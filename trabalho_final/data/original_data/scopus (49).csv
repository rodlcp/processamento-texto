The material has a high delithiation capacity about 965.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle and retains 660 mA h g-1 after 40 cycles at 50 mA g-1. The differential capacity curves of the anode show that there are several reduction peaks between 0.2 and 0.6 V existing all the time during repeated cycles. By comparing 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS NMR), Si (2p) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the anode in the original, fully lithiated, and fully delithiated state, the reduction peaks are related to lithium reversible insertion into SiO2C2, SiO3C, and SiO 4 units, respectively. The corresponding 29Si MAS NMR resonances shift to high field and their binding energies of the Si (2p) XPS peak increase in the fully lithiated state, and then both turn to the opposite direction in the fully delithiated state. The SiO4 units decrease during repeated cycles. The remaining ones can reversibly transform to Li-silicate (Li2SiO3) when lithium is inserted, while the lost ones irreversibly transform to Li-silicate (Li4SiO4). However, the SiOC3 units of the material are totally irreversible with lithium because they nearly disappear in the first discharge process, and lead to the formation SiC4 units. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The scalable plasma spray method enables the direct deposition of large area nanostructured films of V2O5 with controllable particle size and morphology. In this approach, the solution precursors (vanadium oxychloride and ammonium metavanadate) were injected externally into the plasma jet, which atomizes and pyrolyzes the precursors in-flight, resulting in the desired films on the current collectors. The microstructure analysis of the as synthesized films revealed pure nanocrystalline phase for V2O5 with particles in the size range of 20-50 nm. The V2O5 film based electrodes showed stable reversible discharge capacity in the range of 200-250 mAh g-1 when cycled in the voltage window 2-4 V.

The GNS/PANI composites exhibit better electrochemical performances than the pure individual components. A remarkable specific capacitance of 1130 F g-1 (based on GNS/PANI composites) is obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in 1 M H 2SO4 solution compared to 402 F g-1 for pure PANI and 270 F g-1 for GNS. The excellent performance is not only due to the GNS which can provide good electrical conductivity and high specific surface area, but also associate with a good redox activity of ordered PANI nanofibers. Moreover, the GNS/PANI composites present excellent long cycle life with 87% specific capacitance retained after 1000 charge/discharge processes.

Different control strategies of EES have corresponding reliability and economic impacts on the system. In this paper, the reliability and economy of radial distribution system integrated with EES are assessed. The control strategy of utilizing EES as a standby backup energy resource is analyzed. This standby backup control strategy improves system reliability the most but falls short on economy improvement. A novel MPC-based control strategy is presented, which can maximize distribution system economy but could not improve reliability as much as the standby backup control strategy. A hybrid control strategy of balancing the reliability and economy improvement by combining the standby backup control strategy and MPC-based control strategy is presented. The reliability and economic analysis of distribution system integrated with EES using proposed control strategies illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. It also illustrates that even with the same EES integrated into the distribution system, different control strategies have very different reliability and economic impact on the system. In order to accurately assess the impact of the implemented control strategies, sequential Monte Carlo Simulation is used and implemented EES control operations are included in the simulation. © 2011 IEEE.","Distribution system; economy analysis; electric energy storage; Model Predictive Control; reliability analysis","Control operations; Control strategies; Distribution systems; Economic impacts; Economic improvements; Economy analysis; Electric energies; Hybrid control strategies; Radial distribution systems; Rapid development; Sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Storage control; System reliability; Computer simulation; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Energy storage; Integration; Local area networks; Model predictive control; Monte Carlo methods; Predictive control systems; Reliability analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855182194

However due to the intermittent and unpredictable nature of renewable resources, energy storage needs to be used to ensure that the load is met by the supply at all times. There are many possible options for energy storage, of which the most popular and technologically mature option is batteries. Two main technical issues related to integrating batteries with RES are firstly, sizing the batteries optimally so as to minimise operating costs of the overall system and secondly, developing a battery controller to schedule the charging and discharging cycles of the battery in order to ensure uninterrupted supply to the loads within specified voltage and frequency limits. The authors are conducting research on developing a battery management and control system for a RES which would address the above mentioned issues as built-in functionalities.

In Japan, some electric utilities have started to accept only the wind farms which disconnect and give up generating power during light-load periods with less adjustable reserve. Otherwise, wind farms are required to employ battery energy storage systems to charge the generated power during the light-load periods. Instead of these uneconomical solutions, this paper proposes direct control of loads such as electric water heaters (EWHs) for power system balancing. In the paper, the increase of acceptable wind power generation by the proposed load control has been evaluated quantitatively in the power system of the Hokkaido Island in Japan. The result indicates that the acceptable wind power generation increases almost three times higher by implementing the direct control on seven-tenth of EWHs in Hokkaido. However, the control interval of the direct load control is required to be shorter than or almost equal to the inertia constant of the power system. © 2011 IEEE.","Direct load control; electric water heater; frequency regulation; power system balancing; two-way communication; wind power generation","Battery energy storage systems; Demand and supply; Direct control; Direct load control; Electric water heaters; Frequency deviation; Frequency regulations; Hokkaido; Inertia constants; Output power fluctuations; Two way communications; Wind farm; Wind power integrations; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Power transmission; Standby power systems; Water heaters; Wind power; Electric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855178075

However, when there is a large amount of penetration of renewable energy generations into a grid, some problems will arise in the present distribution power network, due to instability of power output and large reverse power flow caused by the renewable energy generation. In researches on recent new electricity supply system, there is a way of thinking of local production for local consumption by the so-called micro-grid and smart-grid which supply the area demand by the area electric power resources, and several demonstrations have been performed also in Japan. From the viewpoint of local production for local and its consumption of electric power energy, a new type of expandable distribution network is proposed to meet regional expansion of the area's electricity demand and supply by the addition of electricity-cluster. The role and operation of battery energy storage system (BESS) in the expandable distribution networks are also discussed.

Many countries have set a goal for high penetration levels of wind power generation. At a high penetration level, an extra fast response reserve capacity is needed to cover the shortfall of generation when a sudden variation of wind takes place. To enable a proper management of the uncertainty, this paper presents an approach to make the wind power a more reliable source by using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. High penetration of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is anticipated in the next years due to the benefits for both environment and end-users. Consequently, combining the wind power generation system with V2G will reduce the intermittency of wind power and will lead to a sustainable development. Therefore, PHEVs can stabilize the output power of the wind farm by providing a kind of storage capacity for electric energy during high wind speed and deliver it in low wind speed. It also requires a scheduling for charging of the PHEV's batteries so it is important to estimate the reasonable number of participating vehicles for the desired applications. The approach of the model has been justified by conducting numerical studies using actual wind histograms of Sotavento wind farm in Spain. © 2011 IEEE.","Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV); V2G aggregator; vehicle-to-grid (V2G); wind power generation","Electric energies; End-users; Fast response; High wind speed; Intermittency; Low wind speed; Numerical studies; Output power; Penetration level; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-ins; Power managements; Reserve capacity; Storage capacity; V2G aggregator; Vehicle to grids; Wind farm; Wind power generation systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy resources; Farms; Wind effects; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855177798

Therefore, the seemingly non-dispatchable wind can be utilized to improve the system frequency performance and reduce the regulation burden on conventional generators. Economically, by allowing wind to participate in regulation markets, the proposed control extracts more value from the variable wind generation and reduces the system frequency regulation costs.

The three parameters that are varied in this analysis include: the wind penetration, which is reflected in the number of Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) installed; the energy rating of the ESS; and the power rating of the ESS. Both continuous and discontinuous diesel operations are considered, where the diesel can be turned-off for a period of time in the discontinuous diesel mode, and not in the continuous diesel mode. A one-year analysis is performed for each ESS size for each wind power penetration level, ranging from 0% to 50% of the maximum load, using an hourly scheduling controller that has been previously developed and has been shown to yield a minimized cost of energy.

It operates as a smart microgrid that optimally utilizes the public right-of-way and roadway infrastructure to provide cost-effective, highly efficient, and reliable wind/solar electric power production, distribution, storage, and utilization.

The term ""energy-plus"" stands for annual energy consumption that is less than production. The generated electric power will be consumed locally by the roadway/traffic signal light; the excess power generated will be stored in batteries, optimally distributed in the microgrid, and supplied to the utility main grid. The deployment of the proposed roadway microgrid will dramatically change the role of the public right-of-way from an energy consumer to an energy producer, leading to energy-plus roadways.

Earlier studies have found that energy storage can compensate for the stochastic nature of intermittent energy sources by absorbing the excessive energy when generation exceeds predicted levels and providing it back to the grid when generation levels fall short. However, earlier economic studies have shown that battery energy storage and flywheel energy storage is not economically competitive comparing to traditional generation units. An optimal control algorithm has been developed to coordinate the slow unit (having respond time greater than 1 minute) and fast energy storage unit (having response time less than 1 minute) to maximize the revenue (or minimize the total cost) of the hybrid energy storage system. The fast energy storage unit, (which can be a flywheel or battery bank) is tuned to pick up the fluctuations of regulation signal while the slow unit, (which can be a traditional generation unit or slow energy storage system) is adjusted less than once per hour to provide regulation service. Simulation models of hydro, combined cycle, and flywheel unit have been developed and implemented in MATLAB. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm. The value of the algorithm has been shown from power plant wear and tear aspect and reducing system balancing reserve aspect. © 2011 IEEE.","coordinated control; fast energy storage unit; Hybrid energy storage system; regulation service; slow unit; wear and tear","Co-ordinated control; fast energy storage unit; Hybrid energy storage; Regulation services; slow unit; wear and tear; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Electric utilities; Flywheels; MATLAB; Renewable energy resources; Wheels; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855172124

This is primarily because the effects of information asymmetries and diverse technical characteristics and preferences in a system with very little storage are no longer second order. We review three possible implementations of electricity markets that account for these effects. These are fully centralized unit commitment, distributed unit commitment and a hybrid unit commitment. The locational marginal prices (LMPs) obtained are quite different than the short run marginal costs of the power plants. A major recommendation is made that these differences and effects be accounted for as policy is designed for managing uncertainties and inter-temporal constraints and for valuing their effects on pricing. In particular, design of IT-enabled rules, rights and responsibilities (3Rs) for managing and valuing the effects of uncertainties is suggested to be essential. Possible 3Rs for supporting interactive integration of wind power and adaptive load management in systems with large wind penetration are used to illustrate proof-of-concept implementation of such systems without reliability problems. We recommend to pursue studies of the 3Rs impact on the performance of real-world electric energy systems. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Adaptive load managements; Electric energy systems; Electricity market; Electricity pricing; Information asymmetry; Large wind penetrations; Locational marginal prices; Managing uncertainty; Proof of concept; Reliability problems; Rights and responsibilities; Second orders; Short run marginal costs; Technical characteristics; Unit commitments; Electric utilities; Wind power; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855172122

Several states in USA have set their own target to meet significant percentage of DG penetration over the years. These requirements will have impacts on grid reliability and operational requirements given inherent intermittency for some of the DG. Energy storage integrated with DG has been proposed as a solution by several researchers to provide greater levels of flexibility and reliability. Energy storage will have impact on electric grid in several other ways including stability. This work addresses the impact of DG with storage on transient stability of the electric grid system. DG based on wind energy and biomass have been modeled based on synchronous and induction generators. Wind based DG has been modeled as both the fixed and variable speed wind energy farms. Battery and ultra-capacitor have been modeled as storage with suitable power electronics interface. MATLAB/ Simulink and PSS/E have been used as a tool for this study. Transient stability of the test systems has been assessed for different types and locations of faults as well as for different penetration levels of the DGs, with and without the energy storage devices. Transient stability have been analyzed in terms of generator rotor speed deviation, rotor angle and terminal voltage of the DGs. Results indicate that the presence of DGs and storage devices enhances the transient stability of the system in most of the cases. This work also identifies the lack of dynamic model for storage in most of the commercial available tools. © 2011 IEEE.","biomass generation; Distributed Generation (DG); energy storage; transient stability; wind power","Biomass generation; Distributed Generation (DG); Distributed generations; Electric grids; Generator rotors; Grid reliability; Intermittency; Operational requirements; Penetration level; Power electronics interface; Rotor angle; Simulink; Terminal voltages; Test systems; Ultracapacitors; Variable speed; Asynchronous generators; Distributed power generation; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Power electronics; Power quality; Stability; Virtual storage; Wind power; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855171518

One of the key assumptions underlying this vision is that it will be possible to manage the trading of electricity between the numerous active parties within the grid. These parties may include or represent such diverse entities as individual users, homes, commercial consumers, micro-grids, virtual power plants (VPPs), energy collectives (ECs), energy suppliers and power generators. The management of these trades needs to take into account the fact that most, if not all, of the actors in the system are self-interested, and cannot be expected to co-operate without incentives. To further complicate matters, there are numerous sources of unpredictability and constraining factors, such as line capacity, availability of renewable and non-renewable resources, inconsistent user behaviour and the inherent real-time dynamism in electricity demand and supply. We develop and evaluate several novel mechanisms for the Smart Grid, in particular an efficient, market-based mechanism and novel trading strategies for the Smart Grid, an agent based approach to studying the impact of the widespread adoption of electricity storage and decentralised control methods for energy suppliers and consumers to manage micro-storage devices. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Agent-based approach; Agent-based modeling; Carbon emissions; Decentralised control; Efficient use of energy; Electricity demands; Electricity supply network; Energy suppliers; Line capacity; Market operation; Market-based mechanisms; Micro grid; Renewable and non-renewable resources; Smart grid; Trading strategies; User behaviour; Virtual power plants; Behavioral research; Commerce; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Virtual storage; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855169235

Power systems have also changed and matured at a rapid pace through deregulation, the integration of renewable energy, the integration of distributed energy production and storage, concerns regarding climate change, and recent discussions concerning the smart grid. Considering the vast amount of change that has occurred in both industries, this work reviews ways in which HPC has been used in the field of power systems over the last 15 years while also identifying some emerging trends and suggesting possible future applications. © 2011 IEEE.","high performance computing; smart grid","Distributed energies; Emerging trends; General-purpose computing; High performance computing; Moore's Law; Multi core; Possible futures; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Climate change; Cluster computing; Computer software selection and evaluation; Electric utilities; Grid computing; Power quality; Power transmission; Systems analysis; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855168358

The microgrid concept, which basically corresponds to the coordinated operation of a cluster of loads, distributed generators and energy storage systems, is quite appealing due to its flexibility, controllability and energy management capabilities. In order to provide uninterruptible power supply to the loads, microgrids are expected to operate in both grid-connected and stand-alone modes, and economically meet the demand on an instantaneous basis. The problem of optimal management of the resources in a microgrid is being widely investigated and recent studies have proposed the application of both centralized and distributed control schemes by using multi-agent systems, heuristic methods and optimization algorithms. This paper elaborates on the conceptual design of a centralized energy management system (EMS) and its desirable attributes for a microgrid in stand-alone mode of operation.

Currently, demand response approaches are predominantly based on one-way signalling from the utility to the end-customer's devices and installations. However, this approach leads to a suboptimal solution as it does not unlock the full flexibility potential of these devices. On top of that, it leads to market inefficiencies and uncertainty in the price response of end-customer's demand and supply units when applied on a mass scale. These drawbacks are not present when the responsive end-customer's systems are fully integrated in the electricity markets. In this paper, we describe a smart grid technology that integrates demand and supply flexibility in the operation of the electricity system, rather than just letting it respond. Over the last few years, this technology has been researched and developed into a market-ready system, and has been deployed in a number of successful field trials. Using this approach, the pool reaction to a certain price signal is known beforehand. With that, demand response moves from influencing, with an uncertain overall response, into control with the dynamic price as a control signal. © 2011 IEEE.","demand response; Dynamic pricing; market-based control; smart grids","Control mechanism; Control signal; Demand and supply; Demand response; Dynamic price; Dynamic pricing; Electricity grids; Electricity market; Electricity system; Field trial; Fully integrated; Market-based control; Mass scale; Price response; Price signals; Smart grid; Suboptimal solution; Vehicle to grids; Commerce; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electricity; Sales; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855168221

However, their limited driving range and the long time required to charge the battery bank remains a drawback. One solution to improve the driving range of an EV is to integrate a fuel cell (FC) with the battery. Like EVs, fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs) produce no pollutants during operation. However, production of the hydrogen for the fuel cells and the charging current for the batteries requires large amounts of electric energy. Since the vast majority of the energy produced by electric utilities in the US comes from fossil fuels (mostly coal), traditional production of the electricity to fuel FCHVs will still result in high levels of pollution. This pollution could be avoided entirely if the energy to fuel the FCHV was produced from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of FCHV transportation using hydrogen that is produced primarily by solar energy. The first task on this part of the overall project was to implement a fuel cell (FC) on a Kronosport electric vehicle to convert it to a FCHV. The second part of this paper demonstrates the generation of hydrogen using solar energy from a photovoltaic array. The electrolyzer will supply hydrogen that will be transferred to a storage tank on the FCHV via a dispenser (fueling station). © 2011 IEEE.","electric vehicle; electric vehicle hybridization; electrolyzer; fuel cell hybrid vehicle; hydrogen economy; hydrogen generation; photovoltaic array; proton exchange membrane fuel cell","Electrolyzers; fuel cell hybrid vehicle; hydrogen economy; hydrogen generation; Photovoltaic arrays; Proton exchange membranes; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Coal combustion; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Electrolytic cells; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Ground vehicles; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Internal combustion engines; Land vehicle propulsion; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pollution; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar energy; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855167166

The Community Solutions Initiative is a virtual community of professionals from a wide variety of backgrounds who are providing largely pro-bono efforts to design, develop, deliver and promote sustainable energy solutions for developing communities. The CSI Community Charging Station (CCS) is designed to charge batteries that are transported to and from their customers' home or business sites. The CCS can be based upon some combination of solar, wind, biogas, biodiesel and / or human powered generation. In the short time since CSI was formed in April 2010 several instances of the CCS have been developed. The CSI LightCycle is a 60 watt pedal powered generator. Two and half hours of daily pedaling can provide four hours of reading quality light for 100 homes. Home owners can buy a locally made LED reading lamp for $1 and have their batteries charged for around $1 per month. The goal is to make the choice for electric light so affordable that home owners will not have to think twice about converting from expensive, unsafe and unhealthy cancerous kerosene. The CSI Solar Trailer is a 1.4 kW charging station with six 235 watt PV solar panels and four large 245 Amp Hour local storage batteries. The Solar Trailer has 20 parallel controllers for charging portable 12 volt home batteries. The Solar Trailer is sized to support 40 homes each with 100 watt hours of daily consumption. With IEEE funding, three pilot systems are being built for installation in Haiti. The open source 10' diameter wind turbine built by the CSI IEEE PES and EWB-USA Seattle Team provides 700 watts in 22 mph wind and costs less than $500 excluding the tower. An effort to build low cost bamboo wind turbine towers is underway. The CCS can be used to charge a range of batteries sizes and types. Open source designs are provided so that local businesses / entrepreneurs can assemble simple but highly effective LED based flashlights, desk/task lamps and ambient / room lamps for a few dollars; excluding battery costs. The CSI products are all based on an open Sustainable Energy Reference Architecture (SERA) so that there is compatibility in all interfaces and maximum commonality of components. The CSI family of products conforms to the criteria defined by Paul Polak; they are extremely affordable and highly miniaturized but infinitely scalable. It now appears that it is a reasonable goal to ensure that the entire world can have access to safe, reliable electric light by the year 2020. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Battery cost; Charge batteries; Charging station; Developing communities; Electric lights; Energy solutions; Home owners; Local business; Low costs; Open sources; Parallel controller; Pilot system; Seattle; Solar panels; Storage battery; Sustainable energy; Virtual community; Wind turbine towers; Biogas; Developing countries; Electric lighting; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Light emitting diodes; Virtual reality; Wind turbines; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855164176

The capability to store energy for a later use can help to improve the flexibility of power system operation by providing control of power as and when required. With a strong push towards increasing the reliance on renewable energy resources, a flexible power system is desired; one that can accommodate increased variability and uncertainty of generating resources. Energy storage is one strategy for enhancing the flexibility of power system operation. The application for energy storage can be broadly classified into energy applications (bulk transfer of energy from one time to another) and power applications (fast injection/absorption of power). There is also a broad spectrum between energy and power applications. The selection of a storage system as a means of adding flexibility to the grid depends upon a number of factors: cost being an important one.

In such a system, it could be both economical and environmentally friendly to harness wind power and displace the consumption of fossil fuels. In the study, energy storage and DR are used to contain frequency deviations and reduce diesel generators' movement, while maximizing the use of wind energy. Detailed dynamic models of DERs and household loads are built to simulate the microgrid. Combinations of centralized (direct control) and decentralized (autonomous response) control strategies on DERs are implemented. The control capabilities of each type of DERs are also explored under different scenarios. The system responses under high wind speeds and to large disturbances are tested.

Beyond DG, other resources such as storage systems and demand response must be managed in order to obtain more efficient and ""green"" operation of PS. More players, such as aggregators or Virtual Power Players (VPP), that operate these kinds of resources will be appearing. This paper proposes a new methodology to solve the distribution network short term scheduling problem in the Smart Grid context. This methodology is based on a Genetic Algorithms (GA) approach for energy resource scheduling optimization and on PSCAD software to obtain realistic results for power system simulation. The paper includes a case study with 99 distributed generators, 208 loads and 27 storage units.

The high storage capacity permits a reduced volume of TES material compared to sensible heat systems and the quasi constant temperature during phase transition is really substantial for thermodynamic regulation in industrial processes. However, PCMs systems are generally limited by supercooling, segregation, corrosion and low thermal conductivity. The last drawback leads to low and decreasing power systems. One solution developed by CRISTOPIA ENERGY SYSTEMS is to encapsulate the PCM in spherical high density polyolefin capsules in order to develop the exchange surface with the heat transfer fluid. Another option is to associate a highly conductive component into the PCM, like graphite in order to increase its effective thermal conductivity.

In order to avoid coherent beam instabilities, the reduction of the overall ring impedance is of great importance. The extraction kicker system is one of the main contributors to the overall ring impedance. This paper focuses on the contribution of the external electrical network to the kicker impedance. Previous calculations as well as measurements of the kicker impedance have already been carried out for the SIS18 and ESR kickers and these showed a significant contribution to the impedance influencing the beam [1]. The SIS100 extraction and emergency kicker magnet system will be equipped with a bipolar pulse power generator. Thereby, the beam can be deflected in two directions by the same kicker magnets. Depending on the desired deflection direction, the current fed into the magnet has a positive or negative polarity. A Pulse Forming Network (PFN) will be used as energy storage. To provide the different polarities of the current the PFN is connected to a transformer. This transformer is also needed to isolate the PFN and the kicker magnets galvanically from each other. Since this setup is new in several ways it is important to determine its contribution to the coupling impedance of the kicker system.

Operation centres on an 800 MeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS), which provides 3×1013 protons per pulse (ppp) at 50 Hz, corresponding to a beam power of 0.2 MW. In common with many lower energy, high intensity proton rings, a key loss mechanism on ISIS is half integer resonance under space charge. This paper summarises experimental and simulation work studying half integer resonance in a ""2D"" coasting beam in the ISIS ring: understanding this is an essential prerequisite for explaining the more complicated case of RCS operation. For coasting beam experiments, the ring is reconfigured to storage ring mode with RF off and main magnets powered on DC current only. A 70 MeV beam is injected, painted appropriately, and manipulated so as to approach resonance. Understanding how the resonant condition develops is central to explaining observations, so realistic simulations of resonance, including injection, ramping of intensity and tunes are being developed. Results from the ORBIT code are presented and compared with experimental and theoretical results. Finally, future plans are summarised.

We studied the use of two 500MHz SC cavities providing the necessary resonator voltage of up to 14MV and replacing the normal conducting cavities of PETRA type. A large cavity coupling factor is required, so that, using the existing 260kW klystron, an internal beam of 50mA can be accelerated up to 5GeV. In addition, a fast detuning of the resonance frequency of the cavities must be implemented during beam injection and the energy ramp of 4 GeV/s. An appropriate 500MHz structure is given by a five-cell cavity constructed for the JAERI FEL LINAC. Based on this geometry, HOM have been calculated from a numerical simulation. Since all monopole and a large number of dipole HOM are well above the multi-bunch instabilities threshold, further studies about the damping of beam instabilities are essential.

The SCW consists of a superconducting main pole and two normal-conducting side poles. The main pole of the SCW is cooled by a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler. The beam lifetime has been investigated and information was obtained regarding the contributions of various processes to the total lifetime. Laser Compton gamma-rays were generated by a CO2 laser. They were used for measuring the machine parameters of the storage ring such as the beam energy and the momentum compaction factor. To permit full control of the undulator parameters during user time, a feed-forward correction system was developed that minimizes the effects of the undulators on the emittance coupling.

Because undulator radiation comes in a line spectrum, photons up to the 7th harmonic are desired. This requires to correct the undulator for errors in period length and magnetic field strength. The photon brightness (or photon flux density) in such harmonics is strongly dependent on perfect periodicity of the magnetic field. Small changes in field strength and phase from period to period can cause destructive interference which reduces the photon intensity dramatically, especially at higher harmonics. Such imperfections also appear in conventional permanent material undulators, which can be corrected by well developed and efficient shimming. Unfortunately, this method cannot be applied to superconducting undulators. Therefore, we present a new approach to field corrections by modification of the magnetic field saturation in each pole. By this correction, not only the magnetic field error but also greatly improves phase (period length) errors from period to period. The proposed method works quite local with only small perturbations in neighbouring poles. The tunability is preserved for most of the field excitations and is reduced only at extreme parameters.

The final goal is, to fill BESSY II with short bunches of 1.5 ps length (rms) and long bunches of 15 ps length simultaneously in the presently applied user optics. All insertion devices are operated as usual, i.e. the helical undulators and 7 T-field insertions. Long bunches of 1.5 mA current per bunch, twice the value of the present user optics, are filled in each second bucket. The other buckets can be filled with short bunches of up to 0.8 mA. The lower current value is required to avoid increase in the bunch length and bunch energy spread, predicted by scaling laws. The total current is e.g. limited by the HOM damping capabilities of the sccavities and the machine impedances. This scheme is achievable with recent developments in sc-rf cavity technology driven by requirements of high current cw applications like for the energy recovering linacs (ERLs). These developments seem to make it feasible to install high gradientHOMdamped multi-cell cavities in electron storage rings. With an appropriate choice of the cavity resonance frequencies a beating of the effective longitudinal focusing voltage at the stable fixed points can be introduced and leads to different zero current bunch lengths. Basic parameters of this scheme are presented.

A significant part of this program has been the installation of diagnostic devices to measure and quantify the electron cloud effect, a potential limiting factor in these machines. In particular, several Retarding Field Analyzers (RFAs) have been installed in CESR. These devices provide information on the local electron cloud density and energy distribution, and have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different cloud mitigation techniques. This paper will provide an overview of RFA results obtained at CESRTA over the past year, including measurements taken as function of bunch spacing and wiggler magnetic field. Understanding these results provides a great deal of insight into the behavior of the electron cloud.

During deceleration of the beam the revolution frequency decreases, resulting in low current, which is difficult to measure with a common DC transformer. However the number of particles in a bunch can also be determined by measuring the voltage signal in the time domain using a capacitive pick-up. If the ratio of bunch length and RF period does not change during deceleration or acceleration, measuring the pick up signal spectrum is a more sensitive method, where the signal is directly proportional to the number of particles in a bunch. A summery of these different methods to determine the number of particles is presented.

At SOLEIL (2.75 GeV),six conventional in-vacuum hybrid undulators, operating at high radiation harmonics, and also one small gap multipole wiggler producing high magnetic fields were designed and built for hard X-ray beamlines. The construction has been progressively improved by choosing new magnetic materials of higher magnetization, developing additional correction techniques and bringing mechanical changes.

The LHeC will utilise the existing LHC storage ring with the addition of a 60 GeV electron accelerator. The electron beam will be stored and accelerated in either a storage ring in the LHC tunnel (Ring-Ring) or a linac tangent to the LHC tunnel (Linac- Ring). Synchrotron Radiation (SR) in the Interaction Region (IR) of this machine requires an iterative design process in which luminosity is optimised while the SR is minimised. This process also requires attention to be given to the detector as the beam pipe must be designed such that disturbing effects, such as out-gassing and background scattering, are minimised while the tracker remains close to the IP thus maximising the acceptance of the experiment. The machinery of GEANT4 has been used to simulate the SR load in the IR and also to design absorbers/masks to shield SR from backscattering into the detector or propagating with the electron beam. The outcome of these simulations, as well as cross checks, are described in the accompanying paper which characterises the current status of the IR design for both the Ring-Ring and Linac-Ring options of the LHeC in terms of SR.

In order to produce synchrotron radiation of short wavelengths (~ 1 nm) in such undulator a 1.5 GeV electron beam is necessary. Instead of expensive high energetic electron beam a beam of a moderate energy (≤300 MeV) in RF undulator with period ranging from several millimeters to sub-millimeters is appealing. Additionally the RF undulator can provide fast dynamic control of polarization, wavelength, undulator K parameter, can have wide aperture (~ 1 cm), and to bring other attractive features [1-3]. In order to become a competitive alternative to the traditional undulator, the RF undulator must, of course, have as high strength of wiggling fields as magnetic fields in existing permanent magnets (B ~ 1 T). In particular, the K parameter should be about unity in RF undulator of the 10 mm period. Because powers of modern millimeter and sub-millimeter RF sources like a magnicon or a relativistic gyroklystron are limited by several tens of megawatts, necessary undulator fields can be obtained in so-called storage cavities only. Design of such cavities should take into account many constraints like: emittance growth in presence of powerful RF fields, Ohmic wall losses, breakdown, and surface pulse heating.

To increase the repetition rate, the electron beam is stored in a 50 MeV ring. The main drawback of such a scheme is the low energy of the electrons regarding collective effects and intrabeam scattering. These effects tend to spread or even disrupt the stored bunch and they limit its charge, especially in low energy rings machine where damping plays a negligible role. Thus such collective effects reduce the maximum Xray flux and it is important to investigate them to predict the performance of this type of X-ray source. In addition, Compton back scattering acts on the electron beam by increasing its energy spread. This presentation will show firstly the impact of collective effects on the electron beam, essentially during the first few thousand turns when they are the most harmful. Then, the reduction of the Xray flux due to Compton back scattering and intrabeam scattering will be investigated on a longer time scale.

In this scenario, muons produced by the decay of pions coming from the interaction of a proton beam onto a target are accelerated to energies of several GeV and injected in a storage ring where they will decay in neutrinos. The so-called front-end section of the neutrino factory is conceived to reduce the transverse divergence of the muon beam and to adapt its temporal structure to the acceptance of the downstream accelerator to minimize losses.

One of the main parts of the facility is the middle energy storage ring (40-225 MeV). The storage ring has comprehensive lattice to provide low emittance, low beam size in the interaction point and big value of the energy acceptance. One of the NESTOR storage ring lattice feature is use of bending magnets of 0.5 m radius with combined focusing function. It leads to increasing of 3D magnetic field effects on electron beam dynamics. After NESTOR magnetic element manufacturing characteristics of element magnetic fields were measured and the effect of the real magnetic field distribution on beam dynamics was calculated. As a result, to provide project X-ray source characteristics the parameters of NESTOR storage ring lattice should be modified. The second reason for the lattice modification was the desire to increase the interaction point straight section length. The results of the beam dynamics simulation after lattice modification and optimization show that the storage ring will provide all project electron beam parameters. The results of the electron beam simulations are presented in the paper.

In this case of 'asymmetric cooling', the stationary energy spread is much smaller than under conditions of regular scattering where the laser spot size is larger than the electron beam; and the synchrotron oscillations are damped faster. Coherent oscillations of large amplitude may be damped within one synchrotron period, so that this method can support the rapid successive injection of many bunches in longitudinal phase space for stacking purposes.

To know the contribution of neutrinos to the SM, needs precise measurements of the parameters governing the neutrino oscillations. This will require a high intensity beam-based neutrino oscillation facility. The EUROν Design Study will review three currently accepted methods of realizing this facility (the so-called Super-Beams, Beta Beams and Neutrino Factories) and perform a cost assessment that, coupled with the physics performance, will give means to the European research authorities to make a decision on the lay-out and construction of the future European neutrino oscillation facility. ""Beta Beams"" produce collimated pure electron neutrino and antineutrino beams by accelerating beta active ions to high energies and letting them decay in a race-track shaped storage ring. EUROν Beta Beams are based on CERNs infrastructure and the fact that some of the already existing accelerators can be used. To use existing machines is a strong advantage for the cost evaluation, however this choice is also constraining the Beta Beams. In this article we describe recent work that has made the Beta Beam facility a solid option for neutrino production: new ideas and developments to produce and collect different Beta Beam isotopes, the 60 GHz pulsed ECR source development, the integration of Beta Beams in the upgrade program for LHC, work to ensure the very high intensity ion beam stability in the different machines, and optimizations of the decay ring to get high neutrino flux at a gamma boost of 100.

Such a low emittance lattice requires very strong sextupoles for chromaticity correction, which in turn introduce strong non-linear field effects that limit the beam dynamic aperture. In order to maximize the dynamic aperture we choose the cell phases to cancel the third and fourth order geometric resonances in each 8-cell arc. Four families of chromatic sextupoles and six families of geometric (or harmonic) sextupoles are added to correct the chromatic and amplitude-dependent tunes. To find the best settings of the ten sextupole families, we use a Multi-Objective Genetic Optimizer employing elegant[3] to optimize the beam lifetime and dynamic aperture simultaneously. Then we evaluate dynamic aperture reduction caused by magnetic field multipole errors, magnet fabrication errors and misalignments. A sufficient dynamic aperture is obtained for injection, as well as workable beam lifetime[2].

An important and challenging feature of the new facility is the combination of phase space cooled beams with internal targets. In the modularized start version of FAIR the accumulator ring RESR is part of an upgrade program and only the collector ring CR is available from the beginning for antiproton beam cooling. Antiproton accumulation will then be accomplished in the HESR by utilizing the already designed stochastic cooling system with moving barrier buckets.

We employed a 10 W CO2 laser with a wavelength of 10.6 μm to produce gammarays with energies of the order of a few MeV during user time for synchrotron radiation experiments. LCS gammarays with a maximum energy of 3.5 MeV were generated by head-on collisions between the laser photons and the 1.4 GeV stored beam. Since the energy acceptance of the storage ring is well in excess of the maximum gamma-ray energy, the LCS experiment can be performed without reducing the beam lifetime. We used dosimetry to measure the LCS gamma-ray flux and measured gamma-ray fluxes of the order of 106 photons/s. The maximum gamma-ray flux at the detector was evaluated to be 6×106 photons/s with a beam current of 300 mA and a laser power of 10 W, which corresponds to an LCS event rate of 3×107 s-1 in the interaction region. We confirmed that the present setup can be used to generate gamma-rays with fluxes of the order of 106 photons/s without affecting the light source performance of the storage ring.

With an energy of 2.4 GeV, it provides high brightness photon beams for research in materials science, biology and chemistry. The SLS storage ring contains 36 room temperature bending magnets, all of which produce light for experimental use; at the design energy of 2.4 GeV, they have a maximum magnetic field of 1.4 Tesla. Light is produced along the entire bending arc but can only be transferred to the external experimental facilities from selected short portions of the beam path. In cooperation with the Budker Institute for Nuclear Physics (BINP) in Novosibirsk, Russia, three of these magnets were replaced with new room temperature magnets with short regions of high magnetic field up to 2.9 Tesla. This enabled the production of intense light beams at shorter wavelengths than from the existing magnets.

The thermal conduit rapidly transports energy to unreacted fuel regions, and the reaction wave induces a concomitant thermopower wave of high power density, producing electrical current in the same direction. At up to 7 W/g, this can be substantially larger than the power density offered by current micro-scale power sources (e.g. fuel cells, batteries) and even about seven times greater than that of commercial Li-ion batteries. MEMS devices and wireless sensor networks would benefit from such high power density sources to enable functions such as communications and acceleration hampered by present power sources. Recently, we have covalently attached energetic molecules of mono-, di-, and trinitrobenzenes to single-walled carbon nanotubes via diazonium chemistry. Although covalent functionalization introduces defects that can scatter electrons and phonons, thermopower waves can still rapidly propagate and produce electricity on these decorated nanotubes. Differential scanning calorimetry confirms that the energetic molecules release heat, but thermopower waves require additional fuel adsorbed on the nanotubes to propagate.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863181635

Rather than focus on CO 2 capture directly from flue gas, our work seeks to evaluate membranes as a means to regenerate CO 2 from absorption solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA). A membrane evaluation system was designed and built to study the permeability and selectivity of various membrane materials for the recovery of CO2 from MEA solutions. The feed consisted of an aqueous MEA solution (15% wt) saturated with CO2 and continuously circulated through a membrane module. On the permeate side of the membrane a sweep gas was used to maintain a low CO 2 partial pressure. The permeate gas composition was measured by gas chromatography (GC) and a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector. The performance of several porous and nonporous membrane materials, including polyester (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), was measured and compared.

Current lithium-ion batteries, although an attractive energy storage device, have limited charge capacity that diminishes rapidly at high charge/discharge rates. We have shown previously that a Si-graphene composite integrated into a 3-dimensional, conducting graphitic network offers high structural and cycling stability and substantially higher charge capacity as an anode material than graphite. However, the composite suffers from the problem of diminishing charge capacity during high current operations. Here, we report a facile microscopic engineering strategy to enhance the Li ion transport in graphene sheets, which could be utilized as a platform to create high-power battery materials. When used with Si nanoparticles to form a Si-graphene composite and integrating the composite into a 3-dimensional graphitic network to form a self-supporting electrode paper, the electrode exhibits an outstanding energy density-power density combination, without compromising the usable lifetime and mechanical flexibility. The power capability was found to be comparable to supercapacitors but with a much higher energy density. For example, a charge capacity of over 1000 mAh/g was achieved at a discharge rate of 8 A/g. Structural characterization by high resolution electron microscopy and impedance measurements provided evidence that relates the structural properties to the Li ion diffusivity for this material, which can bridge the performance disparity between batteries with high energy density and capacitors with high power density.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863155167

Domestically available biomass has been proposed as part of the solution to our dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuels, especially liquid transportation fuels produced from cellulosic materials, have the benefits of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and leading to new jobs and greater economic vitality in rural areas. Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, establishes a target of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel annual production by 2022, although the United States produced less than 1 billion gallons of liquid fuels from cellulosic materials in 2010. In observance of this mandatory production target, many new cellulosic biomass-to-biofuels supply chains will be designed and developed in the coming decade for better economic, environmental and social performances. However, uncertainty resulting from supply and demand variations may have significant impact on the biofuel supply chain. Therefore, an efficient optimization strategy is urgently needed to for the design and operations of sustainable and robust cellulosic biofuel supply chains. In this work, we address the optimal design and planning of cellulosic biofuel supply chains under supply and demand uncertainty. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (SMILP) model combined with Monte Carlo sampling and the associated statistical analysis is proposed to deal with different types of uncertainty, and it is incorporated into a multi-period planning model that takes into account the main characteristics of the biofuel supply chains, such as seasonality of feedstock supply, biomass deterioration with time, geographical diversity and availability of biomass resources, feedstock density, diverse conversion technologies and byproducts, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, regional economic structure, and government incentives. In the two-stage framework, the supply chain network design and capacity planning decisions are made ""here-and-now"" prior to the resolution of uncertainty, while the production, transportation and storage decisions for each time period are postponed in a ""wait-and-see"" mode. The SMILP model integrates decision making across multiple temporal and spatial scales and simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production operations, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. In order to solve the resulting large scale SMILP problems effectively, a decomposition algorithm based on sampling average approximation and multi-cut L-shaped method is proposed by taking advantage of the problem structure. In addition to the economic objective of minimizing the annualized net present cost, the SMILP model is also extended to integrate with life cycle assessment (LCA) and regional economic input-output (EIO) analysis through a multiobjective optimization scheme to include two other objectives: the environmental objective measured by life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and the social objective measured by the number of accrued local jobs resulting from the construction and operation of the cellulosic biofuel supply chain. The multiobjective optimization framework allows the model to establish tradeoffs among the economic, environmental, and social performances of the cellulosic biofuel supply chains in a systematic way. The multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an ?-constraint method and produces Pareto-optimal curves that reveal how the optimal annualized cost and the supply chain network structure change with different environmental and social performance of the entire supply chain. The proposed optimization model and solution method is illustrated through county-level case study for the state of Illinois. Three major types of biomass, including crop residues, energy crops, and wood residues, and three major conversion pathways, including biochemical conversion, gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and fast pyrolysis followed by hydroprocessing are considered. Uncertainty information is generated from the time series analysis based on the historical data of biomass feedstock supply and liquid fuel demand.

However, the intermittent, varied nature of the renewable resources makes it difficult to integrate these valuable energies into the electrical grids. A solution to this problem is to employ large-scale electrical energy storage (EES), which is widely considered as an effective approach to improve the reliability, power quality, and economy of these renewable energies. Among the most promising large-scale EES technologies are the redox flow batteries (RFBs). RFBs are special electrochemical systems that can repeatedly convert and store multi-megawatt-hours (MWhs) of electricity energy to chemical energy and convert the chemical energy back to electricity energy when needed. The advantages of RFBs include short response time, low self discharge, long life-time, and independent tunable power and storage capacity, which make it possible to independently scale up the electricity storage capacity and power generation capacity. With the support of US Department of Energy's Office of Electricity, PNNL has carried out extensive efforts in the development of advanced redox flow batteries. Substantial progress has been achieved in the past two years, including two new redox chemistries (V-Fe system and all vanadium mixed acid system), which will be reported in this presentation.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863149927

It is well recognized that in order to implement these applications, TiO 2 should own a large surface area, a high crystallinity and high thermal stability simultaneously. Our group has developed a template-free method to fabricate mesoporous Titania (m-TiO 2) nanofibers with all these properties. Trace TiO 2-B was proved by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectra. However, its contribution in terms of performance was not perfectly specified. In this work, we report on lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation reaction in two differrent m-TiO 2 with or without trace TiO 2-B and find significant intercalation increasement of m-TiO 2 with trace TiO 2-B on surface. TiO 2-B is a metastable monoclinic polymorph of TiO 2 different from anatase. Its open structure, characterized as large and continuous channels, makes it well suited as a host for Li+ ion intercalation. It can be seen that the cyclic voltammetry of m-TiO 2 exhibits a pair of cathodic/anodic peaks at 1.70 and 2.05V, which are attributed to lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation reaction in anatase phase. In addition to that, the voltammogram of m-TiO 2 with trace TiO 2-B shows another two pairs of peaks with formal potentials in the range of 1.5-1.6 V vs. Li +/Li, respectively. This notation can be assigned to the reaction of lithium-ion intercalation/ deintercalation reaction in TiO 2-B phase lattice. The first discharge capacity of m-TiO 2 with trace TiO 2-B can reach up to 247 mA·h·g-1 at the current rate of 130 mA·g-1 which is about 50 mA·h·g-1 higher than that of m-TiO 2 without TiO 2-B. Stable cycling discharge capacity attains 170 mA·h·g-1 at the discharge rate of 155 mA·g -1 and 110 mA·h·g -1 even up to 4000 mA·g -1. These findings indicate that m-TiO 2 with trace TiO 2-B on surface represents a promising material in lithium ion delivery and storage.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863147660

The transport and storage, however, require more energy and rather complex infrastructure than fossil fuels. Hydrogen may be stored as liquid, compressed gas, or hydrides. Liquid hydrogen has relatively small density of 50-70 kg/m3, i.e., the volume of hydrogen shrinks less than other gas when it is transformed to a liquid. Moreover, it has low boiling point, and its spin conversion during liquefaction consumes a significant amount of energy. 20-30% of its energy content is required for transport and storage of hydrogen in the liquid state, while compression of hydrogen gas requires 15%. Although such features of hydrogen makes it more complicated to be liquefied, compression of hydrogen gas to 350~700 bar also has technological barriers to be realized. Compression and high pressure storage require larger facilities and heavier storage vessels. It also involves safety concerns, and the compression technology has not yet been matured enough. In this regard, the most economic state of hydrogen for transport and storage is likely to be liquid although the decision may vary according to technological developments. A precooled Claude cycle and a He refrigerated cycle are investigated to develop a pilot scale hydrogen liquefaction system.

In the NSR technology, alkali or alkaline earth elements (K or Ba) take up NO x under lean operation and store them as nitrates, which are subsequently reduced during rich operation.

To potentially reduce costs associated with algal biofuels production and/or improve the quality of intermediate steps through improved efficiencies downstream, Phycal is developing strains that can transport and store significantly more iron than wild-type strains. The potential reward is that they can out-compete contaminating species (e.g., algae, bacteria, protozoa, and etc.) for the available iron. Once stored, the iron is in the form of magnetite inside ferritin complexes that are paramagnetic.

Controlled anodic electrodeposition of ultrathin (< 10 nm) catalyst films and electrokinetic studies at intermediate pH regimes have given rise to unique mechanistic insights, including a 30 mV/decade Tafel slope and an inverse third order dependence on proton activity.

Accordingly, the development of novel sorbent materials and new technologies for CO 2 capture and storage is highly sought. The traditional method for CO 2 capture is chemical absorption by aqueous amine solutions. The key advantages associated with this liquid-based method are high reactivity, low cost, and good absorption capacity. However, the use of amines and water has some serious inherent drawbacks, including the loss of solvent, corrosion, and high energy demand for regeneration. A potential alternative method is the capture of CO 2 by ionic liquids, which have many unique properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, a broad range of liquid temperatures, high thermal stability, good CO 2 solubility, and tunable physicochemical characteristics.

Cation-exchange in zeolites has been shown to result in more H 2 specific binding sites and higher adsorption capacity. Determining the relationship between the H 2-cation interaction and the type of cation is critical to designing new types of H 2 storage materials, including MOFs and porous carbons. The interaction of H 2 with cation-exchanged zeolites can provide critical information on the relative binding strengths to the zeolite host, as well as how the host framework changes as a function of the quantity of gas adsorbed. We present a multifaceted approach to the study of H 2 adsorption in both copper- and silver-exchanged SSZ-13 and for comparison the host framework SSZ-13. Powder neutron diffraction was employed to locate each of the site specific binding sites for H 2 from in situ adsorption allowing for the accurate determination of the location of the adsorbed gas relative to the zeolite framework. Possible cation-migration as a function of adsorbed H 2 is considered relative to that of gas adsorbed in cation-exchanged zeolites X and Y (FAU).

Simulation of Li-ion batteries, resolving statistical variation in the agglomerates that comprise active materials, is the stepping-stone toward this goal. Modeling of Li-ion batteries is a challenging problem due to the presence of two special characteristics of the electrochemical system: multiphysics processes and disparate length and time scales. The length scales in Li-ion batteries can range from particles at the micrometer length scale to the whole cell at the millimeter scale. The time scale in batteries spans from seconds to hours, electrochemical reactions occur in seconds, Li-ion diffusion occurs in minutes, and full cell cycling can take hours, depending on the charge/discharge rate. In these multiple scales, battery systems require multiphysics solutions involving transport of ions and electrons, electrochemical reactions at the solid-electrolyte interface, heat transfer, and intercalation induced stress generation. For these physicochemical processes, the corresponding governing equations are coupled with nonlinear electrochemical kinetics. Multiphysics/multiscale modeling of such a complex system is difficult and numerically expensive, however, once perfected, will allow both understanding of the physicochemical processes of battery electrochemistries and the optimization of battery performance.

One class of potential cathode materials that promises high-performance is metal oxyfluorides. These materials follow the conversion mechanism for lithium storage that has been discovered with metal oxides and metal fluorides; these materials can accommodate a charge capacity 2-3 times that of traditional cathode materials via an intercalation mechanism. We will report a low-temperature hydrothermal process for synthesizing FeOF nanostructures. First, FeOOH nanostructures will be made by electrodeposition (Fe 2+ + 3OH - → FeOOH + H 2O + e -).

We employed silica capped silver nanoparticles as our test particle which clearly demonstrated size dependent melting properties as observed in temperature dependent transmission electron microscopy.

In one process the biomass is pyrolyzed and then steam reformed to yield hydrogen. Biomass is dried and then converted to oil by very quick exposure to heated particles in a fluidized bed. The char and gases produced are combusted to supply heat to the reactor. The product oils are cooled and condensed. Bio-oil is then shipped by truck from the plant location(s) to the hydrogen production facility. By shipping the bio-oil which has a higher energy density rather than the biomass transportation costs are reduced. On arrival the bio-oil is fractionated using water extraction into carbohydrate fraction and lignin fractions. The carbohydrate fraction is steam reformed and the hydrogen that is formed is separated using PSA, pressure swing adsorption.

While all the structure of the disc is transparent and homogeneous the parasitic signal will be caused mostly by photoluminescence (PL) and absorption of pits areas where laser light is unfocused. At large number of layers (10 or more) the noise level will get significant value, so it was suggested to derive readout signal as a variable one. Also it was proposed to record information only by the lands, to decrease the absorbance level and thus uncontrolled changing of the noise level. Furthermore in the FMD information layer there are inner and outside peripheral areas which hold a stable level of parasitic signal during readout from the edges of the disc. While the PL readout signal is spatially isotropic the optical head of the FMD drive receives just a part of the probing beam energy. PL quantum yield, absorption factor, receiver systems exposure loss coefficients are other reasons of the low PL signal. Thus the problem of the low SNR in this case is a major one and the only way of its solving is synthesis of the dye with a high PL quantum yield. The PL relaxation time on the other hand is a main feature of the data reading rate and therefore selection of the appropriate recording material will allow to bring this parameter in accordance to parameters of modern optical discs. To achieve this goal the composite organic pyrazoline dyes where synthesized and investigated as effective medium with a PL quantum yield up to 60-70%, relaxation time less than 100 ns, PL wide spectrum and opportunity of two-photon absorption.

The most common type of the BLEVE is caused when the external wall of the tank is exposed to a fire 1. The continuous heat transfer from the fire to the tank wall increases the temperature and pressure inside the tank, until the tank fails. This sudden failure of the tank results in an explosive vaporization of its contents. In passenger cars the LH 2 is stored as a cryogenic liquid at -240 °C and at moderate pressures (20 to 30 bars) 2. It is believed that the LH 2 will not BLEVE, since it is stored at such a low temperature3. However, LNG, which is also stored as a cryogenic liquid presents a potential for BLEVE 4. Consequently, in this study we have theoretically investigated if the LH 2 storage tanks will BLEVE. A theoretical model considering transient mass and energy transfer is developed and solved numerically5. It is assumed that the LH 2 tank is engulfed in a fire and the fire is caused due to spilled gasoline or hydrogen. Different tank materials and insulations are tested. The transient model has a capability to predict the time required for the LH 2 tank to BLEVE. This prediction will be useful for the fire fighters and emergency responders when dealing with LH2 tank engulfed in a fire.

The main carbon rich components of algal biomass include protein, carbohydrates, and lipids. The balance of these components within a specific algal species is a affected by the environment in which it is cultivated. Proteins in algae can provide energy storage, structural support, and maintain internal function. Carbohydrates, such as starch, provide energy storage and cell structure. Lipids are involved in structure of the algae cells, energy storage, and are used as signaling molecules. High lipid content in algae used for fuel processing is attractive due to the high yields per acre compared to terrestrial crops. Triacylglycerides (lipids) can be converted to free fatty acids via hydrolysis in subcritical water. Subcritical water is attractive due to the elimination of organic solvents and catalysts, which can be difficult to remove and expensive. This eliminates energy intensive drying steps prior to hydrolysis, allowing for algae, as received, to be processed. High temperature can denature and char protein components. These proteins are a valuable byproduct of algae useful as a livestock feed or food supplement. The effects of polysaccharides and other constituents at subcritical conditions are also of interest to determine the behavior of algal species during hydrolysis. The focus of this research is evaluating the effects of pre-processing algal samples for hydrolysis of triacylglycerides to free fatty acids. Extraction of algal constituents prior to hydrolysis impacts charring at elevated temperatures, conserves profitable by-products, and can ease downstream material handling.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857229291

Aqueous chemistries are used for all current commercial RFBs, therefore, cell potentials are limited to thestability range of water (01.23 V vs. SHE). Since a battery's cellpotential determines its energy and power density, aqueous chemistries limitthe possibilities for the performance of RFBs. Several non-aqueous systems have beenreported recently, including systems based on ruthenium, uranium, chromium, manganese, and vanadium coordination complexes.

Self-assembly through templating is one way to tailor carbon-based materials, enabling the formation of a uniform porous network in the mesopore size regime via manipulation and control of macroscopic process variables. These tailorable, nanostructured materials are synthesized by self assembly in solution, followed by heat treatment. Further activation results in a bimodal pore structure where micropores are present with the mesopores. The larger mesopores allow for faster electrolyte transport. Characteristics of templated carbons having relatively high surface areas and hierarchical pore structures will be presented, as well as measurements of their specific capacitance under conditions relevant to applications. A focus of the presentation is on recent efforts to convert the mesoporous carbon into electrode materials that may be used practically in capacitive deionization devices.

The current bottleneck to extensive deployment of both electric vehicles and smart electrical grids is the battery. Adoption by major utility companies of renewable energy plants, such as those based on photovoltaics, is hindered for two reasons. Stabilization of the intermittent power generation requires inexpensive long-life battery systems, which are yet to be developed. Additionally, power derived from photovoltaics is still too expensive to compete with electricity derived from fossil fuels. Deploying these applications will call for entirely new energy generation and storage innovations. In my poster presentation I will highlight examples both from my graduate research and from my accomplishments at Seeo Inc., the start-up company I co-founded. I will discuss how electrochemistry can be used to control assembly of block copolymers and, reciprocally, how structured nanomaterials can be used to control electrochemical device function, particularly in the case of stable high energy batteries. Building on my past work, I will describe my plans to create a research program aimed at obtaining a fundamental understanding of the structure-property-function relationships in nano-structured polymers as they apply to devices for advanced energy generation and storage. During my graduate work, I synthesized and studied organometallic block copolymers, wherein one block was composed of alternating ferrocene and dialkylsilane units in the main chain. Similarly to typical organic block copolymers, they underwent self-assembly to form microphase-separated ordered structures, and I characterized the phase behavior and thermodynamic interactions of the poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) system with multiple copolymers. The thermodynamic interactions in poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) diblock copolymers were systematically adjusted by oxidizing the ferrocene moieties with silver salts and examined using SAXS and depolarized light scattering. The polymers retained microphase separated ordered structures upon oxidation and showed systematic changes in the location of the order-disorder transition as a function of extent of oxidation. By controlling the redox properties of the ferrocene moiety in the backbone of the polymer, I developed a method for controlling the self-assembled microstructure and hence bulk material properties. Furthermore, using electrochemical techniques, a novel means of controlling the order-disorder transition of block copolymers was discovered. By applying very small electrochemical potentials to disordered solutions of the organometallic block copolymers, oriented ordered grains were formed near one electrode, the result of electrochemical reactions. After reversing the electrical bias on the system, the ordered grains disappeared and new oriented ordered regions were formed at the opposite electrode. Our work established a fundamentally new mechanism for controlling the self-assembly of block copolymers. More recently as Director of Materials Development at Seeo Inc., I have focused on developing commercially viable lithium battery systems based on solid-state polymeric electrolytes. Solid-state batteries have long been a goal of rechargeable battery development. Today's conventional batteries rely exclusively on organic liquid electrolytes, whose volatility and reactivity are responsible for the most significant limitations to battery life and safety. Liquid electrolytes continuously react with electrodes at maximum cell voltages and upon cycling, causing reduced lifetime through impedance rise and capacity fade. In contrast, polymer electrolytes limit the mobility of reactive electrolyte species, forming solid interfaces that can remain stable over long periods of time and over many charge/discharge cycles. Remarkably, this drastic enhancement in interfacial stability can yield extremely low rates of degradation and capacity fade, even in cells employing otherwise reactive high energy electrodes. Before the widespread commercialization of lithium ion batteries, solid polymer electrolyte technology was considered to be among the most promising routes to enabling lithium-based batteries. However, despite strong government and private-sector funding, academic and commercial efforts to develop batteries based on solid polymer electrolytes consistently failed. At the heart of each of these failures lay the inability to overcome a single fundamental constraint. Ion transport in polymers is coupled to the motion of the surrounding molecules that are solvating the ions. The presence of mobile molecules is thus essential to allow for a conductive medium; however, the same mobility of molecules is detrimental to the polymer's structural integrity. In all cases, polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity failed due to mechanical reasons while mechanically robust ion conductors were severely limited in conductivity. At Seeo, we have employed advanced self-assembled polymer nanostructures to break free from this principal constraint. We are commercializing our proprietary polymeric electrolytes in lithium-based batteries for electric vehicle and grid-tied storage applications. I believe my four-year experience leading an industrial research and development team gives me a unique understanding of how to create an academic research program with capabilities of exploratory science, intellectual property generation, and translation to practical application.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857228800

At the same time, metal organic frameworks have attracted research interest because of their exceptional adsorption properties and their flexibility in tailoring. This work aims at assessing the potential of a metal organic framework (USO-2-Ni) with respect to the performance in separating CO 2 from H 2 in a pressure swing adsorption pre-combustion process. This is done by comparing it to a base case which was designed using commercial activated carbon as adsorbent. Both experimental and theoretical aspects related to the PSA process are investigated in this study. First a sound characterization of the two adsorbents namely activated carbon (Chemviron, Germany) and MOF is done by measuring equilibrium adsorption isotherms of CO 2, H 2 and N 2 using a Magnetic Suspension Balance (Rubotherm, Germany). Additionally physical material properties such as material and bed densities as well as heat capacities were defined. Secondly kinetic parameters, such as mass and heat transfer parameters, are determined by conducting breakthrough experiments. The interpretation of the dynamic experiments is done by describing the process with a detailed one-dimensional model consisting of mass and heat balances and several constitutive equations such as adsorption isotherms, equation of state and pressure drop correlation. The model was further validated by predicting breakthrough curves in a broad temperature and pressure range and compared to the experiments. The comparison of the results of the aforementioned experiments with simulations allowed to confirm the static adsorption measurements and to determine the rapid adsorption kinetics of CO 2 on USO-2-Ni. For the design of the PSA process several aspects are important: the energy penalty has to be minimized whereas the capture rate is aimed to be higher than 90% and the CO 2 purity has to meet the specifications for the subsequent transportation and storage. Therefore after the validation of the process parameters, the simulation tool is used to describe various complete PSA cycles with different combinations of the individual steps. To assess the performance of the newly developed PSA cycles a multi-objective optimization including the CO 2 capture rate and the CO 2 purity is conducted. The results of the PSA simulations considering USO-2-Ni as adsorbent have been compared to those considering an activated carbon adsorbent. The former show a slightly better performance, as expected based on the favorable thermodynamics of the metal organic framework material compared to the thermodynamics of the activated carbon. It was shown that high bed and particle porosities can have a negative effect on the process performance, due to the reduced CO 2 uptake per unit volume and the increased fluid ratio in the column. It is therefore essential to consider the formulation of the adsorbent as much as the adsorption properties in further process development.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857228734

As the global demand for these fuels increases, sustainable technologies for both the production and consumption of these fuels will become critical. A suit of reforming processes can be used to synthesize liquid fuels from various feed stocks, such as biomass or natural gas. Examples of intermediate processes include short-contact time partial oxidation, oxidative coupling, hydrothermal reforming, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Advanced conversion technologies - such as homogeneous-charge compression ignition, catalytic combustion, and solid oxide fuel cells - could generate power with increased efficiency. In order to make these technologies both sustainable and commercially viable, we must understand how the chemical bonds in these fuels are manipulated at the atomic level. Unfortunately, the chemistry of energy conversion is staggeringly complex. Most of these technologies involve high temperatures and high pressures. Under these conditions, homogeneous gas-phase chemistry is coupled with heterogeneous surface-phase chemistry. A detailed mechanism for combustion of comparatively small hydrocarbons requires hundreds of species and thousands of reactions, and the inclusion of surface chemistry dramatically increases the complexity. My research will help to elucidate the complex chemistry of energy conversion. I will combine various computational methods with experimental techniques to create and validate kinetic mechanisms in homogeneous/heterogeneous coupled systems. Gas-phase mechanisms will be generated using an automatic reaction mechanism generator, RMG. Thermodynamically consistent surface mechanisms will be generated using scaling relationships, BEP relations, and other methods. Spatial profile reactors will provide experimental data under industrially relevant conditions. The simplified flow field, wide range of operating conditions, and sub-mm resolution of these instruments make them ideal candidates for evaluating microkinetic models. Sensitivity, flux, and reaction-path analyses will highlight which minima and saddle points on a potential energy surface are most important, and these stationary points will be refined with computational quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT) and statistical mechanics. New experiments will be performed to highlight certain reaction channels. This process is iterated until the mechanism is suitably accurate.

Porous structures made up with spherosilicate building blocks and consist of metal catalytic sites exhibit promising results for the ability of adsorption of gases. Experiments are carried out for investigating the hydrogen adsorption ability of these materials. In this study we performed computer simulations to analyze hydrogen adsorption in structures which consist of interconnected silsesquioxane units. This porous material has cubic silicate building blocks (Si 8O 20), which are cross-linked by SiCl 2O 2 bridges and decorated with OTiCl 3 catalytic sites and SiMe3 ends. The structure for the simulations was developed first using a coarse grain model, followed by an energy optimization and replacing the coarse grains with atoms. The physical properties of the structure such as density, surface area, accessible volume and pore size distribution were compared with experimental vales and they are in good agreement. Adsorption of hydrogen was modeled by Path Integral Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (PI-GCMC) simulations using standard force fields. From the simulations, hydrogen adsorption isotherms at 300K and 77 K were generated for low pressures up to 10 bars. The energy of adsorption of hydrogen was calculated at each case.

Related to their cost is the durability of these electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. Through an understanding of the mechanisms of failure it is possible to 1) guide the development of new materials that are lower cost or more durable, 2) devise system architectures and controls to mitigate these failure mechanisms. Generally, these are transient phenomena and the challenges involve the coupling of transport, kinetics, and thermodynamics. Two examples related to fuel cells are discussed in detail. The first is the oxidation of carbon associated with the starting and stopping of a PEM FC [1]. In the absence of a suitable materials solution, the system design is altered to reduce the loss of carbon to an acceptable level. A second example shows how a simple change to the power sharing algorithm for a fuel cell hybrid vehicle can dramatically reduce the dissolution of platinum. Only a small reduction in system efficiency accompanies this control strategy. More important, a framework is established to allow these types of trade-offs to be explored. [2] A third example is the loss of cyclable lithium in a lithium-ion battery. Common electrolytes used in lithium ion cells are not stable in contact with lithium. Because a relatively stable film called the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed, the reaction of lithium with the electrolyte is limited. Nonetheless, some lithium becomes unavailable for shuttling between the insertion electrodes, and further the reaction continues albeit more slowly over the life of the battery. It is impractical to add excess lithium to these cells. At the same time the SEI represents a polarization of the cell that reduces its efficiency and limits power density.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857223794

Al cannot be electrodeposited from aqueous solutions due to breakdown of water. It has been shown that Al electrodeposited from mixture of ionic liquid based on imidazolium chloride and aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) can be used as rechargeable battery electrode. In this work, cycle life was limited due to the compositional changes taking place in the electrolyte solution upon cycling which was proved with NMR spectroscopy. The intial 33% Depth of Dicharge (DOD) for 15 cycles showed the improvement of cycle life of deposited Al over 100% DOD cycling for 70 cycles due to the formation of base layer of Al. The effect of addition of co-solvent such dry benzene improves the conductivity of electrolyte and reduces the kinematic viscosity. This helps in improved current distribution and dense and compact Al deposition. As the concentration of benzene increased the Al was deposited with equiaxed grains and no entrained salt was observed in the deposit. In our previous work, cycle life of deposited Al was limited to ∼100 cycles due to the formation of undesireable surface products which were rich in Cl and Al. To improve the cycle life and minimize the compositional changes taking place in the electrolyte, organic solvents such as acetonitrile and dry benzene were added to the IL electrolyte. The cycle life and surface morphology of deposited Al from this mixture has been studied as a function of IL: solvent concentration. At various concentrations of the solvent (20-80 wt %), the galvanostatic cycling (charging and discharging) was studied with three-electrode electrochemical setup. It has been found that more than 100 cycles were obtained with 100% depth of discharge (DOD) at 20% dry benzene concetration. The addition of solvent helped in improving mobility of electroactive species in the electrolyte. The NMR spectroscopic measurements have been carried out with various concentrations of organic additives to the mixture of IL and AlCl 3. Also the variation of the morphology of the electrodeposited Al was studied with SEM and EDAX with varying the concentrations of the organic additives. Though the addition of organic additives improve the battery performance, it will also increase the risk of developing unsafe batteries due to the flammability or high vapor pressure associated with these organic additives. The flammability and vapor pressure was monitored with varying concentration of the electrolyte and organics, using a bomb calorimeter setup.

Bioethanol, in particular, is the world's leading transportation biofuel with a worldwide production in 2009 of almost 74 billion liters. This scenario has created a clear need for systematic tools to assist in the design and operation of biofuels facilities. The overwhelming majority of the optimization studies for designing bioethanol infrastructures have concentrated on improving the economic performance. Few studies have accounted for the environmental impact of these systems. Zamboni et al. formulated a multi-objective optimization model to reduce GHG emissions associated with the future corn-based Italian bioethanol network. Later, Giarola et al. extended this model by considering second generation bioethanol production technologies. As pointed out in the literature, approaches focusing on minimizing GHG emissions as unique criterion are somehow limited, as they can lead to solution where this impact is mitigated at the expense of increasing others. Hence, the environmental assessment of bioethanol infrastructures requires the application of holistic methods capable of accounting for several impacts occurring throughout the entire production chain. The aim of this work is to provide a decision-support tool for the strategic planning of integrated bioethanol-sugar supply chains (SCs) that accounts for the simultaneous optimization of several environmental impacts. The design task aims to determine the number, location and capacities of the SC facilities to be set up in each sub-region of a given country, their expansion policy for a given forecast of prices and demands over the planning horizon, the transportation links and number of trucks that need to be established in the network, and the production rates and flows of the involved feedstocks, wastes and final products. The problem is mathematically formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To encompass all possible conversion pathways, the proposed model includes production facilities of two types: sugar mills and distilleries. Depending on the utilized technology, the sugar mills can give two main by-products: molasses or honey, both of which can be fermented to obtain bioethanol. The liquid and solid materials require different storage conditions, so the model considers two options of warehouses depending on the physical state of the stored material. The region of interest (i.e., Argentina) is divided into a number of sub-regions, where the SC facilities can be installed. Different trucks are also considered for transporting materials between sub-regions of the country. The environmental impact is quantified via a set of life cycle assessment (LCA) metrics that measure the environmental performance of the integrated sugar-bioethanol SC in eleven damage categories. To tackle this high dimensional multi-objective problem, we follow a combined approach that relies on the use of a MILP-based dimensionality reduction technique recently developed by the authors. This strategy allows identification of redundant environmental objectives that can be left out of the analysis, shedding light on the interactions between the environmental damages caused by the bioethanol infrastructure. Numerical results show that several environmental effects of the sugar-bioethanol network are highly correlated, which makes it possible to focus our attention on a reduced set of damages. Our tool allows uncovering relationships between environmental impacts, providing valuable insight into the design problem and suggesting process alternatives for holistic environmental improvements.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857223743

Research in this area aims to both decarbonize and address energy security issues related to liquid fuel demand. Biofuels are renewable, low carbon fuels that are derived from biomass converted through different thermo-chemical or bio-chemical processes. Among the possible conversion processes, fast pyrolysis, the rapid thermal decomposition in the absence of oxygen, is considered to be an effective technology by which biomass, can be converted to valuable pyrolysis oil (bio-oil), biochar and gaseous products. Bio-oil and bio-char can each be used as a fuel and the gas can be recycled back into the process. In particular, bio-oils are attractive because of their high energy density and convenience in usage, storage and transport. Bio-char, rich in carbon, is resistant to degradation and can be either used as a source of energy for the process or as a soil amendment to enhance the sustainability of biomass harvesting and a means of carbon sequestration. The latter strategy will allow more residues to be removed from land by providing soil organic carbon (SOC) while benefiting from carbon storage. This study investigates the life cycle (LC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cost of different scenarios of pyrolysis of corn stover to bio-oil. A LC model is developed using data from literature, prior work (Spatari et al., 2010, Pourhashem et al.2010), and SimaPro life cycle inventory data to characterize the corn stover feedstock; and an Aspen Plus chemical process design developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the pyrolysis of the corn stover feedstock to bio-oil in a 200 ton/day scale facility. We study the cost effectiveness of the options for producing bio-oil as a final product or upgrading it to a drop-in transportation fuel; and the two options of utilizing the biochar byproduct i.e., as a source of energy or using it as a soil amendment and a means of sequestering carbon. The GHG emissions of the bio-oil and drop-in fuel produced are compared to low-grade heating fuel oils and gasoline, respectively.

Electrochemical conversion of CO 2 into fuels can provide a means for the storage of electrical energy in chemical form, which is important considering that most carbon neutral energy sources such as wind and solar produce electricity. Storage of this electrical energy in a chemical form would enable the use of renewable energy in the transportation sector, which makes up a large portion of our energy use but has only 3% supplied by renewable sources. Additionally, this technology could provide a means of storage for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar that are intermittent and, as a result, require output leveling. Conversion of CO 2 into CO is attractive due to the versatility of CO (with hydrogen) as a feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch process, which enables the synthesis of a variety of products including liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Presently, key challenges reducing large over potentials and improving selectivity, thereby resulting in a search for electrolytes and catalysts that stabilize CO 2- intermediate. Work by Rosen et al. has shown that the ionic liquids may stabilize the intermediate and lower the necessary overpotentials. Here, we use a microfluidic reactor that employs a flowing electrolyte to investigate the influence of ionic liquids in a flowing cell [5]. In the flow cell, we found ionic liquids improve the selectivity for CO as opposed to H 2 and increase the current densities, both at low currents. However, ionic liquids were found to be mass transport limited, thereby limiting the selectivity at high currents. To address this limitation, we study several key parameters including, temperature, and pressure with regards to current efficiency, faradaic efficiency, current densities and overpotentials. Additives are used to improve the selectivity for CO and minimize anodic poisoning. massand make design changes to overcome these mass transport limitations.

We have carried out experiments in flow-assisted zinc-nickel oxide batteries, and concluded that flowing electrolyte contributes to the modification of zinc morphology and extend the battery cycle life significantly. More than 1500 cycles have been obtained while keeping the Coulombic efficiency at or above 90% by utilizing a deep-discharge reconditioning step every 15 cycles. The loss of Coulombic efficiency is attributed to remaining zinc on anodes on discharge, hydrogen and oxygen evolution occurring as parasitic reaction, and reasons such as corrosion in the sintered nickel electrodes. The extent of gas evolution is determined by the balance of thermodynamics and kinetics of the hydrogen and oxygen, and those of the main reduction-oxidation reactions in the battery. We have conducted experiments on gas evolution in a sealed zinc-nickel oxide battery for with and without flow assisted cases. The effects of flowing electrolyte on gas evolution were quantitatively evaluated and the impacts on battery performances were discussed. Metal zinc as negative (anode) electrode was deposited on polished nickel coated copper sheets as substrate. Sintered nickel oxide electrode was used as the cathode. The test cell was a prismatic cell which has a capacity of 2.2 Ah. Zinc oxide at a concentration of 60 g L -1 was initially dissolved into 45 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution as electrolyte. The electrolyte flows from the bottom to the top of the cell at an average velocity of 3 mm s -1 in the flowing case. Evolved gases were accumulated in the head space of the cell. The concentration of the oxygen in the head space was measured by anoxygen sensor. The internal pressure of the cell was measured by a pressure transducer which is also attached to the head space of the cell. Galvano static battery cycling experiments were carried out for a charge and discharge rates of 1C and 0.5C, respectively. Charge was terminated when a battery cell was fully charged to the full rated capacity of the sintered nickel oxide electrodes, and discharge was terminated when the cell voltage dropped to 1.0V. The results show that, on charge, hydrogen is evolved from zinc (anode) side. Because of the formation of concentration boundary layer and the lower concentration of zinc (zincate) ion near the zinc anodes in the non-flowing case, hydrogen evolution tends to occur more instead of zinc electro deposition. On the other hand, on discharge, hydrogen can theoretically be evolved from the cathode (nickel oxide). However, from a thermodynamic point of view, hydrogen evolution should not start until the cell voltage drops much lower, near 0 V. Other possibilities are zinc corrosion and that hydrogen evolved on charging is released from voids within the zinc electro deposit during discharging. Time elapsed images of the zinc anode in a cycle showed that the evolved bubbles on charging, which are presumed to be hydrogen, do not detach from the surface on charging and detach on discharging. Also, there are quite a few bubbles that appear as zinc dissolves on discharging. From a thermo dynamic point of view, these bubbles should not be oxygen and, in fact, oxygen in the cell doesn't increase on discharging. Therefore, these are expected to be hydrogen which is generated on charging. On the other hand, xygen is drastically evolved toward the end of charge for both the cases. This oxygen evolution is from the positive (nickel oxide) electrodes and this phenomenon in zinc-nickel oxide batteries has been reported in many previous works. The results also show that oxygen is evolved more in the non-flowing case than the flowing case. Though we did not compare the differences of crystal structure of the nickel oxide electrodes between the flowing and non-flowing cases, considering that oxygen evolution basically occurs on overcharging, and that electrolyte (KOH)concentrations affect the performance of sintered nickel oxide electrodes, oxygen evolution tends to occur more than the reaction between nickel oxide and hydroxide ion in the non-flowing case, because of the concentration gradient of the hydroxide ion at the electrodes surfaces. On discharging, oxygen is not evolved for both the cases, and the curves rather show a tendency of slight decrease of oxygen in the cell. This indicates that oxygen is slightly recombined on discharging, probably by the reduction on the positive plates.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857222290

Repurposingthis chemistry as a rechargeable electrical storage medium make possible a newera of MW-scale advanced batteries to add universal storage capability to theelectrical grid. This would bepossible due to low cost, high availability, and safety of the materials. There is no universal consensus on the strategy forextending the cycle life of MnO 2 electrodes, which are typicallyelectrolyte-filled porous electrodes also containing carbon and a binder. Adding dopant atoms to the MnO 2 crystal structure is one. Anotheris low depth of discharge. Thefirst of these renders electrochemically irreversible products (Mn 2O 3)reversible, the second avoids their formation. These methods are not mutually exclusive, and a combinationof them may prove successful. Inany case, the problem is not only one of manganese electrochemistry, but alsocurrent distribution in the electrode and interactions with the conductivecarbon matrix. Any one of many processes may become limiting in a porousMnO 2-carbon electrode: ionic conduction in pores, electronic conductionin the carbon matrix, interfacial contacts, or charge transfer of the MnO 2reaction itself. Parallel studiesof battery cycling, half-cell cycling, ex situ material characterization, andfailure analysis must be used to identify the limiting processes in such porouselectrodes. For this study, porous manganese dioxide cathodes werepaired with non-limiting cadmium anodes with a base cell size of ∼4 Ah. The electrolyte was quiescent 12 M KOH.

The EIS results weremodeled to pinpoint which phenomena in the porous electrode were responsiblefor increase in overall impedance.

However, due to the difficulty in finding an effective storage medium, the application of H 2, for example in the automotive sector, is currently limited. Single H 2 clathrate hydrates have been considered as potential future H 2 storage material. Their profitability, safety, fast and high reversibility and efficient production make them more suitable for this application than other H 2 storage materials. However the main disadvantage of single H 2 clathrate hydrates is the high pressure (200 MPa at 273K) required for formation. Recently, it has been reported that tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) can be used as an additive to form H 2-TBAB semi-clathrate hydrates with water, which are stable at much more practical conditions (atmospheric pressure and close to room temperature). Similar to clathrate hydrates, semi-clathrate hydrates have empty small cavities that can be filled by H 2 molecules. Moreover, the TBAB molecule is non-volatile which means there is no contamination of the H 2 realized. These favorable conditions make the H 2-TBAB semi-clathrate hydrates particularly attractive as a potential H 2 storage media. In order to elucidate the potential of H 2-TBAB semi-clathrate hydrates for H 2 storage, kinetic data and in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements were obtained for two TBAB concentrations (2.56 mol% and 3.7 mol% in the liquid solution) in a pressure range of 5 - 16 MPa. In order to prove or disapprove the stochastic nature of hydrate growth, two approaches were applied: (i) isochoric temperature cycle method and (ii) temperature constant method. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of time-dependent kinetic conditions of H 2-TBAB semi-clathrate hydrates using in situ Raman spectroscopy in an aqueous solution.

Specifically, using batteries for transportation will enable improved efficiency and use of renewable energy. But, to maintain vehicle range and performance, batteries with an order of magnitude higher energy density are needed. New electrode chemistries that provide more energy with less mass, such as lithium-air, have the potential to fill this need. Lithium-air batteries are complex systems with many barriers to be overcome before they are competitive with current energy sources. Several of the challenges arise from the use of liquid electrolyte. In a system exposed to air, solvent in the electrolyte not only evaporates but is also flammable. Block polymer electrolyte mitigates this problem, while also serving multiple functions. In conventional systems the membrane separator and binder are inert, used only for their mechanical properties. Whereas a block polymer electrolyte can serve each of these functions and also conducts ions. Block polymer electrolyte battery cycling will be presented.

CCS can play significant role especially in the short/medium term as it offers a seamless and cheaper transition route towards a more sustainable energy economy (e.g., renewables) in the long-term while allowing the continued use of fossil fuels environmentally benignly. However, one of the main stumbling blocks to realize large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the huge upfront costs involved. Hence, in this contribution we have proposed a comprehensive optimization framework, that is spatially and temporally explicit, to design the least-cost CCS networks and their optimal evolution with time over the next four decades (i.e., until 2050). This framework establishes optimal transport links amongst most potential sources and sinks (while leaving out the not-so-important ones from a global perspective), as and when they are necessary, to achieve a pre-set CO 2 reduction target that is to be met by CCS in every decade within this time horizon. We have then demonstrated the applicability and usefulness of our approach with a real case study by applying it to design CCS networks for the Netherlands. As demonstrated by Konda et. al., 2011, CCS must be an integral part of the Dutch CO 2 mitigation portfolio to comply with the local and regional (i.e., EU level) CO 2 mitigation targets. Furthermore, the availability of a number of large-scale CO 2 point-sources and large storage capacity makes CCS an attractive CO 2 mitigation option for the Netherlands. Potential CO 2 sources considered within our framework include the existing power plants (including coal/gas-fired plants and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle plants) and industrial sources (including refineries, cement, steel and chemical plants such as ammonia and hydrogen production plants). In addition to the existing plants, we have also considered the prospective plants within the scope of this study - this is an one of the salient features of our models, and as we will demonstrate, this is an important aspect as establishing a CO 2 capture facility at an existing/old power plant can be more expensive compared to establishing it at a new/prospective facility. This is because new plants can be built in accordance with the requirements so as to make its integration with CO 2 capture facility easier and cheaper (for instance, they can be capture-ready plants) and to minimize the additional capital burden and efficiency losses/penalties. Potential sinks considered include depleted gas reservoirs (including the Groningen fields) onshore and offshore, enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBM) sites and saline aquifers. Within the Dutch context, depleted oil reservoirs' estimated storage capacity is rather limited and hence they are not considered. Extensive data on all the point sources (i.e., CO 2 emissions/yr, location, type etc) and sinks (i.e., sink capacity, location, type etc.) are obtained from latest data-sources (including official sources whenever possible) as it is important to ensure the quality of the data used in such a large-scale real case-study. CO 2 is transported by pipelines (both onshore and offshore) and pipeline economies of scale is explicitly accounted for (by piecewise linearization) in our models. We have already obtained interesting results that are practically useful/significant demonstrating the need and usefulness of such a holistic systems based multi-period optimization approach to design optimal and realistic large-scale CCS networks. The results, model and the salient features will be discussed in detail during the presentation.

One major drawback associated with these renewable resources is that the power output is dependent on environmental factors, such as cloud cover and wind speeds. This allows the possibilities of either power output exceeding or falling short of forecast levels which may lead to grid instabilities. Therefore, Large Scale Energy Storage (LSES) systems are critical to store excess power when the output exceeds demand in order to supplement output power when it falls short of demand. Some promising LSES contenders are: 1) Zinc bromide flow cells (FC), 2) Vanadium redox FC, 3) Sodium sulfur batteries, and 4) Lead acid batteries. Of these available technologies the zinc bromide technology was selected for further investigation because of previously reported long cycle-life (CL) and high efficiencies. In this work, the cell efficiency dependence on temperature of a bench scale Zinc Bromide battery manufactured in our lab was investigated to confirm the theoretical efficiency. Efficiency cycling was voltage limited on the discharge cycle at a 1.5 / V cell cut-off potential. Standard method of measuring columbic efficiency was implemented. At room temperature, ∼80% efficiency was achieved when cycling the system between 20 - 100% State of Charge (SOC), which is in good agreement with published values. The cell efficiency was demonstrated at over 90% at 50°C and cycling between 20 - 100% SOC. In addition, given that deep discharge is perceived as highly damaging to electrochemical energy storage, the battery was cycled through the Zero-Point (ZP) 10,000 times. The cell was continuously cycled between 0 - 5% (SOC). Battery performance was evaluated from transfer rate and exchange current density, determined using Tafel scans. No degradation of the electrodes was found, and in fact a slight increase in the exchange current density was observed.

These compounds can be loaded and unloaded with considerable amounts of hydrogen in a cyclic process. In contrast to other hydrogen storage methods, LOHC can be safely stored under ambient conditions in big quantities. As they have many physico-chemical similarities to Diesel, LOHC can make use of the existing energy infrastructure, e.g., storage tanks or road tankers. In times of high loads from intermittent sources, e.g., wind or solar energies, excess energy can be used to locally produce hydrogen by water electrolysis, which is efficiently stored in the form of LOHC. The so-produced energy carrier can be stored at the spot of production and re-converted to electricity in times of high demand. Alternatively, it can be easily transported to be used in various off-site applications, e.g., mobility, heating, and local hydrogen production. Compared to other energy storage technologies, e.g., pumped hydroelectric or compressed air energy storage, LOHC show a high energy storage density, thus enabling a safe and loss-free storage of renewable energy with only limited land use.

The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, CO chemisorption combined with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The NSR performance of the catalysts was investigated by fuel lean/rich cycling in the absence and presence of SO 2 (25 ppm) as well as after H 2 desulfation at 750 °C. The performance increased when Rh was located on BaCO 3 enabling good catalyst regeneration during the fuel rich phase. Best performance was observed for bimetallic catalysts where the noble metals were separated, with Pt on Al 2O 3 and Rh on BaCO 3.

CSP systems have been considered for several decades and in recent years generate renewed interest in research, development and commercialization. Several difficulties associated with CSP systems have to be overcome before a successful wide-scale commercial adoption. The focus of this talk is the design and optimization of CSP with a central receiver, in particular integrated with thermal energy storage. Such technologies are still at a research/development stage. Central receiver systems are typically employed in flat land using dozens to thousands of heliostats for a single receiver. In the first part of the talk we describe a recent proposal to use hilly terrain. Hilly terrain is often significantly cheaper than flat lands which is suitable for many uses. A tool for site selection is presented for both beam-up and beam-down configurations and used to demonstrate the abundance of suitable hills. Additionally a computationally efficient tool for heliostat placement in both planar and hilly terrains is described and used to identify novel heliostat patterns that are significantly better than any of the existing ones. An interdisciplinary team at MIT proposed a new concept, termed CSPonD, that collocates the receiver and storage system. CSPonD has the potential to overcome some of the operational challenges of power towers and reduce capital cost of the receiver/storage system without compromising the efficiency. On the other hand, identifying an optimal design and operation is very challenging. The second part of the talk describes a methodology based on dynamic optimization . Both single-purpose (electricity only) and dual-purpose plants (electricity and seawater desalination) are discussed. The effect of feed-in tariff (FIT) on optimal design and operation is demonstrated and the influence of seasonal variations on operability discussed.

However, a heterogeneous catalyst plays a vital role for first initiating and then controlling H 2 production during hydrolysis reactions. Thus, the present work is focused to develop nano-catalyst to be used for dehydrogenation reactions of AB. Firstly, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (∼ 100 nm) with pore size of ∼ 3 nm were synthesis by hydrolysis and condensation of alkoxy silane using CTAB surfactant as a template. Later, cobalt salt was embedded inside the pores of the mesoporous silica by chemical impregnation method followed by reduction using NaBH 4 to form Co-B nanoparticles. It was observed that Co-B nanoparticles act as highly active catalytic centers to produce significantly higher rate (about 6 times) of H 2 by hydrolysis of AB than the same amount of the corresponding Co-B powders (produced by similar chemical reduction method but without mesoporous silica support). Almost complete conversion (95%) of AB was obtained during hydrolysis, as confirmed by 11B NMR, by using nano-catalyst at room temperature. The nano-catalyst were characterized by TEM, SEM, AFM, XPS, EDS, XRD and BET surface area measurement to understand the enhanced activity of the catalyst. Availability of a large number of under-coordinated Co active atoms owing to the size and shape of nanoparticles, better dispersion &amp; polycrystalline nature of nanoparticles, and optimum interaction with reactant provided by electron enrichment on Co sites from B, are the main features acquired by the Co-B nanoparticles that exhibit high catalytic efficiency.

Due to the widespread availability of renewable energy (RE) sources, power can be produced in a small scale and remote locations, as long as a sustainable integrated system for power production, storage and distribution exists. Energy storage is a key challenge, especially when the energy system is not connected to the grid, and is usually solved by incorporating an energy storage unit. For long-term storage, electrical energy can be converted into hydrogen, for later use in fuel cells to produce electricity. This study deals with the development of a supervisory, optimization and power management tool for a 10kW hybrid energy system built in Lambton College, Sarnia, ON. The main rationale for such a tool lies in the fact that renewable energy sources are intermittent in nature and their availability may not coincide with the load demand or with the availability of energy carriers. In order to accomplish the task of developing the supervisory software, the main step is to develop a reliable plant model, which is then used for optimization and control purposes. The wind, PV, and hydrogen production/storage/consumption components of the hybrid energy system are modeled individually. Process streams and electrical connections are applied for integration of the above-mentioned components. The RE sources and fuel cell are integrated either through an AC or DC bus. The hybrid energy system is modeled as stand-alone and grid-connected as well. When the hybrid system is without grid connection, the power demand (load) is the main criterion for power management. However, in the grid-connected system, power can be transferred from the grid to the hybrid system when power generated from RE sources does not meet the load demand. The integrated model was structured in a dynamic mode. In addition to main components, hydrogen storage tank, gas compressor and gas pressure regulator models are also developed. The hybrid system is designed and modeled in a modular approach for all components, which allows proper sizing of equipment to achieve maximum efficiency. The control architecture consists of the low level local controllers for each component and a supervisory power controller, which manages the power flow. Excess RE power initiates the hydrogen production units and whenever the RE system cannot completely meet load demand, the FC system provides power to meet the remaining load. The supervisory controller deals with a complex control problem of handling binary and continuous variables, as well as constraints. The control strategy consists of tracking the power demand, producing sufficient amount of hydrogen, and switching on and off modular components. It is important to highlight the consideration of constraints such as minimum fuel cell, electrolyzer power threshold and time limitation between fuel cell and electrolyzer startups and shutdowns. A model predictive control strategy is developed to solve the optimal energy management problem.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857207586

In this context, hydrogen is a potential clean and environmentallyfriendly energy carrier because, with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity, its only product is water. A major obstacle for the development of hydrogen powered vehicles is the lack of safe, light weight and energy efficient means for on-board hydrogen storage. There are targets for hydrogen storage materials so that a vehicle can travel &gt;500 km on single hydrogen fill. The 2015 system volumetric and gravimetric targets are 4.7 MJ/L and 5.5 wt %, respectively. Evaluation of a hydrogen storage system includes all associated components (tank, valves, piping, insulation, reactants, etc.). Currently, no technology is able to meet the 2015 system targets. In order to meet the system targets, material-based H 2 yield must exceed the system targets by a typical factor of 2 or more. Ammonia borane (NH 3BH 3, AB) has attracted considerable interest as a promising hydrogen storage candidate because of its high hydrogen content (19.6 wt %), hydrogen release under moderate conditions, and stability at room temperature. Our experiments show promising results that high H 2 yield (~14 wt %, which is significantly higher than by any other method reported in the literature) can be obtained by neat AB thermolysis at or near proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM FC) operating temperatures along with rapid kinetics, without the use of either catalyst or additives. In addition, it was found that even small amount of boric acid as additive can decrease onset temperature of AB thermolysis to below PEM FC operating temperatures. Further, only trace amount of NH 3 was detected in the gaseous product from the above-mentioned approaches. Our results show that both neat AB thermolysis and AB thermolysis in the presence of boric acid have the potential to meet DOE target and even surpass it. To our knowledge, on a material basis, these high yield values are higher than by any other method reported in the literature, using AB near PEM FC operating temperatures.

With the addition of the Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility (IBRF)at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the cellulosic biofuels industry has access to a significantly expanded pilot plant and biochemical conversion process research facility. At NREL, the goal is to improve the cost effectiveness of cellulosic biofuels production processes and thereby to accelerate commercial scale deployment of these technologies. A number of aggressive government policies are guiding NREL's approach to cellulosic ethanol and other cellulosic biofuels research and development (R&D), including the 2007 Energy and Independence and Security Act requiring 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, and President Obama's New Energy for America Plan calling for 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030. The IBRF's new integrated and flexible process R&D piloting capabilities will enable a wide variety of biofuels technology developers to reduce risks associated with scaling up to demonstration and full-commercial scales. Many of the risks to be mitigated are related to solids handling, which presents a variety of challenging technical issues that the cellulosic biofuels industry must resolve to successfully transition the conversion technologies from pilot to demonstration scale and ultimately to commercial scale. The IBRF was completed in two stages and includes provisions to evaluate a wide variety of sustainable biomass feedstocks (corn stover, switch grass, sorghum, etc). During completion of the first stage start up and commissioning a number of solids handing issues were encountered and to some extent resolved. Second stage design modifications were implemented to address the solids handling issues experienced during the first stage. The design changes were primarily associated with storage hoppers and discharge screws,pneumatic conveyance, cyclone separation, weigh belt feed, and dust collection.Design considerations for biomass feedstock handling as well as lessons learnedduring first and second stage facility commissioning and startup will bediscussed.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857206280

However, there is currently a significant lack of understanding regarding the development and dynamics of the biomass feedstock market upstream of the biorefinery, which is a critical component of the value chain. This includes assessing the time-scale of its development as well as the impact of various engineering, technological, regulatory and social factors on the dynamics. Various uncertainties and disturbances can impact the functioning of this system, and understanding the resilience of the system in the presence of those is also important. The analysis is especially challenging due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders such as farmers, refinery, transportation companies and storage elevators that must participate and yet compete for a fraction of the profit. The objective of this work is to conduct such as analysis using the complex adaptive systems theory approach. The work develops an agent-based model that incorporates various stakeholders (agents) within the feedstock production system. The model, developed in MATLAB®, uses an object-oriented programming approach by considering each agent-type as an independent class and a particular realization of that agent-type as an object (instance) of that class. The individual characteristics of an object are defined by a set of attributes. The behavior of each agent as well as its interaction with other agents is based on a set of rules (methods). Since the behavioral and social factors play an important role in the decisions made by individual agents, a mental model incorporating some of these factors is also developed for each agent. The set of decision rules are consequently based not only on the economic and technological rationale, but also on the unique mental models and cognitive processes. The learning/adaptive behavior exhibited by the agents is also modeled which enables the simulation of emergent behavior of the system. The model has previously been used to study the development of the biomass market under different scenarios. The focus of this work is on understanding the impact of various disturbances and uncertainties on the dynamics of the system, which enables us to study the resilience of the system. Different possible disturbances such as loss of productivity, price fluctuations and infrastructure breakdown will be modeled. Desirable but sudden changes such as the availability of an efficient technology will also be considered. Simulation studies incorporating these disturbances will be conducted to study their impact on the dynamics of the feedstock production system. Preliminary studies using this model have illustrated that the development of this sector is gradual, nonlinear and may take up to 15 years. The impact of the time of disturbance along this development trajectory will therefore be critical and will also be studied. Simulations for different types of energy crops such as switchgrass and Miscanthus will also identify whether the dynamics are a function of the energy crop. The work will also enable us to evaluate different system resilience measures appropriate for analyzing the feedstock production system.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857202322

Biomass, of various forms, has been proposed as an option to fill this need for alternative raw materials. Several problems with biomass as an alternative to fossil fuel derived materials instantly arise: low bulk energy density, the resulting high transport costs, seasonal variability of biomass supply, and the risks inherent to relying on a largely agriculturally based system are several examples. To begin to realize energy and chemical production with biomass as the feedstock on an economic scale, supply chain optimization and a robust means of simulating variation over long periods of time is critical. Due to a relatively low energy density of the given biomass feedstocks, the majority of the biorefinery supply chain costs occur in the process of raw material transportation. By optimizing this aspect of the biorefinery supply chain, given the plant and potential feedstock source locations, the cost associated with raw material transportation can be minimized. In order to examine the potential longevity and general robustness of the output from the optimization model, simulation is a valuable tool. In this way, the effects of perturbations on the various feed stock supplies due to weather variability, crop yield variability, or other factors can be examined and analyzed. This presentation focuses on the development of a coupled system comprised of an optimization model for the upstream portion of biorefinery supply chains in Western Kentucky and a discrete-event simulation program. The optimization model minimizes the transportation costs associated with moving biomass feedstock from centralized storage facilities to the biorefinery location. Multiple feedstocks available in the region under consideration including chicken litter, forest residue, and corn stover were taken into consideration. Various alternative shipping methods as well as a centralized versus a distributed production facility layout are considered as well. The discrete-event simulation model allows for the examination of the robustness of the determined optimal supply chain design. This combination of optimization and simulation for the examination of multi-biomass source-to-biorefinery supply chains could potentially serve as a template for future work in biorefinery supply chain model development and decision-making.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857200329

The costs of biomass supply and logistics hinder commercialization for advanced fuel and power production. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC, or wet torrefaction) is a pretreatment process for making a homogenized, carbon rich, and energy dense solid fuel, called HTC biochar, from lignocellulosic biomass. Compared to raw biomass, HTC biochar is both more hydrophobic for better storage and more friable for better processing. In this pretreatment method, the biomass is treated with hot compressed water in an inert environment in the temperature range of 200-260°C. The range of mass yield of biochar is 60-90% and its energy yield is 75-95%, indicating that the process causes an energy densification of 6-25%. Higher reaction temperature decreases mass yield and increases energy densification. Kinetic data show that hemicelluloses and water extractives react very quickly compared to cellulose and that lignin is relatively inert, resulting in a biochar with increased lignin content. Lignin extracted from raw wood by Van-Soest method exhibits a glass transition temperature at about 135-165 °C. Similarly, lignin extracted from HTC biochar exhibits a glass transition temperature in the same range. Lignin acts as a natural binder for pelletization of HTC biochar, if pelletizing is done in the temperature range of glass transition. A hydraulic press with a controllable heated die was used for producing uniform pellets. The materials used to make pellets were raw loblolly pine and pine pretreated at 200°C, 230°C, and 260°C. The sample was compressed into a 13 mm die to make cylindrical pellets 8-10 mm long. The pressure applied was 1000 MPa while a temperature of 140 °C was maintained for 30 seconds to allow the lignin showing the glass transition behavior. Pellets made from HTC biochar exhibit favorable properties resulting from high levels of lignin, including increased abrasion resistance, increased durability, increased modulus of elasticity, increased energy density, and increased mass density. On the other hand, ultimate breaking strength of pellets is decreased with increasing pretreatment temperature. Pellets produced from biomass pretreated at 260°C, have volumetric fuel value 70% greater than pellets produced from untreated pine and 142% greater than the raw biomass. Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of pellets of HTC biochar pretreated at 260 °C is about one fourth that of pellets produced from raw biomass. Pellets produced from HTC biochar maintain structural integrity significantly longer than do pellets produced from raw woody biomass.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857198903

Among the various choices of renewable energy resources, biomass intrigues many researchers due to its widespread availability, cost effectiveness and its applicability as a sustainable energy source. Large scale biomass production and improved manufacturing techniques are some of the major areas where researchers are working on. However, because of high variations in the availability of biomass from one region to another there is a necessity to develop region specific economic models for biorefining. Developing economic models requires a multidisciplinary approach as the variation in biomass results in significant change in collection, storage techniques, supply and processing. This presentation aims to show how different disciplines of engineering and sciences can be combined to develop a region specific economic model for sustainable biorefinery based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), supply chain optimization and process systems engineering. The Jackson Purchase in western Kentucky is the region where this model will be applied first. The Jackson Purchase region is not only rich in coal and biomass but also has a large number of poultry farms. Hence poultry litter can be a potential feedstock for integrated biorefinery in this region. Forest residue, corn stover and chicken litter are some of the feedstocks that are considered in this model for producing liquid transportation fuels. However, the distribution of lignocellulosic biomass in the country is very uneven and the first challenge is to locate the biomass. GIS is a technique by which biomass in a region can be located and by coupling it with supply chain optimization, location of potential biorefinery can be suggested. ILOG OPL is the tool used for optimizing the transportation cost of biomass from supply points to the potential biorefineries. Process systems engineering can be used to develop and optimize the processes. Aspen plus V-7.2 process engineering suite is the process simulation software used for this purpose. Gasification is a proven thermochemical process that is optimized in this model to produce synthesis gas and liquid hydrocarbons from forest residue and chicken litter. Also, a biochemical process is optimized in which corn stover is used to produce ethanol which can be marketed as transportation fuel. This model also looks into costs associated with storage and preprocessing of biomass and chicken litter. Detailed ash analysis will also be done in order to suggest most environmentally friendly conversion techniques among the various available choices. Finally, in future all the above optimized models will be combined to estimate the total production cost of various marketable products from different locally available feedstocks. The results, thus, obtained from these models will not only determine the location and number of biorefineries required to sustain a given region, but will also estimate the adequate monetary investment on sustainable biorefining required for that specific region.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857198889

Reversible fuel cells have been proposed as a possible way to store energy; however, energy losses associated with the conversion between H 2O and H 2 and the volumes required for storing H 2 are serious impediments to this technology. To solve these problems, we propose to use the electrochemical oxidation of Sb and reduction of Sb 2O 3 in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) as a means of energy storage. Both Sb (m.p. 903K) and Sb 2O 3 (m.p. 929K) are molten at typical SOFC operating temperatures (e.g. 973K). Furthermore, initial data for Sb electrode overpotentials indicates that these losses are very low. Although the Nernst potential for Sb-Sb 2O 3 equilibrium is relatively low, this is inconsequential for the energy-storage application. Finally, the volume associated with 1MW-h of energy is only 45 liters, based on cell performance that has already been achieved.

Two different flow schemes have been simulated and compared: flue gas recycle with air combustion and flue gas recycle with an oxygen enriched feed mixture. The energy requirement of the different processes, expressed in GJ (thermal basis) per ton of recovered CO 2, and the size of the membrane capture process (expressed in m 2 of membrane area) have been systematically estimated. Based on a feed compression strategy, the simulations are achieved for four different membrane characteristics, covering a broad range of currently commercially available and hypothetical materials, with 0.9 CO 2 purity in the permeate side and 0.9 CO 2 capture ratio specifications. For air combustion scheme, the results show that the best performances, logically obtained with the most selective membrane (a = 200), induce an energy requirement of more than 8 GJ/ton. This value is much larger than the 3.5 GJ/ton needed for the reference post-combustion capture process (absorption in MEA). A completely different picture is obtained if an Oxygen Enriched Air (OEA) strategy is applied. In that case, energy requirements down to 2.6 GJ/ton can be attained. Interestingly, the membrane selectivity performances (tested between a = 50 and a = 200 here) play a key role on the overall energy requirement. This situation differs from the direct ""end of pipe"" post-combustion carbon capture, where no significant improvement on the energy requirement is observed as soon as the membrane selectivity reaches a value of a= 50. Thus, the search for highly selective membranes, far above the performances of the actual membrane materials, is of major interest for the gas turbine / membrane capture process investigated in this study. Additionally, moderate inlet pressure values (12-22 bar), together with moderate oxygen purities (45-53 %) are needed for optimal OEA conditions. The promising results reported for the OEA combustion strategy call for a more in depth analysis of this hybrid process. Several unexplored issues could be investigated in future works.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857197709

In this context, my research employs electronic structure simulations in two promising areas: chemical catalysis and solar energy. In addition to gaining fundamental descriptions of new chemistries, these studies have specific implications for the advancement of energy technologies, including hydrogen storage, carbon dioxide reduction, hydrocarbon conversion, and organic solar cells. Breakthroughs in these technologies could lead to zero emission vehicles, carbon neutral fuels, better utilization of fossil fuel feedstock, and inexpensive solar electricity. In recent years, electronic structure simulations have become standard tools for providing molecular level information. The widespread use of simulations results from their ability to provide otherwise unattainable chemical mechanisms, as well as to supply guidance and interpretation to experiment. Although many simulation techniques have proven qualitatively useful, further development is needed to attain quantitative predictions. For instance, detailed investigation of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations of zeolites (Zimmerman et al., JCTC, in press) demonstrates that accurate simulations are achievable, but only with careful (and transferable) parameterization. Our new, fast and accurate model is actively being utilized to simulate catalysis in zeolites, including natural gas upgrading and alkane cracking. For solar research, simulations have typically relied on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to investigate responses of molecules to light. This approach, however, is qualitatively incorrect for describing multiple exciton generation in organic materials. More sophisticated methods, such as restricted active space double spin flip configuration interaction (RAS-2SF), are required to gain fundamental insight into these processes. RAS-2SF breaks through limitations of TD-DFT and is able to explain the intermolecular mechanism that leads to efficient multiple exciton generation (Zimmerman et al., Nature Chem. 2010). The mechanisms elucidated in these studies are able to suggest design principles for exploiting the underlying chemical processes. Continued development and application of novel molecular simulation methods will be essential for the design of practical clean energy solutions.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857196775

The reforming and water-gas shift catalysts used to produce hydrogen and the fuel cell electrodes are all sensitive to the sulfur compounds in the fuels. Conventional desulfurization methods, i.e. hydrodesulfurization (HDS), consume large amounts of energy to reach sulfur concentrations low enough for fuel cells. Adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) is a promising method being developed to produce ultra-low sulfur fuels. A Ti xCe 1-xO 2 material has been reported by the Song group at Penn State to be a potential adsorbent for ADS due to its good selectivity and regenerability. The ratios of Ti:Ce were optimized to 9:1 for the maximum adsorption capacity. Comparing Ti 0.9Ce 0.1O 2 to TiO 2, the 10% CeO 2 addition significantly increases the capacity, despite only a slight surface area increase. We have applied density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the role of Ce addition to TiO 2 in promoting the adsorption of thiophenic molecules. A number of possible contributions of Ce addition were evaluated, including 1) stabilization of TiO 2 surfaces that adsorb thiophene strongly, 2) stronger adsorption to Ce-doped TiO 2 surfaces, 3) stabilization of reduced or over-oxidized sites on Ce-doped TiO 2, and 4) increased oxygen storage capacity to promote formation of adsorbed sulfone-like complexes. We find that Ce-doping of the surface can offer adsorption sites with stronger binding of thiophene, and can stabilize the anatase (100) surface which demonstrates strong adsorption affinity. Ceria may also serve as an oxygen reservoir to promote formation of adsorbed sulfone species to the TiO 2 surface. Thiophene adsorption energies are compared with cyclopentene to probe adsorption selectivity, and substitution of both thiophene and cyclopentene is considered to evaluate variations in selectivity. Calculations using DFT and dispersion corrected DFT, DFT+D, are compared.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857196663

The activation process was performed under relatively mild activation conditions, i. e., a KOH/polymer weight ratio of 2 and reaction temperatures in the 600-850 °C range. The porous carbons thus obtained possess very large surface areas, up to 3000 m2/g, and pore volumes of up to 1.75 cm3/g. The pore size distribution of these carbons can be tuned via modification of the activation temperature. Thus, by increasing the activation temperature from 600 to 850 °C, the nature of the carbons changes gradually from microporous to micro-mesoporous (with small mesopores of up to 2.5 nm). The polythiophene-derived activated carbons are sulfur-doped with sulfur contents in the 3-12 wt% range. The sulfur content decreases at higher activation temperature. The hydrogen storage capacity of these activated carbons, at cryogenic temperature and 20 bar, is up to 5.71 wt% with an estimated maximum hydrogen uptake of 6.64 wt%.

The eventual production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can achieve the long-term vision of having no tailpipe emissions, as well as eliminating the dependence of the transportation sector on dwindling supplies of petroleum for its energy. Before FCEVs can be introduced in large numbers, a hydrogen-fueling infrastructure is needed. This report describes an early proof-of-concept for a distributed hydrogen fueling option in which renewably generated, high-pressure hydrogen is dispensed at an FCEV owner's home. In an earlier report we described the design and initial characterization of a solar photovoltaic (PV) powered electrolyzer/storage/dispensing (ESD) system that was a proof-of-concept for a single FCEV home fueling system. In the present report we determined the efficiency and other operational characteristics of that PV-ESD system during testing over a 109-day period at the GM Proving Ground in Milford, MI, at a hydrogen output pressure of approximately 2000 psi (13.8 MPa). The high pressure was achieved without any mechanical compression via electrolysis. Over the study period the photovoltaic solar to electrical efficiency averaged 13.7%, the electrolyzer efficiency averaged 59%, and the system solar to hydrogen efficiency averaged 8.2% based on the hydrogen lower heating value. A well-documented model used to evaluate solar photovoltaic power systems was used to calculate the maximum power point values of the voltage, current, and power of our PV system in order to derive the coupling factor between the PV and ESD systems and to determine its behavior over the range of environmental conditions experienced during the study. The average coupling factor was near unity, indicating that the two systems remained coupled in an optimal fashion. Also, the system operated well over a wide range of meteorological conditions, and in particular it responded quickly to instantaneous changes in the solar irradiance (caused by clouds) with negligible effect on the overall efficiency. During the study up to 0.67 kg of high-pressure hydrogen was generated on a sunny day for fueling FCEV. Future generations of high-pressure electrolyzers, properly combined with solar PV systems, can offer a compact, efficient, and environmentally acceptable system for FCEV home fueling. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

A reaction model is built that separates hydrogen surface sorption and interior diffusion during the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process. For the hydrogenation process, the hydrogen surface adsorption is much faster than the hydrogen diffusion, resulting in high hydrogen concentration buildup at the surface at a relatively low temperature. With increasing temperature, the hydrogen diffusion time decreases more rapidly than the hydrogen surface adsorption time. This leads to a relatively low-gradient diffusion field in the nanoblade during most time of the hydrogenation process, and no shell-core structure with a finite hydride layer is observed. However, for the dehydrogenation process, when hydrogen molecules are released at the surface, a hydride core is formed inside the nanoblade and the interface recedes gradually. The receding rate of the hydride core is determined by the hydrogen molecule release rate. In a two-dimensional simulation with decorated vanadium catalyst islands on the surface, isolated interior hydride islands are sometimes observed before the hydride core entirely fades away. The hydride core boundary is sharper at lower temperature when the surface reaction rate is high relative to the interior diffusion rate. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In the case of Spain, in 2009, it represents the 26.9% of installed power and 20.1% of energy production. Wind energy has the most important contribution of this production. Wind generators are greatly affected by the restrictive operating rules of electricity markets because, as wind is naturally variable, wind generators may have serious difficulties on submitting accurate generation schedules on a day ahead basis, and on complying with scheduled obligations. Weather forecast systems have errors in their predictions depending on wind speed. Thus, if wind energy becomes an important actor in the energy production system, these fluctuations could compromise grid stability. In this study technical and economical viability of a large scale compensation system based on hydrogen is investigated, combining wind energy production with a biomass gasification system. Combination of two systems has synergies that improve final results.

Mechano-chemical treatment facilitates formation of a hexagonal solid solution h-Li(BH4)1-xBrx whereas heating at elevated temperatures, i.e. T &gt; 112 °C appears to allow full solubility in the system LiBH4-LiBr. The first step in the anion substitution process may be dissolution of small amounts of LiBH 4 in α-LiBr deduced from observation of a hexagonal solid solution with unit cell volume similar to β-LiBr for a hand-mixed sample. The solid solution, Li(BH4)1-xBrx, is isostructural to the hexagonal high temperature polymorph of LiBH4. This solid solution melts at a significantly higher temperature depending on the composition as compared to h-LiBH4.

It is found that an Avrami-Erofeyev type model, normally used in solid-gas systems, can be modified for this two-step reaction to describe the measured kinetics of hydrogen release and the observed double peaks in release rates. The kinetic model indicates that temperatures in excess of 200 °C are needed for complete conversion (release of 2.35 H2-equivalents) in a reasonably compact flow reactor with &lt;20 s AB/IL residence time. A non-isothermal, plug flow reactor model indicates that heat transfer to ethylene glycol at 80 °C alone is not sufficient to control the peak temperature to &lt;250 °C in the exothermic decomposition reaction. The peak temperature, however, can be controlled by partial recycling of the spent AB/IL mixture. The reactor can also be operated adiabatically to obtain complete conversion while limiting the peak temperature through recycle. In a flow reactor where the feed stream is heated by mixing with the recycle stream there is a minimum recycle ratio for complete conversion. This minimum recycle ratio is a function of the reactor outlet temperature, which is determined by heat transfer. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The idea is to combine the high specific energy of the battery component together with the high specific power of the capacitor component within one system. We realized laboratory scale electrochemical cells based on a capacitor material (activated carbon) and two battery materials (LiMn2O4 and Li 4Ti5O12). We investigate hybrid systems following a serial and a parallel approach with two different mass ratios of battery materials over activated carbon. The investigated systems are compared in terms of Ragone plot and pulse performance. The results clearly show that the parallel hybridization of electrochemical capacitors and lithium-ion batteries is superior to the serial approach. Parallel hybrids provide both, high specific energy and power, and they outperform both the battery and the capacitor for pulsed applications. By contrast the serial hybrid can slightly increase the specific energy with respect to the capacitor but the specific power is comparable to the power of the battery, and it does not provide any benefit with pulsed applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The reuse of PHEV/EV propulsion batteries in second use applications following the end of their automotive service life may have the potential to offset the high initial cost of these batteries today. Accurately assessing the value of such a strategy is exceedingly complex and entails many uncertainties. This paper takes a first step toward such an assessment by estimating the impact of battery second use on the initial cost of PHEV/EV batteries to automotive consumers and exploring the potential for grid-based energy storage applications to serve as a market for used PHEV/EV batteries. It is found that although battery second use is not expected to significantly affect today's PHEV/EV prices, it has the potential to become a common component of future automotive battery life cycles and potentially to transform markets in need of cost-effective energy storage. Based on these findings, the authors advise further investigation focused on forecasting long-term battery degradation and analyzing second-use applications in more detail. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An important facet of this challenge is the development of new materials with improved electronic and photonic properties. Nano-scale metrology will be important in developing these materials, and optical methods have many advantages over electrons or proximal probes. To surpass the diffraction limit, near-field methods can be used. Alternatively, the concept of imaging in a multi-dimensional space is employed, where, in addition to spatial dimensions, the added dimensions of energy and time allow to distinguish objects which are closely spaced, and in effect increase the achievable resolution of optical microscopy towards the molecular level. We have employed these methods towards the study of materials relevant to renewable energy processes. Specifically, we image the position and orientation of single carbohydrate binding modules and visualize their interaction with cellulose with ∼10nm resolution, an important step in identifying the molecular underpinnings of bio-processing and the development of low-cost alternative fuels, and describe our current work implementing these concepts towards characterizing the ultrafast carrier dynamics (∼100fs) in a new class of nano-structured solar cells, predicted to have theoretical efficiencies exceeding 60%, using femtosecond laser spectroscopy. © 2011 SPIE.","Cellulose; DOPI; IBSC; PALM; Quantum Dots; Single Molecule Imaging; Solar Cells","DOPI; IBSC; PALM; Quantum Dot; Single-molecule imaging; Alternative fuels; Carbohydrates; Cellulose; Diffraction; Laser spectroscopy; Optical microscopy; Optical waveguides; Solar cells; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81455135201

Furthermore the quality and quantity of some crops products, such as grape, is improved under a controlled amount of water stress. The latter is related, on a side to actual evapotranspiration (ET) through water demand, on the other side to plant water content through leaf water potential. Residual energy balance approaches based on remote sensing allow to estimate the spatial distribution of daily actual ET at plant scale, representing an useful tool to detect its spatial variability across different cultivars and even within each parcel. Moreover, the connection between actual ET and leaf water potential is still not well assessed, especially under water stress conditions, even if farmers use leaf water potential to plan irrigation. However residual energy balance methods are based on the hypothesis that storage terms are negligible, at least during the remote sensor overpass. Indeed, energy balance approaches estimate daily actual ET from the instantaneous value at the overpass time using a daily integration method. The paper first verifies this latter assumption using field data acquired by a flux tower on a whole phenological period. Then, the actual ET values measured by eddy covariance tower were analyzed together with water potential measured using a Scholander chamber; the analysis highlights that, under water stress conditions, daily actual ET is inversely linearly related with water potential. These results suggest the possibility to use remote sensing-based ET as support for irrigation management at plot scale. © 2011 SPIE.","Actual evapotranspiration; Plant water potential; Surface energy balance","Actual evapotranspiration; Agricultural water; Eddy covariance towers; Field data; Instantaneous value; Integration method; Irrigation management; Leaf water potential; Management practices; Plant water content; Plant water potential; Remote sensors; Residual energy; Semi-arid environments; Spatial variability; Under water; Water consumption; Water demand; Water potential; Water stress; Ecosystems; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Irrigation; Overpasses; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Surface chemistry; Towers; Water management; Water supply; Water content",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80455135121

The implemented sorter is able to sort one data record every two clock periods. This throughput does not depend on the capacity of the sorter (defined as number of storage cells in the sorter). The mean latency (expressed in sorting cycles - each equal to two clock periods) when sorting the stream of data is equal to the capacity of the sorter. Due to efficient use of FPGA resources (e.g. data are stored mainly in internal block RAMs), the complexity of the sorter is proportional to the logarithm of sorter capacity. Only the required RAM size is linearly proportional to the sorter capacity.

The reversible hydrogen storage of 2LiBH4 + MgF2 was achieved under a back pressure of 5 bar at 450 °C.

Herein the isobaric constraint is relaxed by solving the Darcy equation for computing the pressure drop in the bed, the quasi-static approximation is relaxed by introducing the Langmuir adsorption kinetics, and the 2-D refueling results are compared with the 1-D quasi-static isobaric refueling results. In spite of the significant differences in formulation, the two results compare well with each other. The 2-D refueling results show that the pressure transients equilibrate quickly and a nearly steady pressure profile gets established in the bed. This observation justifies the isobaric approximation used earlier. The Langmuir kinetics used here has a desorption rate constant which could vary depending on the diffusional resistance at adsorbent particle level. A sensitivity analysis of this parameter shows that the refueling rate varies negligibly while this parameter is varied over many orders of magnitude. This observation shows that as long as the pellets are small enough, refueling is controlled by macroscopic processes like simultaneous cooling/adsorption in the bed and the movement of the adsorption front out of the bed, rather than the molecular processes like sorption at an adsorbent site or diffusion through the adsorbent lattice. This observation justifies the quasi-static approximation used earlier. The above two approximations offer significant computational advantage to the design and optimization of cryo-adsorber beds with complex geometry. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Regeneration of spent Al by direct hydrogenation is impractical due to the extremely high hydrogen equilibrium pressure required (∼7000 bar). This paper examines the off-board regeneration of alane using a three-step organometallic process. In the first step, a relatively stable adduct of a tertiary amine and alane is formed from elemental aluminum and hydrogen gas under moderate conditions of temperature and pressure. The second step involves transamination of the adduct by a second tertiary amine to form a secondary tertiary amine-alane adduct that is less stable than the first adduct. This secondary amine alane adduct is thermally decomposed in the final step to yield alane and the secondary amine for reuse in the process. All reagents, except aluminum and hydrogen, are recovered and recycled. Two process flowsheets have been constructed, and energy consumption in each step of the regeneration process has been calculated. Additionally, total energy requirements across the entire chain of production, delivery, storage, recovery, and regeneration has been evaluated to determine the overall well-to-tank efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. In one flowsheet, the well-to-tank efficiency is ∼24.2% which improves to ∼42.1% if waste heat is freely available from industrial sources. The estimated greenhouse gas emissions are 31.6 kg CO2 (eq) per kg H2 delivered to the vehicle and reduce to 20.6 kg/kg-H2 if free waste heat is readily available. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The initial discharge capacity was observed to depend on Mg/Ni atomic ratio rather than Ti/Mg atomic ratio in alloys. As the Ti/Mg atomic ratio increased the alloy charge transfer resistances decreased probably due to the partial selective dissolution of the surface Ti/Ti-oxides and thus the limited enrichment of the surface by the electro-catalytic Ni. The average hydrogen diffusion coefficients in all the Ti-including alloys were higher than that in MgNi alloy.

Remarkable hydrogen storage reversibility of LiBH4-MH2 composites is confirmed under moderate conditions: 400 °C and 6.0 MPa of hydrogen pressure for 4 h without catalyst. The LiBH4-LaH2 composite exhibits improved hydrogen desorption performance compared with LiBH4-CeH2 composite, but the hydrogen storage reversibility is inferior. Notably, the LiBH4-CeH2 nanocomposite produced by in situ formation of CeH2 from Ce(BH4)3-LiH displays excellent hydrogen storage properties. The addition of ZrCl4 as a catalyst improves dehydriding kinetics. The mechanism underlying the enhancement in the LiBH4-MH2 composites is also discussed. Our study is the first work about reversible hydrogen storage in LiBH4-LaH 2. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The mixture as-deposited has a rough surface with many pores. After wet selectively etching to remove SiO2, the mixture turns into Pd nanoparticles with a size of ∼ 30 nm on an interlayer with oxygen, as indicated by SEM, EDX, and SIMS methods. A careful study of the Pd-mixture on a metal-semiconductor-metal type of hydrogen sensor provides significant information on the roles of oxygen and the interlayer. Experimental results reveal that hydrogen atoms trapped inside the mixture as-deposited cannot contribute to changes in barrier height as an applied voltage is not large enough. Improved sensing properties such as hydrogen dissociation rate, diffusion rate, and storage capability were obtained when Pd nanoparticles were formed by selectively etching the mixture. The situation that hydrogen atoms were blocked and disturbed by oxygen will exist no more. Uniform sensing responses of higher than 105 (defined as (JH2-JN2)/JN2, JH2 and J N2 are current densities measured in H2/N2 and N2 ambiences, respectively), voltage shifts of larger than 20 V were obtained at 2.13 ppm H2/N2. In addition, hydrogen transport through grain boundaries of Pd nanoparticles is much faster than diffusion through a Pd-mixture layer. A much shorter response time was obtained from the sensors with the Pd-mixture wet etched. Furthermore, stable and reliable sensing characteristics were also expected. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the energetics and electronic structures of Mg3MNi2 (M = Al, Ti, Mn) compounds are systematically investigated. The optimized structural parameters including lattice constants and internal atomic positions are close to experimental data determined from X-ray powder diffraction. The calculated results of formation enthalpy ΔHform show that the stabilities of cubic Mg3MNi2 (M = Al, Ti, Mn) compound, compared with hexagonal Mg2Ni, increase in the order of Mg3MnNi 2, Mg2Ni, Mg3TiNi2 and Mg 3AlNi2, whereas the stabilities of their saturated Mg 3MNi2H3 (M = Al, Ti, Mn) hydrides, compared with monoclinic Mg2NiH4, decrease in the order of Mg 2NiH4, Mg3AlNi2H3, Mg3TiNi2H3 and Mg3MnNi 2H3. Further calculations of hydrogen desorption enthalpy ΔHdes indicate that these cubic Mg3MNi2 (M = Al, Ti, Mn) compounds possess promising dehydrogenation properties for their relatively lower ΔHdes values. Among of them, the dehydrogenation ability of Mg3TiNi2 is the most pronounced. Analysis of electronic structures suggests that the strong covalent bonding interactions between Ni and M within cubic Mg3MNi2 (M = Al, Ti, Mn) are dominant and directly control the structural stabilities of these compounds. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, the lack of efficient onboard hydrogen storage technology is becoming one of great obstacles impeding their industrial applications. Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) has been attracting a great deal of attention as a hydrogen storage material with high gravimetric hydrogen capacity. This manuscript about LiBH4 includes the synthesis, hydrolysis, structure, dynamics, intermediate compound, and the de/rehydrogenation properties improvement of LiBH4. LiBH4 can be synthesized by several methods, for example, direct synthesis from elements. In the hydrolysis of LiBH4 with the liberation of hydrogen gas, the byproduct will be different under different conditions. Structurally, LiBH4 has four different phases in experiment: Pnma, P6 3mc, Ama2 and Fm-3m. Dynamically, the high temperature (HT) phase of LiBH4 is a lithium fast-ion conductor. In the hydrogen desorption reaction of LiBH4, Li2B12H12 among the possible intermediate compounds is studied the most. Several methods have been proposed to improve the de/rehydrogenation properties of LiBH4. The first method is ""destabilization"" of the LiBH4. The second one is the use of catalyst. The third one is nanoscaffolding incorporation. The de/rehydrogenation properties of LiBH4 have been changed considerably through the great efforts of researchers in recent years. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Fuel cells are one such integral part of Renewable Energy Sources based clean energy supply; that they operate with hydrogen as fuel and water with heat as process waste. Due to the electrochemical reaction, fuel cell has the power quality of delivering low voltage with high current capability. Here an attempt is made to develop a power conditioner with a series of conversion to get a 220 V sinusoidal AC, 50 Hz single phase voltage of low distortion and fast dynamic regulation to cater load variations. A novel Polyphase Boost DC-to-DC switching converter based on parallel connection of 8 identical converters with current mode control is devised to have minimum reflected ripple current and voltage injected to fuel cell input. A full bridge converter with high frequency transformer isolation, step-up the DC voltage level from the low voltage fuel cell along with poly phase boost converter, deliver required DC to the PWM inverter, which generate AC utility power output. Recent trend of Ultra-capacitor based transient energy storage and retrieval system, to cater for the sluggish behavior of fuel cell, for load transients is incorporated. DSP and FPGA based digital real time controllers are used to realize the gating of MOSFETs and IGBTs used in the power conditioner.

The storage systems are gaseous 350 bar hydrogen, gaseous 700 bar hydrogen, Cold Gas at 500 bar and 200 K, Cryo-Compressed Liquid Hydrogen (CcH2) at 275 bar and 30 K, and an experimental adsorbent material (MOF 177) -based storage system at 250 bar and 100 K. Each storage technology is examined with several hydrogen production options and a variety of possible hydrogen delivery methods. Other variables, including hydrogen vehicle market penetration, are also examined. The 350 bar approach is relatively cost-effective and energy-efficient, but its volumetric efficiency is too low for it to be a practical vehicle storage system for the long term. The MOF 177 system requires liquid hydrogen refueling, which adds considerable cost, energy use, and GHG emissions while having lower volumetric efficiency than the CcH2 system. The other three storage technologies represent a set of trade-offs relative to their attractiveness. Only the CcH2 system meets the critical Department of Energy (DOE) 2015 volumetric efficiency target, and none meet the DOE's ultimate volumetric efficiency target. For these three systems to achieve a 480-km (300-mi) range, they would require a volume of at least 105-175 L in a mid-size FCV. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation properties of NaAlH4 were significantly enhanced by mechanically milling with 3 mol% NbF5. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicate that the ball-milled NaAlH 4-0.03NbF5 sample lowered the completion temperature for the first two steps dehydrogenation by 71 °C compared to the pristine NaAlH4 sample. Isothermal hydrogen sorption measurements also revealed a significant enhancement in terms of the sorption rate and capacity, in particular, at reduced operation temperatures. The apparent activation energy for the first-step and the second-step dehydrogenation of the NaAlH 4-0.03NbF5 sample is estimated to be 88.2 kJ/mol and 102.9 kJ/mol, respectively, by using Kissinger's approach, which is much lower than for pristine NaAlH4, indicating the reduced kinetic barrier. The rehydrogenation kinetics of NaAlH4 was also improved with 3 mol% NbF5 doping, absorbing ∼1.7 wt% hydrogen at 150 °C for 2 h under ∼5.5 MPa hydrogen pressure. In contrast, no hydrogen was absorbed by the pristine NaAlH4 sample under the same conditions. The formation of Na3AlH6 was detected by X-ray diffraction on the rehydrogenated NaAlH4-0.03NbF5 sample. Furthermore, the structural changes in the NbF5-doped NaAlH4 sample after ball milling and the hydrogen sorption were carefully examined, and the active species and mechanism of catalysis in NbF5-doped NaAlH4 are discussed. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Additionally, a single plateau is observed in the pressure-composition isotherm where MgH2 and Mg2NiH4 form and decompose simultaneously during the absorption/desorption process. The increase in absorption plateau pressure to 100 kPa suggests a decrease in the free energy by as much as 15 kJ/mol resulting from either a decrease in enthalpy or an increase in entropy of reaction between the hydride and metallic phases. The improved thermodynamics are discussed in terms of the formation of a new equilibrium metallic phase, Mg 6(Ni,Pd). The phase alters the thermodynamics of the hydriding reaction, allowing both MgH2 and Mg2NiH4 to form cooperatively in a single reaction. This method for reducing the free energy of the hydriding reaction is promising, and may prove useful in a variety of other metal-hydride hydrogen-storage systems. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The comparative analysis was also performed integrating the two storage systems in a hydrogen fuel cell power train for moped applications. The propulsion system comprised a fuel cell generator based on a 2.5 kW polymeric electrolyte membrane (PEM) stack, fuelled with compressed hydrogen, an electric drive of 1.8 kW as nominal power, of the same typology of that installed on commercial electric scooters (brushless electric machine and controlled bidirectional inverter). The power train was characterized making use of a test bench able to simulate the vehicle behaviour and road characteristics on driving cycles with different acceleration/deceleration rates and lengths. The power flows between fuel cell system, electric energy storage system and electric drive during the different cycles were analyzed, evidencing the effect of high battery currents on the vehicle driving range. The use of Li batteries in the fuel cell power train, adopting a range extender configuration, determined a hydrogen consumption lower than the correspondent Pb battery/fuel cell hybrid vehicle, with a major flexibility in the power management. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen; Lithium battery; PEM fuel cells; Power management","Acceleration/deceleration; Acid batteries; Bidirectional inverter; Brushless electric machines; Cell power; Charging/discharging; Comparative analysis; Driving cycle; Driving range; Dynamic behaviours; Electric energies; Electric scooters; Fuel cell generators; Fuel cell system; Hybrid vehicles; Li batteries; PEM fuel cell; Polymer battery; Polymeric electrolytes; Power flows; Power managements; Propulsion system; Road vehicles; Storage systems; Test benches; Electric drives; Electric machinery; Electric power measurement; Energy management; Fuel cells; Highway administration; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Lead; Lithium; Polymers; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052034091

A scaled-down version of the hybrid system was assembled and tested in a controlled laboratory environment using a controllable resistive load. The control loops were operating in an in-house developed embedded system. The software is designed for building generic control applications, and the source code has been released as open source and made available on the internet. The hybrid drivetrain supplied the required 50 kW peak power in a typical forklift work cycle consisting of both loaded and unloaded driving, and lifting of a 2.4 tonne load. Load variations seen by the fuel cell were a fraction of the total current drawn by the forklift, with the average fuel cell power being 55% of nominal rating. A simple fuel cell hybrid model was also developed to further study the effects of energy storage dimensioning. Simulation results indicate that while a battery alone significantly reduces the load variations of the fuel cell, an ultracapacitor reduces them even further. Furthermore, a relatively small ultracapacitor is enough to achieve most of the potential benefit. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Drivetrain; Experimental; Forklift; Hybrid; Modelling; PEMFC","Drivetrain; Experimental; Forklift; Hybrid; Modelling; Capacitors; Hybrid systems; Land vehicle propulsion; Materials handling equipment; Open systems; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955481649

The algorithm includes modules for extracting text, photo, and strong edge/line regions. Firstly, a text detection module which is based on wavelet analysis and Run Length Encoding (RLE) technique is employed. Local and global energy maps in high frequency bands of the wavelet domain are generated and used as initial text maps. Further analysis using RLE yields a final text map. The second module is developed to detect image/photo and pictorial regions in the input document. A block-based classifier using basis vector projections is employed to identify photo candidate regions. Then, a final photo map is obtained by applying probabilistic model based on Markov random field (MRF) based maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimization with iterated conditional mode (ICM). The final module detects lines and strong edges using Hough transform and edge-linkages analysis, respectively. The text, photo, and strong edge/line maps are combined to generate a page layout classification of the scanned target document. Experimental results and objective evaluation show that the proposed technique has a very effective performance on variety of simple and complex scanned document types obtained from MediaTeam Oulu document database. The proposed page layout classifier can be used in systems for efficient document storage, content based document retrieval, optical character recognition, mobile phone imagery, and augmented reality. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","edge linkages; Hough transform; Markov random field (MRF); page classification; projection vectors; run length encoding (RLE); wavelet transform","edge linkages; Markov random field; page classification; Projection vectors; Run-length encoding; Augmented reality; Cellular telephone systems; Copying; Encoding (symbols); Frequency bands; Hough transforms; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Maps; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Structural frames; Telecommunication equipment; Text processing; Virtual reality; Wavelet analysis; Information retrieval systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054954602

This scheme is a hybrid method that combines the high compression ratio of Vector Quantization (VQ) with the good energy-compaction property of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

The beamline parameters (position of the mirror, ray of curvature, slit aperture, reflecting angle, etc.) have been optimized by defining and improving a figure of merit. This optimization allows for room constraints (distances among elements), mechanical constraints (minimum curvature radii available) and optical constraints.

Bmad has been used to simulate the storage ring CESR for many years, and to design and analyze the proposed Cornell Energy Recovery Linac. Work is ongoing to expand Bmad in a number of directions. In particular, the ability to be able to do a combined simulation of accelerated charged-particle beams and the x-ray beams they create is being developed. Ultimately a complete framework for simulations from the gun cathode (including space-charge) to x-ray generation, to x-ray tracking through to the experimental end-stations is envisioned. The exibility of Bmad is such that multiple propagation algorithms can be accommodated with the user selecting the appropriate algorithm for each individual element. To this end, the integration of Bmad with the SHADOW tracking code is in development. © 2011 SPIE.","Accelerator; Bmad; Charged-particle; Photon; SHADOW; Simulation; Tracking; X-ray","Accelerator; Bmad; Combined simulation; Cornell University; Energy recovery linac; Object-oriented design; Open Source Software; Open sources; Propagation algorithm; SHADOW; Simulation; Software libraries; Space charges; X ray beam; X-ray generation; Algorithms; Charged particles; Computational methods; Open systems; Optics; X rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054065748

Coatings, composites and polymeric structures used in windows, roof and wall coatings, energy storage, insulation and other components in energy efficient buildings will increasingly involve nanostructure, as will solar cells. Nanostructures have the potential to revolutionize thermoelectric power and may one day provide efficient refrigerant free cooling. Nanomaterials enable optimization of optical, opto-electrical and thermal responses to this urgent task. Optical harmonization of material responses to environmental energy flows involves (i) large changes in spectral response over limited wavelength bands (ii) tailoring to environmental dynamics. The latter includes engineering angle of incidence dependencies and switchable (or chromogenic) responses. Nanomaterials can be made at sufficient scale and low enough cost to be both economic and to have a high impact on a short time scale. Issues to be addressed include human safety and property changes induced during manufacture, handling and outdoor use. Unexpected bonuses have arisen in this work, for example the savings and environmental benefits of cool roofs extend beyond the more obvious benefit of reduced heat flows from the roof into the building. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","angular selectivity; chromogenics; cool roofs; energy efficiency; nano-coatings; paints; spectral selectivity; windows","Angle of Incidence; Angular selectivity; Cool roofs; Energy efficient building; Environmental benefits; Environmental dynamics; Environmental energy; Heat flows; High impact; Human safety; Material response; Nano-coatings; Polymeric structures; Property changes; Renewable energies; Short time scale; Spectral response; Spectral selectivity; Switchable; Thermal response; Wavelength band; Coatings; Nanophotonics; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Roofs; Solar energy; Thin films; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053956805

In this paper, electrochemical properties of one of the silane-based electrolytes, tri(ethylene glycol)-substituted trimethylsilane (1NM3)-lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) was studied using LiMn2O4 as cathode and MAG graphite as anode. When combined with LiBOB as lithium salt, the 1NM3-LiBOB electrolyte can provide solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation due to the reductive decomposition of LiBOB at first charging cycle. Compared to the electrolyte used in the conventional lithium-ion batteries, 1NM3-LiBOB electrolyte showed compatible battery performance in LiMn2O4/MAG chemistry. The AC impedance measurement indicates that the activation energy (Ea) obtained from the charge transfer impedance for 1NM3-LiBOB was higher than that of the state-of-the-art electrolyte. Due to its low conductivity, the rate capability of 1NM3-LiBOB electrolyte needs to be improved. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The OCP change with the storage time reflected state-of-charge (SOC), which depended on both the carbon material and the storage temperature. Higher specific surface area of the material and higher storage temperature lead to higher self-discharging rate. The activation energy for self-discharging was estimated from the temperature dependence of the self-discharging rate. Although small difference was observed among the materials, the value of the activation energy suggests that the self-discharging reaction at each electrode is controlled by a diffusion process. Changes in the interfacial resistance with the storage time reflected the growth of so-called Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) at carbon surface. The rate of SEI formation at lower temperature does not depend on the carbon material, but at higher storage temperature the rate on spherical graphite was much higher than those on the other carbon materials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Variable temperature dielectric measurements, in the 20-80°C range, of both DNA-TiO2 and DNA-BaTiO3 films, revealed that the ceramic additive stabilizes DNA against large temperature-dependent variations in both ε and the dielectric loss factor tan δ. The bulk resistivity of the DNA-Ceramic hybrid films, in the case of both TiO2 and BaTiO3 additives in DNA, was measured to be two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of the control DNA films, indicating their potential for utilization as insulating dielectrics in capacitor applications. As a part of a baseline study, results based on a comparison of the temperature-dependent dielectric behavior of DNA and DNA-CTMA complex films as well as their frequency-dependent polarization behavior, are also discussed. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","bio-dielectrics; biopolymer; dielectric constant; DNA; DNA-Ceramic hybrid; DNA-CTMA; tan δ","bio-dielectrics; Bulk resistivity; Ceramic additives; Complex films; Dielectric behavior; Dielectric characterization; Dielectric constants; Dielectric loss factors; Dielectric measurements; DNA films; DNA solutions; DNA-Ceramic hybrid; DNA-CTMA; Energy storage applications; Frequency ranges; Frequency-dependent; High dielectric constants; Hybrid film; Polarization behavior; Stable suspensions; Temperature dependent; Three orders of magnitude; TiO; Variable temperature; Additives; Barium compounds; Biopolymers; Ceramic materials; Characterization; Dielectric losses; Dielectric materials; Energy storage; Oxide minerals; Suspensions (fluids); Titanium dioxide; DNA",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053513388

Commercially available polymer, poly lactic acid (PLA), was used in our studies. PLA is a well know biodegradable polymer naturally obtained from corn. PLA was received as a solid resin in pellet form and dissolved in 1:3 acetone/chloroform solutions, to achieve the proper electrospinning kinematic viscosity. Once in the liquid phase, the material was mixed with commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at varying concentrations and dispersed by severe sonication. The mixtures was electrospun at room temperature using a home built electrospinning apparatus capable of depositing randomly oriented fiber mats or oriented fibers onto different substrates, ranging from oxidized silicon wafers, alumina squares or glass microscope slides. The fibers diameters and lengths are statistically distributed following a log-normal distribution and the mean and dispersion are controlled by spinning parameters. Once the fibers were electrospun, they were compositionally, morphologically and structurally characterized by thermal and gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA), rheology, imaging using a focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (IBSEM), and IR /Raman methodologies. These studies can be used to explore PLA-MWCNTs mixtures suitability in applications such as super-capacitor technology, which would enable us to pursue further research in this field, while focusing on improving the electro spinning conditions so as to be able to better anticipate fiber morphology to generate a consistent regime of fibers. © 2011 SPIE.","Bio-degradable polymers; Electrospinning (ES); Energy storage and recovery systems; Hybrid super capacitors; Multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); Nanofibers; Poly lactic acid (PLA)","Different substrates; Electrospuns; Environmentally-friendly; Fiber mat; Fiber morphology; Glass microscope slides; Ion beam scanning; Liquid Phase; Log-normal distribution; Oxidized silicon wafers; Photo-induced; Poly lactic acid; Processing condition; Room temperature; Spinning parameters; Super capacitor; TGA/DTA; Thermal actuation; Alumina; Biodegradable polymers; Capacitors; Carbon; Fibers; Gravimetric analysis; Lactic acid; Mechanical engineering; Mechanics; Mixtures; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanofibers; Normal distribution; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Silicon wafers; Electrospinning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053487355

The light localization takes place due to appearance of spatial solitons which velocities depend on their intensities and location in the photonic crystal. This results in changing of velocities of sub-pulses which are not soliton and reflect or transmit through the nonlinear photonic crystal. We found out the formation of two types of solitons. One of them is appeared in separate layer. This soliton appear because of cubic nonlinear response. The second type of soliton spreads over some layers of the photonic crystal. This soliton is found out on the base of solving the eigenvalue function. We consider also the Anderson localization in photonic crystal with nonlinearity. The main result of this part of the investigation is a prevalence of nonlinear localization over the Anderson localization. The formation of soliton depends on input light intensity, duration of pulse and shape of elements from which the photonic crystal consists. In 2D case the soliton formation depends on focusing of laser beam and on presence of laser energy in neighbouring elements of the photonic crystal. These solitons move with slow velocity inside the elements of the photonic crystal. Under certain conditions the soliton can stop. This phenomenon can be used for data storage. The similar solitons can appear in many elements of the photonic crystal. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","localization; nonlinear photonic crystal; optical pulse; reflection; slow light; superluminal effect; transmission","Anderson localization; Cubic nonlinear response; Data storage; Eigenvalue function; Input light; Laser energies; Laser pulse propagation; Light localization; localization; Non-Linearity; Nonlinear localization; nonlinear photonic crystal; Nonlinear photonic crystals; Optical pulse; Photonic structure; Soliton formation; Spatial solitons; Superluminal effects; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Laser pulses; Light propagation; Light pulse generators; Photonic crystal fibers; Photonic crystals; Reflection; Slow light; Solitons; Transmissions; Crystal structure",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053481711

The cure kinetics, thermal behavior and mechanical property of carbon nanotubes/bismaleimide-o,o-diallyl bisphenol A resin (CNTs/BMI-BA) were studied. It was found that this kind of CNTs can be easily dispersed in high performance resin only with a slight stirring.

Only 5% (v) of steam should be enough to inhibit the complete reduction of the solids. Since steam is a product of the reduction reaction, small amounts of water present in the reactive atmosphere can slow down the reduction itself. To account for the effect of the steam pressure during the reduction stage of the steam-iron process, two approaches have been considered and the resulting models, i.e. 'competitive model' and 'inhibitive model' have been tested against experimental measurements. Both models are based on the known Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) theory. The 'competitive model', accounts for the discretization of groups of moles of iron oxide/iron reducing and oxidizing with their own reaction rates. By using the kinetic parameters obtained from independent reduction and oxidation processes, this model is not capable of predicting properly the behaviour of the solid subjected to successive reductive and oxidative cycles. On the contrary, the 'inhibitive model', which takes into account the hydrogen and water vapour partial pressures in a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type kinetic constant dependency, seems to be very appropriate to predict correctly the effect of the presence of water in the reducing atmosphere. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It was found that the lithium atom is adsorbed on this vacancy, with a binding energy much larger than the lithium cohesive energy. Then, the adsorption of hydrogen molecules around lithium atoms was studied. We found that at 300 K and atmospheric pressure, this system could store up to 6.2 wt.% hydrogen, with average adsorption energy of 0.19 eV per molecule. Thus, this material satisfies the gravimetric capacity requirements for technological applications. A complete desorption of hydrogen occurs at 750 K. However, a multilayer of this system would be required for practical reasons. Under atmospheric pressure and at 300 K, we found that a system made of multiple layers of this material is stable. The storage capacity remained at 6.2 wt.%, but all adsorbed molecules were dissociated. The average adsorption energy becomes 0.875 eV/H. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Consequently, the viability of a sustainable hydrogen economy greatly depends on the development of an efficient, cost-effective method of hydrogen production. One model for addressing this challenge is to deploy portable hydrogen generators for the home. The Princeton University Chapter of the International Association for Hydrogen Energy (IAHE-PU) has designed and created a generator that produces hydrogen through water electrolysis and optimizes cost effectiveness and portability while maximizing hydrogen output. For our proof-of-concept, the system utilizes simple household items with a Sharp ND130UJF 130W solar panel. In our design, Ni electrodes submerged in 8 M KOH solution in six glass containers were utilized to power an external circuit. Over 1 h, our system produced 8.61 L of hydrogen gas at an estimated cost of $8.58 per kilogram of hydrogen gas over the 25-year lifetime of the solar panel. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

A solid oxide fuel cell based mCHP system coupled with a hot water storage tank is analyzed. The energy profiles of single-family households in different European countries are evaluated. The range of Heat-to-Power Ratio for the SOFC-based mCHP System of 0.5-1.5 shows good agreement with the hot water, space heating and electricity demand during the warm seasons across Europe. This suggests that the fuel cell system should be sized according to the summer energy demand. The winter energy demand shows a Heat-to-Power Ratio which cannot be covered by the mCHP unit alone. To ensure that the mCHP system meets both the thermal and electrical energy demand over the entire year, an auxiliary boiler and a hot water storage tank need to be coupled with the mCHP unit. It is further noted that the size of the auxiliary boiler should match the larger winter space heating demand. In contrast, the hot water tank volume should be sized according to the warm season space heating requirement, when space heating is not required but electricity and hot water are still in demand. This maximizes the running time of the fuel cell, and thus the economic and environmental benefit of the system, without wasting produced heat. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Rigorous models involve several thousands of variables whereas reduced models we are interested in involve only several tens of variables. The models here presented reproduce the main dynamic behavior of rigorous models and experimental data found in the literature. Furthermore, the main tradeoffs arisen in process design are well described with these models, which is always an objective of optimal process design. In the first part of the work, a simplified lumped model is developed and validated by comparing the simulations outcome with numerical results and experimental measurements obtained from the literature for absorption and desorption individual processes. Our model is then used to simulate the process behavior using real parameters and constraints required by continuous recovery and compression systems such as those found in the metal treatment industry. The simulation results are used to improve the process performance by adjusting some key parameters of the system. These results are also used to perform a sensitivity analysis, i.e. evaluate the storage/compression system behavior when introducing variations to parameters such as operating conditions, reactor design, and material properties. Finally, we further reduce the model by considering that the inlet and outlet hydrogen flow is approximately constant. This particular specification is usually required by continuous processes in the metal treatment industry where hydrogen flow must remain constant. This requirement allows considering reaction rate as a constant. The constant reaction rate constraint allows integrating the ordinary differential equations; hence the system no longer has differential and algebraic equations but just algebraic equations. As a consequence of the simplification, the number of equations to be solved is reduced from over 15,000 to less than 50, maintaining an excellent match in the results. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It is discovered that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon increases from Ni-B nanoalloy-doping but much less than that of graphene. After surface functionalization, although the specific surface area and micropore volume of the doped activated carbon decrease significantly, a hydrogen storage capacity is still almost as same as that of the unfunctionalized larger surface one, while showing a large desorption hysteresis. We argue that the surface functionalization greatly enhances the spillover process on carbon based adsorbents, thus playing an essential role in hydrogen storage capacity improvement. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

A sequence of four decomposition steps was found by TPD measurements; they occur at 235, 315, 365 and 460 °C for p(H2) = 3 bar, with a clear T decrease with respect to pure LiBH4 and Mg(BH4)2. In the PCI experiments, the first two steps could not be resolved but appeared merged in a single process. The amounts of H2 release at each step and the ΔrH and ΔrS values derived from van't Hoff plots were analyzed and compared with known results for relevant possible reactions. A scheme of interpretation was then proposed for all four processes. In particular, a fraction of LiBH4 and Mg(BH4)2 would react together in the range of 300-350 °C according to 2LiBH 4 + Mg(BH4)2 → 2B + 2LiH + MgB2 + 7H2, thus explaining the quite large H2 yield therein observed. The first and fourth steps correspond to decompositions of pure remaining Mg(BH4)2 and LiBH4, respectively, and the third one to dehydrogenation of MgH2 produced in the first step. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This compound, however, shows poor hydrogen desorption kinetics. Much effort was devoted in the past to finding possible ways of enhancing hydrogen desorption rate from MgH2, which would bring this material closer to technical applications. One possible way is catalysis of hydrogen desorption. This paper investigates separate catalytic effects of Ni, Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 on the hydrogen desorption characteristics of MgH2. It was observed that the catalytic efficiency of Mg2NiH4 was considerably higher than that of pure Ni and non-hydrated intermetallic Mg2Ni. The Mg 2NiH4 phase has two low-temperature modifications below 508 K: un-twinned phase LT1 and micro-twinned phase LT2. LT1 was observed to have significantly higher catalytic efficiency than LT2. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Higher LaNi5 content could improve hydriding kinetics of Mg but not change hydrogen diffusion as the rate-controlling step, which was validated by characteristic reaction time tc. The rate-controlling step was hydrogen diffusion in the hydriding reaction of Mg-30 wt.% LaNi5 prepared by microwave sintering (MS) and hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS), and surface penetration was the rate-controlling step of sample prepared by mechanical milling (MM). Rising temperature and initial hydrogen pressure could accelerate the absorption rate. The rate-controlling step of Mg-30 wt.% LaNi5 remained hydrogen diffusion at temperatures ranging from 302 to 573 K, while that of Mg-50 wt.% LaNi5 changed from surface penetration to hydrogen diffusion with increasing initial hydrogen pressure ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 MPa.

This short communication presents a multi-objective design of a remote PV system coupled to battery and hydrogen storages systems simultaneously minimizing the total levelized cost and the occupied area, while fulfilling a constraint of consumer satisfaction. For this task, a multi-objective code based on particle swarm optimization has been used to find the best combination of different energy devices. Both short and mid terms based on forecasts assumptions have been investigated. An application for the site of La Nouvelle in the French overseas island of La Réunion is proposed. It points up a strong cost advantage by using Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer (HIT) rather than crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells for the short term. However, the discrimination between these two PV cell technologies is less obvious for the mid term: a strong constraint on the occupied area will promote HIT, whereas a strong constraint on the cost will promote c-Si. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Battery storage; Hydrogen storage; Particle swarm optimization; Photovoltaic; Remote consumer; Renewable energy","Battery storage; Particle swarm; Photovoltaic; Remote consumer; Renewable energy; Costs; Electric utilities; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic effects; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960557813

Here we show that separator deformation in response to mechanical stimuli that arise under normal operation and storage conditions, such as external stresses on the battery stack or electrode expansion associated with lithium insertion/deinsertion, leads to increased internal resistance and significant capacity fade. We find this mechanically induced capacity fade to be a result of viscoelastic creep in the electrochemically inactive separator which reduces ion transport via a pore closure mechanism. By applying compressive stress on the battery structure we are able to accelerate aging studies and identify this unexpected, but important and fundamental link between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, by making simple modifications to the electrode structure or separator properties, these effects can be mitigated, providing a pathway for improved battery performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; Capacity fade; Lithium-ion battery; Mechanical stress; Polymer separator; Power fade","Accelerate aging; Battery performance; Capacity fade; Electrochemical performance; Electrode structure; Emerging energy technologies; External stress; Internal resistance; Ion transports; Limiting factors; Lithium insertion; Lithium-ion battery; Loss-of-capacity; Mechanical stimulus; Mechanical stress; Normal operations; Pore closure; Power fade; Simple modifications; Storage condition; Viscoelastic creep; Creep; Electrochemical properties; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Mechanical properties; Stresses; Separators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960555040

The nano-porous Ni framework, derived from the selective dissolution of Cu from a Ni-Cu alloy, effectively promotes the electrochemical utilization of deposited Co(OH)2 even at a high loading amount condition. The great electronic and ionic conduction within the nano-structured electrode improves the energy storage performance of Co(OH)2 as compared to that for a conventional flat Ni substrate. In this work, the Co(OH)2 mass specific capacitance, evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), only slightly decreases from 2650 to 2470 F g-1 when the potential sweep rate is substantially increased from 5 to 200 mV s-1. The developed Ni(OH)2/NiOOH (from the nano-porous framework) incorporates with the deposited Co(OH)2 upon CV cycling; the mixed hydroxide shows a noticeably synergistic capacitance. Furthermore, the dissolution of Co(OH)2 in KOH electrolyte is greatly suppressed due to the incorporation of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH, consequently prolonging the electrode cycle life. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The as-prepared hollow CoS HNSs have an average edge length ca. 110 ± 27 nm and an outer shell of 16 ± 4 nm in thickness from 500 counts. The CoS HNSs are deposited onto transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates through a drop-dry process to prepare two types of supercapacitors (SCs); high rate and large per-area capacitance. The electrolyte used in this study is KOH(aq). The CoS HNSs (8 μg cm-2) electrodes exhibit excellent capacity properties, including high energy density (13.2 h kg -1), power density (17.5 kW kg-1), energy deliverable efficiency (81.3-85.3%), and stable cycle life (over 10,000 cycles) at a high discharge current density of 64.6 A g-1. With their fast charging and discharging rates (&lt;3 s), the CoS HNSs show characteristics of high-rate SCs.

They have been demonstrated to cause various health problems in humans, including immunosuppression and cancer. A class of mycotoxins, aflatoxins, has been studied extensively because they have caused many deaths particularly in developing countries. Chili pepper is also prone to aflatoxin contamination during harvesting, production and storage periods. Chemical methods to detect aflatoxins are quite accurate but expensive and destructive in nature. Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging are becoming increasingly important for rapid and nondestructive testing for the presence of such contaminants. We propose a compact machine vision system based on hyperspectral imaging and machine learning for detection of aflatoxin contaminated chili peppers. We used the difference images of consecutive spectral bands along with individual band energies to classify chili peppers into aflatoxin contaminated and uncontaminated classes. Both UV and halogen illumination sources were used in the experiments. The significant bands that provide better discrimination were selected based on their neural network connection weights. Higher classification rates were achieved with fewer numbers of spectral bands. This selection scheme was compared with an information-theoretic approach and it demonstrated robust performance with higher classification accuracy. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Aflatoxin Detection; Artificial Neural Network; Dimension Reduction; Feature Saliency; Feature Selection; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Vision; Noninvasive Testing","Artificial Neural Network; Dimension reduction; Feature saliency; Hyperspectral Imaging; Noninvasive testing; Agriculture; Chemical contamination; Computer vision; Contamination; Developing countries; Food safety; Information theory; Learning systems; Metabolites; Neural networks; Nondestructive examination; Aflatoxins",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052203091

Our first-principles calculations predict that this complex, Ti atoms embedded in double-vacancy graphene (Ti@DV), can hold up to eight H 2 per unit. The hydrogen molecules are not dissociated and are all stored in molecular form, so adsorption and desorption of hydrogen should be feasible. Furthermore, this type of structure is stable throughout the charging and discharging process.

The system consisted of a solar photovoltaic array connected to an electrolyzer which produced hydrogen as a means of energy storage. The hydrogen was used to produce electricity in a fuel cell that operated in parallel with a battery to meet dynamic power demand similar to that found in residential applications. The study demonstrated the technical feasibility of operating such a system under the simultaneous dynamics of solar input and load. Limitations of current fuel cell and electrolyzer designs, as they pertain to both power delivery and energy storage, were identified. The study also established the need to understand and address dynamic performance in the design and application of solar-hydrogen reversible fuel cell hybrid systems.

All alloys exhibit hyper-stoichiometric C14 main phase due to the formation of A-rich non-Laves secondary phases and the loss of Zr and Ti in the melt.

It is observed that the film deposited on the porous AAO template demonstrates a better hydrogen absorption in the H 2 pressure range 10-600 mbar with respect to the same film supported by the non-porous glass substrate. Moreover, the layer grown on the AAO, owing to its specific morphology inherited from the nano-porous substrate, has revealed its resistance toward stress accumulation caused by the lattice expansion, showing no buckle-to-crack network formation upon the hydrogen uptake.

Variability in electricity demand due to air conditioning of commercial buildings necessitates installation of on-site energy storage. Here, we propose a totalized hydrogen energy utilization system (THEUS) as an on-site energy storage system, present feasibility test results for this system with a metal hydride tank, and discuss the energy efficiency of the system. This system uses a water electrolyzer to store electricity energy via hydrogen at night and uses fuel cells to generate power during the day. The system also utilizes the cold heat of reaction heat during the hydrogen desorption process for air conditioning. The storage tank has a shell-like structure and tube heat exchangers and contains 50 kg of metal hydride. Experimental conditions were specifically designed to regulate the pressure and temperature range. Absorption and desorption of 5,400 NL of hydrogen was successfully attained when the absorption rate was 10 NL/min and desorption rate was 6.9 NL/min. A 24-h cycle experiment emulating hydrogen generation at night and power generation during the day revealed that the system achieved a ratio of recovered thermal energy to the entire reaction heat of the hydrogen storage system of 43.2% without heat loss. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

As a result, a large amount of CO2 is liberated into the atmosphere. The blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke oven gas (COG) from the ironmaking process can be used for H2 production in association with carbon capture and storage (CCS), thereby reducing CO2 emissions. In this study thermodynamic analyses are performed to evaluate the feasibility of H 2 production from BFG and COG. Through the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) of BFG, almost all CO contained in BFG can be converted for H2 production if the steam/CO (S/C) ratio is no less than unity and the temperature is at 200 °C, regardless of whether CO2 is captured or not. The maximum H2 production from WGSR is around 0.21 Nm 3 (Nm3 BFG)-1. Regarding H2 production from COG, a two-stage reaction of partial oxidation (POX) followed by WGSR is carried out. It is found the proper conditions for syngas formation from the POX of COG is at the oxygen/fuel (O/F) ratio of 0.5 and the temperature range of 1000-1750 °C where the maximum syngas yield is 2.83 mol (mol hydrocarbons)-1. When WGSR is subsequently applied, the maximum H2 production from the two-stage reaction can reach 0.83 Nm 3 (Nm3 COG)-1. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Several attempts are being made to enhance the ORR. Inspite of several attempts Pt in the vicinity of high surface area oxide catalysts seems to be the best choice although some alloy catalyst have shown good performance in half cell studies and single cell studies. We are investigating methods to improve the performance of PEM fuel cell especially in low air flow conditions which is the condition that will arise in surge power requirements. We have found that oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of Pt/C can be increased in the presence of cerium-zirconium oxides especially Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 (CZO) in the cathode catalyst layer. Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 was prepared by co-precipitation method and the formation is confirmed by the XRD results. An XPS study of Ce 3d emission spectra dominated by atomic multiplet effects in core level spectroscopy of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-Pt/C are studied from which the possible oxidation states of Ce on Ce 0.8Zr0.2O2-Pt/C surface are examined.

The hydrogenation- dehydrogenation cycles of Pd-decorated Mg nanoblades was investigated in situ by temperature programmed desorption (TPD). It shows that hydrogen starts desorption at about 340 K and peaks around 373 ± 10 K. If the dehydrogenation temperature is kept below 373 K then the cycling can be repeated up to more than 10 cycles with gradual degradation of H uptake capacity and desorption kinetics. At 373 K the hydrogen desorbs in less than 20 min.

We use first principle calculations to identify the hydrogen diffusion paths and barriers and diffusion rates in three different MgH2 structures: equilibrium rutile, rutile with ball-milling-induced deformation twins and fluorite polymorph. Hydrogen vacancy mediated mechanism was applied when hydrogen diffusion was studied. We observed that both hydrogen diffusion barriers in deformation twins and fluorite structure are lower compared to that in the equilibrium rutile. This is because the hydrogen diffusion is facilitated by new interstitial sites in the Mg lattice: a new hexahedral site formed by the reconstruction of Mg lattice at the twinning interface in the deformation twins and the octahedral sites in the fluorite structure. Furthermore, the hydrogen vacancy density effect on the diffusion barrier was estimated. The general trend is the higher the density of hydrogen vacancies, the lower the hydrogen diffusion barrier, the higher the diffusion rate. Our results demonstrate how the hydrogen kinetics is altered by controlling the structure of the hydrides. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The process is based on anhydrous NH3 thermal dissociation inside a small size reactor (30 cm3), filled by a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction is promoted by the presence of seven Pd coated tubular membranes about 203 mm long, with an outer diameter of 1.98 mm, which shift the NH3 decomposition towards the products by removing hydrogen from the reaction area. The system fluid-dynamics was implemented into a 2D and 3D geometrical model. Ammonia cracking reaction over the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was simulated using the Temkin-Pyzhev equation. Introductory 2D simulations were first carried out for a hypothetic system without membranes. Because of reactor axial symmetry, different operative pressures, temperatures and input flows were evaluated. These introductory results showed an excellent ammonia conversion at 550 °C and 0.2 MPa for an input flow of 1.1 mg/s, with a residual NH 3 of only a few ppm. 3D simulations were then carried out for the system with membranes. Hydrogen adsorption throughout the membranes has been modeled using the Sievert's law for the dissociative hydrogen flux. Several runs have been carried out at 1 MPa changing the temperature between 500 °C and 600 °C to point out the conditions for which the permeated hydrogen flux is the highest. With temperatures higher than 550 °C we obtained an almost complete ammonia conversion already before the membrane area. The working temperature of 550 °C resulted to be the most suitable for the reactor geometry. A good matching between membrane permeation and ammonia decomposition was obtained for an NH3 input flow rate of 2.8 mg/s. Ammonia reaction shift due to the presence of H2 permeable membranes in the reactor significantly fostered the dissociation: for the 550 °C case we obtained a conversion rate improvement of almost 18%. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Generally, the battery is employed for finishing this aim. The expense of the battery occupies a large part in the whole PV system. However, the constant variations of both photovoltaic panel power product and load power demand reduce the life of the battery. At the same time, for providing several large burst power demands generated by the motor based application startup, the sizing of battery should be enlarged. Both of them increase the cost of the PV system. Therefore, supercapacitor is integrated into this system. With a reasonable energy control strategy among the PV panel, supercapacitor and battery, the battery's life could be prolonged and its size can be reduced.

Recently, extensive efforts have been made to improve nanoparticle dispersion to enhance its performance using various surfactants, dendrimers and polyelectrolytes which can tune colloidal interactions. However, it is still challenging to establish a technology in which spatial organization of metal nanoparticles is finely controlled at varied length scales. Here we present that in situ sol-gel polymerization of metal precursors incorporated into self-assembling poly(amino acid) nanostructure would generate metal nanoparticles with regular spacing at the nanometer scale. This hypothesis was examined using poly(amino acid)s substituted with alkyl chains to form various morphologies from a spherical micelle to a bilayer structure. Platinum precursors (K2PtCl4) were mixed with alkyl-substituted poly(amino acid)s solution followed by reduction to activate sol-gel polymerization to form Pt particles. Specifically, alkyl-substituted poly(amino acid)s with DS of 5 % were assembled into a vesicle with an average diameter of 100 nm, and also presented Pt nanoparticles with diameter of 2 to 5 nm exclusively within a bilayer of the vesicle. Furthermore, the resulting Pt nanoparticles showed a significantly enhanced electro-catalytic activity as compared with Pt particles polymerized via bulk sol-gel polymerization. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that the size and spacing of metallic particle can be controlled using a self-assembling polymeric template.

Called CO2E™, GreenFire's technologies combine CO2 with geothermal resources to generate renewable, baseload power from pressure and heat, while creating more efficient use of the power grid. GreenFire's initial source of CO2 for technology development is an inexpensive, natural resource, yet financing the development of this potentially beneficial technology has proved challenging. For this discussion, GreenFire Energy will present its technology, the natural resource components, and the financing needs and challenges. CO2E™ captures heat and pressure by circulating either natural or anthropogenic CO2 through hot geologic formations, then returning it to the surface for power generation. The technology can be used to generate baseload power or to store energy to meet peak demand requirements. When used for energy storage, its projected response time to peak energy output is less than two minutes, which is far better than competing technologies. This is an extraordinarily flexible combination that, in effect, constitutes energy supply ""on demand"" for the grid. No other technology provides this range of capabilities. More importantly, the projected CO2E™ cost of production is the lowest of any scalable technology. CO2E™ is attractive because it makes geothermal power production and energy storage commercially viable over vast portions of the earth at costs lower than for existing technologies. If the technical issues are surmounted, CO2E™ will become the low-cost, high-volume supplier in the enormous electrical power market. CO2E™ has the potential to decrease the cost of geothermal power and greatly increase its output. This can revolutionize the entire electrical power market because it is modeled to have a lower production cost, can be used in many more locations, and generates power from both pressure and heat.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051908006

Life cycle analysis is a reasonable tool for keeping 'score' in the sustainability game, but it still has many challenges. Measuring the sustainability of bioenergy systems has two groups of challenges. First, the large scale production of bioenergy feedstocks by definition requires large land areas, which are by their nature highly variable in terms of biomass productivity, establishment inputs, collection and harvesting, and supply and storage systems, all of which are required for year round operation of a bioenergy production process. With these wide variations in biomass production and collection systems there are additional complications of limited data sets, and significant improvements on specific technical challenges, that both result in few analyses being conducted with the same biomass feedstock assumptions. Even for widely deployed biomass resources, such as the tens of millions of acres of plantation pines, oil seed crops, or corn stover, there is a limited understanding of how effectively these commercial systems can be extended to the less productive or marginal lands that must be used to avoid the competition with the food supply.

In this study, a one-dimensional modeling was carried-out to calculate the charge and discharge behaviors of VRLA battery used in HEVs. The model accounts for electrochemical reaction rates, charge conservation and mass transport. In order to validate the model, modeling results were compared with the experimental data in various conditions.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051906092

In this work, we used in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate the carbonation of representative olivine (forsterite) and serpentine (antigorite and lizardite) minerals. Experiments were conducted by circulating a stream of dry or wet scCO2 past a mineral overlayer deposited on the window of a high-pressure infrared flow cell. Little reaction was observed when the minerals were exposed to dry scCO2 for 24 hr. When water was added, a thin film of liquid-like water was observed on the mineral surface, and a carbonation reaction occurred.

According to our previous breakthrough - complete conversion of carbohydrate and water to hydrogen and CO2, we propose the use of carbohydrate (e.g., starch) as a high energy density hydrogen carrier with a gravimetric density of 14.8 H2 mass % and suggest sugar fuel cell vehicles. To produce starch without relying on living plants, we design a non-natural CO2 fixation pathway that can fix CO2 by using hydrogen or electricity and produce water insoluble starch. This pathway would be scalable because it involves neither membrane nor membrane protein. A combination of this chemical synthesis pathway with commercial solar cells would have overall solar energy-to-chemical energy efficiencies of more than 20% and decrease water consumption by more than 1000 fold as compared to those of natural plants. This artificial photosynthesis would solve key challenges, such as CO2 fixation, electricity storage, feed and food production, transportation fuel production, water conservation or maintaining an ecosystem for space travel.

The cost of RuO2 precursors limits these and other applications, which has prompted development of highly dispersed, nanoscale forms of the oxide that maximize the number of catalytically active reaction sites while minimizing weight loading. In order to prepare highly-active, 3D electrode architectures with low loadings of RuO2, we have developed a simple solution-based synthesis in which self-wired networks of RuO2 deposit onto porous, paper-like substrates including commercially available SiO2 filter papers (RuO2[SiO2]) or in-house fabricated carbon nanofoam papers (RuO2[nanofoam]). On SiO2 filter papers the RuO2 forms a contiguous, nanoskin of 2-3-nm RuO2 particles wrapped around the individual fibers composing the paper. The RuO2 network imparts high electronic conductivity and electrochemical activity to the otherwise insulating SiO2 paper at only 5 wt% RuO2.

One example related to energy storage is the use of porous membrane based enthalpy exchangers (with concentration storage) in air conditioning systems. For example, liquid desiccant (LD) can be concentrated during day time by solar thermal energy and stored for later use to absorb moisture (dehumidification) from the process air through a membrane based AIR/LD contactor. This can achieve independent humidity control and as high as 30% energy savings. However, liquid desiccant carryover has been a major obstacle in the application of existing LD dehumidification technologies to air conditioning due to the corrosion of ductwork over the time and the potential toxicity of LD aerosols or droplets introduced into the conditioned air. The use of porous membrane isolates the LD from contacting air, therefore, eliminating the potential of LD carryover. Usually, hydrophobic membrane is used, the hydrophobic material and proper pore morphologies can prevent LD from entering the membrane pores while allows water vapor transported across the membrane (see Figure 1b). The introduction of the membrane demands a more detailed understanding of the pore structure on transport.

Fuel cells are the representative electrochemical devices that can convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with high efficiency and low emission of pollutants. However, the commercialization of fuel cells is severely hampered by the sluggish oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, which demands the exclusive use of Pt-based catalysts. As Pt is expensive and scarce, extensive efforts have focused on improving the catalytic activity of Pt alloys to lower the Pt loading, and more attractively, exploring non-precious metal catalysts. In this context, our group have recently prepared and investigated a series of Mn-based oxide materials for catalyzing the electrochemical ORR. Manganese is featured with virtues of low cost, high abundance, environmental friendliness, and rich redox chemistry, rendering the Mn-based compounds versatile electrochemical properties. We have selectively synthesized MnO2, Mn2O3, MnOOH, and CoMn2O4 with controlled phases and shapes through facile solution-based soft chemistry routes. Our results showed that the electrocatalytic activities of manganese oxides depended strongly on their compositions, crystallographic structures, and morphologies. The nanostructured samples, having prominent advantages of high surface areas and enormous exposed catalytic sites, exhibited significantly higher activity than the counterpart bulk materials. Remarkably, Ni nanoparticles decorated α-MnO2 nanowires and large-aspect-ratio Mn2O3 nanowires could generate a specific ORR current comparable to the Pt/C catalysts and result in an apparent quasi 4-electron transfer per molecular oxygen in alkaline electrolyte.

In recent work we have developed nickel complexes containing diphosphine ligands with pendant bases as electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation and production. The development of these catalysts has been guided by an understanding of the contributions of both the first and second coordination spheres of these catalysts. Pendant bases incorporated in the second coordination sphere of the molecular catalysts for H2 production and oxidation serve as proton relays controlling the movement of protons between the metal and acids or bases in solution. Insights into additional roles played by the pendant bases during the catalytic cycles will be discussed.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051882716

By employing metal oxide nanostructures, it is possible to achieve Li-ion anodes that have significantly higher capacity than the state-of-the-art technology. However, because of the large volume expansion it is difficult to achieve stable cycling. We have demonstrated that thin film MoO3 nanoparticle electrodes (∼2 μm thick) have a stable reversible capacity of ∼630 mAh/g, at C/2 (charge/dicharge in 2 hours). By fabricating more conventional electrodes (∼35 μm thick) with conductive additive and binder, an improved reversible capacity of ∼1000 mAh/g is achieved but, unfortunately, the rate capability decreases. In order to achieve high-rate capability, we applied a thin Al2O3 atomic layer deposition coating to enable high volume expansion and prevent mechanical degradation. Recently we have focused on iron oxide nanostructures, as iron is an inexpensive and non-toxic element. Furthermore, we have synthesized binder-free, high-rate capability electrodes. The electrodes contain Fe3O4 nanorods as the active storage material and carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) as the conductive additive. The highest reversible capacity is obtained using 5 wt.% SWNTs, reaching ∼1000 mAh/g at C rate when coupled with a lithium metal electrode. Furthermore, the electrodes exhibit high rate capability and stable capacities of 800 mAh/g at 5C (charge/discharge in 12 minutes), sustained over 100 cycles and 600 mAh/g at 10C (charge/discharge in 6 minutes). Scanning electron microscopy indicates the high-rate capability is achieved because Fe3O4 nanorods are uniformly suspended in the SWNT matrix. Raman spectroscopy was employed to understand how the SWNTs function as a highly flexible conductive additive. Recently, we have also employed this method to demonstrate improved conductivity and highly improved rate capability for a LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.2O2 cathode material.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051877846

The fabrication of 1D semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures plays a crucial role in developing alternative energy storage/ conversion devices with high power and energy densities. Low dimensional nanotubular morphologies are particularly attractive, but the preparation of thin films remains a challenge. A novel technique for the preparation of TiO2 and V2O5 nanotube films via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) will be described.

For example, the (001) planes of anatase are much more active than the (101) planes, which are the most commonly observed and thermodynamically more stable crystalline plane in anatase. Significant efforts have therefore been devoted to synthesize TiO2 crystals with preferential (001)-plane exposure. Parallel to the crystallographic control, equally important is building networks of pore within the crystals to increase the surface area and provide pore-dependent activity and selectivity. To date, although a large number of porous TiO2 have been made using the sol-gel, soft- or hard- templating approaches, the current materials are limited to porous TiO2 with amorphous or polycrystalline frameworks that exhibit low photocatalytic activity and charge-transport capability. Herein, using a method of crystal oriented growth, we report the synthesis of highly active mesoporous TiO2 single crystals (meso-cages) with both preferential (001)-plane exposure and controllable mesoporous networks. This simple solution-growth method is readily extendable to the synthesis of other mesoporous single crystals beyond TiO2, providing a new class of materials for catalytic, energy storage and conversion and other applications. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that building titania spheres containing hollow or semi-hollow chamber structure enables the manipulation of light propagation within chamber structure, which further leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The capability to synthesize photoactive materials with structural control at multiple length scales is therefore essential for future design of photocatalysts with better performance.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051876927

The free energy perturbation method was employed to investigate the adsorption free energies of methane, ethane, n-butane, n-hexane and cyclohexane. For linear alkanes, the free energy lowered as the length of the carbon chain increased. Also, the adsorption of n-hexane was preferred over cyclohexane, due to its ability to rearrange its structure to maximize contacts with the host. Furthermore, due to the large pore size of NiDOBDC, higher loadings of alkanes did not significantly affect the alkane structure, and enhanced the free energy of adsorption for subsequent alkanes being loaded.

The approach involves: (i) coproducing electricity and liquid transportation fuels from biomass and a fossil fuel (coal or natural gas) with carbon capture and storage, and (ii) evaluating these systems as low-carbon (low-C) power generators as alternatives to new supercritical coal power plants that vent CO2. Under a wide range of plausible future conditions, these systems could provide low-C electricity (and also low-C transportation fuels) at lower costs than could low-C stand-alone fossil-fuel power plant alternatives. One striking finding is that widespread deployment of coproduction systems could, via economic dispatch competition, drive natural gas combined cycle power plants out of baseload power markets at all GHG emission prices. There are five reasons for the prospective superior economic performances of coproduction plants compared to stand-alone power plants. Three hold without a C-mitigation policy: (i) the large credit for synfuel co-products at current or higher oil prices, (ii) the inherent low minimum dispatch cost of coproduction plants, and (iii) the energy efficiency gain offered by coproduction. The other two reasons are relevant only under a C-mitigation policy: (iv) the low CO2 capture costs compared to capture costs for stand-alone power plants, and (v) levelized costs of electricity that decline sharply with greenhouse gas emission price at high (&gt; 30%, HHV basis) biomass coprocessing rates. This approach represents not only an economically attractive way to decarbonize electricity and synfuels but also would provide an opportunity to make synfuels profitably at scales &gt; 10,000 barrels per day in power-generation plant-scale applications that require only a modest fraction of the capital investment required for the 50,000 to 140,000 barrels per day facilities usually considered for making synfuels from coal or natural gas.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051874820

In the NSR technology, alkali or alkaline earth elements (K or Ba) take up NOx under lean operation and store them as nitrates, which are subsequently reduced during rich operation. In this presentation, we compare the characteristics of Ba and K storage elements during NOx adsorption and desorption processes using multiple techniques, including TR-XRD, FTIR and NO2 TPD. We find that, although both elements store NOx as nitrates, there are significant differences between the morphology changes of the Ba and K nitrates.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051869485

The technical application of carbon materials requires precise control over their mesoscale and microscale architectures, which call for the development of easy and efficient synthetic protocols towards unprecedented carbon and metal/carbon composite materials. Here we introduce a novel carbon-rich precursor approach towards the fabrication of well-defined carbon materials with tailorability at the molecular level. This strategy can further establish the link between 2D (graphene) and 3D carbon materials through the controlled pyrolysis of precursors in confining template or carbonmesophase state. Therefore, this method stands in contrast to other chemical means of carbon synthesis in terms of its 1) size, shape and component fine control; 2) structural perfection and 3) feasible processability. Prominent applications have been achieved with using these carbon materials and their carbon-metal nanocomposite across the ranges of catalysis, sensing, supercapacitors and batteries.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051868907

What is certain, however, is that new discoveries that involve materials that are difficult to make, manufacture and implement tend to have long product development cycles. In these cases, before discovery can be translated to a viable technology, the iterative developmental cycle can become mired in the so-called ""valley of death"" where financing constraints suffocate innovation. Conversely, discoveries that are based on materials that are easy to make, manufacture and implement can have much shorter iterative development cycles and consequently have a greater chance to avoid the chasm that the ""valley of death"" presents to nascent technologies. For this reason, the discovery of new Co and Ni based water splitting catalysts developed in our labs are of potential technological interest in the energy sector. Converting water to oxygen and hydrogen is the central chemistry of conversion processes that store renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. This talk will present results of a high surface area electrode that is functionalized with cobalt-based oxygen evolving catalysts (Co-OEC). Current densities of 100 mA/cm2 are achieved for water splitting at 350 mV overpotential. The catalyst retains activity in near-neutral pH buffered electrolyte in natural waters such as those from the Charles River (Cambridge, MA) and seawater (Woods Hole MA). The efficacy and ease of operation of anodes functionalized with Co-OEC catalyst at appreciable current density together with its ability to operate in near neutral pH buffered natural water sources bodes well for the translation of this catalyst to a viable renewable energy storage technology.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051863686

The experimental results show that the phase change temperature of the paraffin wax slightly increases after adding the nano-materials to the paraffin wax. In addition, the nano-materials in the paraffin wax will reduce the temperature difference between test samples and heating water, indicating that adding the nano-materials can effectively reduce the thermal resistance of the experimental samples and improve the efficiency of thermal energy storage. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.","Alumina (Al2O3); Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs); Nanocomposite-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCMs); Paraffin wax","Heating temperatures; Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs); Optimal parameter; Phase Change; Phase change temperature; Temperature differences; Test samples; Two step method; Buoyancy; Characterization; Heat storage; Heating; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanocomposites; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961235615

However, the most serious barrier to potential uses is the development of feasible hydrogen storage systems. The discovery of high hydrogen storage capacity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) makes up alternatives for hydrogen storage systems. In this study, the hydrogen adsorption on carbon nanotubes was investigated. CNTs were firstly synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene (C 2H2) on a magnesium oxide (MgO) powder impregnated with an iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) solution. The synthesis parameters were selected as: the synthesis temperature of 800 °C, the iron content in the precursor of 5% and the synthesis time of 30 min. The liquid phase oxidation method was applied for the purification of the synthesized CNT materials. Three different chemicals - 3 M HNO3, H2SO4, and HCl-were used in the removal of the metal catalysts from the synthesized CNT material to investigate the possible effects of each acid solution to the purification step. Purification of the synthesized CNT material was carried out under the conditions of 75 °C for 15 h. A 30% H2O2:3 M HCl (1:1 v%) solution was also used in the purification step to remove both the metal catalysts and the amorphous carbon. The purification using this solution was performed at 75 °C for 8 h. The hydrogen storage capacities of the purified materials were measured using volumetric method. It was found that the hydrogen adsorption capacities of these materials were changed in the range of 0.60-4.86 wt% at the liquid nitrogen temperature and gas pressure up to 100 bar. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

All three compositions exhibit a maximum storage capacity of about 5 mass % H at 573 K. When ball-milled for 30 min in hexanes, the binary alloy can be activated (first-cycle hydrogen absorption) at 473 K. DSC experiments indicate that desorption in this sample begins at 525 K, compared to 560 K when the material is activated at 573 K; which indicates an improvement in the hydride reaction thermodynamics due to capillarity effects. Additions of Y and La improve the degradation in storage capacity observed during cycling of the binary alloy by slowing microstructural coarsening. Alloying with La also shows a decrease of about 8 kJ/mol and 5 kJ/mol in the enthalpy of reaction for MgH2 and Mg2NiH4 formation, respectively, compared to the binary alloy; resulting in some desorption of H2 at 473 K. The improved thermodynamics are discussed in terms of destabilization of the hydrides relative to new equilibrium phases introduced by alloying additions.

It is found that the maximum temperature of 530 °C required by the oxygen production step in the Cu-Cl cycle can be supplied by current solar thermal technologies. The heat requirements are examined for the Cu-Cl cycle and it is found that the heat source must be sufficiently high and above the maximum temperature requirement of the Cu-Cl cycle, in order to match the heat requirements of the cycle. The quantity of molten salt and solar plant dimensions for capturing and storing solar heat for an industrial hydrogen production scale are also estimated for 24 h operation per day. The flow characteristics and heat losses of molten salt transport in pipelines are studied while considering the influences of pipeline diameter, heat load and weather conditions. The heat loss from a solar salt storage tank is also calculated based on various tank diameters and heights. The intermediate product of molten salt produced in the oxygen production step gives the Cu-Cl cycle a significant advantage of linkage with current high temperature solar thermal technologies. This allows flexibility for integration of the Cu-Cl cycle and solar thermal plant. Using a thermal network analysis of the Cu-Cl cycle, the layout options for the integration of a Cu-Cl cycle with various solar thermal technologies are presented and discussed in this paper. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Below 250 °C, the alanate decomposes into Al, LiH and H2, through the formation of Li3AlH6, whereas the amide remains largely intact. The release of gaseous hydrogen corresponds to approximately 5 wt%. Above 250 °C, additional ∼4 wt% of hydrogen is produced through solid-state reactions among LiNH2, LiH and metallic Al, through the formation of intermetallic Li-Al binary alloy and an unidentified intermediate. The overall reaction of the thermochemical transformation of the LiAlH 4-LiNH2 mixture results in the production of Li 3AlN2, metallic Al, LiH and the release of 9 wt% of gaseous hydrogen. The reaction mechanism of the thermal decomposition is different from one identified earlier during mechanical treatment of the same system. Rehydrogenation of the thermally-decomposed products of LiAlH 4-LiNH2 mixture using high hydrogen pressure (180 bar) and heating (275 °C) yields LiNH2 and amorphous aluminum nitride (AlN). © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The performance of the portable SOFC system is studied in a wide range of the cell's average current densities and fuel utilization ratios. Considering a heat recovery option, the system exergy efficiency is calculated to be 60-90% as a function of current density, whereas energy efficiency varies between 60 and 40%, respectively.

Three different hydrogen-carbon surface interaction potentials, based on Lennard-Jones (LJ), Møller-Plesset (MP2), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, respectively, have been used with that model, in order to obtain sensible boundaries of the values of the storage capacities. We support the MP2 results as the most realistic of the three. The optimal pore sizes, which yield the highest storage capacities, depend mainly on the shape of the pore and on the interaction potential, and slightly on temperature and pressure. At 300 K and 10 MPa, the optimal width of the planar pores and the optimal radii of the cylindrical and spherical pores lie in the ranges of 5.8-7.5, 7.0-8.6 and 8.5-10.7 , respectively, for the three interaction potentials considered.

The development of hydrogen production, transportation-storage and utilization technologies can play a central role in addressing growing concerns over carbon emissions and climate change, as well as the future availability and security of energy supply. However the widespread use of hydrogen may have unknown environmental effect due to increased anthropogenic emissions of molecular hydrogen and other gases to the atmosphere, through production, transportation-storage and utilization processes. It is recognized that hydrogen participates in stratospheric chemical cycles of H2O and various greenhouse gases, and a substantial increase in its concentration might lead to changes in equilibrium concentration of constituent components of the stratosphere. More accurate modeling of the stratospheric processes as well as better understanding of several other factors such as hydrogen uptake in soil and its effect on microbial communities is required to assess potential adverse effects of hydrogen economy. It is critical for us to understand the potential adverse effect of widespread use of hydrogen and take necessary actions to understand and prevent its possible environmental impacts. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

As the B/A stoichiometry in each series of alloys increases from 1.8 to 2.2, systematic trends in certain storage properties are found: the hydrogen dissociation pressure and heat of hydride formation increases; the alloy with a AB2.0 stoichiometry has the highest electrochemical full capacity; and slightly higher and lower B-contents increase the electrochemical high-rate-dischargeability and gaseous phase maximum storage capacity, respectively. Stoichiometric or slightly hyper-stoichiometric AB2 alloys have lower PCT hysteresis which are expected to reduce pulverization during cycling. The full and high-rate discharge electrochemical capacities correlate well with the maximum and reversible gaseous hydrogen storages, respectively.

The suitability of the periodic DFT method employing the GGA-PBE functional is tested against MP2/6-311 + G (*) and MP2/cc-pVTZ molecular calculations. A correlation between the charge transfer and interaction energies is revealed. The metal-MOF-5 interactions are analyzed using the frontier molecular orbital approach. Difference charge density plots show that H 2 molecules get polarized due to the charge generated on the metal atom adsorbed over the BDC linker, resulting in electrostatic guest-host interactions. Our solid state results show that amongst the four metal atoms, Mg and Be decoration does not stabilize the MOF-5 to any significant extent. Li and Al decoration strengthened the H2-MOF-5 interactions relative to the pure MOF-5 exhibited by the enhanced binding energies. The hydrogen binding energies for the Li- and Al-decorated MOF-5 were found to be sensible for allowing reversible hydrogen storage at ambient temperatures. A high hydrogen uptake of 4.3 wt.% and 3.9 wt.% is also predicted for the Li- and Al-decorated MOF-5, respectively. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

THEUS consists of a fuel cell, water electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tank and their auxiliary machinery. The hydrogen storage tanks with metal hydrides for load leveling have been previously experimentally investigated as an important element of THEUS. A hydrogen storage tank with 50 kg AB5 type metal hydride was assembled to investigate the hydrogen-absorbing/desorbing process, which is exothermic/endothermic process. The goal of this tank is to recover the cold heat of the endothermic process for air conditioning, and thus improve the efficiency of THEUS. To verify the practical effectiveness of this improved system, we developed a numerical simulation code of hydrogen storage tank with metal hydride. The code was validated by comparing its results with experimental results. In this code the specific heat value of the upper and lower flanges of the hydrogen storage tank was adjusted to be equal to the thermal capacity of the entire tank.

The synthesized composite shows interesting hydrogen storage properties. The desorption temperature is more than 100 °C lower compared to commercial MgH2 from TG-DSC measurements. After desorption, the composite sample absorbs hydrogen at 100 °C to a capacity of 4 mass% in 4 h and may even absorb hydrogen at 40 °C. The improved properties are due to the catalyst and nanostructure introduced during high pressure ball milling. From the PCI results at 269, 280, 289 and 301 °C, the enthalpy change and entropy change during the desorption can be determined according to the van't Hoff equation.

During the ball milling process, two concurrent reactions take place in the mixture: 3LiBH 4 + 4NaNH2 → Li3Na(NH2) 4 + 3NaBH4 and LiBH4 + NaNH2 → LiNH2 + NaBH4. The heating process from 50 °C to 400 °C is mainly the concurrent reactions of Li3Na(NH 2)4 + 3LiBH4 → 2Li3BN 2 + NaBH4 + 8H2 and 2LiNH2 + LiBH4 → Li3BN2H8 → Li 3BN2 + 4H2, where the intermediate phases Li3Na(NH2)4 and LiNH2 serve as the reagents to decompose LiBH4.

The maximum dehydrogenation capacity in closed system below 400 °C is 5.1 wt.% H2, which agrees well with the theoretical capacity (5.5 wt.% H2) of the merged equation and thus demonstrates the suggested pathway.

Hydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics of Mg-4Fe at.% (+/- 1 at.%) thin films capped with Pd at temperatures ranging from 363 K to 423 K were studied by a number of different methods: in situ infrared imaging, volumetric pressure-composition isotherm (PCI) measurements, and ex situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The hydride growth rate was determined by utilizing wedge-shaped films and infrared imaging; assuming formation of a continuous hydride layer, the growth rate was found to range from ≈3.8 nm/s at lower temperature to ≈36.7 nm/s at higher temperature. The apparent activation energy of the thermally activated hydrogenation kinetics was measured to be 56 kJ/mol; this value suggests that at low temperatures hydrogen diffusion along grain boundaries of MgH2 is the mechanism controlling the hydride layer growth. Reproducible PCI measurements of 600 nm-thick uniform films showed a pressure plateau and large hysteresis; from these measurements enthalpy and entropy were estimated as 66.9 kJ/mol and 0.102 kJ/(molK), respectively, which are both slightly less than values for pure magnesium (as either films or bulk). The extremely rapid and cyclable kinetics of Mg-4 at.% Fe films suggest that properly grown Mg-Fe powders of 1-2 μm size can be fully charged with hydrogen within 1 min at temperature near 150 °C (423 K), with possible practical hydrogen storage applications. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Recycled amber glass frit coated with polypropylene glycol and cobalt sulfate is converted into hollow glass microspheres with a simple, low-cost flame spraying method. Hollow glass microspheres made by this process release hydrogen more quickly when illuminated versus traditional outgassing with a heated oven.

The compaction of ball-milled MgH 2 associated with Expanded Natural Graphite was used to improve the thermal conductivity of the resulting compacts. Taking advantage of these compacts, an intermediate scale tank (1.8 kg MgH2) cooled down by forced air circulation was designed. The absorption is initiated at 90 °C. Since the intrinsic kinetic is not the limiting factor, the hydrogen pressure does not affect the loading process. The loading time is strongly dependent on the cooling efficiency. However, beyond a given air flow rate it doesn't decrease any more, the heat transfer being limited by the thermal conductivity of the compacted disks. During desorption, the maximum hydrogen flow (25 Nl/mn) is directly proportional to the thermal power of the heating system. The tank absorbs 1170 Nl, has a specific-energy of 270 W h/kg and a system volumetric-density of 42 gr/l. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient solution to this problem is in modification of the material surface by the deposition of metals (including Palladium) capable of catalyzing the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecules. In this work the surface modification of TiFe alloy was performed using a metal-organic chemical vapour deposition technique (MOCVD), by the thermal decomposition of palladium (II) acetylacetonate (Pd[acac]2) mixed with the powder of the parent alloy. Such a treatment was shown to result in the formation of coatings comprised of palladium nanoparticles, which subsequently facilitate the hydrogenation of the material even after its exposure to air, which otherwise prove detrimental. However, the hydrogenation performances were found to be quite sensitive to MOCVD conditions that, most probably, originates from side processes in the interaction of gaseous products of Pd[acac]2 decomposition with TiFe. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The process achieved a final relative density of 97% the theoretical. Relatively thick, ∼100 μm, electrodes were fabricated to enhance the energy density relatively to the traditional solid-state thin film battery electrodes. The sintered electrode composite delivered full capacity in the first discharge at C/40 discharge rate. Full capacity utilization resulted from the 3D percolated network of both solid electrolyte and metal, which provide paths for ionic and electronic transport, respectively. The electrodes retained 85% of the theoretical capacity after 10 cycles at C/40 discharge rate. The tensile strength and the Young's modulus of the sintered electrode composite are the highest reported values to date, and are at least an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding value of traditional tapecast ""composite electrodes"".

Failures of Li-ion battery not only result in serious inconvenience and enormous replacement/repair costs, but also risk catastrophic consequences such as explosion due to overheating and short circuiting. In order to prevent severe failures from occurring, and to optimize Li-ion battery maintenance schedules, breakthroughs in prognostics and health monitoring of Li-ion batteries, with an emphasis on fault detection, correction and remaining-useful-life prediction, must be achieved.

When functioning as an energy storage device, the RSOFC acts like an electrolyzer in water electrolysis mode; whereby the electric energy is stored as (electrolyzed) hydrogen and oxygen gases. While hydrogen is useful as a transportation fuel and in other industrial applications, the RSOFC also acts as a fuel cell in power generation mode to produce electricity when needed. The RSOFC would be a competitive technology in the upcoming hydrogen economy on the basis of its low cost, simple structure, and high efficiency. This paper reports on the design and manufacturing of its membrane electrode assembly using commercially available materials. Also reported are the resulting performance, both in electrolysis and fuel cell modes, as a function of its operating parameters such as temperature and current density.

They can generate electrical power up to 100 μW which can be used to drive various sensing and actuating MEMS devices. Today, piezoelectric energy harvesters are considered autonomous and reliable energy sources to actuate low power microdevices such as wireless sensor networks, indoor-outdoor monitoring, facility management and biomedical applications. The advantages of piezoelectric energy harvesters including high power density, moderate output power and CMOS compatible fabrication in particular with aluminum nitride (AlN) have fuelled and motivated researchers to develop MEMS based energy harvesters. Recently, the use of AlN as a piezoelectric material has increased fabrication compatibility, enabling the realization of smart integrated systems on chip which include sensors, actuators and energy storage. Piezoelectric MEMS energy microgenerator is used to capture and transform the available ambient mechanical vibrations into usable electric energy via resonant coupling in the thin film piezoelectric material. Analysis and modeling of piezoelectric energy generators are very important aspects for improved performance. Aluminum nitride as the piezoelectric material is sandwiched between two electrodes. The device design includes a silicon cantilever on which the AlN film is deposited and which features a seismic mass at the end of the cantilever.

The results indicated that, the density of energy storage decreases with the increasing of Yb3+ and amplifier aperture in absence of Cr4+; but the co-doped Cr 4+ in Yb:YAG crystal would suppress the ASE in amplifier and affect on the energy storage in the amplifier, the ASE decreases with the increasing of co-doped Cr4+. But the maximum energy storage in amplifier increases firstly, and then decreases with the increasing of Cr4+ density. The reason is that, the Cr4+ in amplifier absorb not only the ASE but also the pumping energy.

Namely, in order to obtain maximum energy storage there is an optimized Cr4+ density, which was determined by the Yb3+ density and aperture of amplifier. © 2011 SPIE.","Co-doped crystal; Cr4+; Energy storage; Numerical simulation; Yb:YAG crystal","Co-doped; Co-doped crystal; Co-doping; Pumping energies; Pumping power density; Yb:YAG crystal; Cobalt; Energy storage; Flywheels; High energy physics; High power lasers; Pumping (laser); Pumps; Ytterbium; High energy lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960525855

The ideal energy provider is reliable, efficient, with low emissions source - wind, solar, etc. The low carbon footprint of renewables is an added benefit, which makes them especially attractive during this era of environmental consciousness. Unfortunately, the intermittent nature of energy from these renewables is not suitable for the commercial and residential grid application, unless the power delivery is 24/7, with minimum fluctuation. This requires intervention of efficient electrical energy storage technology to make power generation from renewable practical. The progress to higher energy and power density especially for battery technology will push material to the edge of stability and yet these materials must be rendered safe, stable and with reliable operation throughout their long life. A major challenge for chemical energy storage is developing the ability to store more energy while maintaining stable electrode-electrolyte interface. A structural transformation occurs during charge-discharge cycle, accompanied by a volume change, degrading the microstructure over-time. The need to mitigate this volume and structural change accompanying charge-discharge cycle necessitates going to nanostructured and multifunctional materials that have the potential of dramatically enhancing the energy density and power density. © 2011 SPIE.","Conversion electrode; Energy storage; Lithium-ion battery; Nanoarchitectured materials; Nanomaterials","Battery technology; Charge-discharge cycle; Chemical energy; Electrical energy; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Energy density; Green energy; Grid applications; Lithium-ion battery; Long life; Low carbon; Low emission; Multi-functional materials; Nano-structured; Nanoarchitectured materials; Power delivery; Power densities; Power generation from renewable; Reliable operation; Renewables; Storage technology; Structural change; Structural transformation; Volume change; World energy consumption; Alternative fuels; Electric discharges; Electric power transmission; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Flywheels; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Materials; Nanostructured materials; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960520799

MFCs have the potential of powering small sensors in remote areas and disposing organic waste safely by harvesting the energy stored in the waste products. From previous research in this field, a few important factors for MFC performance have been identified. These include the internal resistance of MFC, the surface area of anode with catalyst for the biofilm development, the type and number of bacteria, and the abundance of nutritional supplies to the bacteria. This paper describes the design of a novel single chamber MFC (SMFC) with carbon electrodes. Experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between each parameter and the power production. It is shown here that this SCMFC can generate electrical current without the use of PEM membranes or additives; the maximum voltage of around 411 mV can be achieved at the room temperature. These results also measured a various parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen and solution conductivity during the operation of SMFC.

In this view, much effort has been made in developing new, cost effective, environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage devices. The performance of such devices is fundamentally related to material properties. Hence, innovative materials engineering is important in solving the energy crisis problem. One such innovation in materials engineering is porous materials for energy storage. Porous electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) offer a high degree of electrolyte-electrode wettability, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity within the material. Among the porous materials, mesoporous materials draw special attention, owing to shorter diffusion lengths for Li+ and electronic movement. Nanostructured mesoporous materials also offer better packing density compared to their nanostructured counterparts such as nanopowders, nanowires, nanotubes etc., thus opening a window for developing electrode materials with high volumetric energy densities. This would directly translate into a scenario of building batteries which are much lighter than today's commercial LIBs. In this article, the authors present a simple, soft template approach for preparing both cathode and anode materials with high packing density for LIBs.

The Fe-Ti and Mg-Ti-Fe elemental powders are milled with the milling time of 30 h, in a Mixer Mill, type PW 700i high energy ball mill. The milled specimens are analyzed with an X-ray diffractometer, Philip, type PW 1710, using Cu as the anode tube and λ = 1.5406 Å. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are determined using Rietveld method developed by Fuji Izumi. The microstructure of the specimens after milling and hydriding are identified with a scanning electron microscope, Philip type 550. The refinement analysis of the x-ray diffractions results for Fe-Ti alloy shows that before milling the specimen consists of Ti and Fe phases, and after 30 h of milling new phases identified as FeTi and Fe2Ti are formed. In case of Mg-Ti-Fe alloy after 30 h of milling new phases identified as Fe2Ti and FeTi compounds are formed with the absence of Mg-Ti and Mg-Fe. Quantitative analysis of the milled powders shows that the mass fractions of FeTi and Fe2Ti phases are correspondingly 22.5 wt% and is 21.1 wt%, and the rest is Fe. The disappearance of Mg peaks after milling is suggested from the transformation of the crystallite into amorphous state. On hydriding at room temperature, the milled Fe-Ti and Mg-Fe-Ti powders are transformed into β-Ti4FeH8.5, Fe and TiH2. Considering the high hydrogen capacity and the low hydriding temperature of the Mg-Ti-Fe alloy compared to those of Fe-Ti alloy, the Mg-Ti-Fe alloy could be promoted as a new hydrogen storage material. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Fe-Ti and Mg-Fe-Ti systems; Hydriding; Mechanical alloying; Metal hydride","Amorphous state; Atomic ratio; Elemental powders; Fe-Ti and Mg-Fe-Ti systems; FeTi alloys; High energy ball mill; High-energy ball milling; Hydriding; Hydrogen absorption properties; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; Mass fraction; Metal hydride; Milled powders; Milling time; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Room temperature; Scanning Electron Microscope; Toluene solution; X ray diffractometers; Alloys; Ball milling; Ball mills; Chemical analysis; Diffraction; High energy physics; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Iron alloys; Mechanical alloying; Mechanical properties; Metallurgy; Milling (machining); Powder metals; Rietveld method; Scanning electron microscopy; Toluene; X ray diffraction; Titanium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960393013

The emission wavelength is characteristic of the target material and allows spectral discrimination of targets from clutter. The burst-illumination- LIDAR system transmits a laser pulse and the fluorescent return is detected with a synchronised gated imaging receiver. The short gate length (∼ns) allowed by a micro-channel plate CCD reduces solar clutter. Detector noise is not the limiting factor because of the high MCP-CCD detectivity. Laser choice is constrained by the required laser pulse energy, laser size and robustness. The COTS solution identified is a diode-pumped, 4th harmonic converted, 1064nm laser. Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF and Nd:Alexandrite lasers have superior performance but require some development for this application. A pessimistic range model evaluates the optical powers. Comparison of the received fluorescent energy to the detector noise equivalent energy and the solar energy received provides the detection range limit. Performance of the proposed systems exceeds the detection range requirement for all samples evaluated and all varying conditions explored. The lowest range is for black paint with the COTS laser system and is 2860m; the best ranges exceed 5km.

A poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) was chosen as a base polymeric matrix and functionalised in situ by manganese oxide formation. The functionalisation process and the preliminary results on hydrogen storage capability of the synthesized polymer are reported. The polymer was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, BET method surface and gravimetric hydrogen adsorption measurements. The metallic compound introduction modifies the morphology of the material and supplies an increased surface area for hydrogen chemisorptions, revealing a 1.2 wt% hydrogen adsorption capability at 77 K. Preliminary results from gravimetric measurements showed that by increasing the temperature hydrogen storage capability was reduced but not eliminated; for example, a 0.24 wt% at 50 °C and 60 bar was obtained. Moreover, reversibility of hydrogen adsorption and desorption in a wide range of both temperatures and pressures was confirmed.

This composite system showed improved dehydrogenation performance compared with that of as-milled NaAlH4 and MgH2 alone. The dehydrogenation process in the MgH2-NaAlH4 composite can be divided into four stages: NaAlH4 is first reacted with MgH 2 to form a perovskite-type hydride, NaMgH3 and Al. In the second dehydrogenation stage, the Al phase reacts with MgH2 to form Mg17Al12 phase accompanied with the self-decomposition of the excessive MgH2. NaMgH3 goes on to decompose to NaH during the third dehydrogenation stage, and the last stage is the decomposition of NaH. Kissinger analysis indicated that the apparent activation energy, E A, for the MgH2-relevent decomposition in MgH 2-NaAlH4 composite was 148 kJ/mol, which is 20 kJ/mol less than for as-milled MgH2 (168 kJ/mol). X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the second, third, and fourth stages are fully reversible. It is believed that the formation of Al12Mg17 phase during the dehydrogenation process alters the reaction pathway of the MgH 2-NaAlH4 (4:1) composite system and improves its thermodynamic properties. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

NaAlH4-Tm2O3 (10 wt%) and NaAlH 4-Tm2O3 (10 wt%)-porous SiO2 (10 wt%) are prepared by the ball milling method, and their hydrogen desorption/re-absorption capacities are compared. Dehydrogenation process was performed at 150 °C under vacuum and rehydrogenation was performed at 150 °C for 4 h under ∼9 MPa in highly pure hydrogen. The results show that Tm2O3 has a catalytic effect on the hydrogen desorption and re-absorption of NaAlH4. The hydrogen desorption capacity of Tm2O3 single-doped NaAlH4 is 4.6 wt%, higher than that of undoped NaAlH4 (4.3 wt%). During the dehydrogenation process, NaAlH4 is completely decomposed and no intermediate product Na3AlH6 is detected. The addition of porous silica improves the dehydrogenation performance of NaAlH4.

The experimental results showed that Ti0.95Zr0.05Cr0.8Mn0.8V 0.2Ni0.2 and Ti0.8Zr0.2Cr 0.95Fe0.95V0.1 alloys could well meet the requirements of compression system. Composite materials formed by mixing hydrogen storage alloys with Al fiber were an effective way to prevent strain accumulation for hydride compression. With cold oil (298 K) and hot oil (423 K) as the cooling and heating sources, the built compression system could convert hydrogen pressure from around 4.0 MPa to over 70 MPa. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Pd nanoparticles were loaded on DWCNT surfaces for dissociation of H2 into atomic hydrogen, which spills over to the defect sites on the DWCNTs. When we use different reductants, the reduction capabilities and other effects of the different reductants are different, which affects the hydrogen storage capacity of the DWCNTs. In this work, the amount of hydrogen storage capacity was determined (by AMC Gas Reactor Controller) to be 1.7, 2.0, 2.55, and 3.0 wt% for pristine DWCNTS and for 2.0%Pd/DWCNTs using H2, l-ascorbic acid, and NaBH4 as reductants, respectively. We found that the hydrogen storage capacity can be enhanced by loading with 2% Pd nanoparticles and selecting a suitable reductant. Furthermore, the sorption can be attributed to the chemical reaction between atomic hydrogen and the dangling bonds of the DWCNTs. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The microstructure and phase compositions were examined by the scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Hydrogen absorption pressure composition isotherms (P-C isotherms) were investigated by pressure reduction method using Sievert apparatus at temperature ranging from 673 to 823 K. The compositional homogeneity of the alloy was achieved under the homogenizing treatment at 1373 K for 100 h. Twin defects with {111}&lt;022&gt; orientation relationship were observed in the Zr0.9Ti0.1V2 annealed at 1373 K for 100 h. The phase compositions of the annealed Zr 0.9Ti0.1V2 alloy could be attributed to ZrV2 Laves phase and V BCC solid solution. After hydrogenation, the alloy hydrides were consisted of ZrV2H3.6 and V 4H2.88. Titanium substitution in the Zr 0.9Ti0.1V2 alloy induced the formation of twin defect structures and the multiphase consisting of Laves (C15 type) related with BCC solid solution phases. The especial phase compositions and structures in the alloy were favorable to decrease the equilibrium pressure and improve the hydrogen absorption kinetics due to the twin defects in Zr0.9Ti 0.1V2 comparing with the primary ZrV2 alloy. The desorption hysteresis could be decreased to a certain extent in the Ti-doped alloy under the experimental condition.

The possible spatial separation of electricity generation and centralised fossil hydrogen production with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) allows an additional degree of freedom in the system in enabling the transport of hydrogen instead of electricity. This paper analyses energy conversion and transport tasks associated with the plant locations offered by this enhanced scheme. By considering various scenarios for Germany, we describe different gasification/reforming options with CO 2 capture and estimate their cost, including required new infrastructures. The results point out that moderate additional costs could allow the implementation of a first level hydrogen transport infrastructure instead of building a CO2 transportation network. This could be a smooth way to finance and facilitate the transition to a future larger hydrogen-based energy system.

It results in developing an effective method of producing a high-density solid hydrogen carrier by means of hydrogen intercalation in carbonaceous nanomaterials at relevant temperatures and pressures (at the cost of the hydrogen association energy). This is a much more technological method, in comparison with the current megabar compression dynamic and static methods. As is also shown, one of the known processes of chemisorption of hydrogen in some carbonaceous nanostructures can be related to formation of graphane-like (i.e., carbohydride-like) nanoregions. By using gravimetric and electron microscopy data, the density values ( ρH=0.7±0.2g(H2)/cm3(H 2),ρH=0.28±0.08g(H2)/cm3(system)), of the intercalated solid molecular (i.e., reversible) hydrogen in graphane-like nanofibers (≥ 17 wt% H2) has been defined.

Small particle size, which can be achieved by milling, and small amounts of transition-metal compounds as catalysts result in increased hydrogen release/uptake kinetics. In this work, we developed the rate expression for the dehydrogenation of milled 7MgH2/TiH2, 10MgH2/TiH2, and MgH2 samples. The complete rate expressions, together with the values of activation energy and other rate parameters, were determined for the three milled samples by analyzing data obtained from non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The MgH2 doped with TiH2 by high-energy milling displayed substantially reduced apparent activation energy of 107-118 kJ/mol and significantly faster kinetics, compared with 226 kJ/mol for similarly milled MgH2 without TiH2 doping. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Efforts were made to achieve an in-depth understanding of the dehydrogenation mechanisms following the introduction of elemental Si and Al to both systems. A variety of analytical instruments were employed, such as Temperature-Programmed Desorption, Mass Spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and InfraRed spectroscopy. Unlike the effect of elemental Al in the (LiNH2 + LiH) system, which showed no promising improvement in the dehydrogenation, a significant kinetic improvement in the (LiNH2 + LiH) system was achieved upon addition of elemental Si. Kinetic improvement by elemental Si was described as a result of the LiH destabilisation through the formation of a Li2Si phase and an increase in H- anion concentration. On the other hand, once elemental Al is added to the (2LiNH2 + MgH2) system, the overall dehydrogenation kinetics of the system is delayed through the formation of a LiAl Phase. The results suggest that dehydrogenation mechanism in both the (LiNH2 + LiH) and the (2LiNH2 + MgH2) systems are identical. Dehydrogenation reaction starts with the electrostatic interaction of the oppositely charged hydrogen atoms in amide and hydride and proceeds by mass transfer of reactant species across the product layer at the later stage of the dehydrogenation. However, it was particularly identified that each system has a unique kinetic rate limiting step. Dehydrogenation kinetics seems to be controlled by the diffusion of the H- anion in the (LiNH2 + LiH) system but by the diffusion of the Li+ cation in the (2LiNH2 + MgH2) system. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The pilot biohydrgoen reactor with a working volume of 1 m3 was constructed and a stream of gluten manufacturing wastewater was used as the major substrate. When the gluten wastewater was introduced into the reactor, methane appeared in the biogas and hydrogen decreased to zero accumulation. By increasing the organic loading rate from 6.7 to 13.4 kg-COD/m3/d and reducing the hydraulic retention time from 1.5 to 1 day spontaneously, methanogens can be suppressed in 7 days. Besides, the total volatile fatty acids increase after the adjustment. However, high ethanol concentration in the influent revealed that only limited carbohydrate was available for biohydrogenation. The sugar content in the gluten wastewater can be degraded drastically in 5 days under both acidifying and alkalizing preservation conditions. 5 g/L ethanol and 3 g/L lactate was accumulated in the substrate storage tank resulting in limit carbohydrate for biohydrogenation under acidifying preservation condition. On the other hand, alkalizing preservation condition is a better approach and can preserve 80% of the carbohydrate within 2 days but various volatile fatty acids also accumulated without ethanol production. It is suggested that the gluten wastewater should be fed into the biohydrogen reactor as soon as possible and supplement such as solid organic wastes can also be introduced to maintain a proper organic loading rate and sustain bioactivity of biohydrogenation. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In the experiments, La2O3, Ni, and Ca were dry-mixed, and then heated at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 MPa of hydrogen pressure until ignition due to the hydrogenation of calcium. The products were recovered after natural cooling for 2 h. The results showed that the ignition temperature lowered with hydrogen pressure. The products changed from bulk to powder with hydrogen pressure. This was probably caused by volume expansion due to hydrogenation at higher pressure. The product obtained at 1.0 MPa showed the highest hydrogen storage capacity under an initial hydrogen pressure of 0.95 MPa.

When the dehydrogenation temperature was raised to 573 K, the hydrogen capacity decay became more significant and the ammonia concentration increased to 0.27 ± 0.06 mol%(NH3/H2). The reaction kinetics also severely deteriorated during cycling at the higher temperature. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This system is based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology, which is supplied by fuel reforming process, for producing hydrogen fuel starting from natural gas. The exhaust heat is recovered by a Thermal Storage Tank (TST), which is used in an absorption sub-system as a generator for residential cooling system. The feasibility analysis of an absorption cooling device, using thermal energy of PEMFC sub-system, for a residence application located at the unit of applied research in renewable energy in Ghardaia has been studied and performances were analysed. Electrical and thermal powers generated by the PEMFC sub-system with variable electrical loads (Part Load Ratio) have been analysed. The feasibility study shows that using PEMFC for residential cooling in Ghardaia is a promising solution.

Isothermal absorption kinetics were determined at 150 °C, and compared with the NaH + Al + 0.02TiCl3 system, indicating that CeCl3 and TiCl3 are equally effective additives, with CeCl3 preferred on the basis of hydrogen storage capacity. After milling, AlCe contains 100% of the Ce. After the first H absorption, we observe two Al1-xCex phases. The first, AlCe, contains ca. 60% of the originally added Ce atoms. The AlCe phase observed after milling and H cycling is chemically disordered, with complete exchange between the Al and Ce sublattices occurring, yielding zero intensity in ordering reflections such as (100). In the absorbed state after H cycling, the remaining 40% of Ce atoms are contained in a cubic Al1-xCex phase not previously observed in the Al-Ce phase diagram. Indexing yields a primitive cubic unit cell of dimension 7.7111 , in space group P23. Lineshape analysis indicates the AlCe and unknown cubic Al1-xCex phases are ca. 35 nm and 30 nm in dimension respectively. High resolution TEM imaging confirms that both Al1-xCex phases are embedded on the NaAlH4 surface, and localised energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) indicates a ca. 2:1 Al:Ce ratio for the unknown cubic Al1-xCex phase. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In order to resolve the problem of wastewater discharge from hydrogen production in green energy sustainable houses, this study proposes wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) treatment research, and suggests the use of two-stage anaerobic treatment to produce two types of bio-energy i.e. hydrogen and methane, while simultaneously reducing COD levels. Methane production employed a condensed molasses fermentation solubles (CMS) and hydrogen fermentation tank effluent as a substrate to test the COD reducing efficiency and overall efficiency of methane production. It was found that if CMS is used during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages, the maximum carbohydrate degradation rate will be approximately 70% (F/M ratio of 1.9-2.3), and the COD removal rate will increase from 15 to 20% (F/M ratio of 1.9-2.3) to 68% (F/M ratio of 0.5). This study showed that the total gas (H2 and CH4) production yield from effluent of hydrogen fermentation tank (56.2 KJ/mol substrate) is greater than the value for CMS. In this study, a 3.2 m3 anaerobic hydrogen reactor is evaluated to provide a family with 3-4 kW of power. When acclimatization is performed under conditions of 20 g COD/L substrate and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the COD removal rate can reach approximately 50%. If a methane-generating reactor with a 95% COD removal rate is used to degrade effluent from the hydrogen reaction tank, it will be possible to reduce the COD of organic effluent to under 500 mg/L. Since this water quality is not far from that of ordinary untreated household wastewater (approximately 300-500 mg COD/L), the effluent can be discharged into a community sewer system and treated in a community sewage treatment facility. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The microstructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The sizes and morphological structures were also evaluated using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pore structure and specific surface area were analyzed by N2/77 K adsorption/desorption isotherms. The hydrogen storage capacity was studied by BEL-HP at 298 K and 100 bar. The results revealed that the hydrogen storage capacity of the Pt-ACs-MOF-5 was 2.3 wt.% at 298 K and 100 bar, which is remarkably enhanced by a factor of above five times and above three times compared with raw ACs and MOF-5, respectively.

This paper reports a new composite system (NaBH4/ZnF2) to generate hydrogen at a low temperature below 100 °C. The NaBH4 and ZnF2 mixture was prepared by a mechanical milling in a 2:1 M ratio. Dehydrogenation of the mixture during a heating process shows that the initial dehydrogenation temperature was below 100 °C with favorable kinetics. The structural analysis confirmed the formation of NaBF4 and Zn in the reaction products. The study concerning the reaction mechanism reveals that ZnF 2 plays a role of reagent rather than catalyst.

Energy efficiency to convert microwaves to heat via this Ni-coated HCM was estimated to be more than 90%. By loading metal hydride powder samples into the monolith channels, Ni-HCMs were demonstrated to release 100% hydrogen from MgH 2 and other hydrides (NaBH4, NaAlH4, and LiH) under 200 W microwaves within 2-3 min. The new microwave/Ni-HCM method offers many advantages over the conventional electrical resistant or microwave heating methods on hydrides, including 1) very fast kinetics, 2) wide application range for various hydrides, 3) simple process with no ball-milling or catalyst addition, and 4) very high energy efficiency. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Energy storage may play a vital role in addressing these issues allowing for higher penetration of RES into weak electricity grids, especially in islands and isolated communities. The aim of STORIES project, which is co-financed by the Intelligent Energy - Europe programme of the European Commission, is to provide suggestions for changes in policies and regulations covering RES installations and to promote the use of energy storage technologies in island grids based also on the assessment of economic aspects, such as internal and external costs of energy storage solutions in order to increase RES penetration. The main outcome of the project will be the development of a Roadmap for the promotion of hybrid RES-energy storage power systems, which may assist in overcoming barriers for higher RES penetration in European islands and boosting the respective RES electricity markets in these areas. In the present work, the introduction of hydrogen as a storage means and wind energy as an electricity production source into the power supply system of the Portuguese island Corvo in Azores is presented. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out in order to examine the proposed RES and Hydrogen power system from an economic, environmental and social perspective. The results indicate that a considerable RES penetration into the power system of Corvo island is feasible and entails convergence between the financial and social profitability showing alignment of private and social interest. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Energy efficiency, Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen can play an important role in reducing the consumptions and the emissions and improving the energy security if integrated (Efficiency, Res, Hydrogen) systems are developed and experimented. The paper analyzes a real residential 100 square meters house, where energy efficiency measures and RES technologies have been applied, sizing a hydrogen system (electrolyzer, metal hydrides and fuel cell) for power backup, taking into consideration its dynamic behavior, experimentally determined. The technologies used are already available in the market and, except hydrogen technologies, sufficiently mature. Through energy efficiency technologies (insulation, absorbers, etc), the maximum electrical and thermal power needed decreases from 4.4 kWe to 1.7 kWe (annual consumption from 5000 kWh to 1200 kWh) and from 5.2 kWt to 1.6 kWt (annual consumption from 14,600 kWh to 4500 kWh) respectively. With these reduced values it has been possible to supply the consumptions entirely by small photovoltaic and solar thermal plants (less than 10 m 2 each). The hydrogen backup even if remains the most expensive (versus traditional batteries and gasoline generator), satisfying all the electric needs for one day, increases the security and allows net metering. Moreover the low-pressure hydrogen storage system through metal hydrides guarantees system safety too. Finally the system modularity can also satisfy higher energy production. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The large void space generated by cages in MOFs is not completely utilized for hydrogen storage application owing to weak interactions between the walls of MOFs and H2 molecules. These unutilized volumes in MOFs can be effectively utilized by incorporation of other microporous materials such as single walled carbon nanotubes into the pores of MOFs which could effectively tune the pore size and pore volume of the material towards hydrogen sorption. Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) incorporated MIL-101 composite MOF material (SWNT@MIL-101) was synthesized by adding purified single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) in situ during the synthesis of MIL-101. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of SWNT@MIL-101 showed the structure of MOF was not disturbed by SWNT incorporation. Hydrogen sorption capacities of MIL-101 was observed to increase from 6.37 to 9.18 wt% at 77 K up to 60 bar and from 0.23 to 0.64 wt% at 298 K up to 60 bar. The increment in the hydrogen uptake capacities of composite MOF materials was attributed to the decrease in the pore size and enhancement of micropore volume of MIL-101 by single walled carbon nanotube incorporation. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Indeed, to calculate the number of tanks, the evaluation of the energy requirement could be not enough because the available hydrogen depends not only on the quantity contained in the tank, but also on other dynamic factors which influence the kinetics and hydrogen flow such as the temperature and, therefore, the heat exchange system.

In-situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction and thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements were performed to analyze the product distributions formed during the thermal decomposition of LiMg(AlD 4)3. The first decomposition step occurs at about 120 °C and the second at about 160 °C for the as-milled sample, while for a purified sample of LiMg(AlD4)3, the decomposition temperatures involving release of hydrogen increase to 140 and 190 °C, respectively, suggesting that pure samples of LiMg(AlD4)3 are kinetically stabilized. Studies of the purified LiMg(AlD4) 3 also showed that the second decomposition step can be divided into two reactions: 3LiMgAlD6 → Li3AlD6 + 3MgD2 + 2Al + 3D2 and Li3AlD6 → 3LiD + Al + 3/2D2. Addition of TiCl3 to LiMg(AlD 4)3 under a variety of ball milling conditions consistently led to decomposition of LiMg(AlD4)3 during milling. Correspondingly, all attempts to rehydrogenate the (completely or partially) decomposed samples at up to 200 bar hydrogen pressure failed. Decomposition of MgD2 was observed at relatively low temperatures. This is ascribed to thermodynamic destabilization due to the formation of different AlxMgy phases, and to kinetic destabilization by addition of TiCl3. A thermodynamic assessment was established for the calculation of phase stability and decomposition reaction relationships within the Li-Mg-Al-H system. The calculations confirmed the metastability of the LiMg(AlH4)3 phase and the irreversibility of the Li-Mg alanate phase decomposition reactions. The Li-Mg alanate decomposition pathways followed experimentally could be explained by the endothermicity of the calculated decomposition enthalpies, in that an impure or catalyzed LiMgAlH 6 intermediate phase could more directly access an endothermic decomposition reaction at lower temperatures, while a kinetically-hindered, purified LiMgAlH6 would require higher temperatures to initiate the two-step decomposition through an exothermic reaction. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Here we performed a comparative study of the effects of selected micron and nano-sized nitrides using temperature programmed desorption, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. It was found that both micron and nano-sized BN and TiN act as effective catalysts within the system. While an increase in the concentration of TiN reduces dehydrogenation temperature, the opposite was observed for BN catalyst. Employment of both nano and micron-sized BN catalysts resulted in an almost similar dehydrogenation temperature; but dehydrogenation temperature was decreased about 20 °C by switching from micron to nano-sized TiN. The catalytic effects of the additives were proposed to be an improvement of surface reactivity and diffusion enhancement across the interface of the reactants. However, the role of BN and TiN are different in the way that TiN is likely to improve the surface reactivity of LiNH2, while BN mainly enhances diffusion across the interface of the reactants. Our findings also indicate that TiCl3 behaves like TiN, as a catalyst in Li-N-H system. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The catalyst exhibited high activity and low overpotential for O2 evolution under mild conditions. The main functional composition of the catalyst was a redox couple of Ag 2O/AgO. Catalytic activity during oxygen evolution was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and Tafel plot. The effects of the concentration, temperature, and pH of K2B4O7 solution on the catalyst, and the Faradaic efficiency of the oxygen evolving reaction were examined.

The use of a zero environmental impact vehicles is particularly stringent in urban area where high air pollutant concentrations could be reached. In particular, in this paper, the use of fuel cell vehicles plus ultracapacitors has been considered to minimize the TTW (Tank to Wheels) global efficiency in comparison with the conventional vehicles powered by ICE. A zero emissions city-car is designed by optimization of the components (in particular the energy storage) in order to minimize both its weight and its bulk with particular reference to the functions (passenger vehicles, minibus, freight distribution), the areas where the vehicle is driven (characteristic drive cycles, traffic) and the users (different driving style). In particular the design discussed in this paper was carried out through a process of reverse engineering. The energy needs, in fact, were calculated starting from real drive cycles obtained during an on-board data acquisition campaign carried out in Rome urban area. In this paper the powertrain is designed starting from the acquisition of real drive cycles obtained during acquisitions campaign in an urban area. The data collected by the on-board acquisitions systems has been used to evaluate the power required by the wheels as a function of time in a generic urban drive cycle and the energy needs of an urban vehicle. Thus, the analysis performed takes into account not only global energy consumption, but also the power needs that are affected by both the congested traffic conditions and the driving style. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This work reports on a new NMR method for studying the kinetics of non-catalyzed sodium borohydride hydrolysis in highly concentrated solutions. The effects of initial NaBH4 concentration, temperature and pH on conversion are studied. It is found that higher initial NaBH4 concentration and higher temperature both improve the reaction rate. The reaction rate is slowed down with increasing pH of basic solutions and is accelerated with decreasing pH of acidic solutions.

The transition is accompanied by a latent heat, and therefore is of the 1st order. On the deuterated sample the enthalpy variation is reduced of more than 20%, from 1.29 to 1.01 kJ/mol and the transition is shifted by ∼1.5 K toward higher temperatures. Both NH3BH3 and ND3BD3 display a temperature hysteresis between cooling and heating, thus denoting that the phase transition is of first-order. In addition, this hysteresis is extremely small (∼0.5 K) indicating that the coexistence region between the two phases is very narrow. During isothermal ageing, the transformation of the low-temperature orthorhombic phase into the high-temperature tetragonal one occurs with a time constant of ∼16 min in NH3BH3 and ∼64 min in ND3BD3, evidencing a drastic slowing down of kinetics in the deuterated compound. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It was found that the dehydrogenation reaction under vacuum is likely to proceed as follows: 2NaBH4 + MgH2 (&gt;250 °C) → 2NaBH4 + 1/2MgH2 + 1/2Mg + 1/2H2 (&gt;350 °C) ↔ 3/2NaBH4 + 1/4MgB2 + 1/2NaH + 3/4Mg + 7/4H2 (&gt;450 °C) → 2Na + B + 1/2Mg + 1/2MgB 2 + 5H2. In addition, presence of NaMgH3 phase suggests the occurrence of secondary reactions. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, TiC supported Pt-Ir electrocatalysts (Pt-Ir/TiC) for oxygen electrode in URFCs were synthesized, respectively, by chemical reduction process and plasma reduction process. Their physical and electrochemical properties are characterized and compared using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cyclic voltammogram (CV), potentiostatic technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results from XRD, XPS and TEM demonstrate that the plasma process gives a finer metal crystals and higher metal dispersion on the TiC support. The CV, polarization, potentiostatic and EIS results show that the Pt-Ir/TiC electrocatalyst prepared by the plasma reduction process is obviously more active than that by the chemical reduction process, in agreement with the above metal-dispersion observations.

When discharged to 2.0 V, the reaction products of Li-O 2 cells include a small amount of Li2O2 along with Li2CO3 and RO-(CO)-OLi in the alkyl carbonate-based electrolyte. However, regardless of the DOD, there is no Li2O detected in the discharge products in the alkyl-carbonate electrolyte. For the first time it was revealed that in an oxygen atmosphere the high surface area carbon significantly reduces the electrochemical operation window of the electrolyte, and leads to plating of insoluble Li salts on the electrode at the end of the charging process. Therefore, the impedance of the Li-O2 cell continues to increase after each discharge and recharge process.

This pilot-plant system is composed of two feedstock storage tanks (0.75 m3 each), a nutrient storage tank (0.75 m3), a mixing tank (0.6 m3), an agitated granular sludge bed fermentor (working volume 0.4 m3), a gas-liquid-solid separator (0.4 m3) and a control panel. The seed mixed microflora was obtained from a lab-scale agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor. This pilot-scale fermentor was operated for 67 days at 35 °C, an organic loading rate (OLR) of 40-240 kg COD/m3/d, and the influent sucrose concentration of 20 and 40 kg COD/m3. Both biogas and hydrogen production rates increased with increasing OLR. However, the biomass concentration (volatile suspended solids, VSS) only increased with an increasing OLR at an OLR range of 40-120 kg COD/m3/d, whereas it decreased when OLR was too high (i.e., 240 kg COD/m3/d). The biogas consisted mainly of H2 and CO 2 with a H2 content range of 23.2-37.8%. At an OLR of 240 kg COD/m3/d, the hydrogen content in biogas reached its maximum value of 37% with a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 15.59 m3/m 3/d and a hydrogen yield of 1.04 mol H2/mol sucrose. This HPR value is much higher than 5.26 m3/m3/d (fermented molasses substrate) and 1.56 m3/m3/d (glucose substrate) reported by other pilot-scale systems. Moreover, HPR was also greatly affected by pH. At an optimal pH of 5.5, the bacterial community became simple, while the efficient hydrogen producer Clostridium pasteurianum was dominant. The factors of energy output compared with the energy input (Ef) ranged from 13.65 to 28.68 on biohydrogen, which is higher than the Ef value on corn ethanol, biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol but in the similar range of cellulosic ethanol. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In a first step, the DMFC stack and the energy storage were dimensioned. To dimension the energy storage, the required energy density and power density were calculated. These are influenced by the operating states of the vehicle as well as the highly fluctuating load profile. For this kind of application a high energy density as well as a high power density is needed. Therefore, super capacitors are not the energy storage of choice. As an alternative, suitable batteries were analyzed in terms of their behavior in the DMFC hybrid system. Therefore, a characterization procedure was developed consisting of five different tests. These tests were developed adapted to the requirements of the application. They help to characterize the battery in terms of energy content, high power capability during charge and discharge, thermal behavior and lifetime. The tests showed that all batteries have to be operated on a partial state of charge (pSOC) and a thermal management is very important. Especially lead-acid battery show an decrease in lifetime under a pSOC operation. Therefore, a lithium battery was identified as the suitable energy storage for the considered application. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Characterization; DMFC; Energy storage; Hybridization; System","A-thermal; Characterization procedures; Charge and discharge; DMFC; Energy content; Energy density; Fluctuating loads; High energy densities; High power capability; High power density; Hybridization; Operating state; Partial state; Power densities; Super capacitor; System; Thermal behaviors; Traction applications; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Energy storage; Flywheels; Hybrid computers; Hybrid systems; Lead acid batteries; Lithium; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954674202

While the specific technique and effectiveness of the circuits have varied, an important goal is still out of reach for many desired applications: to produce sufficient and sustained power. This is due in part to the power requirements of the control circuits themselves. One method for increasing the robustness and versatility of energy harvesting systems which has started to receive some attention would be to utilize multiple energy sources simultaneously. If some or all of the present energy sources were harvested, the amount of constant power which could be provided to the system electronics would increase dramatically. This work examines two passive circuit topologies, parallel and series, for combining multiple piezoelectric energy harvesters onto a single storage capacitor using an LTspice simulation. The issue of the relative phase between the two piezoelectric signals is explored to show that the advantages of both configurations are significantly affected by increased relative phase values. © 2011 SPIE.","Energy harvesting; Multi-source; Piezoelectric","Constant power; Control circuitry; Control circuits; Energy harvesting systems; Energy source; Geometric optimization; Multi-source; Multisources; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric energy; Piezoelectric signals; Power managements; Power requirement; Relative phase; Storage capacitor; System electronics; Electric network topology; Energy management; Integrated control; Passive networks; Piezoelectricity; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958148378

The device consists of an electromagnetic generator located close to ground level, attached via an inelastic cord to a point on the trunk of a 5-6 meter tall eucalypt tree. The device uses the movement of the tree to drive the generator in one direction, rotationally, and a mass to keep the cord taught when the tree returns to its resting position. The electrical output is sent to electrical circuitry that rectifies, stores and switches the electrical power to supply a wireless sensor node. The initial configuration stored energy in a super-capacitor, the voltage of which indicates storage charge level. Once there was sufficient power to operate the sensor node it transmits local information such as temperature, and energy state, in terms of capacitor voltage, to a base node located approximately 80m away. Results show that there is sufficient energy in this method to power a wireless sensor node continuously in wind as low as 3-4m/s. In order to allow continuous operation in lower wind speeds a number of alterations have been investigated. These are reported here and include: operation with a secondary battery in place of the storage capacitor, increasing the electrical storage capacity and varying the connection point on the tree and the electronic duty cycle. © 2011 SPIE.","Energy harvesting; Energy scavenging; Movement energy; Power harvesting; Sensor network; Tree movement; Vibration energy; Wireless sensor","Energy scavenging; Movement energy; Power harvesting; Tree movement; Vibration energy; Wireless sensor; Capacitors; Electric network synthesis; Integrated control; Plant extracts; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958127454

The poor operational time of multimedia terminals makes computationally demanding applications impractical in real scenarios. For instance, the so-called smart-phones are currently unable to remain in operation longer than several hours. The OMAP3530 processor basically consists of two processing cores, a General Purpose Processor (GPP) and a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The former, an ARM Cortex-A8 processor, is aimed to run a generic Operating System (OS) while the latter, a DSP core based on the C64x+, has architecture optimized for video processing. The BeagleBoard, a commercial prototyping board based on the OMAP processor, has been used to test the Android Operating System and measure its performance. The board has 128 MB of SDRAM external memory, 256 MB of Flash external memory and several interfaces. Note that the clock frequency of the ARM and DSP OMAP cores is 600 MHz and 430 MHz, respectively. This paper describes the energy consumption estimation of the processes and multimedia applications of an Android v1.6 (Donut) OS on the OMAP3530-Based BeagleBoard. In addition, tools to communicate the two processing cores have been employed. A test-bench to profile the OS resource usage has been developed. As far as the energy estimates concern, the OMAP processor energy consumption model provided by the manufacturer has been used. The model is basically divided in two energy components. The former, the baseline core energy, describes the energy consumption that is independent of any chip activity. The latter, the module active energy, describes the energy consumed by the active modules depending on resource usage. © 2011 SPIE.","Android; Embedded systems; Energy consumption estimation; OMAP","Active energy; Android; Clock frequency; Core energy; Design goal; DSP core; Energy components; Energy consumption model; Energy estimates; Energy optimization; External memory; General purpose processors; Multimedia applications; Multimedia embedded systems; Multimedia terminals; OMAP; Processing core; Resource usage; System levels; Test-bench; Video processing; Computer architecture; Digital signal processors; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Estimation; Flash memory; Optimization; Real time systems; Robots; Signal processing; VLSI circuits; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958041886

The overall emission spectrum consists of a 400 nm wide band centered at ∼600 nm which depends little on the grating amplitude, metal, or e-beam energy. For the larger grating amplitudes the emission spectrum is periodically modulated as a function of wavelength. Both the strength of the emission envelop and the depth and phase of the modulation depend on grating orientation with respect to the light collection axis, the distance of the excitation spot from the grating, and the distance between the grating and the collection optics. The modulation can be explained as interference of surface emission from grating bars and grooves. The origin of the emission remains unclear, as mechanisms of electron collision with image charge, transition radiation, surface contamination, and inverse photo-electron effect all fail to explain the observed spectrum.

First, the fabrication of planar alkaline cell batteries compatible with MEMS scale power storage applications is shown. Both mm scale and sub-mm scale individual cells and batteries have been constructed. The chosen coplanar electrode geometry allows for easy fabrication of series connected cells enabling higher voltage while simplifying the cell sealing and electrode formation. The Zn/Ag alkaline system is used due to the large operating voltage, inherent charge capacity, long shelf life, and ease of fabrication. Several cells have been constructed using both plated and spun-on silver. The plated cells are shown to be limited in performance due to inadequate surface area and porosity; however, the cells made from spun-on colloidal silver show reasonable charge capacity and power performance with current densities of up to 200 uA/mm2 and charge capacities of up to 18 mA-s/mm2.

However, piezoceramic materials are often prone to breakage and are difficult to apply to curved surfaces when in their monolithic form. One approach to alleviate these issues is to embed the fragile piezoceramic inclusion into a polymer matrix. The flexible nature of the polymer matrix protects the ceramic from breaking under mechanical loading and makes the resulting compoistes easier to apply onto curved structure. However, most developed active ceramic composites have relatively low electroelastic coupling compared to bulk piezoceramics. There are two main methods to improve the eletroelastic properties of piezoceramic composites, namely using higher aspect ratio active inclusions and alignment of inclusions in the electric field direction. In this paper, the dielectric and energy storage property of nanowire composites is significantly enhanced by aligning the nanowires in the direction of the applied electrical field. PZT nanowires are hydrothermally synthesized and solution-cast into a polymer matrix, and then aligned using a shear flow based stretching method. The alignment was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy images and it is shown that the nanowires can be successfully aligned in the PVDF. The dielectric constant and energy density of the nanocomposites were tested using Agilent E4980A LCR meter and Sawyer-Tower circuit. This testing result shows that the dielectric constant and energy density of the composites can be increased by as much as 35.7% and 49.3% by aligning the nanowires in the electric field direction. Piezoceramic composites with enhanced energy storage property could lead to broader applications when using this type of materials for polymer based capacitive energy storage. © 2011 SPIE.","Nanocomposite; Nanowires; Piezoelectric; PZT","Agilent; Capacitive energy storage; Ceramic composites; Curved structure; Curved surfaces; Dielectric constants; Electric-field directions; Electrical field; Electroelastic coupling; Energy density; Hydrothermally synthesized; LCR meters; Mechanical loading; Monolithic forms; Nanowire composites; Piezo-ceramics; Piezoceramic; Piezoceramic materials; Piezoelectric; Polymer based; Power harvesting; PZT; Sawyer-Tower circuit; Scanning electron microscopy image; Solution-cast; Storage properties; Testing results; Vibration sensing; Alignment; Aspect ratio; Ceramic materials; Electric fields; Electric properties; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Flywheels; Inclusions; Nanocomposites; Nanowires; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectricity; Polymer matrix; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear flow; Storage (materials); Structural health monitoring; Electric wire",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957856223

The process roughly consists in repeated series of alternate reduction and oxidation steps in which a reducing stream (H 2 + CO, or in general H2 enriched fuels) reacts with the iron oxide rendering the metal or a partially reduced oxide. Pure hydrogen is released during the re-oxidation with steam. The studied iron ores contain some impurities that accounting minor percentages (&lt;10 wt%) enhance the behaviour of the solid. This improvement regards not only to the reduction and oxidation rate, but especially to the ability of the solid to maintain a given redox capacity along cycles. Also concerning this topic, the effect of the presence of these natural additives has been investigated in order to determine the inert behaviour of methane as a potential reducing agent.

A wide range of microporosities was obtained when the second step pyrolysis temperature was maintained between 400 and 450 °C for 0.5-2 h. The optimal H2 storage was obtained using 1 h pyrolysis in this temperature range. The maximum excess H2 storage capacity was 1.5 wt% at 77 K and at pressures below 2 MPa.

Regarding this, the feasibility of decalin as a promising hydrogen carrier is investigated in this study. The performance of decalin thermally coupled membrane reactor (DCTCMR) is compared with cyclohexane thermally coupled membrane reactor (CTCMR) for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) in gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology. Some important parameters such as hydrogen production rate, H2 recovery yield, exothermic and endothermic temperature profiles and etc. are considered as criteria to recognize the most appropriate configuration. A comparison between the modeling results of two coupled configurations shows that DCTCMR is superior to CTCMR owing to achieving remarkably higher hydrogen production (seventeen times) compared with CTCMR. Furthermore, considerably higher H2 recovery yield (about twelve times) and faster dehydrogenation reaction rate in DCTCMR than CTCMR proposes decalin as one of the best hydrogen carriers.

In order to improve the hydrogen storage properties, the influence of MoCl3 as an additive on the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties of LiBH 4-MgH2 system is investigated. The reversible hydrogen storage performance is significantly improved, which leads to a capacity of about 7 wt.% hydrogen at 300 °C. XRD analysis reveals that the metallic Mo is formed by the reaction between LiBH4 and MoCl3, which is highly dispersed in the sample and results in improved dehydrogenation and hydrogenation performance of LiBH4-MgH2 system.

This project develops two power harvesting technologies. First, a novel parametric frequency-increased generator (PFIG) is developed. The fabricated PFIG harvests the non-periodic and unprecedentedly low frequency (DC to 30 Hz) and low acceleration (0.55-9.8 m/s2) mechanical energy available on bridges with an average power &gt; 2 μW. Prototype power conversion and storage electronics were designed and the harvester system was used to charge a capacitor from arbitrary bridge-like vibrations. Second, an RF scavenger operating at medium and shortwave frequencies has been designed and tested. Power scavenging at MHz frequencies allows for lower antenna directivities, reducing sensitivity to antenna positioning. Furthermore, ambient RF signals at these frequencies have higher power levels away from cities and residential areas compared to the UHF and SHF bands utilized for cellular communication systems. An RF power scavenger operating at 1 MHz along with power management and storage circuitry has been demonstrated.

Unfortunately plugging in traffic lights into the electrical grid is expensive and complex. This paper reports about the energetic, the electronic and the optical design and building of a wireless and batteryless biflash installation in the framework of a flemish SME supporting program. The energy is supplied by a small solar panel and is buffered by supercapacitors instead of batteries. This has the advantage of being maintenance free: the number of charge-discharge cycles is almost unlimited because there is no chemical reaction involved in the storage mechanism. On the other hand the limited energy storage capacity of supercapacitors requires a new approach for the system design. Based on the EN-12352 standard for warning light devices, all design choices were filled in to be as energy efficient as possible. The duty cycle and the light output of the high power led flashlights are minimized. The components for the electronic circuits for the led driver, the control and the RF communication are selected based on their energy consumption and power management techniques are implemented. A lot of energy is saved by making the biflash system active. The leds are only flashing on demand or at preprogrammed moments. A biflash installation is typically installed at both sides of a crosswalk. A call at one of the sides should result in flashing at both sides. To maintain the drag and drop principle, a wireless RF communication system is designed. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","High power leds; Solar energy; Supercaps; Traffic signalisation","Battery-less; Charge-discharge cycle; Drag and drop; Duty cycles; Electrical grids; Electronic circuits; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy storage capacity; High power LED; LED drivers; Light output; Maintenance free; Power management techniques; RF communication; Solar panels; Storage mechanism; Super capacitor; Supercaps; System design; Traffic light; Traffic signalisation; Warning lights; Capacitors; Communication systems; Energy utilization; Flashlights; Manufacture; Optical design; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Technical presentations; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956198097

The proper management of energy resources is a critical component in the design of any deployed sensing network. For systems that are installed in remote or inaccessible locations, or those with an operational lifespan that exceeds traditional battery technologies, energy harvesting is an attractive alternative. Unfortunately, the dependence on a single energy source (i.e. solar) can cause potential problems when environmental conditions preclude the system from operating at peak performance. In this paper we consider the use of a hybrid energy source that extracts energy from multiple sources and uses this collective energy to power sensing hardware. The sources considered in this work include: solar, vibration, thermal gradients, and RF energy capture. Methods of increasing the efficiency, energy storage medium, target applications and the integrated use of energy harvesting sources with wireless energy transmission will be discussed. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","embedded sensing; Energy harvesting; hybrid power system","Battery technology; Critical component; Embedded sensing; Embedded sensors; Energy capture; Energy source; Environmental conditions; Hybrid energy; Hybrid energy sources; Hybrid power systems; Life span; Multiple source; Peak performance; Potential problems; Power sensing; Power sources; Sensing networks; Target application; Wireless energy transmission; Energy resources; Harvesting; Radiofrequency spectroscopy; Sensor nodes; Solar energy; Telecommunication equipment; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956116411

Combining the various functionalities of conducting polymers to create single-substrate, integrated systems remains a challenge, as chemical and electrical insulation barriers, adhesion techniques, and the possibility of scaling need to be taken into consideration. Here fabrication techniques for combining multiple conducting polymer components by means of electrically insulated, mechanical attachments are developed. Electrochemically synthesized polypyrrole substrates were coated with thin films of polystyrene, Parylene, and polyimide. The isotonic actuation performance of each coated film was evaluated in comparison to non-coated films, with an observed decrease in peak-to-peak maximum strain output near 95% (polystyrene and Parylene), 20% (vacuum, 0.8 Pa), 50% (curing at 110°C) and 20% (localized polyimide deposition). The chemical barrier properties of each manufacturing technique were evaluated by exposing the coated polypyrrole substrates to an oxidative chemical vapor deposition of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Vapor-deposited PEDOT made the insulation layers of polystyrene and Parylene conductive at thicknesses up to four microns. Spin-coated films of polyimide, greater than ten microns thick, maintained electrical insulation properties after PEDOT depositions. Conducting polymer film-to-film attachments using each manufacturing technique were attempted, with polyimide working successfully when employed under a specific deposition, drying, and curing protocol, as discussed. Three dimensional conducting polymer actuation systems composed of actuators, length sensors, and energy storage devices were constructed on flexible, single substrates. These results build a foundation upon which scalable, self-powered, polymer actuation systems can be developed. © 2011 SPIE.","Actuators; Conducting polymers; Energy storage; Polypyrrole; Strain","Actuation systems; Chemical barriers; Coated films; Electrical components; Electrical insulation; Electrical insulation properties; Energy storage devices; Fabrication technique; Force sensor; Insulation layers; Integrated systems; Manufacturing techniques; Multicomponents; Parylenes; Poly(3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); Self-powered; Spin-coated films; Actuators; Chemical vapor deposition; Conducting polymers; Curing; Electric properties; Energy storage; Flywheels; Functional polymers; Manufacture; Organic conductors; Plastic coatings; Plastic films; Polyimides; Polymer films; Polypyrroles; Polystyrenes; Sensors; Storage (materials); Virtual storage; Substrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955896855

A new class of ferroelectric polymers, i.e., the terpolymers of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) or of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), was developed from the normal ferroelectric PVDF-TrFE polymer by employing proper defect modifications which eliminate detrimental effects associated with a normal first order F-P transition while maintaining high material responses. Relevant studies show that this class of electroactive polymers offers unique properties in comparison with other ferroelectric polymers. The syntheses of these relaxor ferroelectric polymers have been done by a combination of the suspension polymerization process and an oxygen-activated initiator at a temperature of 40 °C. Films from cast solution can be made in different length and thicknesses. Stretching of these films increases the performance as well as the mechanical properties.

Unfortunately, the costs of these devices have been rather high. This is partially due to the involved clean-room processes, but also due to the fact that these devices generally rely on expensive precious-metals such as Pd and Pt. Therefore we developed a novel integrated FC type accumulator that is based on non-precious-metals only. The key component of the presented accumulator is its alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane that allows not only the usage of a low-cost AB5 type hydrogen storage electrode, but also the usage of La0.6Ca 0.4CoO3 as a precious-metal free bifunctional catalyst for the air-breathing electrode. Additionally the presented design requires only comparatively few cleanroom processes which further reduces the overall production costs. Although abdicating precious-metals, the presented accumulator shows an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V and a maximum power density of 0.66 mW cm-2 which is comparable or even superior to former precious-metal based cells. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The significantly larger theoretical energy density of the lithium-oxygen batteries is due to the use of a pure lithium metal anode and the fact that the cathode oxidant, oxygen, is stored externally since it can be readily obtained from the surrounding air. Before the lithium-oxygen batteries can be realized as high performance, commercially viable products, there are still many challenges to overcome, from designing their cathode structure, to optimizing their electrolyte compositions and elucidating the complex chemical reactions that occur during charge and discharge. The scientific obstacles that are related to the performance of the lithium-oxygen batteries open up an exciting opportunity for researchers from many different backgrounds to utilize their unique knowledge and skills to bridge the knowledge gaps that exist in current research projects.

The preparation of the composite material with composition of MgH2-5 at% (TiCr1.2Fe0.6) was performed by co-milling of commercial available MgH2 powder with the body-centered cubic (bcc) alloy either in the form of Ti-Cr-Fe powder mixture with the proper mass fraction (sample A) or prealloyed TiCr1.2Fe0.6 powder (sample B). The prealloyed powder with an average crystallite size of 14 nm and particle size of 384 nm was prepared by the mechanical alloying process. It is shown that the addition of the Ti-based bcc alloy to magnesium hydride yields a finer particle size and grain structure after mechanical alloying. As a result, the desorption temperature of mechanically activated MgH2 for 4 h decreased from 327 °C to 262 °C for sample A and 241 °C for sample B. A high dehydrogenation capacity (∼5 wt%) at 300 °C is also obtained. The effect of the Ti-based alloy on improvement of the dehydrogenation is discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this optical network, we introduced an adaptive algorithm for concurrent peer-to-peer communications, by utilizing optical nonlinearity depending only on the signal strength passing through the network. This method is applicable for autonomous organization of functions for ad-hoc electric power distribution systems for the power grid. For this purpose, a simple optical- electrical hybrid bistable circuit composed of such as light emitting diode (LED) and photo diode (PD), has been incorporated into the network node. In the experiment, the method uses a simple, local adaptation of transmission weights at each network node, which enables self-organizing functions of the network, such as self-routing, self-optimization, self-recovery and self-protection. Based on this method, we have demonstrated experimentally a new smart grid model applicable for ad-hoc electric power distribution systems mediated by power comsumptions. In this model, electric power flow is controlled autonomously through the self-organized network nodes associated with individual power facilities having photovoltaics and electric storage devices, etc., and the nodes convert the amounts of electric power supply and/or comsumption to the light intensity values using above mentioned transmission weights at each node. As a consequence, we have experimentally demonstrated a simple shorthaul system model for ad-hoc electric power distribution with a self-organized optical network as a novel green photonics technology application for smart grid. © 2010 COPYRIGHT SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","adaptive algorithm; green photonics; hybrid electrical-optical network equipment; optical bistability; peer-to-peer electrical power transmission; self-organizing network; short-haul systems; smart grid","Bi-stability; green photonics; hybrid electrical-optical network equipment; peer-to-peer electrical power transmission; self-organizing network; short-haul systems; Smart grid; Ad hoc networks; Adaptive algorithms; Electric energy storage; Electric lines; Electric load distribution; Electric power distribution; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Fiber optic networks; Light emitting diodes; Metropolitan area networks; Optical bistability; Photonics; Smart power grids; Thermoelectric equipment; Virtual storage; Peer to peer networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955446889

The obtained results showed that the reduction of the MHCS's cell size combined with an external cooling design configuration permits better use of the storage system.

The TiO2 NPs are deposited on the surface of MWCNTs by sol-gel method. Structural and morphological characterizations have been carried out using XRD, SEM and TEM, respectively. TiO2 NPs can significantly enhance the discharge capacity of MWCNTs. The cyclic voltammograms analysis indicates that the electrical double layer contributes little to the discharge capacity of TiO2-decorated MWCNTs. The MWCNTs modified with a certain amount of TiO2 NPs have a discharge capacity of 540 mAh/g, corresponding to an electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of about 2.02 wt%, which is quite interesting for the battery applications. The enhancement effect of TiO2 NPs on the discharge capacity of MWCNTs could be related to the increased effective area for the adsorption of hydrogen atoms in the presence of TiO2 NPs on MWCNTs and the preferable redox ability of TiO2 NPs.

However, the slow kinetics, irreversibility, and formation of volatile materials (borazine and ammonia) of AB limit its practical application. In this paper, new strategies by doping AB in metal-organic framework MIL-101 (denoted as AB/MIL-101) or in Ni modified MIL-101 (denoted as AB/Ni@MIL-101) are developed for hydrogen storage. In AB/MIL-101 samples, dehydrogenation did not present any induction period and undesirable by-product borazine, and decomposition thermodynamics and kinetics are improved. For AB/Ni@MIL-101, the peak temperature of AB dehydrogenation was shifted to 75 °C, which is the first report of such a big decrease (40 °C) in the decomposition temperature of AB. Furthermore, borazine and ammonia emissions that are harmful for proton exchange membrane fuel cells, were not detected. The interaction between AB and MIL-101 is discussed based on both theoretical calculations and experiments. Results show that Cr-N and B-O bonds have generated in AB/MIL-101 nanocomposites, and the decomposition mechanism of AB has changed. Copyright © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

These gaskets/seals in PEM fuel cells are exposed to acidic, humid air, mechanical compressive pressure and cyclic temperature environment. Both the physical and chemical long-term stabilities of these gaskets/seals are therefore crucial to the overall performance of the fuel cell. Chemical degradation of five elastomeric gasket materials in a simulated and an aggressive accelerated fuel cell solution at 80 °C up to 63 weeks was investigated in this work using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) which assesses the change of dynamic mechanical properties of the five materials samples as they aged. The storage, loss modulus, and tan δ of the materials were presented that can reveal the glass transition temperature and other properties. The five materials tested are copolymeric resin (CR), liquid silicone rubber (LSR), fluorosilicone rubber (FSR), ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM), and fluoroelastomer copolymer (FKM).

The completion of decarbonization ultimately depends on the production and use of pure hydrogen as energy carrier. With respect to electricity, which is currently the most relevant and clean energy carrier, hydrogen has a fundamental advantage that it can be stored efficiently. In this research context, we propose a Peer-to-Peer Hydrogen Economy Framework based on decentralized production, storage and trading of energy. We apply the peer-to-peer paradigm for designing a virtual network, where peer software entities implement distributed algorithms for the localization of remote energy providers. The proposed approach has many advantages, both technical (availability, robustness, scalability) and socio-economic (shared responsibilities and improved competition).

The safety of hydrogen infrastructure is one of the crucial pre-requisites for a sustainable economy and accordingly, its design should be made based upon the performance to investigate and evaluate the risks from or out of the required infrastructure. In order to support strategic decision-making for safe hydrogen infrastructure, this study proposes an appropriate index-based risk assessment model. The model evaluates the hydrogen infrastructure using the relative risk ranking of the hydrogen activities such as hydrogen production, storage and transportation, and the relative impact levels of regions. The relative risk rankings of the hydrogen activities are rated a quantitative risk analysis, whereas the relative impact level of regions is rated based on the regional characteristics such as population density. With consideration of regional characteristics, the proposed model makes it possible not only to assess the risks of processes and technologies associated with hydrogen but also to compare the relative safety levels of the hydrogen infrastructures made up with various hydrogen activities. In order to show the features and capabilities of the model, four future hydrogen infrastructure scenarios in Korea are examined in the study. The result shows that distributed production, and mass storage and transportation via liquefied hydrogen facility are relatively safer than centralized production, and compressed-gaseous hydrogen storage and transportation, respectively.

Beside the insights about the electricity market (prices do not correlate the demand; they are related to the supply-and-demand hardness), advances in modelling discontinuous operation are proposed. An optimum production cost is found that induces a profit of 4%, with regard to a plant that would work continuously. Specific attention should be given to related overcosts: additional degradation due to frequent transitions from the minimum electrolyser load to the nominal one, higher maintenance needs, and hydrogen storage costs. Such an operating mode would also greatly benefit from a reduction of the electrolyser prices. However, the state-of-the-art as regards the electrolyser minimum loads and transition time appears satisfactory. Copyright © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Further increase up to 25 h did not cause change in the discharge capacities considerably. Among the Mg1-xPd xNi ternary alloys, Mg0.93Pd0.07Ni alloy was observed to exhibit the best charge/discharge cyclic performance. The hydrogen storage capacity of the high-Pd-containing alloys (Mg1-xPd xNi; x &gt; 0.07) deteriorated as Pd content of the alloy increased. This observation was attributed to the Mg-Pd phase formations. According to the EIS experiments as Pd atomic ratio increased up to 0.07 the charge transfer resistances of the alloys decreased.

The electrical efficiency of SOFCs is particularly high, so that such systems are very attractive for integration in complex polygeneration systems. In this paper, the integration of SOFC systems with solar thermal collector is investigated seeking to design a novel polygeneration system producing: electricity, space heating and cooling and domestic hot water, for a university building located in Naples (Italy), assumed as case study. The polygeneration system is based on the following main components: concentrating parabolic through solar collectors, a double-stage LiBr-H2O absorption chiller and an ambient pressure SOFC fuel cell. The system also includes a number of additional components required for the balance of plant, such as: storage tanks, heat exchangers, pumps, controllers, cooling tower, etc. The SOFC operates at full load, producing electric energy that is in part self-consumed for powering building lights and equipments, and in part is used for operating the system itself; the electric energy in excess is eventually released to the grid and sold to the public Company that operates the grid itself. The system was designed and then simulated by means of a zero-dimensional transient simulation model, developed using the TRNSYS software; the investigation of the dynamic behavior of the building is also included. The results of the case study were analyzed for different time bases, from both energetic and economic points of view. Finally, a thermoeconomic optimization is also presented aiming at determining the optimal set of system design parameters. The economic results show that the system under investigation may be profitable, provided that it is properly funded. However, the overall energetic and economic results are more encouraging than those claimed for other similar polygeneration systems in the recent literature. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The development of catalyst materials for on demand NaBH4 hydrolysis, and the design of practical reaction systems for hydrogen storage based on NaBH4 are key research areas. Progress in the former area has been promising, with many non-noble catalysts being reported with activities comparable to those of higher-cost noble metal catalysts. However, the design of practical hydrogen storage systems remains a critical issue, as identified by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in their ""No-Go"" recommendation in 2007. The problems of by-product precipitation and catalyst blockage at high NaBH4 concentrations must be addressed in order to produce a hydrogen storage system capable of meeting the DOE target of 5.5 wt% H2 (2015). It is likely that a new, novel reaction system design will be required to achieve these targets, given the limitations identified in conventional systems. Moreover, a new process for regenerating spent NaBH4 will need to be developed, in order to lower its cost to a viable level for use as a transportation fuel. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This paper evaluates in details the iron-based chemical looping system used for hydrogen production in conjunction with natural gas and syngas produced from coal and lignite gasification. The paper assesses the potential applications of natural gas and syngas chemical looping combustion systems to generate hydrogen. Investigated plant concepts with natural gas and syngas-based chemical looping method produce 500 MW hydrogen (based on lower heating value) covering ancillary power consumption with an almost total decarbonisation rate of the fossil fuels used. The paper presents in details the plant concepts and the methodology used to evaluate the performances using critical design factors like: gasifier feeding system (various fuel transport gases), heat and power integration analysis, potential ways to increase the overall energy efficiency (e.g. steam integration of chemical looping unit into the combined cycle), hydrogen and carbon dioxide quality specifications considering the use of hydrogen in transport (fuel cells) and carbon dioxide storage in geological formation or used for EOR. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Arrays of vertical magnesium nanorods were deposited by the DC magnetron sputtering glancing angle deposition technique, while the magnesium thin films were deposited using the same system but at normal incidence. The morphologies and corresponding crystal structure of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction methods, respectively. We report that the Mg thin films showed oxidation induced weight gain starting from room temperature. On the other hand, Mg nanorods did not show any indication of significant oxidation at temperatures below 350 °C. Enhanced oxidation resistance of Mg nanorods was also confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance measurements. At temperatures higher than 350 °C, Mg nanorods started to get oxidized and their weight increased at a similar rate to that of Mg thin films. We argue that reduced oxidation of Mg nanorods is mainly attributed to their single crystal nature.

In this study, the critical energies for direct blast initiation of spherical detonations in hydrogen-nitrous oxide-Ar mixtures obtained from laboratory experiments and theoretical predictions at different initial conditions (i.e., different initial pressure, equivalence ratio and amount of argon dilution) are reported. In the experiments, direct initiation is achieved via a spark discharge from a high voltage and low inductance capacitor and the initiation energy is estimated accordingly from the current output. Characteristic detonation cell sizes of hydrogen-nitrous oxide-Ar mixtures are estimated from chemical kinetics using a recently updated reaction mechanism. A correlation expression is developed as a function of initial pressure, argon dilution and equivalence ratio, which is fitted to provide good estimation of the experimental measured data. The direct link between cell size and critical energy for direct blast initiation is then analyzed. Good agreement is found between experimental results and theoretical predictions, which make use of the cell size estimation correlation and the semi-empirical surface energy model. The effects of the initial pressure, equivalence ratio and the amount of Ar dilution on the critical initiation energy H2-N2O-Ar mixtures are investigated. By comparing the critical energies with those of H2-O2-Ar mixtures, it is shown that H2-N2O mixtures are more detonation sensitive with smaller initiation energies than H2-O2 mixtures at the same initial pressure, equivalence ratio and amount of argon dilution, except for higher diluted condition with amount of argon in the mixture above 20%. Attempt is made to explain the critical energy variation and comparison between the two H2-N2O-Ar and H 2-O2-Ar mixtures from the induction length analysis and detonation instability consideration. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TiF3 was doped into the composite for promoting this interaction and thus enhancing the hydrogen sorption properties. Experimental analysis on the LiAlH4-MgH2-TiF3 composite was performed via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal sorption, pressure-composition isotherms (PCI), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). For LiAlH4-MgH 2-TiF3 composite (mole ratio 1:1:0.05), the dehydrogenation temperature range starts from about 60 °C, which is 100 °C lower than for LiAlH4-MgH2. At 300 °C, the LiAlH4-MgH2-TiF3 composite can desorb 2.48 wt% hydrogen in 10 min during its second stage dehydrogenation, corresponding to the decomposition of MgH2. In contrast, 20 min was required for the LiAlH4-MgH2 sample to release so much hydrogen capacity under the same conditions. The hydrogen absorption properties of the LiAlH 4-MgH2-TiF3 composite were also improved significantly as compared to the LiAlH4-MgH2 composite. A hydrogen absorption capacity of 2.68 wt% under 300 °C and 20 atm H 2 pressure was reached after 5 min in the LiAlH4-MgH 2-TiF3 composite, which is larger than that of LiAlH 4-MgH2 (1.75 wt%).

From high pressure differential scanning calorimeter (HP-DSC) measurements it was found that these additives all effectively decrease the onset temperature of hydrogenation. The isothermal hydrogenation/dehydrogenation measurements suggest that Ti, TiH2, and TiB2 can significantly improve the hydrogen sorption kinetics of LiH/MgB2 mixture. The absorption kinetics of TiF3 and TiCl3 doped samples are slower than the baseline (2LiH-MgB2 without additive), but their desorption kinetics are faster than the baseline and other additives doped systems.

However, its hydrogen desorption enthalpy is too high for practical applications. In this paper, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to systematically study the effects of Al doping on dehydrogenation properties of Mg2NiH4, and the underlying dehydrogenation mechanism was investigated. The energetic calculations reveal that partial component substitution of Mg by Al results in a stabilization of the alloy Mg 2Ni and a destabilization of the hydride Mg2NiH 4, which significantly alters the hydrogen desorption enthalpy ΔHdes for the reaction Mg2NiH4 → Mg2Ni + 2H2. A desirable enthalpy value of ∼0.4 eV/H2 for application can be obtained for a doping level of x ≥ 0.35 in Mg2-xAlxNi alloy. The stability calculations by considering possible decompositions indicate that the Al-doped Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 exhibit thermodynamically unstable with respect to phase segregation, which explains well the experimental results that these doped materials are multiphase systems. The dehydrogenation reaction of Al-doped Mg2NiH4 is energetically favorable to perform from a metastable hydrogenated state to a multiphase dehydrogenated state composed of Mg2Ni and Mg3AlNi2 as well as NiAl intermetallics. Further analysis of density of states (DOS) suggests the improving of dehydrogenation properties of Al-doped Mg2NiH 4 can be attributed to the weakened Mg-Ni and Ni-H interactions and the decreasing bonding electrons number below Fermi level. The mechanistic understanding gained from this study can be applied to the selection and optimization of dopants for designing better hydrogen storage materials. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Phase change material (PCM) can adjust temperature through storing and releasing thermal energy during phase change process and has been used in thermal energy storage areas and building materials. However, the use of PCM to regulate the temperature of asphalt pavement has not been widely studied. In this paper, the feasibility of temperature self-control asphalt pavement using PCM was studied for preventing rutting. The temperature-control mechanism of asphalt pavement with PCM has been presented. The selection criteria of PCM used in asphalt pavement have been made. Meanwhile, a paraffin/expanded graphite shape-stabled phase change material with a phase change temperature range of 40°C~50°C has been used in this study. The temperature rising test of asphalt concrete showed that sample with PCM exhibited a lower temperature than the control sample, which indicates that it is feasible to use PCM in asphalt pavement for lowering temperature and preventing rutting. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications.","asphalt pavement; high temperature; phase change material; rutting","Asphalt concretes; Control mechanism; Control samples; During phase; Graphite shape; high temperature; Phase change temperature; rutting; Selection criteria; Temperature rising; Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Building materials; Construction equipment; Heat storage; Information science; Materials science; Roads and streets; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955113884

Diode-pumped systems based on ytterbium-doped crystals have a huge interest thanks to their good thermal and spectroscopic properties. Among them, Yb:CaF2, shows very promising results for short pulse generation, and its long fluorescence lifetime, 2.4 ms, indicates a high energy storage capacity. We present a diode-pumped regenerative amplifier based on an Yb:CaF2 crystal optimized to produce short pulses for various repetition rates ranging from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The experiment is performed with a 2.6-% Yb doped 5-mm-long CaF2 crystal grown by using the Bridgman technique and used at Brewster angle. To optimize the injection pulse spectrum in terms of bandwidth and maximum gain, the seed pulses are generated by a broadband Yb:CALGO oscillator centered at 1043 nm with a FWHM bandwidth of 15 nm at a repetition rate of 27 MHz. The pulses are then stretched to 260 ps with a transmission grating. The shortest pulse duration generated is 178-fs, and the corresponding energy is 1.4 mJ before compression (620 μJ after), at a repetition rate of 500 Hz for 16 W of pump power. The bandwidth is 10 nm centered at 1040 nm. At 10 kHz repetition rate, 1.4 W of average power before compression is obtained, corresponding to an optical-optical efficiency of 10%. We also noticed that the pulse duration tends to increase above 1 kHz, reaching 400 fs at 10 kHz. © 2011 SPIE.","Regenerative amplifier; Ultrafast laser; Ytterbium doped material","Average power; Brewster angle; Bridgman techniques; Diode-pumped; Diode-pumped systems; Energetic pulse; Fluorescence lifetimes; FWHM bandwidth; High energy; Injection pulse; Maximum gain; Optical-optical efficiency; Pulse durations; Pump power; Regenerative amplifier; Repetition rate; Scientific applications; Seed pulse; Short pulse; Short pulse generation; Spectroscopic property; Transmission gratings; Ultra-fast; Ytterbium doped material; Ytterbium-doped crystals; Bandwidth; Diodes; Optical pumping; Optimization; Pulse repetition rate; Solid state lasers; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrafast phenomena; Ytterbium; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954469722

Nowadays, many applications of FLABs require reduction of the charge duration, for instance, a 4 h-charge for FLABs in grid energy storage or 1 h-charge for FLABs in electric buses. These are called accelerated charge and fast charge. Such reductions of charge time imply the use of a new charge process. One way to reduce the charge duration is to perform an early destratification step without waiting for the end of charge. The new charge method proposed in this paper (early destratification method - ED) focuses on the reduction of the charge time for FLABs using early destratification, which is performed and controlled using charge acceptance measurement during the charge. Laboratory experiments presented here aim first to develop charge acceptance measurements followed by an ED charge method compared to an IUi traditional charge process. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The parameter values of a supercapacitor can be determined by a charging-redistribution experiment and a self-discharge experiment. The modeling and characterization procedures are illustrated using a 22F supercapacitor. The accuracy of the model is compared with that of other models often used in power electronics applications. The results show that the proposed model has better accuracy in characterizing the self-discharge process while maintaining similar performance as other models during charging and redistribution processes. Additionally, the proposed model is evaluated in a simplified energy storage system for self-powered wireless sensors. The model performance is compared with that of a commonly used energy recursive equation (ERE) model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can predict the evolution profile of voltage across the supercapacitor more accurately than the ERE model, and therefore provides a better alternative for supporting research on storage system design and power management for wireless sensor networks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By on-board renewable electricity generation and storage, it accounts for all aspects of living, such as space heating and cooking as well as providing a purified rainwater supply and wastewater treatment, excluding food supply. Uninterrupted, on-demand energy and water supply are the key challenges. Off-grid renewable power supply fluctuations on daily and seasonal time scales impose production gaps that have to be served by local storage, a function normally fulfilled by the grid. While daily variations only obligate a small storage capacity, requirements for seasonal storage are substantial. The energy supply for SELF is reviewed based on real meteorological data and demand patterns for Zurich, Switzerland. A battery system with propane for cooking serves as a reference for battery-only and hybrid battery/hydrogen systems. In the latter, hydrogen is used for cooking and electricity generation. The analysis shows that hydrogen is ideal for long term bulk energy storage on a seasonal timescale, while batteries are best suited for short term energy storage. Although the efficiency penalty from hydrogen generation is substantial, in off-grid systems, this parameter is tolerable since the harvesting ratio of photovoltaic energy is limited by storage capacity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Structural and morphological characterizations of RuO2 are investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. The TEM images of as prepared material show the uniform distribution of RuO2 nanoparticles with mean diameter of ca. 1.5 nm. Analysis on as prepared material indicates the structural formula as [RuO2·2.6H2O] 0.7H 2O with low crystallinity. The influence of annealing temperature on RuO2 is studied in light of electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and capacitance. Electrochemical performances of RuO2 electrodes are followed by current-potential curves, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles and evolved oxygen measurements. The amount of oxygen gas evolved during the OER by the crystalline RuO2 is found to be consistent with the electrical energy supplied to the catalyst. The cyclic voltammogram of RuO2 exhibits the typical capacitance behavior with highly reversible nature. The specific capacitance of hydrous RuO2 is found to be 737 F g-1 at the scan rate of 2 mV s-1, by the balanced transport of proton through the structural water and electron transport along dioxo bridges, which makes a suitable material for energy storage. The specific capacitance decreases with increase in the crystallinity of RuO2.

A nanostructured eutectic Mg-Mg2Ni is formed upon solidification which introduces a large area of interfaces along which hydrogen diffusion can occur with high diffusivity. After a few cycles of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, an ultrafine porous structure formed in the eutectic Mg-Mg 2Ni and some cracks developed along the interface between the eutectic and the α-Mg matrix. This indicates that hydrogen atoms introduced into the alloys preferentially migrate along the interfaces in the nanostructured eutectic which enables effective short-range diffusion of hydrogen. Furthermore, transition metals (TMs) such as Nb, Ti and V in the range 240-560 ppm are added directly to molten Mg-10 wt% Ni alloys and are found to form intermetallic compounds with Ni during solidification. The alloys can store 5.6-6.3 wt% hydrogen at 350 °C and 2 MPa. TM-rich intermetallics distributed homogeneously in the cast alloys appear to play a key role in accelerating the nucleation of Mg from MgH2 upon dehydrogenation. This leads to a significant improvement in the hydrogen desorption kinetics. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, this development is generally thought to be based on a gradual, decentralised evolution. Nevertheless, in this paper it is argued that, taking into account the entire hydrogen chain (production, transport, storage, distribution and end-use), this decentralised fuel-cell based philosophy shows some serious flaws. Therefore, a new hydrogen-transition approach was pushed forward: mixing in of hydrogen into the natural-gas bulk. Using Flanders - the Northern part of Belgium - as a case study, the development of a transitory hydrogen infrastructure has been studied, taking into account the entire hydrogen chain and its dynamics, from production to end use. In a next step, this transition is being quantified. An optimisation model has been developed using Matlab and the commercial solvers GAMS and CPLEX. Following a mixed-integer linear-programming approach, this model is able to determine the economically optimal hydrogen-production mix and operational behaviour of each hydrogen-production plant separately. The model then allows gaining valuable insights in the importance of storage and the influence of fuel prices and carbon taxes with regard to the development of an early hydrogen economy. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium for energy and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is more particularly advantageous and efficient when the electrolyzer is simply coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines the operation of alkaline water electrolysis coupled with solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation with emphasis on the electrolyzer efficiency. PV generator is simulated using Matlab/Simulink to obtain its characteristics under different operating conditions with solar irradiance and temperature variations. The experimental alkaline water electrolysis system is built in the fluid mechanics laboratory of Menoufiya University and tested at certain input voltages and currents which are fed from the PV generator. The effects of voltage, solution concentration of electrolyte and the space between the pair of electrodes on the amount of hydrogen produced by water electrolysis as well as the electrolyzer efficiency are experimentally investigated. The water electrolysis of different potassium hydroxide aqueous solutions is conducted under atmospheric pressure using stainless steel electrodes. The experimental results showed that the performance of water electrolysis unit is highly affected by the voltage input and the gap between the electrodes. Higher rates of produced hydrogen can be obtained at smaller space between the electrodes and also at higher voltage input. The maximum electrolyzer efficiency is obtained at the smallest gap between electrodes, however, for a specified input voltage value within the range considered. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The atomic and electronic structure optimizations were carried out using hybrid density functional theory within the linear combination of atomic orbitals-molecular orbital (LCAO-MO) approach. The results show that all metal ions bind the corannulene ring through charge transfer complex formation. Moreover, the site preference of metal ion adsorption depends on the size of the cation. While the larger size cation prefers to bind on the concave surface, the smaller cation stabilizes on the convex surface. Subsequently, we have carried out the interaction of molecular hydrogen with the clean and doped corannulene complexes. A significant improvement of H 2 binding on the doped corannulene was observed in comparison to that of clean surface. This has been attributed to the charge-induced polarization of the H-H bond. Based on the binding energy and hydrogen uptake considerations, it is inferred that Na+ doped corannulene is the best candidate among all metal ions considered here.

During the preparation, the growth of the Mg nanoparticles was confined by the carbon from the decomposition of acetylene. The size of the Mg particles exhibited a clear decreasing trend with increasing acetylene fraction in the plasma. Due to the short diffusion distance and large specific surface area, the kinetics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the small Mg nanoparticles were improved.

B-N compounds such as ammonia-triborane, ammonia-borane and amine-borane adducts are well suited for this purpose due to their light weight, high gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity and inclination for bearing protic (N-H) and hydridic (B-H) hydrogens. In addition to them, more recent study [26] has showed that hydrazine borane with a gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 15.4% wt needs to be considered as another B-N compound that can be used for the storage of hydrogen. Herein we report for the first time, metal catalyzed hydrolysis of hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3, HB) under air at room temperature. Among the catalyst systems tested, rhodium(III) chloride was found to provide the highest catalytic activity in this reaction. In the presence of rhodium(III) chloride, the aqueous solution of hydrazine borane undergoes fast hydrolysis to release nearly 3.0 equivalent of H2 at room temperature with previously unprecedented H2 generation rate TOF = 12000 h -1. More importantly, it was found that in the catalytic hydrolysis of hydrazine borane the reaction between hydrazine borane and water proceeds almost in stoichiometric proportion indicating that the efficient hydrogen generation can be achieved even from the highly concentrated solution of hydrazine borane or in the solid state when water added to the solid hydrazine borane. This finding is crucial especially for on-board application of the existing system. The work reported here also includes (i) finding the solubility of hydrazine borane plus its stability against self-hydrolysis in water, (ii) the definition of reaction stoichiometry and the identification of reaction products for the catalytic hydrolysis of hydrazine borane, (iii) the collection of wealthy kinetic data to demonstrate the effect of substrate and catalyst concentrations on the hydrogen generation rate and to determine the rate law for the catalytic hydrolysis of hydrazine borane, (iv) the investigation of the effect of temperature on the rate of hydrogen generation and determination of activation parameters (Ea, ΔH#, and ΔS #) for the catalytic hydrolysis of hydrazine borane. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It is of particular interest to investigate the spatio-temporal economic, environmental and energetic performance if H2 were to be introduced as a fuel in the Dutch transport sector. A key observation is that the transition towards a large-scale H2 supply infrastructure is economically viable, if designed optimally with a holistic long-term systems perspective. However, the well-to-tank (WtT) CO2 emission reduction potential is limited (ca. 30%), which can be improved (ca. 85%) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The spatially-explicit nature of the framework facilitates the design of efficient networks with a high network-wide WtT energy efficiency (ca. 50% or more). Furthermore, H2 is observed to have the potential to alleviate Dutch energy security concerns.

It was observed that oxidative dissociation of LaNi 5 alloy (2LaNi5 + 3/2O2 → La 2O3 + 10Ni) occurred during synthesis. The Ni particles obtained through this process instantly interacted with C2H 2 and H2 gases, and fragmented to nanoparticles of Ni (∼150 nm) with polygonal shape. These polygonal shapes of Ni nanoparticles were decisive for the growth of helical carbon nanofibres (HCNFs) at 650 °C. TEM, SAED and EDAX studies have shown that HCNFs have grown on Ni nanoparticles. Typical diameter and length of the HCNFs are ∼150 nm and 6-8 μm respectively. BET surface area of these typical HCNFs has been found to be 127 m2/g. It was found that at temperature 750 °C, spherical shapes of Ni nanoparticles were produced and decisive for the growth of planar carbon nanofibres (PCNFs). The diameter and length of the PCNFs are ∼200 nm and 6-8 μm respectively. In order to explore the application potential of the present as-synthesized CNFs, they were used as a catalyst for enhancing the hydrogen desorption kinetics of sodium aluminum hydride (NaAlH4). We have found that the present as-synthesized HCNFs, with metallic impurities, indeed work as an effective catalyst. The pristine NaAlH4 and 8 mol% as-synthesized HCNFs admixed NaAlH4, at 160 °C-180 °C and for the duration of 5 h, liberate 0.8 wt% and 4.36 wt% of hydrogen, respectively. Thus there is an enhancement of ∼5 times in kinetics when as-synthesized HCNFs are used as the catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, the use of hydrogen storage alloy LaNi5 as the catalyst precursor for the growth of HCNFs has not yet been done and thus represents a new feature relating to the growth of HCNFs. Furthermore, we have shown that the as-synthesized HCNFs work as an effective new catalyst for improving the dehydrogenation kinetics of the complex hydride, NaAlH4. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The effect of Ni particle distribution on hydrogen uptake of CNTs is also studied. The chemical composition, crystal structure and microstructure of the CNTs with or without Ni loading are characterized using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP), X-ray diffraction meter (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The hydrogen uptake in CNTs with or without Ni loading is measured using a high-pressure microbalance at room temperature under a hydrogen pressure of 6.89 MPa. The experimental results show that fine and well-dispersed metallic Ni nanoparticles can be obtained by EN. The density and particle distribution depend on deposition temperature and time. An enhanced hydrogen storage capacity of CNTs can be obtained by Ni decoration, which provided a spillover reaction. The hydrogen storage capacity of the as-received CNTs was 0.39 wt.%. As much as 1.27 wt.% of hydrogen can be stored when uniformly distributed nano-sized Ni particles are formed on the surface of the CNTs. However, the beneficial effect is lost when the active sites for either physical or chemical adsorption are blocked by excessive Ni loading. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is assumed that electrode materials made of nano-composited materials will improve battery lifetime and will lead to an enhancement of lithium diffusion and thus improve battery capacity and cyclability. A major problem concerning thin film electrodes is, that increasing film thickness leads to an increase in lithium diffusion path lengths and thereby a decrease in power density. To overcome this problem, the investigation of a 3D-battery system with an increased surface area is necessary. UV-laser micromachining was applied to create defined line or grating structures via mask imaging. SnO2 is a highly investigated anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Yet, the enormous volume changes occurring during electrochemical cycling lead to immense loss of capacity. The formation of micropatterns via laser ablation to create structures which enable the compensation of the volume expansion was investigated in detail. Thin films of SnO2 were deposited in Ar:O2 atmosphere via r.f. magnetron sputtering on silicon and stainless steel substrates. The thin films were studied with X-ray diffraction to determine their crystallinity. The electrochemical properties of the manufactured films were investigated via electrochemical cycling against a lithium anode. © 2011 SPIE.","Anode material; Conversion material; Excimer laser structuring; Laser structuring; Lithium-ion battery; SnO2; Surface modification; Thin film technology","Anode material; Conversion material; Excimer laser structuring; Laser structuring; Lithium-ion battery; SnO2; Surface modification; Thin film technology; Ablation; Anodes; Electrochemical properties; Electrochemistry; Excimer lasers; Film thickness; Gas lasers; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Stainless steel; Surface treatment; Thin films; Three dimensional; X ray diffraction; Materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953077088

The target container, or hohlraum, must be accurately aligned to an x-ray imaging system to allow careful monitoring of the frozen fuel layer in the target. To achieve alignment, x-ray images are acquired through starburst-shaped windows cut into opposite sides of the hohlraum. When the hohlraum is in alignment, the starburst pattern pairs match nearly exactly and allow a clear view of the ice layer formation on the edge of the target capsule. During the alignment process, x-ray image analysis is applied to determine the direction and magnitude of adjustment required. X-ray detector and source are moved in concert during the alignment process. The automated pointing alignment system described here is both accurate and efficient.

Then the corrosion kinetics of Cr20Ni80 alloy in Al-7% Si alloy and Al-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy at 700°C in thermal cycles were obtained. The microstructures, element concentration and phases in the interface were analyzed by means of metallographic microscope, EPMA and XRD. The results show that all materials phase transition temperatures are during 450°C ∼650°C. The total thermal energies of the materials are higher than 900J/cm3. Quaternary alloys and quinary alloys show much more advantages when applying for solar thermal power generation systems. The latent heat depends strongly upon the composition and percentage of elements and the phase composition. Besides, experimental results show that the corrosion rate of Cr20Ni80 alloy in Al-7%Si alloy at 700°C is 0.167mm/h. Under thermal cycling conditions, the corrosion rate of Cr20Ni80 alloy in Al-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy is a little lower and the reaction interface layer does not significantly affect the rate of further corrosion.

The light modulations in the far field, where the surface plasmons are extracted by a grating, have been calculated for a continuum of energies and wavevectors injected by the substrate. We discuss the results of our calculations based on a tensorial rigorous coupled-wave analysis aimed at the full description of SPR coupling in QW semiconductor-based architectures, designed for biosensing applications. The surface roughness induced by various nanofabrication methods is also studied, given that it is one of the main limiting factors in diffraction-based SPR sensing. This aspect is studied for thin film microstructures operating in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The surface roughness and dielectric values for various deposition rates of very thin Au films are examined. We finally introduce a novel experimental method for direct mapping of the electromagnetic (EM) wave dispersion that enabled us monitoring of a massive amount of light-scattering related information. We present the results of far field measurements of the complete 3D dispersion relation of a SPR effect induced by this nanodevice.

The selected additives have been previously demonstrated to significantly improve the sorption reaction kinetics in the corresponding materials. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis were carried out for the milled and cycled samples in absence or presence of the additives. It has been shown that although the evolution of the oxidation state for both Nb- and Ti-species are similar in both systems, the Nb additive is performing its activity at the surface while the Ti active species migrate to the bulk. The Nb-based additive is forming pathways that facilitate the diffusion of hydrogen through the diffusion barriers both in desorption and absorption. For the Ti-based additive in the reactive hydride composite, the active species are working in the bulk, enhancing the heterogeneous nucleation of MgB2 phases during desorption and producing a distinct grain refinement that favours both sorption kinetics. The results are discussed in regards to possible kinetic models for both systems. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

During the CPOM tests, higher C18O than C16O concentrations were observed over 18O labeled Rh/GDC10 than Rh/ALU, which is explained by the higher oxygen storage capacity and oxygen mobility of the former catalyst. Similarly, Rh/GDC10 showed higher oxygen exchange rates than Rh/ALU during the isotopic exchange experiments. The oxygen exchange between the gas phase and the solid is limited by the oxygen mobility in/on the catalyst. This catalytic behavior is due to the fact that ceria has two stable oxidation states, Ce3+ and Ce4+ and the addition of Gd3+ to ceria lattice enhanced the oxygen mobility by the creation of oxygen vacancies. These higher oxygen exchange rates also correlate to higher concentrations of C18O than C16O during the CPOM experiments. Pulse experiments suggest that the reaction mechanism for the CPOM on Rh/GDC10 occurred through a mixed (direct and indirect) mechanism. The direct mechanism assumes that H2 and CO are primary reaction products formed in the oxidation zone at the catalyst entrance. Thus, CO formed from the reaction between lattice oxygen in Rh/GDC10 and adsorbed atomic carbon. CO2 is formed through an indirect mechanism, where CH4 reacts with O2 to form CO2 and H2O. CO forms through the reactions between 1) CO2 and CH4 and 2) CH4 and H2O. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These small-scale leaks may occur from leaky fittings or o-ring seals on liquid hydrogen-based systems. The present study focuses on steady-state leaks with large amounts of pressure drop along the leak path such that hydrogen enters the atmosphere at near atmospheric pressure (i.e. Very low Mach number). A three-stage buoyant turbulent entrainment model is developed to predict the properties (trajectory, hydrogen concentration and temperature) of a jet emanating from the leak. Atmospheric hydrogen properties (temperature and quality) at the leak plane depend on the storage pressure and whether the leak occurs from the saturated vapor space or saturated liquid space. In the first stage of the entrainment model ambient temperature air (295 K) mixes with the leaking hydrogen (20-30 K) over a short distance creating an ideal gas mixture at low temperature (∼65 K). During this process states of hydrogen and air are determined from equilibrium thermodynamics using models developed by NIST. In the second stage of the model (also relatively short in distance) the radial distribution of hydrogen concentration and velocity in the jet develops into a Gaussian profile characteristic of free jets. The third and by far the longest stage is the part of the jet trajectory where flow is fully developed. Results show that flammability envelopes for cold hydrogen jets are generally larger than those of ambient temperature jets. While trajectories for ambient temperature jets depend solely on the leak densimetric Froude number, results from the present study show that cold jet trajectories depend on the Froude number and the initial jet density ratio. Furthermore, the flammability envelope is influenced by the hydrogen concentration in the jet at the beginning of fully developed flow. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

HEEP software can be used to perform the economics of the most promising processes for hydrogen production. Current processes considered in HEEP are: high and low temperature electrolysis, thermo-chemical processes including S-I process, conventional electrolysis and steam reforming. HEEP software is also suitable for comparative between nuclear and fossil energy sources, and for solely hydrogen production or cogeneration with electricity.

The thermodynamic properties (absorption and desorption pressure plateaux) of IMCs can be adjusted to some extend by chemical alloying with foreign metals and substitution on different crystallographic sites.

Experimental tests investigated the influence of limestone loading, total membrane area and natural gas feed rates. Hydrogen-permeate to feed methane molar ratios in excess of 1.9 were measured. This value could increase further if additional membrane area were installed or by purifying the reformer off-gas given its high hydrogen content, especially during the carbonation stages.

Energy and exergy balances are applied to determine exergy flows and efficiencies for individual devices and the overall system. A 'base case' analysis considers the proposed system without modification, while a 'modified case' extends the base case by considering the possibility of multiple product outputs. It is determined that solar photovoltaic-based sub-systems have the lowest exergy efficiencies (14-18%) and offer the most potential for improvement. A comparison of these two scenarios shows that the additional outputs raise the exergy efficiency of the modified case (11%) relative to the base case (4.0%). An investigation of the energy and exergy efficiencies of separate devices illustrates how energy analyses can be misleading. The hybrid system is expected to have several environmental benefits, which may offset to some degree economic barriers to implementation. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The SWCNT - metallic particle addition resulted in both a decreased decomposition temperature and enhanced desorption kinetics compared to pure LiAlH4. The decomposition temperature of the 5 wt.% SWCNT-added LiAlH4 sample was reduced to 80 °C and 130 °C for the first and second stage, respectively, compared with 150 °C and 180 °C for as-received LiAlH4. In terms of the desorption kinetics, the 5 wt.% SWCNT-added LiAlH4 sample released about 4.0 wt.% hydrogen at 90 °C after 40 min dehydrogenation, while the as-milled LiAlH4 sample released less than 0.3 wt.% hydrogen for the same temperature and time. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicate that enthalpies of decomposition in LiAlH4 decrease with added SWCNTs. The apparent activation energy for hydrogen desorption was decreased from 116 kJ/mol for as-received LiAlH4 to 61 kJ/mol by the addition of 5 wt.% SWCNTs. It is believed that the significant improvement in dehydrogenation behaviour of SWCNT-added LiAlH4 is due to the combined influence of the SWCNT structure itself and the catalytic role of the metallic particles contained in the SWCNTs. In addition, the different effects of the SWCNTs and the metallic catalysts contained in the SWCNTs were also investigated, and the possible mechanism is discussed. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Hydrogen is better than almost all other fuels when the fuels are evaluated on the basis of several metrics, including safety and versatility of use. Hydrogen is also presumed to have a superior motivity factor, a performance measure arising out of a combination of acceleration and drag forces. The motivity factor is quantified on the basis of the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of a fuel. The present paper offers a refinement of the motivity factor which incorporates the effects of the mass of the storage matrix in these energy densities. It is shown that other fuels may have higher motivity factors than hydrogen when quantified on the basis of these refinements. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sodium alanate (NaAlH4) is a well-known hydride desorbing up to 5 wt.% H2 with reasonable rates at temperatures above 120 °C. Therefore a high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT-PEM FC) system with exhaust temperatures of about 180 °C can be used to provide the required enthalpy of reaction. In this study, the absorption and desorption behaviour of a lab-scale tank containing 304 g cerium-doped NaAlH4 is studied using (exhaust) air as heat transfer medium. For absorption reactions an optimal temperature for maximal reaction rates is identified. Additionally, the importance of an adapted heat management is shown for the present tank. For desorption experiments different operation procedures are used and the constraints in temperature and air-flow given by the HT-PEM are considered.

Most of the technical potential for RE is in intermittently available sources, mainly wind and solar. As penetration from these sources rises, conversion to another energy form, and energy storage, will be needed. Here we assume the energy carrier is hydrogen. This paper examines the consequences for net energy output over time for various rates of growth of wind-hydrogen systems. Wind energy is chosen for this case study because its output is presently far greater than solar, and because its costs are lower. We find that high growth rates of turbine-hydrogen installations lead to 'boom and bust' cycles in both equipment manufacture, and in net energy output. The main reason for these cycles is that such systems have high up-front input energy costs. To avoid these large swings, the rate of installation will have to be cut back, which limits the rate at which energy alternatives can supplant fossil fuels. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The electron microscopy study revealed that they were spherical in shape with particle size in the range 100-700 nm. Each fine particle was composed of single crystal structure of α-Mg(Zn) solid solution and amorphous structure of Mg-Zn alloy. After one absorption and desorption cycle, these UFPs transformed from the single crystal into the nanocrystalline structure and the mean particle size changed from 400 to 250 nm. It was found that the Mg-Zn UFPs could absorb 5.0 wt.% hydrogen in 20 min at 573 K and accomplish a high hydrogen storage capacity of 6.1 wt.% at 573 K. The fine particle size, nanocrystalline structure and the low oxide content of the obtained sample promoted the hydrogen sorption process with low hydrogen absorption activation energy of 56.3 kJ/mol. The enhanced hydrogen sorption properties of high absorbing rate and high storage capacity were due to the improved kinetics rather than the change in enthalpy. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The present results show that unless the access of oxygen to the surface is restricted, its strong bond to the decorated systems will preclude the practical use for hydrogen storage.

In a modified IGCC design for carbon capture, there are several technological options which are evaluated in this paper. The first two options involve pre-combustion arrangements in which syngas is processed, either by shift conversion or chemical looping, to maximise the hydrogen level and to concentrate the carbon species as CO2. After CO2 capture by gas-liquid absorption or chemical looping, the hydrogen-rich gas is used for power generation. The third capture option is based on post-combustion arrangement using chemical absorption. Investigated coal-based IGCC case studies produce 400-500 MW net power with more than 90% carbon capture rate. Principal focus of the paper is concentrated on evaluation of key performance indicators for investigated carbon capture options, the influence of various gasifiers on carbon capture process, optimisation of energy efficiency by heat and power integration, quality specification of captured CO2. The capture option with minimal energy penalty is based on chemical looping, followed by pre-combustion and post-combustion. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among methods used to design various components of a BMS, such as state-of-charge (SoC) estimators, model based approaches offer a good balance between accuracy, calibration effort and implementability. Because models used for these approaches are typically low in order and complexity, the traditional approach is to identify linear (or slightly nonlinear) models that are scheduled based on operating conditions. These models, formally known as linear parameter varying (LPV) models, tend to be difficult to identify because they contain a large amount of coefficients that require calibration. Consequently, the model identification process can be very laborious and time-intensive. This paper describes a comprehensive identification algorithm that uses linear-algebra-based subspace methods to identify a parameter varying state variable model that can describe the input-to-output dynamics of a battery under various operating conditions. Compared with previous methods, this approach is much faster and provides the user with information on the order of the system without placing an a priori structure on the system matrices. The entire process and various nuances are demonstrated using data collected from a lithium ion battery, and the focus is on applications for energy storage in automotive applications. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Successful modeling of battery designs relies upon accurate calculation of the area specific impedance (ASI). A simplified calculation of the ASI is presented that accounts for physical limitations without performing computationally expensive calculations. The limiting currents for transport within the electrolyte and within the intercalation materials are implemented into a linear form of the Butler-Volmer equation to calculate the interfacial impedance. Lithium-ion batteries are then designed to examine the effect of power to energy ratio on battery dimensions. A large ASI is shown to be detrimental to battery design regardless if the increase in impedance results from mass transport limitations or a reduction in electrochemical active area due to small electrode loadings. The smaller electrochemical active area does not increase the voltage losses of a battery when a constant C-rate is maintained. However, the higher ASI values from low electrode loadings require a larger separator and current collector area resulting in a greater battery volume and weight to achieve similar energy and power requirements when compared to a system with a lower ASI. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Area specific impedance; Battery design; Charge transfer resistance; Lithium ion","Active area; Area specific impedance; Battery design; Butler-Volmer equation; Charge transfer resistance; Current collector; Electrochemical energy storage; Energy ratio; Intercalation materials; Interfacial impedance; Limiting current; Lithium ion; Lithium-ion battery; Mass transport limitation; Physical limitations; Power requirement; Simplified calculations; System development; Voltage loss; Charge transfer; Design; Ion exchange; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Mass transfer; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649518181

We show that traditional methods of estimating battery cell total capacity, which consider noises only in the accumulated ampere hour measurement, are biased. Battery cell total capacity must be estimated with knowledge of both the noises on the state of charge estimates and on the accumulated ampere hour measurements used to compute the total capacity estimate.

The on-board performance and high-volume manufacturing cost were determined for compressed hydrogen tanks with design pressures of 350 bar (∼5000 psi) and 700 bar (∼10,000 psi) capable of storing 5.6 kg of usable hydrogen. The off-board performance and cost of delivering compressed hydrogen was determined for hydrogen produced by central steam methane reforming (SMR). The main conclusions of the assessment are that the 350-bar compressed storage system has the potential to meet the 2010 and 2015 targets for system gravimetric capacity but will not likely meet any of the system targets for volumetric capacity or cost, given our base case assumptions. The 700-bar compressed storage system has the potential to meet only the 2010 target for system gravimetric capacity and is not likely to meet any of the system targets for volumetric capacity or cost, despite the fact that its volumetric capacity is much higher than that of the 350-bar system. Both the 350-bar and 700-bar systems come close to meeting the Well-to-Tank (WTT) efficiency target, but fall short by about 5%. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Being lightweight and rich in hydrogen, MgH2 adsorbs H2 molecules in the vicinity of carbon nanotubes. The H2 molecules are adsorbed dissociatively on SWCNT + MgH2 complex. The H-H distance gets increased by more than ten times of the initial bond length 0.74 of the H 2 molecule. The hydrogen storage capacity of three configurations namely C1MgH2, C5MgH2 and C10MgH2 is reported. The density of states is computed for all the systems. The average binding energies of C5MgH2 and C10MgH2 when H2 molecule is adsorbed are 1.86 eV/H2 and 1.96 eV/H2, which are approximately equal. Thus, increasing the number of MgH2 molecule does not vary the binding energy of H2 adsorption.

To this end, an idealized finite volume model was developed to represent the behavior of dispersed hydride from a breached system. Semi-empirical thermodynamic calculations and substantiating calorimetric experiments were performed in order to quantify the energy released, energy release rates and to quantify the reaction products resulting from water and air exposure of a lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride combination. The hydrides, LiBH4 and MgH 2, were studied in a 2:1 ""destabilized"" mixture which has been demonstrated to be reversible. Liquid water hydrolysis reactions were performed in a Calvet calorimeter equipped with a mixing cell using pH-neutral water. Water vapor and gaseous oxygen reactivity measurements were performed at varying relative humidities and temperatures by modifying the calorimeter and utilizing a gas circulating flow cell apparatus. The results of these calorimetric measurements were used to develop quantitative kinetic expressions for hydrolysis and air oxidation in these systems. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from these tests were then incorporated into a computational fluid dynamics model to predict both the hydrogen generation rates and concentrations along with localized temperature distributions. The results of these numerical simulations can be used to predict ignition events and the resultant conclusions will be discussed. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One possible mitigation strategy to reduce exposure to jet flames is to incorporate barriers around hydrogen storage and delivery equipment. While reducing the extent of unacceptable consequences, the walls may introduce other hazards if not properly configured. This paper describes experiments carried out to characterize the effectiveness of different barrier wall configurations at reducing the hazards created by jet fires. The hazards that are evaluated are the generation of overpressure during ignition, the thermal radiation produced by the jet flame, and the effectiveness of the wall at deflecting the flame. The tests were conducted against a vertical wall (1-wall configuration), and two ""3-wall"" configurations that consisted of the same vertical wall with two side walls of the same dimensions angled at 135° and 90°. The hydrogen jet impinged on the center of the central wall in all cases. In terms of reducing the radiation heat flux behind the wall, the 1-wall configuration performed best followed by the 3-wall 135° configuration and the 3-wall 90°. The reduced shielding efficiency of the three-wall configurations was probably due to the additional confinement created by the side walls that limited the escape of hot gases to the sides of the wall and forced the hot gases to travel over the top of the wall. The 3-wall barrier with 135° side walls exhibited the best overall performance. Overpressures produced on the release side of the wall were similar to those produced in the 1-wall configuration. The attenuation of overpressure and impulse behind the wall was comparable to that of the three-wall configuration with 90° side walls. The 3-wall 135° configuration's ability to shield the back side of the wall from the heat flux emitted from the jet flame was comparable to the 1-wall and better than the 3-wall 90° configuration. The ratio of peak overpressure (from in front of the wall and from behind the wall) showed that the 3-wall 135° configuration and the 3-wall 90° configuration had a similar effectiveness. In terms of the pressure mitigation, the 3-wall configurations performed significantly better than the 1-wall configuration. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Box 6015, NO-5892 Bergen, Norway","Hydrogen is widely recognized as an attractive energy carrier due to its low-level air pollution and its high mass-related energy density. However, the safety characteristics of hydrogen are a concern, primarily due to its wide flammability range and high burning velocity. A significant fraction of hydrogen is stored and transported as a cryogenic liquid. Therefore, loss of hydrogen containments may lead to the formation of a pool on the ground. In general, very large spills will give a pool, whereas moderate sized spills may evaporate immediately. Accurate hazard assessments of storage systems require a proper prediction of the liquid hydrogen pool evaporation and spreading when conditions are conducive to the formation of a pool. A pool model handling the spread and the evaporation of liquid spills on different surfaces has recently been implemented in the 3D-Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool FLACS [1-4]. As the influence of geometry on the liquid spread is taken into account in the pool model, realistic industrial scenarios can be investigated. The model has been extensively validated for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) spills [5,6]. The model has previously been tested for LH2 release in the framework of the EU-sponsored Network of Excellence HySafe where experiments carried out by BAM were modelled. In the large-scale BAM experiments [7], 280 kg of liquid hydrogen was spilled in 6 tests adjacent to buildings. In these tests, the pool spreading, the evaporation, and the cloud formation were investigated. Simulations of these tests are found to compare reasonably well with the experimental results. In the present work, the liquid hydrogen spill experiments carried out by NASA are simulated with the pool model. The large-scale NASA experiments [8,9] consisted of 7 releases of liquefied hydrogen at White Sand, New Mexico. The release test 6 is used. During these experiments, cloud concentrations were measured at several distances downwind of the spill point. With the new pool model feature, the FLACS tool is shown to be an efficient and accurate tool for the investigation of complex and realistic accidental release scenarios of cryogenic liquids. © 2010 Professor T.

In order to develop higher power and energy density batteries, innovative electrode materials that provide increased storage capacity, greater rate capabilities, and good cyclability must be developed. Nanostructured materials are gaining increased attention because of their potential to mitigate current electrode limitations. Here we report on the use of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (VA-MWNTs) as the active electrode material in lithium-ion batteries. At low specific currents, these VA-MWNTs have shown high reversible specific capacities (up to 782 mAh g-1 at 57 mA g-1). This value is twice that of the theoretical maximum for graphite and ten times more than their non-aligned equivalent.

X-ray diffraction analyses indicated that the Mg0.5Ni0.5Ti and MgTi0.5Ni0.5 alloys could be monophased or composed of a nanoscale mixture of MgTi + NiTi and MgTi + MgNi phases, respectively. Their hydrogen storage characteristics were investigated electrochemically in KOH electrolyte. No activation step was observed during the cycling of the Mg-Ti-Ni electrodes in contrast to that observed with the MgTi electrode. The highest hydrogen discharge capacity was obtained with the MgTi0.5Ni 0.5 electrode (536 mAh g-1) compared to 401 and 475 mAh g-1 for the Mg0.5Ni0.5Ti and MgTi electrodes, respectively. The ternary Mg-Ti-Ni alloys showed a better cycle life with an average capacity decay rate per cycle lower than 1.5% compared to ∼7% for the binary MgTi electrode. The Mg-Ni-Ti electrodes also displayed a much higher discharge rate capability than the binary MgTi electrode, especially with the Mg0.5Ni0.5Ti electrode. The origin of this was established on the basis of the anodic polarization curves, where a substantial decrease of the concentration overpotential (reflecting a higher hydrogen diffusivity) was observed for the Mg0.5Ni0.5Ti electrode. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Mechanical alloying; Metal hydride; Mg-Ti-Ni based alloys; Ni-MH batteries","Anodic polarization curves; Average capacities; Comparative studies; Concentration overpotential; Cycle lives; Discharge rates; Electrochemical hydriding; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen diffusivity; Hydrogen discharge; Hydrogen storage characteristics; Hydrogen storage electrode; Metal hydride; Mg-Ti-Ni based alloys; Monophased; Nano scale; Ni-MH batteries; NO activation; Ti electrode; TiNi alloy; Ball milling; Binary alloys; Decay (organic); Electric discharges; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; High energy physics; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Mechanical alloying; Metallurgy; Milling (machining); Milling machines; Nickel cadmium batteries; Palladium; Potassium hydroxide; X ray diffraction; X ray diffraction analysis; Titanium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049381514

One critical concern for the scale-up of battery production is the availability of the elements used in battery couples. We provide the first systematic comparison of supply limits and extraction costs of the elements in battery couples against short- and long-term scaling goals. Several couples can scale well beyond short- and long-term grid-storage goals, including: Na/S, Zn/Cl2, and FeCl 2/CrCl3. Li-based couples currently have the performance characteristics most suitable for electric vehicles, yet scaling beyond 10 MM vehicles per year will demand significant increases in Li production. We also provide a framework to evaluate new couples, such as those based on Mg, which may be an alternative to Li-based couples. While the extraction costs of the elements used in current battery couples are, in many cases, below 10 $ kWh-1, the cost of finished battery cells is in the range of 150-1000 $ kWh-1, well above cost targets of 100 $ kWh -1 for both grid and transportation applications.

High-speed flywheels are an emerging technology with traits that have the potential to make them competitive with more established battery and ultracapacitor technologies in certain vehicular applications. This study compares high-speed flywheels, ultracapacitors, and batteries functioning as the ESS in a fuel cell based HEV on the bases of cost and fuel economy. In this study, computer models were built to simulate the powertrain of a fuel cell based HEV where high-speed flywheels, batteries, and ultracapacitors of a range of sizes were used as the ESS. A simulated vehicle with a powertrain using each of these technologies was run over two different drive cycles in order to see how the different ESSs performed under different driving patterns.

Densification of corn cobs into briquettes/pellets would improve their bulk handling, transportation, and storage properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the densification characteristics and specific energy requirements for the compression of corn cobs under four pressure levels (10, 12, 14, 16MPa) and with two particle size levels (2.41mm, 0.86mm). The compression behavior of ground corn cobs was studied using a hydraulic press briquetteing machine whose cylindrical die diameter was about 30 mm. The corn cobs moisture content and preheat temperature before compaction was 10% (w.b.) and 75 °C, respectively. The cylindrical die temperature was maintained at 90 ± 5 °C. It was found that the briquette density ranged from 809 to 1043 kg m-3; while the total specific energy requirement to compress and extrude briquette ranged from 17 to 26 MJ t-1, with an increase in pressure. Particle size had also a significant effect on briquette density and specific energy requirement. The finer corn cob grinds (0.86mm) resulted in higher density and lower specific energy requirement than the coarser corn cob grinds (2.41mm). New statistical models were developed to describe the total specific energy consumption of ground corn cobs during densification using a multiple linear regression analysis.","Briquettes; Corn cobs; Densification; Density; Specific energy","Briquettes; Bulk handling; Compression behavior; Corn cob; Corn cobs; Cylindrical dies; Density; Hydraulic press; Increase in pressure; Moisture contents; Multiple linear regression analysis; Potential feedstock; Preheat temperature; Pressure level; Specific energy; Specific energy consumption; Specific energy requirement; Statistical models; Storage properties; Briquets; Briquetting; Dies; Energy utilization; Hydraulic machinery; Industrial engineering; Linear regression; Manufacture; Production engineering; Densification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650647709

The enhancement layer above FDT consists of a client program - fdtcp (FDT copy) and a fdtd service (FDT daemon). This pair of components allows for GSI authenticated data transfers and offers to the user (or data movement production service) interface analogous to grid middle-ware data transfer services - SRM (i.e. srmcp) or GridFTP (i.e. globus-url-copy). fdtcp/fdtd enables third-party, batched file transfers. An important aspect is monitoring by means of the MonALISA active monitoring light-weight library ApMon, providing real-time monitoring and arrival time estimates as well as powerful troubleshooting mechanism. The actual transfer is carried out by the FDT application, an efficient application capable of reading and writing at disk speed over wide area networks. FDT's excellent performance was demonstrated e.g. during SuperComputing 2009 Bandwidth Challenge. We also discuss the storage technology interface layer, specifically focusing on the open source Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), presenting the recently developed FDT-HDFS sequential write adapter.

The requirements are beyond the capabilities of a single computing farm, so a distributed production model capable of exploiting the existing HEP worldwide distributed computing infrastructure is needed. In this paper we describe the set of tools that have been developed to manage the production of the required simulated events. The production of events follows three main phases: distribution of input data files to the remote site Storage Elements (SE); job submission, via SuperB GANGA interface, to all available remote sites; output files transfer to CNAF repository. The job workflow includes procedures for consistency checking, monitoring, data handling and bookkeeping. A replication mechanism allows storing the job output on the local site SE.

With LHC entering the analysis phase, PROOF has become a natural ingredient for computing farms at Tier3 level. These analysis facilities will typically be used by a few tenths of users, and can also be federated into a sort of analysis cloud corresponding to the Virtual Organization of the experiment. Proper scheduling is required to guarantee fair resource usage, to enforce priority policies and to optimize the throughput. In this paper we discuss an advanced priority system that we are developing for PROOF. The system has been designed to automatically adapt to unknown length of the tasks, to take into account the data location and availability (including distribution across geographically separated sites), and the {group, user} default priorities. In this system, every element - user, group, dataset, job slot and storage - gets its priority and those priorities are dynamically linked with each other. In order to tune the interplay between the various components, we have designed and started implementing a simulation application that can model various type and size of PROOF clusters. In this application a monitoring package records all the changes of them so that we can easily understand and tune the performance.

The corrected raw data or reconstructed data are transferred via SINET3 with 10 Gbps bandwidth from Brookheaven National Laboratory (BNL) by using GridFTP. The transferred data are once stored in the hierarchical storage management system (HPSS) prior to the user analysis. Since the size of data grows steadily year by year, concentrations of the access request to data servers become one of the serious bottlenecks. To eliminate this I/O bound problem, 18 calculating nodes with total 180 TB local disks were introduced to store the data a priori. We added some setup in a batch job scheduler (LSF) so that user can specify the requiring data already distributed to the local disks. The locations of data are automatically obtained from a database, and jobs are dispatched to the appropriate node which has the required data. To avoid the multiple access to a local disk from several jobs in a node, techniques of lock file and access control list are employed. As a result, each job can handle a local disk exclusively. Indeed, the total throughput was improved drastically as compared to the preexisting nodes in CCJ, and users can analyze about 150 TB data within 9 hours.

Due to a simplification of the original Access Envelope mechanism for xrootd-protocol-based storage systems, fundamental computational improvements of the mechanism were achieved as well as an up to 50% reduction of the credential's size. By extending the access protocol with signed status messages from the underlying storage system, the File Catalogue receives trusted information about a file's size and checksum and the protocol is no longer dependent on client trust.

The focus was to determine orbital- and spin-magnetic moments (g-tensor), hyperfine interactions, and from the linewidth the spin dynamics (T1, T2 relaxation). In FMR most of the experiments and theory assumed the total value M to be constant in the equation of motion and used only one effective damping parameter (Gilbert). This is an enormous, unnecessary limitation for today's analysis of magnetism in nanostructures and ultrathin films. To assume M = const ignores spin wave excitations, scattering between longitudinal and transverse components of M. Moreover, in the framework of itinerant ferromagnetism, the magnetic moment/atom μ was assumed to be isotropic with g≈2! That ignores the anisotropy of μ in nanostructures and the importance of the orbital magnetic moments with μL/μS = (g - 2)/2. Without finite μL we would have no magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), no hard magnets, no magnetic storage media. Only recently the ""language"" of EPR was adapted to FMR in ultrathin films. A g-tensor is discussed and its interrelation with the MAE is pointed out. Also recent theory points out, that"" there is no reason to assume a fixed magnetization length for nanoelements"". This allows a detailed discussion of magnon-magnon scattering, spin-spin, and spin-lattice relaxation - useful, for example, for fs spin dynamics. Recent FMR experiments using frequencies from 1 GHz up to several hundred GHz, will allow measuring the proper g-factor components and μL,μS. From the frequency dependent linewidth magnon-magnon scattering can be separated from dissipative spin-lattice damping.",,"Anisotropy; Condensed matter physics; Damping; Equations of motion; Ferromagnetic resonance; Ferromagnetism; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic moments; Magnetic storage; Nanostructures; Paramagnetic resonance; Paramagnetism; Resonance; Spin dynamics; Spin waves; Tensors; Ultrathin films; Hyperfine interactions; Itinerant ferromagnetism; Magnetic anisotropy energy; Magnetic storage media; Magnon-magnon scattering; Orbital magnetic moment; Spin magnetic moments; Transverse components; Magnetism",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859554334

The steam engine behind HLT is a high performance computing cluster of several hundred nodes. It has to reduce the data rate from 25 GB/s to 1.25 GB/s for fitting the DAQ mass storage bandwidth. The cluster is served by a full GigaBit Ethernet network, in addition to an InfiniBand backbone network. To cope with the great challenge of Pb+Pb collisions in autumn 2010, its performance capabilities are being enhanced with the addition of new nodes. Towards the same end the first GPU co-processors are in place. During the first period of data taking with p+p collisions the HLT was extensively used to reconstruct, analyze and display data from the various participating detectors. Among other tasks it contributed to the monitoring of the detector performance, selected events for their calibration and efficiency studies, and estimated primary and secondary vertices from p+p collisions identifying V0 topologies.

We describe here an automated system for validating releases of the Open Science Grid software stack that leverages the (pilot-based) PanDA job management system developed and used by the ATLAS experiment. The system was motivated by a desire to subject the OSG Integration Testbed to more realistic validation tests. In particular those which resemble to every extent possible actual job workflows used by the experiments thus utilizing job scheduling at the compute element (CE), use of the worker node execution environment, transfer of data to/from the local storage element (SE), etc. The context is that candidate releases of OSG compute and storage elements can be tested by injecting large numbers of synthetic jobs varying in complexity and coverage of services tested. The native capabilities of the PanDA system can thus be used to define jobs, monitor their execution, and archive the resulting run statistics including success and failure modes. A repository of generic workflows and job types to measure various metrics of interest has been created. A command-line toolset has been developed so that testbed managers can quickly submit ""VO-like"" jobs into the system when newly deployed services are ready for testing.

The data connection is limited to the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol using the scp command. Besides a limitof bandwidth, we had to deal with a lack of automation and reliability of the transfers. PIC managed to control those scp transfers through gLite's File Transfer Service (FTS). Therefore, the discs containing the data at the BSC are mounted via SSH to a local Storage Resource Management (SRM) server at PIC. Once established the access to the data through the SRM server, the data can be transfered to any other SRM server, including the storage system at PIC, using grid protocols.

However, data taking is not running continuously and exploiting unused cluster resources for other applications is highly desirable and improves the usage-cost ratio of the HLT cluster. As such, unused computing resources are dedicated to a PROOF-enabled virtual cluster available to the entire collaboration. This setup is especially aimed at the prototyping phase of analyses that need a high number of development iterations and a short response time, e.g. tuning of analysis cuts, calibration and alignment. HAF machines are enabled and disabled upon user request to start or complete analysis tasks. This is achieved by a virtual machine scheduling framework which dynamically assigns and migrates virtual machines running PROOF workers to unused physical resources.

The Debugging Data Transfers (DDT) Task Force in CMS was charged with commissioning Tier-2 to Tier-2 PhEDEx transfer links beginning in late 2009, originally to serve the needs of physics analysis groups for the transfer of their results between the storage elements of the Tier-2 sites associated with the groups. PhEDEx is the data transfer middleware of the CMS experiment. For analysis jobs using CRAB, the CMS Remote Analysis Builder, the challenges of remote stage out of job output at the end of the analysis jobs led to the introduction of a local fallback stage out, and will eventually require the asynchronous transfer of user data over essentially all of the Tier-2 to Tier-2 network using the same PhEDEx infrastructure. In addition, direct file sharing of physics and Monte Carlo simulated data between Tier-2 sites can relieve the operational load of the Tier-1 sites in the original CMS Computing Model, and already represents an important component of CMS PhEDEx data transfer volume. The experience, challenges and methods used to debug and commission the thousands of data transfers links between CMS Tier-2 sites world-wide are explained and summarized. The resulting operational experience with Tier-2 to Tier-2 transfers is also presented.",,"Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; High energy physics; Middleware; Computing model; File Sharing; Operational experience; Operational loads; Physics analysis; Remote analysis; Storage elements; Transfer volumes; Data transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858144265

WNoDeS provides on demand, integrated access to both Grid and Cloud resources through virtualization technologies. Besides the traditional use of computing resources in batch mode, users need to have interactive and local access to a number of systems. WNoDeS can dynamically select these computers instantiating Virtual Machines, according to the requirements (computing, storage and network resources) of users through either the Open Cloud Computing Interface API, or through a web console. An interactive use is usually limited to activities in user space, i.e. where the machine configuration is not modified. In some other instances the activity concerns development and testing of services and thus implies the modification of the system configuration (and, therefore, root-access to the resource). The former use case is a simple extension of the WNoDeS approach, where the resource is provided in interactive mode. The latter implies saving the virtual image at the end of each user session so that it can be presented to the user at subsequent requests. This work describes how the LHC experiments at INFN-Bologna are testing and making use of these dynamically created ad-hoc machines via WNoDeS to support flexible, interactive analysis and software development at the INFN Tier-1 Computing Centre.",,"Application programming interfaces (API); Cloud computing; High energy physics; Software design; Software testing; Cloud environments; Computing resource; Development and testing; Interactive analysis; On-demand services; Open cloud computing interfaces; System configurations; Virtualization technologies; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858143900

Some calibrations requiring particularly high events rates are driven by special data streams that select the relevant event fractions already at the HLT level, for example π0 and η candidates for the intercalibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter. A dedicated express stream drives very low latency workflows that are operated at the CERN Analysis Facility.

However, with an ever-increasing user base and scale of resources to manage, along with the introduction of more advanced data transfer protocols, some limitations in the current architecture have become apparent. The simple first-in first-out approach to data transfer leads to bottlenecks in the system, as does the built-in assumption that all data is immediately available from remote data storage. We present an entirely new data management architecture for ARC which aims to alleviate these problems, by introducing a three-layer structure. The top layer accepts incoming requests for data transfer and directs them to the middle layer, which schedules individual transfers and negotiates with various intermediate catalog and storage systems until the physical file is ready to be transferred. The lower layer performs all operations which use large amounts of bandwidth, i.e. the physical data transfer. Using such a layered structure allows more efficient use of the available bandwidth as well as enabling late-binding of jobs to data transfer slots based on a priority system. Here we describe in full detail the design and implementation of the new system.",,"Bandwidth; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; High energy physics; Middleware; Network architecture; Available bandwidth; Data management architecture; Data transfer protocols; Design and implementations; First in first outs; Layered Structures; Storage technology; Three-layer structures; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858142842

This problem has generally been tackled by the experiment's data management framework controlling in fine detail the distribution of data around the grid and the careful brokering of jobs to sites with co-located data. This approach, however, presents experiments with a difficult and complex system to manage as well as introducing a rigidity into the framework which is very far from the original conception of the grid. In this paper we describe how the ScotGrid distributed Tier-2, which has sites in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Durham, was presented to ATLAS as a single, unified resource using the ARC middleware stack. In this model the ScotGrid 'data store' is hosted at Glasgow and presented as a single ATLAS storage resource. As jobs are taken from the ATLAS PanDA framework, they are dispatched to the computing cluster with the fastest response time. An ARC compute element at each site then asynchronously stages the data from the data store into a local cache hosted at each site. The job is then launched in the batch system and accesses data locally. We discuss the merits of this system compared to other operational models and consider, from the point of view of the resource providers (sites), and from the resource consumers (experiments); and consider issues involved in transitions to this model.",,"Cluster computing; Digital storage; Information management; Middleware; Batch systems; Computing clusters; Fastest response; Local cache; Management frameworks; Operational model; Resource providers; Storage resources; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858138376

In this coherent approach all different physics analyses employ the same data and MC samples, which provide the users with the best possible knowledge of the H1 collaboration. The analysis files are produced centrally in a very efficient semi-automatic procedure, allowing a very short turn-around time when installing new reconstruction and analysis software versions.",,"Digital storage; Particle accelerators; Analysis frameworks; Analysis softwares; Efficiency and performance; Event selection; Integrated luminosity; Interactive analysis; Physics analysis; Semi-automatic procedures; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858136493

Emerging cloud computing services such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offer short-term CPU and storage resources with costs based on usage. These services allow experiments to purchase computing resources as needed, without significant prior planning and without long term investments in facilities and their management. We have demonstrated that services such as EC2 can successfully be integrated into the production-computing model of CMS, and find that they work very well as worker nodes. The cost-structure and transient nature of EC2 services makes them inappropriate for some CMS production services and functions. We also found that the resources are not truely ""on-demand"" as limits and caps on usage are imposed. Our trial workflows allow us to make a cost comparison between EC2 resources and dedicated CMS resources at a University, and conclude that it is most cost effective to purchase dedicated resources for the ""base- line"" needs of experiments such as CMS. However, if the ability to use cloud computing resources is built into an experiment's software framework before demand requires their use, cloud computing resources make sense for bursting during times when spikes in usage are required.",,"Cloud computing; Computer programming; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; High energy physics; Investments; Middleware; Network function virtualization; Cloud computing services; Compact Muon solenoids; Computational infrastructure; Computational resources; Elastic compute clouds; Large Hadron Collider; Long-term investment; Scientific collaboration; Solenoids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858134697

Currently, the INFN Tier-1 supports more than twenty different collaborations; in this context, optimization of the usage of computing resources is essential. This is one of the main drivers behind the development of a software called WNoDeS (Worker Nodes on Demand Service). WNoDeS, developed at INFN CNAF and deployed on the INFN Tier-1 production infrastructure, is a solution to virtualize computing resources and to make them available through local, Grid or Cloud interfaces. It is designed to be fully integrated with a Local Resource Management System; it is therefore inherently scalable and permits full integration with existing scheduling, policing, monitoring, accounting and security workflows. WNoDeS dynamically instantiates Virtual Machines (VMs) on-demand, i.e. only when the need arises; these VMs can be tailored and used for purposes like batch job execution, interactive analysis or service instantiation. WNoDeS supports interaction with user requests through traditional batch or Grid jobs and also via the Open Cloud Computing Interface standard, making it possible to allocate compute, storage and network resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. User authentication is supported via several authentication methods, while authorization policies are handled via gLite Argus. WNoDeS is an ambitious solution aimed at virtualizing cluster resources in medium or large scale computing centers, with up to several thousands of Virtual Machines up and running at any given time.

BNL's mass storage system currently holds more than 16 PB of data on tapes, managed by HPSS. To restore files from HPSS, we make use of a scheduler software, called ERADAT. This scheduler system was originally based on a code from OakRidge National Lab, and then it was renamed to BNL Batch at 2005 after some major modifications and enhancements.

Our experiments have shown that the I/O bound nature of the analysis jobs in combination with the latency due to the remote access protocols (e.g. rfio, dcap) cause a low CPU efficiency of these jobs. In addition to causing a low CPU efficiency, the remote access protocols give rise to high overhead (in terms of amount of data transferred). This paper gives an overview of the concept of pre-fetching and caching of input files in the proximity of the processing resources, which is exploited to cope with the I/O bound analysis jobs. The files are copied from Grid storage elements (using GridFTP), while concurrently performing computations, inspired from a similar idea used in the ATLAS experiment. The results illustrate that this file staging approach is relatively insensitive to the original location of the data, and a significant improvement can be achieved in terms of the CPU efficiency of an analysis job.

The tests are done on a cluster comparable to a small analysis cluster. Our tests have shown that the dCache NFSv4.1 (pnfs) implementation is very stable and that analysis speed is at least comparable if not superior to dCap in general.

In addition to the accumulated metadata from a decade of operations, refinements to detector calibrations force user analysis to access database information post data production. Users may access any year's data at any point in time, causing a near random access of the metadata queried, contrary to time-organized production cycles. Moreover, complex online event selection algorithms created a query scarcity (""sparsity"") scenario for offline production further impacting performance. Fundamental changes in our hardware approach were hence necessary to improve query speed. Initial strategic improvements were focused on developing fault-tolerant, load-balanced access to a multi-slave infrastructure. Beyond that, we explored, tested and quantified the benefits of introducing a Tiered storage architecture composed of conventional drives, solid-state disks, and memory-resident databases as well as leveraging the use of smaller database services fitting in memory.

The Python scripting language is adopted to define the job configuration that drives the analysis workflow. It could be a challenging task for users, especially for newcomers, to develop analysis jobs managing the configuration of many required modules. For this reason a graphical tool has been conceived in order to edit and inspect configuration files. A set of common analysis tools defined in the CMS Physics Analysis Toolkit (PAT) can be steered and configured using the Config Editor. A user-defined analysis workflow can be produced starting from a standard configuration file, applying and configuring PAT tools according to the specific user requirements. CMS users can adopt this tool, the Config Editor, to create their analysis visualizing in real time which are the effects of their actions. They can visualize the structure of their configuration, look at the modules included in the workflow, inspect the dependences existing among the modules and check the data flow. They can visualize at which values parameters are set and change them according to what is required by their analysis task.

It relies on a large, distributed computing system composed of thousands of software applications running concurrently. In such a complex environment, information sharing is fundamental for controlling applications behavior, error reporting and operational monitoring. During data taking, the streams of messages sent by applications and data published via information services are constantly monitored by experts to verify the correctness of running operations and to understand problematic situations. To simplify and improve system analysis and errors detection tasks, we developed the TDAQ Analytics Dashboard, a web application that aims to collect, correlate and visualize effectively this real time flow of information. The TDAQ Analytics Dashboard is composed of two main entities that reflect the twofold scope of the application. The first is the engine, a Java service that performs aggregation, processing and filtering of real time data stream and computes statistical correlation on sliding windows of time. The results are made available to clients via a simple web interface supporting SQL-like query syntax. The second is the visualization, provided by an Ajax-based web application that runs on client's browser. The dashboard approach allows to present information in a clear and customizable structure. Several types of interactive graphs are proposed as widgets that can be dynamically added and removed from visualization panels.

The determination of the correct pool size is rather difficult. From a management point of view, it is preferable to only have a limited amount of pools. However, less and bigger pools aggravate operation. If one pool becomes unoperational, the complete storage behind this pool is offline. Additionally, restarting of bigger pools is time consuming and causes unnecessary delays. However, as a Tier-1 site like GridKa, which is serving all four LHC [2] experiments, the disk space provided behind a single server has to be optimised to the maximum one pool can provide. This paper analyses the coherence between pool size and the amount of transfer movers to result in highest throughput and less administrative impact.",,"Digital storage; Hard disk storage; High energy physics; Software engineering; D caches; Disk space; Offline; Paper analysis; Single server; Lakes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858118838

Commissioning and maintaining a site to provide an efficient distributed analysis service is therefore a challenge which can be aided by tools to help evaluate a variety of infrastructure designs and configurations. HammerCloud is one such tool; it is a stress testing service which is used by central operations teams, regional coordinators, and local site admins to (a) submit arbitrary number of analysis jobs to a number of sites, (b) maintain at a steady-state a predefined number of jobs running at the sites under test, (c) produce web-based reports summarizing the efficiency and performance of the sites under test, and (d) present a web-interface for historical test results to both evaluate progress and compare sites. HammerCloud was built around the distributed analysis framework Ganga, exploiting its API for grid job management. HammerCloud has been employed by the ATLAS experiment for continuous testing of many sites worldwide, and also during large scale computing challenges such as STEP'09 and UAT'09, where the scale of the tests exceeded 10,000 concurrently running and 1,000,000 total jobs over multi-day periods. In addition, HammerCloud is being adopted by the CMS experiment; the plugin structure of HammerCloud allows the execution of CMS jobs using their official tool (CRAB).",,"Digital storage; High energy physics; Interface states; Continuous testing; Distributed analysis; Efficiency and performance; Grid job managements; Infrastructure design; Internal network; Large-scale computing; Plug-in structures; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858118125

It is also deployed at many Tier 2 centers. The Storage Resource Manager (SRM) is a standardized grid storage interface and a single point of remote entry into dCache, and hence is a critical component. SRM must scale to increasing transaction rates and remain resilient against changing usage patterns. The initial implementation of the SRM service in dCache suffered from an inability to support clustered deployment, and its performance was limited by the hardware of a single node. Using the Terracotta platform[l], we added the ability to horizontally scale the dCache SRM service to run on multiple nodes in a cluster configuration, coupled with network load balancing. This gives site administrators the ability to increase the performance and reliability of SRM service to face the ever-increasing requirements of LHC data handling. In this paper we will describe the previous limitations of the architecture SRM server and how the Terracotta platform allowed us to readily convert single node service into a highly scalable clustered application.",,"Data handling; Digital storage; Middleware; Cluster configurations; Critical component; LHC experiments; Multiple nodes; Network load balancing; Performance and reliabilities; Storage resources; Transaction rates; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858117232

The versatile and flexible approach allows for a slew of histograms to be configured and grouped into categories (results and thresholds may depend on experimental triggers and data types) ensuring framework evolution with the years of running to come.

It also enables the use of standard technologies such as http caching or load balancing which can be used to improve service resilience and scalability or to boost performance for some use cases seen in HEP such as the ""hot files"".

The data-flow system is responsible for reading out, formatting and conveying the event data, eventually saving the selected events into the mass storage. By the second quarter of 2010, for the first time, the system will be capable of the full event building capacity and improved data-logging throughput. We will in particular detail the tools put in place to predict and track the system working point, with the aim of optimizing the bandwidth and the computing resource sharing, and anticipate possible limits. Naturally, the LHC duty cycle, the trigger performance, and the detector configuration influence the system working point. Therefore, numerical studies of the data-flow system capabilities have been performed considering different scenarios. This is crucial for the first phase of the LHC operations where variable running conditions are anticipated due to the ongoing trigger commissioning and the detector and physics performance studies. The exploitation of these results requires to know and track the system working point, as defined by a set of many different operational parameters, e.g. rates, throughput, event size.

In low-voltage grids, these are mostly decentralized renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic power plants (PV) connected through inverters to the grid. The temporary reversal of the power flow causes overvoltage problems. Consequently, regenerative sources need to be turned off temporarily or on the long term the grid infrastructure has to be extended by the network operator. This paper describes two concepts to increase power capability and voltage quality of the grid. On the one hand reactive power generated by solar inverters is used to influence the grid voltage locally. On the other hand a controllable tap changer in a low-voltage transformer is able to influence the voltage in the whole low-voltage grid. Thus grid extension can be avoided in many cases or at least can be delayed. Voltage fluctuations due to varying power input, e.g. caused by passing clouds, can be reduced. Distributed data collection and central control is required to control a distributed system of multiple solar inverters installed in a grid segment. The concept can be applied not only to PV systems; it is rather a basic technology which can be used in future grids with distributed generation and storage. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Inverter; Low-voltage grids; On load tap changer; Reactive power","Digital storage; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic cells; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Voltage control; Distributed generation and storage; Grid infrastructures; Inverter; Low-voltage grid; On- load tap changers; Photovoltaic power plant; Renewable energy systems; Voltage fluctuations; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555209155

Constant-voltage and current-limited control are realized by parallel controller to meet the energy storage of the system requirement and to protect the battery. Super capacitor is used to filter the PV cell output and to reduce the small charging and discharging cycle of the battery.

A new project called ""AME-future"" is currently ongoing and it is aimed at creation of new mass tables that will be published in 2013: AME2013. The present status of AME and its working structure are presented.

We selected PCM as support owing to its lightness, easy handling, stability, and porous structure with nanosized channels. Our primary objective was to obtain a catalytic film resistant to both physical degradation and delamination while H2 bubbled on its surface. A thin film consisting of mushroom-like cobalt nanoarchitectures were prepared. By SEM, we observed that it is strongly embedded into the PCM thickness, with the anchoring occurring through the channels.

The reaction was followed by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The gaseous products analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the solid by-products identified by elemental analysis: powder X-ray diffraction, infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Compared to pristine AB, the presence of CoCl2 and CoBr2 reduces both the induction period of the AB decomposition and the content of unwanted borazine in the H2 stream, whereas the presence of CoI2 or CoF2 has little or no effect, respectively. We propose that the positive effect of CoX2 comes from their electronic and steric effects, and that CoCl2 is the compound which shows the best properties relative to these effects.

In this research, a series of novel rectangular polyaniline tubes (RPTs) are synthesized using hollow carbon nanosphere (HCNS) templates. By changing mass ratios of ammonium persulfate to HCNSs, the sizes of RPTs can be controlled. Chemical activation with KOH gives rise to a large specific surface area (SSA), ranging from 1680 to 2415 m2 g -1, and big pore volumes that range from 1.274 to 1.550 cm 3g-1. These observations demonstrate that activated rectangular polyaniline-based carbon tubes ARP-CTs are promising hydrogen adsorbents. Hydrogen uptake measurements show that the highest hydrogen adsorption reaches 5.2 wt% at 5 MPa/77 K and 0.62 wt% at 7.5 MPa/293 K respectively.

The coupling is known to be important for dissociative recombination of H3+, for which detailed and simplified theoretical models have been previously developed. In this study we discuss how the detailed theoretical model reproduces individual resonances in the experimental spectrum of H 3+. We present a simplified theoretical model of the dissociative recombination of H3O+. Similarly to H 3+, we consider the Jahn-Teller coupling as a key factor responsible for the capture of the electron into a Rydberg state associated with excited vibrational levels of the ion. We use a simplified Jahn-Teller model for highly symmetrical ions (not only for H3O+ and H 3+) and adopt the normal mode approximation for the vibrational states of H3O+. Using the multi-channel quantum defect formalism and accurate ab initio calculations, we derive the cross sections for electron capture by the ion that is initially in the ground vibrational level. In our approximation, once the electron is captured by the ion, the autoionization probability is neglected compared to the predissociation probability. This allows us to evaluate the cross section for the dissociative recombination of H3O+ using just a few parameters obtained from ab initio calculation. The total cross section obtained is in good agreement with data from storage ring experiments.",,"Calculations; Digital storage; Electrons; Excited states; Ions; Jahn-Teller effect; Photodissociation; Rydberg states; Ab initio calculations; Dissociative recombinations; Experimental spectra; Jahn-Teller couplings; Low energy electrons; Non-Born Oppenheimer; Theoretical modeling; Vibrational levels; Dissociation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051698449

They are complementary to artificially engineered spin systems for surface deposition, as they support a wider variety of complex states in their low energy spectrum. Here a few characteristic examples of molecular nanomagnets showcasing unusual many-body effects are presented. Antiferromagnetic wheels and chains can be described in classical terms for small sizes and large spins to a great extent, even though their wavefunctions do not significantly overlap with semiclassical configurations. Hence, surprisingly, for them the transition from the classical to the quantum regime is blurred. A specific example is the Fe18 wheel, which displays quantum phase interference by allowing Néel vector tunneling in a magnetic field. Finally, the Co5Cl single-molecule magnet is shown to have an unusual anisotropic response to a magnetic field.",,"Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Molecules; Nanomagnetics; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Superconducting materials; Synthesis (chemical); Transition metals; Wheels; Anisotropic response; Finite size scaling; Mesoscopic systems; Molecular nanomagnets; Quantum phase interference; Single-molecule magnet; Surface deposition; Synthetic chemists; Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051694045

Recent experiments on storage ring devices used ion sources producing H3+ with enhanced populations of H3+ ions in the para nuclear spin configuration to shed light on the theoretically predicted faster recombination of para states. Although increased recombination rates were observed, no in situ characterization of recombining ions was performed. We present a state selective recombination study of para- and ortho-H3+ ions with electrons at 77 K in afterglow plasma in a He/Ar/H2 gas-mixture. Both spin configurations of H3+ have been observed in situ with a near infrared cavity ring down spectrometer (NIR-CRDS) using the two lowest energy levels of H3+. Using hydrogen with an enhanced population of H2 molecules in para states allowed us to influence the [para-H3+]/[ortho-H3+] ratio in the discharge and in the afterglow. We observed an increase in the measured effective recombination rate coefficients with the increase of the fraction of para-H3+. Measurements with different fractions of para-H3+ at otherwise identical conditions allowed us to determine the binary recombination rate coefficients for pure para-H3+ pαbin(77 K) = (2.0±0.4)×10-7 cm3s-1 and pure ortho-H3+ oαbin(77 K) = (4±3)×10-8 cm3s-1.",,"Dissociation; Infrared devices; Ion sources; Light measurement; Photodissociation; Afterglow plasmas; Cavity ring down; Identical conditions; In-situ characterization; Lowest energy level; Recombination rate; Spin configurations; State selective; Bins",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051685133

Neutral fragments resulting from DR events were recorded at different electron densities using a high resolution imaging detector and a large-area, energy sensitive detector. The data allowed to deduce the time dependence of the population of three groups of rotational angular momentum states J built on the vibrational ground state of the ion together with the corresponding DR rate coefficients. The latter are found to be (statistical uncertainties only) 〈α〉0,1,2 = 3.8(1), 〈α〉3,4 = 4.0(2), and 〈α〉5,6,7 = 9.0(1.3) in units of 10 -8 cm3/s, in reasonable agreement with the average values derived within the MQDT approach. The time evolution of the population curves clearly reveals that rotational cooling by SEC takes place, which can be well described by using theoretical SEC rate coefficients obtained by combining the molecular R-matrix approach with the adiabatic nuclear rotation approximation. We verify the ΔJ = -2 coefficients, which are predicted to be dominant as opposed to the ΔJ = -1 coefficients and to amount to (1 - 2)·10-6 cm3/s, to within 30%.",,"Cooling; Digital storage; Dissociation; Electrons; Ground state; Hot electrons; Image reconstruction; Population statistics; Angular momentum state; Energy-sensitive detector; High-resolution imaging; R-matrix approach; Rate coefficients; Rotational cooling; Statistical uncertainty; Vibrational ground state; Photodissociation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051683908

One might initially conclude that this process is relatively simple. However, a review of the DR literature over the past 60 years, since the pioneering papers of Sir David Bates [1], shows that the study of DR has proved to be highly challenging for both theorists and experimentalists. Both this challenge and the ubiquitous importance of the process have made its study rewarding, endlessly interesting, and full of surprises. DR is fundamentally the interaction of an electronic continuum with a vibrational continuum often connected by quasibound intermediate states. Autoionization in the first continuum competes with dissociation in the second. DR occurs at the total energy of an ion plus a free electron and is in the same region as vibrationally excited Rydberg states and other neutral superexcited states. All these states interact with each other prior to dissociation, forming a complex that controls the quantum yields of products. The complexity of the process has required both innovation and ingenuity on the part of both theorists and experimentalists. Over the years, it has become apparent that in order to compare theoretical and experimental results, the experiments must identify the electronic, vibrational and for low mass ions, the rotational state. The traditional disagreement between theoretical and experimental results has been due, in part, to the sensitivity of DR cross sections and rate constants to the state of the recombining ion. Great progress has been made in recent years in both flowing afterglow and storage ring experiments aimed at reducing this uncertainty. The latest advances and insights in theory and experiment were the topics of the Eighth International Conference on Dissociative Recombination held at the Granlibakken Lodge at Lake, Tahoe, California, 16-20 August 2010. The conference was part of a series of conferences on DR that started at Chateau Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada in May, 1988 [2] and was followed in May 1992 [3] at L'Abbaye de Saint Jacut de la Mer, Brittany, France, in May, 1995 [4] at Ein Gedi, Israel, in June 1999 [5] on the island of Nässlingen in the Stockholm archipelago, Sweden, in August, 2001 [6] at Chicago, USA, in July, 2004 [7] at the Alte Mälzerei, Mosbach, Germany and in July, 2007 [8] at the Resort d'Amelander Kaap on the island of Ameland, The Netherlands.

However, hydrolysis of NaBH4 for hydrogen generation is a complex process, which is influenced by factors such as catalyst performance, NaBH4 concentration, stabilizer concentration, reaction temperature, complex kinetics and excess water requirement. All of these limit the hydrogen storage capacities of NaBH4, whose practical application, however, has not yet reached a scientific and technical maturity. Despite extensive efforts, the kinetics of NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction is not fully understood. Therefore, better understanding of the kinetics of hydrolysis reaction and development of a reliable kinetic model is a field of great importance in the study of NaBH4 based hydrogen generation system.

As a consequence the variable cost of a thermal MWh follows the international changes of oil prices with a correlation coefficient of 99.2%. Additionally from 2013, which constitutes the start of the 3rd Phase of the EU Emission Trading Scheme, the Public Power Corporation (PPC) of Greece - the unique Administrator of the electricity network and owner of the thermal power plants on the islands - has to face the allowances cost and the penalties for the excessive releases of CO2 in the atmosphere. The present study adopts 3 scenarios in order to estimate some of the environmental, economic and social aspects of the electrification on the non-interconnected islands of the Aegean Sea up to year 2030. A database of the monthly energy productions from the non-interconnected islands from 2000 to 2009 has been created for this purpose and exploited in order to estimate the primary production in the next 2 decades in the given frame of the economic crisis. From such an analysis concrete results are derived regarding the emissions of the thermal power plants of the islands. The core of these scenarios is RES-Electricity (RES-E) production in the region having one of the highest wind and solar potential in Europe. Applying widely accepted methods for exploiting all available RES forms and overcoming the technical restrictions (that among other reasons have decelerated the RES-E penetration rate the last decade), like energy storage and coverage of the seasonal energy demand due to tourism, the results show that a high RES-E penetration target, greater than 50%, constitutes the most preferable solution in the long-term. This is the reason why the interest of the investors remains high despite the current negative economic conjuncture in Greece; on the other hand, the high unemployment on these islands exceeding 20% must be taken into account.

The operation of these remote isolated grids run on a deficit in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars yearly and must therefore be subsidized by the government. Low and high penetration wind-diesel hybrid systems (WDS) have been experimented to reduce diesel consumption. In a previous article, we explored the re-engineering of current diesel power plants with the introduction of high penetration wind systems using compressed air energy storage (CAES).

They are clearly oriented nowadays on the multi-point conversion, based on a parallel high voltage bus, with photovoltaic panels owner of their individual Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) connected to an integrated DC-DC converter managing a global Maximum Power Point. This structure allows to avoid shadowing problems. We have studied in this paper the possibility to have a small universal DC-DC converter able to work in a large input voltage range (10 - 40 volts), and producing an output voltage up to around 300 volts with a global effciency better than 96%. In this paper we describe an original Step-Up converter architecture tested on a standard inverter i.e. including its own MPPT. We also discuss the possibility to use high voltage parallel bus to improve the electro-magnetic compatibility and electro-magnetic pulse robustness by the low surface of wirer loops, which also represents an interesting way to decrease wiring prices. The global effciency improvement of this architecture has been estimated for +15 to 20% compared to classic ones.

Still, the power generated by wind turbines over time is characteristically uneven due to the unpredictable nature of their primary source of power. This only increases the problems inherent to the integration of a great number of wind turbines into power networks, making their contribution rather difficult to manage (regulating voltage and frequency, wind-farm operation, etc.) The integration of wind power in the power system is now an issue in order to optimize the utilization of the resource and in order to continue the high rate of installation of wind generating capacity, which is necessary in order to achieve the goals of sustainability and security of supply. This paper presents the main technical challenges that are associated with the integration of wind power into power systems. These challenges include effects of wind power on the power system, the power system operating cost, power quality and power imbalances (stability of grid).

A joint Research Centre among the three Piedmontese Universities and INRIM, partially funded by Regione Piemonte, has been established in 2009 as Reference Centre for Medical Ultrasounds (CRUM). In addition to research, development and training tasks, the Centre aims at the local diffusion of the quality assurance in clinical US equipments.

The goal is the provision of a regional database, which progressively includes data related to acceptance test, status and QC tests and maintenance, in order to drive equipment turnover and carefully monitoring the overall equipment efficiency.

The muon anomalous magnetic moment has served as a benchmark for models of new physics, and the present experimental value is larger than the standard-model value by more than three standard deviations. The electric dipole moment (EDM) violates parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, and in the context of the CPT theorem, the combination of charge conjugation and parity (CP). Since a new source of CP violation outside of that observed in the K and B meson systems is needed to help explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe, searches for EDMs are being carried out worldwide on a number of systems. The standard-model value of the EDM is immeasurably small, so any evidence for an EDM would signify the observation of new physics. Unique opportunities exist for EDM searches using polarized proton, deuteron or muon beams in storage rings. This talk will provide an overview of the theory of dipole moments, and the relevant experiments.

This would allow us to extend the measurements of polarization observables in photonuclear reactions on deuteron up to a photon energy of 1.5 GeV and permit to perform double polarized experiments - with linear polarized photon beams and tensor/vector polarized deuterium targets.",,"Photons; Storage rings; Tensors; Electron storage ring; Measurements of; Photonuclear reaction; Photoprocesses; Photoproductions; Polarized photons; Tagging systems; Tensor asymmetry; Deuterium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959204481

The magnitude of the effect is determined by the refractive index of deuterons in matter, which depends on the spin-dependent part d1 of the amplitude of zero-angle coherent elastic scattering of the deuteron by the nucleus. Spin dichroism is determined by the imaginary part of this amplitude, and in view of the optical theorem, by the total scattering cross-section, which is different for different spin states of the deuteron. The phenomenon of spin dichroism of deuterons results in the fact that after passing through the target, the initially unpolarized deuteron beam acquires tensor polarization proportional to the difference in the total cross-sections of scattering of deuterons with different spin states by the nucleus. The stated difference was first measured for deuterons with energies up to 20 MeV, where the phenomenon of deuteron spin dichroism was experimentally revealed, and the deuteron tensor polarization was measured. The phenomenon of spin dichroism, i.e., the production of tensor polarization was also observed at high deuteron energy. In the present report we discuss the possibility that the imaginary part of the amplitude d1 of deuteron scattering by the proton may be determined experimentally by measuring the rate of the decrease in the intensity of an unpolarized proton beam in a storage ring as the beam passes through a tensor-polarized deuterium target.",,"Bandpass filters; Coherent scattering; Dichroism; Elastic scattering; Polarization; Proton beams; Refractive index; Spin dynamics; Tensors; Birefringence effects; Deuteron beams; Deuteron energies; Imaginary parts; Optical theorem; Tensor polarization; Total scattering cross sections; Unpolarized targets; Deuterium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959192757

NaNH2BH3 is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, known to dehydrogenate in milder conditions than its parent compound. The preparation was made from sodium hydride NaH and NH3BH3 according to three different energy-efficient routes: namely, ball-milling, grinding in a mortar, and simple mixing with a spatula. In each case, NaNH2BH3 was formed. In other words, it has been demonstrated that the solid-solid reaction between NaH and NH3BH3 can take place by simple contact of these molecules, owing to the basic character of the former and the acidity of the latter. The as-formed materials dehydrogenate to a high extent at low temperature, with ca. 2 equivalent hydrogen H2 (NH3-free in our conditions) evolving at temperatures up to 95 °C. An effective gravimetric hydrogen density of ca. 7.4 wt% was calculated, which may correspond to an effective capacity of 3.7 wt% (assuming the weight of NaNH 2BH3 amounts to 50% of the weight of the whole storage system). Such performance confirms the high potential of amidoboranes as hydrogen storage material, especially when compared to NH3BH 3. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main advantage of liquid hydrogen in comparison with other forms of its storage and transportation is in allowing wide use of superconductivity, which would optimise energy efficiency of the economy. The basic element of the infrastructure for hydrogen economy is a network of superconducting pipelines carrying simultaneously liquid hydrogen and loss-free electricity. The most likely material for such infrastructure is MgB2, the only superconductor efficiently working at boiling temperature of liquid hydrogen and not showing strong critical current reduction on grain boundaries. The cheap techniques for the preparation of MgB2 are hot isostatic pressing, resistive sintering and paint coating. These and other advanced techniques are able to provide MgB2 with suitable for the infrastructure structural and superconducting properties. The preparation of a large-area superconducting joint between two pieces of MgB2 as a technique enabling this infrastructure is reported.

Ru, Co, and Cu acetylacetonates were used as precursors and ethylene glycol as reducing agent. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS, and tested in ammonia-borane (NH 3BH3) hydrolytic dehydrogenation at variable amount of catalyst (10-30 wt%), concentration of NH3BH3 (1.0-0.65 M), and temperatures (50-65 °C). The reactions were monitored by volumetric (inverted burette) and spectroscopic methods (11B and 11B{1H} NMR). It was found that the best bimetallic catalysts are those having a molar ratio Ru:Co and Ru:Cu of 1:1 such as RuCo &gt; RuCu ∼ Ru.

Single InAs quantum dots are optically active and thus can be used as an interface between photonic flying qubits and spin-based stationary qubits. Incorporating single InAs quantum dots into semiconductor devices allows the stationary qubits to be manipulated, making this system a promising candidate for quantum computation. It is well known that the exciton state of quantum dots is split into two polarisation dependent states; the energy difference between the states is the fine-structure splitting, (s). A vertical electric field has been used to tune |s| over a large range of ∼ 100μeV, such that a dot which has |s| over 50μeV at zero field has been tuned to emit polarisation entangled photon pairs[1]. We observe coherent coupling between the two polarisation eigenstates. This coupling results in an anticrossing as the two states are tuned close to each other, and a rotation of the eigenstates through 90° as |s| is swept through its minimum value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd 2011.",,"Atomic physics; Condensed matter physics; Electric fields; Excitons; Indium arsenide; Nanocrystals; Narrow band gap semiconductors; Photons; Polarization; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum theory; Semiconductor devices; Coherent coupling; Electrical tuning; Energy differences; Entangled photon pairs; Fine structure splitting; InAs quantum dots; Single quantum dot; Vertical electric fields; Semiconductor quantum dots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955890801

Fibres in filament wound composite structures are placed on geodesic paths around the mandrel, which becomes the liner; so that when the structure is pressurised the fibres are only subjected to tensile forces, as in a unidirectional composite. Multiscale modelling reveals that composite failure is controlled by fibre breakage and that clustering of fibre breaks determines ultimate reliability of the structure. Time dependent relaxation of the matrix leads to delayed failure of the elastic fibres. A statistical study, using the stochastic properties of the fibres, determines the range of lifetimes which will be obtained in a given class of pressure vessel, leading to an evaluation of failure probabilities as a function of internal pressures. In this way the definition of safety factors, based on an understanding of the physical processes governing damage accumulation, becomes possible. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Together, these three sites have disposed 16 Mt of CO2 by 2010. In highly variable reservoirs, with permeability ranging from a few milliDarcy to more than one Darcy, single wells have injected several hundred Kt of CO2 per year. In the reservoirs, the actual CO2 plume development has been strongly controlled by geological factors that we learned about during injection. Geophysical monitoring methods (especially seismic, gravity, and satellite data) have, at each site, revealed some of these unpredicted geological factors. Thus monitoring methods are as valuable for reservoir characterisation as they are for monitoring fluid saturation and pressure changes. Current scientific debates that address CO2 storage capacity mainly focus on the utilization of the pore space (efficiency) and the rate of pressure dissipation in response to injection (pressure limits). We add to this that detailed CO2 site characterisation and monitoring is needed to prove significant practical CO2 storage capacity - on a case by case basis. As this specific site experience and knowledge develops more general conclusions on storage capacity, injectivity and efficiency may be possible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon; In Salah; Operations; Sleipner; Snøhvit; Storage","Carbon; Digital storage; Efficiency; Energy storage; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Monitoring; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Tin; Fluid saturations; Geological factors; Geophysical monitoring; Monitoring methods; Operational experience; Operations; Reservoir characterisation; Sleipner; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955462711

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection wells for Japan's (or a certain country's) CCS in the immediate future are to be located keeping proper space among one another within one or two intensive sea areas, so that the human and financial resources could be efficiently allocated to the geological survey, the environmental assessment, the public communication and moreover to monitoring after the launch of CCS. Then, multiple existing plants would be retrofitted to the CO2 capture facilities on their respective reasonable scale. Capture-ready new plants may also be fitted well to this scheme. CO2 would be transported by ships from the multiple sources to the storage site complex and injected to the assigned wells via socket buoys.

These activities were conducted as part of Phase II of the U.S. Department of Energy's Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership program. The purpose of the activities was to evaluate the potential dual purpose of CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in carbonate rocks deeper than 2400 m. Activities were conducted to 1) establish the baseline geological characteristics of the injection site, 2) determine the effect that CO 2 has on the ability of the oil reservoir to store CO2 and produce incremental oil, and 3) evaluate the ability of Schlumberger's Reservoir Saturation Tool (RST) and Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) technologies to detect a smallvolume CO2 plume in deep carbonate reservoirs. While the CO2-based EOR operations at the Weyburn and Midale fields in Saskatchewan, Canada, are good examples of economically and technically successful injection of CO2 for simultaneous EOR and sequestration, the depths of injection in those fields are relatively shallow (ca. 1400 m) and not necessarily representative of many large Williston Basin oil fields. One of the primary goals of the PCOR Partnership Phase II Williston Basin Field Validation Test was to evaluate the effectiveness of CO2 for EOR and sequestration in oil fields at depths greater than 2400 m. To achieve that goal, a CO2 huff 'n' puff (HnP) test was conducted on a well that is currently producing oil from the Mission Canyon Formation at a depth of approximately 2450 m in the Northwest McGregor oil field in Williams County, North Dakota. During the test, 440 tonnes of CO2 was injected into a single well and allowed to ""soak"" for 2 weeks, after which the well was put back into production. Unique elements of the Northwest McGregor Mission Canyon reservoir as compared to other HnP operations in the literature include the following: 1) at a depth of 2450 m, it would be among the deepest, 2) pressure (approximately 20 MPa) and temperature (approximately 80°C) would be among the highest for a HnP, and 3) most HnPs in the literature are in clastic reservoirs, while the Northwest McGregor Mission Canyon reservoir is a carbonate reservoir. Using a petrophysical model of the reservoir, iterative dynamic simulations of the fate of CO2 in the target reservoir were developed. Characterization and modeling in support of dynamic simulations included normalizing all logs and performing an error-minimizing stochastic multimineral petrophysical analysis. Neural networks were used to produce matrix permeability to gas and liquids, vertical permeability to gas, irreducible fluid saturations, fracture intensity, and missing zones or logs in the study area. Petrophysical results were verified with Qemscan®, x-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis, and cutting and core descriptions. This produced the main components for a macrofacies/microfacies and fluid model, with the major lithofacies being limestones, dolomites, and anhydrites. To gain a regional understanding of the producing interval, large-scale trend modeling used a traditional sequential indicator and Gaussian simulations, while small downscaled injection models used discrete and continuous multiple point statistics guided by inverted seismic data. The dynamic response of the injection zone was evaluated for changes over the course of the project using two-dimensional VSP projected into three dimensions, temporally resolute RST logs in sigma mode, and produced fluid analyses that were used to history-match fluid and gas saturations. The static and dynamic modeling activities were conducted in an iterative manner, with each iteration based on the acquisition of new data over the course of the baseline characterization, injection, and postinjection activities. These simulations were compared to actual postinjection reservoir conditions as monitored over the duration of the study period. The simulations demonstrated the importance of considering the effects of fracture networks on CO2 movement when predicting CO2 mobility and fate. The results of the RST indicated that the CO2 migrated approximately 15 meters vertically into the reservoir. The results of the VSP provided valuable data regarding the horizontal nature of the Mission Canyon reservoir and sealing lithofacies identified by the RST and core studies, but its ability to identify a CO2 plume within the reservoir was determined to be inconclusive. Productivity of the oil well was observed to more than double over the course of a 3-month production period, increasing from a baseline oil production rate of 1.5 stock tank barrels (STBs) a day to 3 to 7 STBs a day. Overall, the results of the field demonstration indicate that 1) CO2-based HnP operations may be a viable option for EOR in deep carbonate oil reservoirs, 2) the RST and VSP technologies are effective tools for baseline characterization, and 3) the RST may be an effective MVA tool for deep carbonate oil reservoirs, but the ability of the VSP technology to identify small volumes of CO2 in a deep carbonate reservoir could not be conclusively determined. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","EOR; Monitoring","Carbonation; Characterization; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Fracture; Gas permeability; Greenhouse gases; Iterative methods; Monitoring; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Oil well production; Oil well testing; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Seismic prospecting; Seismic waves; Seismology; Stochastic systems; X ray diffraction; Carbonate oil reservoirs; Geological characteristics; Multiple-point statistics; Petrophysical analysis; Static and dynamic modeling; U.S. Department of Energy; Vertical permeabilities; Vertical seismic profiles; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955460026

(2) MHI has co-developed the Kansai Mitsubishi Carbon Dioxide Recovery Process (KM-CDR Process™) and KS-1™ absorbent, which has been deployed in seven CO2 capture plants, now under commercial operation operating at a CO2 capture capacity of 450 metric tons per day (tpd). In addition, a further two commercial plants are now under construction all of which capture CO2 from natural gas fired flue gas boilers and steam reformers. Accordingly this technology is now available for commercial scale CO2 capture for gas boiler and gas turbine application. (3) However before offering commercial CO2 capture plants for coal fired flue gas application, it is necessary to verify the influence of, and develop countermeasures for, related impurities contained in coal fired flue gas. This includes the influence on both the absorbent and the entire system of the CO2 capture plant to achieve high operational reliability and minimize maintenance requirements. (4) Preventing the accumulation of impurities, especially the build up of dust, is very important when treating coal fired flue gas and MHI has undertaken significant work to understand the impact of impurities in order to achieve reliable and stable operating conditions and to efficiently optimize integration between the CO2 capture plant, the coal fired power plant and the flue gas clean up equipment. (5) To achieve this purpose, MHI constructed a 10 tpd CO2 capture demonstration plant at the Matsushima 1,000MW Power Station and confirmed successful, long term demonstration following ∼5,000 hours of operation in 2006-07 with 50% financial support by RITE, as a joint program to promote technological development with the private sector, and cooperation from J-POWER. (6) Following successful demonstration testing at Matsushima, additional testing was undertaken in 2008 to examine the impact of entrainment of higher levels of flue gas impurities (primarily SOx and dust by bypassing the existing FGD) and to determine which components of the CO 2 recovery process are responsible for the removal of these impurities. Following an additional 1,000 demonstration hours, results indicated stable operational performance in relation to the following impurities; 1) SO2: even at higher SO2 concentrations were almost completely removed from the flue gas before entering the CO2 absorber. 2) Dust: the accumulation of dust in the absorbent was higher, leading to an advanced understanding of the behavior of dust in the CO2 capture plant and the dust removal efficiency of each component within the CO2 recovery system. The data obtained is useful for the design of large-scale units and confirms the operating robustness of the CO2 capture plant accounting for wide fluctuations in impurity concentrations. (7) This important coal fired flue gas testing showed categorically that minimizing the accumulation of large concentrations of impurities, and to suppress dust concentrations below a prescribed level, is important to achieve long-term stable operation and to minimize maintenance work for the CO2 capture plant. To comply with the above requirement, various countermeasures have been developed which include the optimization of the impurity removal technology, flue gas pre treatment and improved optimization with the flue gas desulfurization facility. (8) In case of a commercial scale CO2 capture plant applied for coal fired flue gas, its respective size will be several thousand tpd which represents a considerable scale-up from the 10 tpd demonstration plant. In order to ensure the operational reliability and to accurately confirm the influence and the behavior of the impurities in coal fired flue gas, it is necessary to gain further operational experience with coal fired flue gas at large scale. To this extent, MHI has partnered with Southern Company and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the United States for a large scale CCS demonstration project using the KM-CDR Process™ and KS-1™ absorbent. MHI's coal fired CO2 capture experience and know how at 10 tpd scale aided in the design of the 500 tpd CO2 capture demonstration plant to be deployed at Plant Barry Power Station in Alabama. Commissioning of the plant will take place in Q2 2011 and an extensive test program is planned. Following successful demonstration of this plant, in relation to the effect of scale-up concerning the behavior of impurities, it is envisaged that larger-scale commercial CO2 capture plants can be designed and deployed for the coal fired power sector. (9) This paper will summarize the status of the Matsushima plant operational results and the optimization and examination of impurity removal efficiency within the individual plant components. In addition, the current status of the 500 tpd CO2 capture demonstration plant project will be reported. (10) MHI, as a heavy industrial equipment manufacturer, can provide an integrated plant design through the provision of power generation equipment, flue gas clean up, process plants and CO2 compressors. MHI is actively developing solutions to mitigate global warming through the deployment of economically efficient environmental control technologies and advanced optimization of plant equipment. Related activities such as the large scale demonstration of CO 2 capture, with our global partners, are important steps leading to the commercialization of this technology for application in the coal fired power generation sector, thus helping to reduce atmospheric industrial emissions of CO2. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Coal fired flue gas; Demonstration plant; Global warming; MHI","Absorption; Boilers; Carbon capture; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Coal; Coal dust; Coal storage; Demonstrations; Digital storage; Dust; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Equipment; Fighter aircraft; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas compressors; Gas fired boilers; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Impurities; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Recovery; Removal; Software testing; Sulfur dioxide; Technology transfer; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Coal fired flue gas; Coal-fired power generation; Demonstration plants; Electric Power Research Institute; Gas turbine applications; Power generation equipment; Technological development; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955459675

Characterization of these reactions is important for understanding changes in porosity and permeability and the propagation or sealing of fractures in the formation or wellbore cement. Experiments involving the reaction of CO2 with reservoir mineral assemblages and wellbore cement under in situ conditions, combined with geochemical modeling, were used to identify candidate reactive mineral phases and reaction rates specifically applicable to CO2 injection at In Salah. These findings informed a reactive transport model which considered advective transport of CO2 along the wellbore-formation interface and diffusive transport of CO2 and brine constituents into juxtaposed wellbore cement. Model results indicate shallow carbonation of the cement along the interface, leading to changes in cement porosity. Diffusive transport of cations such as Ca, Fe, and Al between the cement and formation materials results in mineralogical changes in the formation material immediately adjacent to the cement, including localized dissolution of calcite and precipitation of siderite, magnesite, gibbsite, smectite, and amorphous silica. In contrast to the cement, the modeled porosity changes in the formation material appear to be minor.

Korean government recently announced that Korea has set its voluntary 2020 emissions reduction target to a 30 % reduction from its forecast under a ""business as usual"" scenario, which is equivalent to 4% less than the 594 million tons of carbon that was emitted in 2005. CCS is included to achieve this target. This paper first explains the CO2 storage potential both in onshore and offshore areas in Korea. While onshore sedimentary basins seem to have unfavorable physical properties such as porosity and permeability, offshore sedimentary basins exhibit very good physical properties in sand thickness and porosity. In order to implement CCS project at the scale needed to achieve a meaningful reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the knowledge of the available CO2 storage capacity obtained by detailed matching of large stationary CO 2 sources with geological storage sites is required. Most CCS programs in Korea, however, are not integrated with capture and storage projects.

As purification of the stream is energy and cost intensive it is necessary to allow a certain level of impurities. The effects of impurities on (short- and long-term) geological storage are, however, uncertain. In this work, geochemical modelling with PHREEQC is performed to describe such effects on a sandstone reservoir (depleted gas field). The impact of two possible CO2 streams, originating from pre-combustion and oxyfuel capture technology is investigated. The streams contain O2, H2, CO, H2S, SO2, and/or NO as potential chemically reactive components. H2S, SO2 and NO are computed to oxidize, thereby forming sulfuric or nitric acid, and decrease the pH of the formation water. A low pH of the brine may be the result of extensive dissolution and dissociation, and therefore accumulation in the brine phase, especially close to the injection well. The impact of impurities on fast reacting minerals (short-term effects) is predicted to be relatively insignificant, due to the low amount of brine generally present in a gas field. On the long-term (equilibrium stage), impurities cause a slightly different mineralogy compared to pure CO2 injection. For the latter case a final increase in porosity of 3.5% is predicted whilst impurities (especially oxygen) could mitigate the porosity increase to zero due to the precipitation of minerals with higher molar volumes, like alunite and nontronite. Overall, the impurities do not seem to have a significant impact on the reservoir, even if accumulation in the brine takes place. The possible limiting effect of diffusion of impurities within the supercritical CO2 towards the brine has not been taken into account, even though the effect could be relevant. It could delay the effect of the impurities due to retarded dissolution. Further research should focus on this issue. Also the spatial effects and effects on different reservoir types, cap rock and well cement need to be investigated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Geochemical modelling; Impurities; Mineral assemblage; Sandstone reservoir","Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Gas industry; Geochemistry; Greenhouse gases; Industrial plants; Injection (oil wells); Minerals; Natural gas fields; Porosity; Precombustion; Sandstone; Sulfur dioxide; Diffusion of impurities; Effects of impurities; Geochemical modelling; Geological storage; Mineral assemblage; Reactive components; Sandstone reservoirs; Short-term effects; Impurities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955456193

While recognising the role of coal - emitting nearly 42 percent of man-made CO2 globally - we want to focus on other aspects of CCS that we find are just as, or more important in actually driving the deployment of CCS in the coming years. One of these factors is what we see as an evolving ""industry norm"" to inject, into geological formations, CO2 extracted from high-CO2 natural gas in gas refineries or LNG plants. A second trend driving CCS in the petroleum sector is the need to produce increasingly acid natural gas (CO 2 and/or H2S rich) and heavier oil. This will certainly accelerate the number of petroleum related CCS-projects in the next decades and thus be valuable for geo-storage learning. A third and already important factor is the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). Today v-EOR is mostly limited to USA - with nearly one hundred operating projects - and a small but increasing number in other countries. In the period to 2030 and beyond, it is the view of the authors that CO2-EOR will fan out across the sedimentary basins of the world. These three factors will not only add to our knowledge of geological storage of CO2, but also be important drivers to develop storage sites, pipeline networks, shipping routes and other infrastructure components for CO2. There are in fact some profitable CCS-projects or at least projects with modest needs for subsidies. With the present electricity-from-coal focus of CCS, it is easy to forget the potential role of other branches of industry with large point sources of CO 2. The branches of iron and steel, cement, petrochemicals, refining, fertiliser, biomass-to-energy are examples we should focus more on. This lack of broad focus is regrettable for two reasons. Firstly, some of these are CO 2 sources which lend themselves to CCS by having higher CO 2 concentrations or higher pressures than power plant flue gas, resulting in potentially lower capture cost. Secondly we need these branches of industry to learn CCS-capture technologies from each other, to progress their own demo-projects and become familiar with the practices of geo-store companies. The main focus in this paper is learning geo-storage by taking available CO2-streams rather than creating such streams through billion dollar investment projects. One such example is that hydrogen today is largely produced and distributed by pipelines and other methods by a small group of specialised industrial gas companies. The connection between these companies and CO 2-storage operators are, however, nearly non-existent. Hydrogen - except for pre-combustion to electricity - has been put on the back-burner in connection with CCS. We here argue for focussing more on hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS aimed at end-use in industry. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Cement; Coal; Energy policy; Geo-storage; Iron; Steel","Carbon capture; Cements; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coal storage; Energy policy; Enhanced recovery; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Iron; Natural gas; Oil well flooding; Pipelines; Precombustion; Public utilities; Steel; Coal-fired power plant; Enhanced oil recovery; Geological formation; Geological storage; Industrial gas companies; Investment projects; Petroleum sectors; Sedimentary basin; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955456151

There are several technologies for CO2 capture for distributed CO2 emission sites where natural gas is consumed. These technologies show very high efficiency and capturing CO2 will not lose too much energy. Green hydrogen is produced from renewable energy such as wind power, and shows very small CO2 emission intensity.

This site has been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS total system in which CO2 is captured from natural gas processing plants, transported to the injection site (100km away from the plants), and then stored in the saline aquifers underneath the seabed of the Japan Sea. Four technical issues have been reviewed for the surface facilities, namely CO2 transportation, removal of impurities in the CO2 gas, the liquefied CO2 heater models and the shaft seal system for CO2 pumps. As for the CO2 transportation method, tanker trucks transportation is selected compared to pipelines because of the merits in a construction period, economy, and local citizen's understanding and acceptance which are crucial for the realization of the project. Concerning process building, removal of impurities contained in the CO2 gas has been considered first. CO2 gas separated from natural gas contains hydrogen sulfide, mercury, and BTX in addition to water. These impurities must be eliminated prior to liquefaction of CO2 because they could interfere with the process as well as for environmental considerations. The adsorption method is found to be effective for removing all these impurities. However, it is also found that adsorbent consumption rate depends largely on the process sequence with which the impurities are eliminated. After reviewing the results, it is found that the most economical sequence to eliminate these impurities is in the order of mercury, hydrogen sulfide, BTX, then water. Liquefied CO2 heater models have been considered to reduce CO2 emission. After transportation to the injection site, the liquefied CO2 is pressurized and heated from -10°C to a super critical state of 40°C in order to avoid phase transition inside the injection tube. Using a heat pump to utilize the heat in the air to improve the energy efficiency, CO2 emission is substantially reduced by approximately 70% compared to the conventional method using hot water from a boiler that uses heavy fuel oil. A centrifugal pump will be selected for CO2 pumps because it can handle large volumes. An effective shaft seal system is the tandem formation using vapor-liquid seal and dry gas seal for the first and the second stages respectively. However, since we have limited experience of this formation at CO2 pumps in Japan, it is identified as a critical item in the demonstration project. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon capture; Critical current density (superconductivity); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Hydrogeology; Mercury (metal); Natural gas; Pumps; Removal; Seals; Sulfur determination; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Construction period; Conventional methods; Demonstration project; Environmental considerations; Natural gas processing plants; Removal of impurities; Transportation method; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955454647

As the combustion of fossil fuels generates CO2 emissions, new technologies are required to enable the power sector to continue to meet the global demand for electric power, while controlling the CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming. To achieve meaningful reductions, it will be necessary to develop technologies that can be applied to both greenfield projects and to the existing fleet through cost effective retrofits. Among those technologies under development, Post-Combustion Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) using the Chilled Ammonia Process (CAP) technology is one of the more promising solutions. Testing and technology development for CAP has been completed at the We Energies Field Pilot and is underway at the E.ON Karlshamn and AEP Mountaineer facilities. This paper will report on the progress being made at those three facilities and describe how the data being generated is contributing to the commercial scale-up of the technology. The current status of these facilities is as follows: • The We Energies Field Pilot, designed to capture over 15,000 metric tonnes/year of CO2, commenced operations in June 2008 and was operated through October 2009. This first of a kind Proof of Concept unit demonstrated that CAP could be applied to coal fired applications. • The E.ON Karlshamn Field Pilot, designed to capture over 15,000 metric tonnes/year of CO2, was commissioned in April of 2009 and captures CO2 emissions from a boiler combusting a high sulfur fuel oil. • The Product Validation Facility (PVF) at American Electric Power (AEP)'s coal-fired Mountaineer Power Plant, inaugurated in September 2009, is designed to capture and store 100,000 metric tonnes/year of CO2. The Chilled Ammonia Product Validation Facility treats a flue gas slipstream taken from a location downstream of Mountaineer's existing selective catalytic reduction (SCR), electrostatic precipitator (ESP), and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) systems. Deployment of a CAP facility in this configuration represents a significant step in the technology scale-up process. This project scope includes CO2 capture, compression, and storage in two geologic reservoirs with injection wellheads located on the plant property. AEP worked with Battelle to develop the geologic storage system.

Yet questions over the security of CO2 storage and the cost of large scale deployment remain. This work looks at the key technoeconomical issues which arise in CO2 storage, including the characterization of possible storage sites - one of the main targets of this work - with the principal focus to describe candidate CO2 storage reservoirs and the process by which CO 2 could be injected and stored in these formations. A thorough evaluation of these formations and their ability to accept and retain injected CO2 must be an essential component of site assessment before any CO2 is injected. Here we take a closer look at these formations in the broad area of Portugal and try to match the potential sites with the greater CO2 emissions power plants. At a properly designed and wellmanaged CO2 storage site, the chance of CO2 leakage should be small; thus, concerns about catastrophic release are likely unfounded. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity; Portugal; Sites; Storage","Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Capacity; Large-scale deployment; Portugal; Renewable sources; Site assessment; Sites; Storage capacity; Storage reservoirs; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955450438

However, a CCS project itself emits some CO2. Therefore, to estimate CCS's net CO2 reduction effect, it is effective to apply life cycle assessment (LCA) to CCS projects. In this paper, we assumed a number of CCS project models to be feasible in Japan, and estimated the amount of CO2 emissions to store one ton of CO2 by applying LCA to the CCS projects. As a result, depending on the model case, 50% or more of the CO2 amount to be stored was emitted. The study also revealed that approximately 80% of the CO2 emissions at CCS-applied facilities derived from the energy consumed to re-heat the liquid absorbent that absorbed CO2. The study also indicated that a substantial amount of CO2 emissions can be reduced if heat integration is conducted between the production equipment and the CCS equipment for energy utilization, such as bleeding CO2 from a power station and other production equipment. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS; Heat integration; LCA; Life cycle assessment","Carbon capture; Energy utilization; Equipment; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Life cycle; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Heat integration; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Power station; Production equipments; Project model; Reduction effects; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955449950

In addition several chemical companies often store and transport large quantities of CO 2 and this may also represent a hazard. There is a need to model potential loss of containment scenarios for risk assessment and design purposes for such installations. It is observed that several models used in quantitative risk analyses and hazard assessment studies are not able to take into account modelling of the thermodynamics of CO2 in case of accidental releases from dense or supercritical conditions. Statoil together with DNV therefore initiated a project to further improve the Phast code for modelling of CO 2 releases. The work and methodology derived in this project have mainly been developed by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), but with significant co-operation and input by Statoil. The consequence modelling package Phast examines the progress of a potential incident from the initial release to the far-field dispersion including the modelling of rainout and subsequent vaporisation. The original Phast 6.54 models allow the released chemical to occur only in the vapour and liquid phases. The new Phast 6.6 models were extended to also allow for the occurrence of fluid to solid transition in case of CO2 releases. This applies both for the post-expansion state in the discharge model, as well as for the thermodynamic calculations by the dispersion model. Here it is assumed that no solid deposition occurs on the ground. The current paper documents work regarding modelling by Phast 6.6 of discharge and atmospheric dispersion of carbon dioxide, including a detailed sensitivity analysis for a wide range of scenarios (base cases) including high-pressure cold releases (liquid storage) and high-pressure supercritical releases (vapour storage) from vessels, short pipes or long pipes. The objectives of this work were to examine the effect of input parameters on key output data, to ensure robustness of the models, and to identify further model improvements where deemed to be necessary. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric dispersion; Consequence modelling; Discharge; Thermodynamics","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon capture; Chemical hazards; Digital storage; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Injection (oil wells); Liquids; Offshore gas wells; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Supercritical fluid extraction; Thermodynamics; Atmospheric dispersion; Capture and storage technologies; Dispersion modeling; Fluid to solid transitions; Potential incidents; Quantitative risk analysis; Supercritical condition; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955448953

In this context, the potential to retrofit carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture to existing power plants so that they can continue to operate in plausible future scenarios where significant cuts in CO2 emissions are required from the electricity sector has become an increasingly 'hot topic'. One potentially important characteristic of retrofitted plants that is typically overlooked in assessments of CO2 capture retrofit is that they are likely to have 'built-in flexibility'. For example, for plants that retrofit post-combustion capture without any significant changes to the power cycle (i.e. that do not undertake a boiler/turbine retrofit at the time as adding capture), it should be technically feasible for the plant to avoid the majority of the efficiency penalty associated with operating CO2 capture by temporarily bypassing the capture unit. The low pressure steam turbine, condenser and generator will be sized so that they are able to use the steam that is diverted away from the CO2 capture unit for power generation without any additional expenditure, since this steam was included in the design flow before capture was fitted. This paper and a related PhD thesis contributes to developing understanding of the potential value of built-in flexibility of coal-fired power plants retrofitted with post-combustion capture and potential enhancements associated with temporary storage of rich solvent. This analysis is important to inform investment and policy decisions and brings together engineering and economic assessment. Thus, it is able to draw robust conclusions that are relevant in determining both priorities for future technical design work and decisions about which modes of operating flexibility may be sufficiently valuable to warrant further analysis within investment appraisal or policy-making related to retrofitting post-combustion capture to pulverised coal plants. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS in future energy systems; Flexibility; Post-combustion capture; Retrofitting; Techno-economic comparisons","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Combustion; Decision making; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Retrofitting; Steam turbines; Capital expenditures; Coal-fired power plant; Flexibility; Future energies; Operating flexibility; Post-combustion captures; Retrofitted power plants; Techno-economic comparisons; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955447309

The CO 2 injection is part of an ongoing enhanced oil recovery effort that will extend to 2035 and likely beyond. Both Weyburn and the adjacent Midale oil field are highly suitable for CO2-EOR and it is expected that, combined, more than 40 MT CO2 will eventually be stored in these carbonate reservoirs. Currently about 2.4 MT and 0.4 MT CO2/year are being stored in the Weyburn and Midale fields, respectively, which now represent the largest site of monitored geological storage of CO2 globally. The Weyburn Field is operated by Cenovus Energy and the Midale Field by Apache Canada. The anthropogenic CO2 used at Weyburn-Midale is a by-product of coal gasification at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota, USA. The compressed CO2 is delivered to the oil fields through a 323 km pipeline that crosses the international boundary. The IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project was established prior to the onset of CO2 injection at Weyburn to assess monitoring methods and subsurface processes associated with the injection of CO2 into geological storage sites. This research program is now in its second phase of research. Baseline 3D seismic surveys were performed over the Weyburn Field before injection and subsequent repeat 3D seismic surveys have been taken during the course of injection spanning multiple years and have indicated that CO 2 distribution within the reservoir can be imaged seismically. Similarly, repeat reservoir fluid sampling surveys have monitored a range of chemical and isotopic parameters to help identify processes associated with CO2-rock interaction. In addition, multiple soil gas and shallow hydrology surveys have been performed during the past 10 years with no indication of CO2 reaching the surface. The current research program is building on many of the results obtained during the first phase of work on the Weyburn Field. For example, some of the current research includes applying stochastic methods to relate fluid chemistry to the seismic data to better characterize the distribution of CO2 in the subsurface. Additional methods of modeling CO2 distribution post-injection are also being demonstrated and integrated into several risk assessment methodologies. A detailed well database has been developed to catalogue characteristics associated with wells drilled at various stages of field development using different cementing practices and completion methods to assist with providing parameters for long-term modeling of well behaviour. In addition, a downhole well integrity testing program to examine cement sheath characteristics will be implemented in two wells in each of the fields. In summary, more than 30 research studies are being performed within this phase of the program to examine aspects of site characterization, well integrity, geochemical and geophysical monitoring methods and risk assessment. One of the goals for the work from this research program is to provide a best practices manual for the transition of CO2-EOR sites into storage sites.

As reported by McGrail et al., [1] experiments with basalts demonstrated surprisingly rapid carbonate mineral formation occurring with samples suspended in the supercritical CO2 (scCO2) phase. Those experiments were limited to a few temperatures and CO2 pressures representing relatively shallow (≈1 km) reservoir depths. Because continental flood basalts can extend to depths of 5 km or more, in this paper we extend the earlier results across a pressure-temperature range representative of these greater depths. Different basalt samples, including well cuttings from the borehole used in a pilot-scale basalt sequestration project (Eastern Washington, U.S.) and core samples from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, were exposed to aqueous solutions in equilibrium with scCO2 and water-rich scCO2 at six different pressures and temperatures for select periods of time (30 to 180 days). Conditions corresponding to a shallow injection of CO2 (7.4 MPa, 34°C) indicate limited reactivity with basalt; surface carbonate precipitates were not easily identified on post-reacted basalt grains. Basalts exposed under identical times appeared increasingly more reacted with simulated depths. Tests conducted at higher pressures (≥12 MPa) and temperatures (≥55°C), reveal a wide variety of surface precipitates forming in both fluid phases. Under shallow conditions tiny clusters of aragonite needles began forming in the wet scCO2 fluid, whereas in the CO2 saturated water, cation substituted calcite developed thin radiating coatings. Although these types of coatings were sparse, conditions corresponding to deeper depths showed increasing carbonate precipitation. Basalts exposed to aqueous dissolved CO2 (25.5 MPa, 116°C) for 30 days were coated in tiny nodules of precipitate (∼100 μm in diameter) that were identified by micro x-ray diffraction as ankerite, [Ca(Fe,Mg)(CO 3)2], a variety of dolomite commonly associated with hydrothermal and metamorphic environments. Surface characterization by SEM revealed well-developed round nodules composed of discrete individual platelets. In contrast, reaction products forming on the basalt in the corresponding wet scCO2 phase had completely different morphology, appearing in an optical microscope as a surface coating instead of discrete nodules. Examination by SEM revealed layers of discrete platelets forming a cover over a few discrete nodules. Longer test durations (180 days) produced severe iron staining along with minerals structures similar to rhodochrosite and kutnohorite. These preliminary experiments show strong evidence of the faster rate of increase in mineralization reactions taking place in the scCO2 phase, transformation reactions that are just beginning to be explored in detail. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Mineralization","Basalt; Carbon; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Coatings; Effluent treatment; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mineralogy; Platelets; Precipitates; Solutions; Supercritical fluids; X ray diffraction; Carbon sequestration; Central atlantic magmatic provinces; Continental flood basalt; Micro X-ray-diffraction; Mineralization; Mineralization reaction; Surface characterization; Transformation Reactions; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955446740

Nevertheless, the possibility remains that the CO2 will leak out of the formation into overlying groundwater aquifers. A site specific remediation plan is also important during the site selection process and necessary before storage begins. Due to the importance of protecting drinking water resources, this study analyzes the optimal remediation scenario for various leakage conditions. The three objectives for remediation considered here are removing any mobile CO2, reducing the quantity of CO2 in the reservoir, and reducing the aqueous phase concentration of CO2. The first part of our research was to determine the processes that control the size and shape of the leakage plume in the groundwater aquifer. We used the multiphase flow simulator TOUGH2 with CO2 leakage from a point source to analyze the plume at various leakage rates. We next determined that during remediation the important physical processes include capillary trapping as a result of hysteresis in the relative permeability curves, dissolution, and buoyancy induced flow. We compared the effectiveness of using vertical and horizontal extraction wells to remove the CO2. We next examined injecting water to dissolve the gaseous CO2 and reduce the overall concentration and increase capillary trapping. Finally, we analyzed the combination of water injection and extraction with multiple wells to determine the optimal spacing and flow rate. Based on the simulations analyzed for this study, multiple conclusions can be made on the effectiveness of various remediation scenarios. With one vertical extraction well the optimal scenario for the larger leakage cases is a multistep extraction process that removes mobile CO2 from the areas with high gas saturation first. A horizontal extraction well in the middle of the aquifer is much more efficient than vertical wells at removing CO2. Water injection is effective at quickly reducing the mobile phase CO2 with tradeoffs between injection rate and increases in pressure. The most effective scenario over a longer time period includes injection for a short time followed by extraction from four vertical wells. To reduce the CO2 most rapidly, four injector wells with high flow rates and one extraction well is the most effective for the large leakage cases. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Groundwater; Remediation; Storage","Aquifers; Atmospheric composition; Energy storage; Extraction; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Horizontal wells; Hydrogeology; Injection (oil wells); Oil well flooding; Pollution; Potable water; Process control; Remediation; Site selection; Underground reservoirs; Water; Water injection; Water resources; Buoyancy induced flow; Extraction wells; Groundwater aquifer; Long-term storage; Multistep extractions; Relative permeability curves; Remediation plan; Storage reservoirs; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955445789

In preparation for implementation of a cap and trade program under this Act, Chevron has undertaken a detailed assessment of greenhouse gas mitigation options and costs. Such an assessment is key to making compliance decisions within the constraints of a given cap and trade regime. If the cap and trade market is minimally restricted (i.e., recognizes that climate change is a global issue and thus has no geographic restrictions and no set requirement for onsite emission reductions), facilities can make the best economic (and environmental) choices of where to 'make' emission reductions inside the facility fenceline and when to 'buy' the emission reduction allowances or credits on the market. The scope of the study included Chevron's two refineries and a large heavy oil steamflood production operation in California. This paper will discuss how mitigation technologies are identified and assessed, describe some of the key greenhouse gas mitigation alternatives of interest to the Chevron California facilities and present a business-based approach to analyzing mitigation costs. Technologies studied included energy efficiency, advanced energy (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, low temperature heat recovery) and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). For each mitigation option, a consistent methodology, based on the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association/American Petroleum Institute (IPIECA/API) Guidelines for Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Projects was used to assess baseline or 'business as usual' emissions, net emission reductions due to the project, capital cost, operating cost and any project benefits (e.g., reduced fuel use for energy efficiency projects). These values were then entered into a business evaluation tool to calculate a Net Present Value for each option. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gases; Geothermal energy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heavy oil production; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Temperature; Waste heat; Cap-and-trade program; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Environmental conservation; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Low temperature heat recovery; Net emission reductions; Production operations; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955442486

To date however, few studies have repeated measures, in order to study how public awareness of CCS develops. This study therefore aims to investigate the development over time of public awareness of CCS, as well as the development over time of public knowledge and understanding of energy and climate and the relationship between these concepts. Our first survey of awareness and knowledge among the general Dutch public took place in 2004, the fourth in 2008. Overall, public awareness of CCS was found to be quite low. The knowledge tests revealed a very substantial part of the general Dutch public does not understand the relationship between current energy use and climate change. Knowledge levels on this topic did not increase between 2004 and 2008. Only awareness of CCS increased statistically significant, though not much. Almost half of the Dutch seemed to be still unaware of CCS by the end of 2008, despite the media's attention for CCS and despite the plans for storage in Barendrecht being public for more than a year at this point in time. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Public awareness; Public knowledge; Public perception; Repeated measures","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Current energy; General publics; Knowledge level; Public awareness; Public knowledge; Public perception; Repeated measures; Social support; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955442453

This option, called CO 2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR), can provide a ""bridge"" to a low-carbon energy future. However, to date, CO 2-EOR has only occurred in a few regions, and just a few of these CO2-EOR projects have pursued CO2 storage as a co-objective. To better understand the potential and constraints offered by integrated CO2-EOR and CO2 storage, this study addressed three questions: (1) How large is the world-wide oil resource potential and associated CO2 storage capacity offered by CO2-EOR, today and in the future? (2) What factors have facilitated or hindered the wide-scale deployment of CO2-EOR? and (3) What set of actions could significantly increase storage potential from the integrated application of CO2-EOR and CO2 storage? We reviewed the major CO 2-EOR operations underway around the world to better understand the factors that facilitated or hindered their implementation. The study concluded that CO2-EOR is not a new phenomena, and that commercial-scale, profitable CO2-EOR has been underway for over 30 years in geologically favorable oil fields with access to affordable CO2. The CO2-EOR experience in the U.S. and elsewhere shows that CO 2-EOR is successful in oil fields that: (1) meet the technical criteria for achieving miscibility (primarily depth and oil composition); (2) have sufficient unrecovered oil after primary and secondary recovery (water flooding); (3) have access to reliable sources of CO2 at affordable costs; (4) are being developed by operators with the technical knowledge and commercial interest in pursuing CO2-EOR technologies; and (5) can benefit from government incentives that promote CO2-EOR projects. To assess worldwide CO2-EOR potential, a database of the largest 54 oil basins of the world (that account for approximately 95% of the world's estimated ultimately recoverable oil potential) was built, including representation of some of the major oil fields in these basins. From this, a high-level, first-order assessment of the CO2-EOR oil recovery and CO2 storage potential in these basins was developed, using U.S. experience as analogue. We then tested our basin-level estimates with reservoir modeling of 47 large oilfields in 6 of these basins. These basins are estimated to contain 4,622 billion barrels of original oil in place (OOIP) in discovered oil fields, within which remains an oil target of 3,090 billion barrels for CO 2-EOR. After screening these basins for CO2-EOR potential and deleting those that are not technically favorable for miscible CO 2-EOR, we estimated that 470 billion barrels could be recovered from fields favorable for miscible CO2-EOR, and could facilitate the storage of 140 billion metric tons (Gt) of CO2. These basins also contain an estimated 8,700 billion barrels of undiscovered oil in-place (as of the year 2000), with 2,900 billion barrels of this resource estimated as recoverable. If CO2-EOR technology could also be successfully applied to this undiscovered resource, our estimates of the potential for the world-wide application of CO2-EOR grow to 1,070 billion barrels of oil, with associated CO2 storage potential of 320 Gt. Currently, approximately half of the potential CO2 demand for CO2-EOR operations in discovered fields in the world can be met by large, identified anthropogenic CO2 sources within distances of 800 kilometers, a distance comparable to existing and planned CO2 pipelines serving EOR projects. These CO2 supplies could support the production of 225 billion barrels of incremental oil through CO2-EOR operations. New anthropogenic sources, such as the large refineries and hydrogen plants being constructed in the Middle East, the development of high CO2 content natural gas fields in the Far East, the aggregation of smaller CO2 sources, and the construction of longer, larger capacity, pipelines could provide the bridge between CO2 supply and demand for CO 2-EOR. Assuming U.S. $15 per metric ton as the cost for CO2 (to cover compression and transportation costs), the vast majority of this technical CO2-EOR potential could be economic to pursue at a $70/barrel world oil price. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Bridges; Costs; Economics; Enhanced recovery; Gas industry; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas fields; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum transportation; Pipelines; Secondary recovery; Well flooding; Anthropogenic sources; Enhanced oil recovery; Estimated ultimately recoverable; Government incentive; Integrated applications; Original oil in places; Transportation cost; Undiscovered resources; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955441960

Process description is accomplished by phase equilibria models which are able to reproduce the vapor-liquid and vapor-solid equilibria. Different process configurations are proposed. Total electric energy demand was defined as the evaluation criteria and the most suitable configuration was selected within technical limits. Further performance enhancement was achieved by improving the compression cooling cycles. An economic evaluation was performed for the low temperature process and the results were compared to a chemical absorption process with monoethanolamine.

Process Group has designed and built several pilot scale capture plants including one located at the Hazelwood Power Station, which is the largest capture plant on a coal fired power station in Australia. This paper discusses some of the lessons from these pilot plants and presents a new retrofit postcombustion study that investigates carbon capture from a 500MW power station (nominally 3.7 million tpa CO2) using three solvents with and without heat integration into the steam cycle. Data pertaining to processing 25% of the flue gas from a 500MW power station (nominally 0.9 million tpa CO2) is also presented. The study found &lt;5% difference between existing solvent processes in terms of overall plant CAPEX and &lt;15% difference in OPEX and that for the end user the most advantageous way to design a capture plant is to ensure that it functions with a wide range of solvents and can be easily adapted for future technology advances. The cost of capture for a 500 MW brown coal power station with non-optimised heat integration was determined to be in the range AUD$53-63/t CO2 avoided, which incorporated an improvement of approximately $8-13/t due to the non-optimised heat integration. The heat integration resulted in modest (5%) energy and cooling duty savings however, with further optimisation performed specific to the given power station and capture plant it is expected that the cost of capture could be further reduced to at or below AUD$50/t CO2 avoided. In situations where cooling water is used exclusively for a full scale capture facility the cooling water usage increased by 85-95%. However, when enhanced heat integration is incorporated this increase is expected to be limited to 75-80% for all technologies analysed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Cost of capture; Energy penalty; Hazelwood; Integration; Post-combustion capture","Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Cooling; Cooling water; Costs; Data handling; Digital storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Pilot plants; Solvents; Steam engineering; Coal fired power station; Coal power stations; Construction technique; Demonstration project; Energy penalties; Future technologies; Hazelwood; Post-combustion captures; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955440342

Here, just three areas of mainly technical risk and uncertainty are discussed relating to technology integration, to IGCC site choice and infrastructure and to GHG storage. Technology integration risks and uncertainties are managed primarily through carefully designed agreement structures and close-in ZeroGen engagements which enable very early information sharing, collaboration and integration between technology providers especially on mass and heat balance issues. Site choice and infrastructure are managed first by a critical technical assurance test on coal quality, followed ranking of differential NPV vs. site-specific non-financial risks using multi-criteria analysis. A distinction is made in the type and level of cost, risk and uncertainty in maturing a storage resource i.e. between lower cost, higher uncertainty storage and higher cost, relatively lower risk and uncertainty plant. For the former, the main focus is the definition and quantification of uncertainty. In the latter, risk and uncertainty reduction are the focuses and are more amenable to creative engineered and commercial solutions. This higher implicit uncertainty at the relatively low cost side of the project may lead to the development of stage gate ""tests"" based on confidence levels in required storage performance prior to making larger plant investment decisions. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; IGCC; Risk; Storage; Uncertainty","Costs; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Investments; Risk assessment; Risks; IGCC; Mass and heat balances; Multi Criteria Analysis; Pre-feasibility studies; Risk and uncertainty; Risks and uncertainties; Technology Integration; Uncertainty; Risk management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955440339

As an example, during the year of 2005, about 84% of the national primary energy demand was supplied by imported oil, coal and natural gas. Also, the predictions for CO2 emissions to the year of 2010 will be 45% above the defined limit. Applying TIMES model tool, this paper examines different scenarios regarding the price levels of CO2 taxes and trading under the Emissions Trading System in Europe and consider the perspectives of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the scenario where the emissions licenses for CO2 credits are obtained for a price of 20 €/tonne of CO2 emitted, the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant will be the main thermal power plants in next three decades. After that period, the installed capacity of coal power plants will increase significantly from 2040 on and NGCC will almost vanish. In the scenarios where CCS was an option, the most significant conclusion is that above 50&lt;€/tonne of CO2 emitted are the CCS technologies economically feasible, maintaining the predictions for electricity demand that show a slowly decrease after the year 2020. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Energy system; Modelling; Portugal","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Models; Natural gas; Thermoelectric power plants; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Electricity demands; Emissions trading system; Energy systems; Natural gas combined cycles; Portugal; Primary energy demand; Thermal power plants; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955440321

Evidence from the laboratory and the field shows that the limiting factors for in situ mineral carbonation are the dissolution rate of CO2 into the aqueous phase and the release rate of divalent cations from basic silicate minerals. Up to now, pilot CO 2 storage projects and commercial operations have focused on the injection and storage of anthropogenic CO2 as a supercritical phase in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or deep saline aquifers with limited potential for CO2 mineralization. The CarbFix Pilot Project will test the feasibility of in situ mineral carbonation in basaltic rocks as a way to permanently and safely store CO2. The test includes the capture of CO2 flue gas from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant and the injection of 2200 tons of CO2 per year, fully dissolved in water, at the CarbFix pilot injection site in SW Iceland. This paper describes the design of the CO2 injection test and the novel approach for monitoring and verification of CO2 mineralization in the subsurface by tagging the injected CO2 with radiocarbon (14C), and using SF5CF3 and amidorhodamine G as conservative tracers to monitor the transport of the injected CO2 charged water. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Basalt; Geochemical monitoring; Iceland; In situ mineralization; Pilot project","Aquifers; Basalt; Carbon; Carbonation; Geothermal energy; Geothermal power plants; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Mineralogy; Minerals; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Water injection; Commercial operation; Conservative tracers; Deep saline aquifers; Geochemical monitoring; Icelands; Mineral carbonation; Oil and gas reservoir; Pilot projects; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955439825

Carbon capture and storage consists of four general processes within the system: carbon capture, carbon compression and transport, carbon injection and carbon storage. All the processes require energy to operate the system and therefore produce additional amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The energy penalty decreases the efficiency of the plant: the total conditional efficiency of the CCS system is often characterised as difference between CO2 emissions eliminated by CCS and CO2 emissions produced by CCS processes. Additionally, CCS is associated with environmental, safety and human consequences because of CO2 leakage from storage sites and its impact to ecosystems, stability of geological layers and changes in geological properties of formations, etc. This paper is aimed at the identification and optimisation of costs and the environmental impact categories caused by energy consumption at a CCS power plant for the realization of carbon compression, pipeline transport and carbon injection phases. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CO2; Costs; Injection; LCA; Transport","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Geology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Life cycle; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon injections; Energy penalties; Geological layers; Geological properties; Life cycle assessment model; Pipeline transport; Transport; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955438778

The Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs) are the mechanism DOE utilizes to prove the technology and to develop human capital, stakeholder networks, information for regulatory policy, best practices documents and training to work toward the commercialization of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The RCSPs are tasked with determining the most suitable technologies, regulations, and infrastructure for carbon capture, transport, and storage in their respective geographic areas of responsibility. The seven partnerships include more than 400 state agencies, universities, national laboratories, private companies, and environmental organizations, spanning 43 states and four Canadian provinces. The Regional Partnerships Initiative is being implemented in three phases: Characterization, Validation, and Development. The initial Characterization Phase began in 2003 and was completed in 2005 and focused on characterization of CO2 storage potential within each region. It was followed by the Validation Phase, which began in 2005 and is nearing completion in 2011. The focus of the Validation Phase has been on small-scale field tests throughout the seven partnerships in various formation types such as saline, oil-bearing, and coal seams. The Validation Phase has characterized suitable CO2 storage reservoirs and identified the need for comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks to enable commercial-scale CCS deployment. Finally, the Development Phase will consist of a series of large-scale, one-million-ton, injection tests throughout the United States and Canada.

It is designed to study vertical flow of CO2 in porous media over length scales representative of leakage scenarios in geologic carbon sequestration. The plan for LUCI is a set of three vertical column pressure vessels, each of which is ∼500 m long and ∼1 m in diameter. The vessels will be filled with brine and sand or sedimentary rock. Each vessel will have an inner column to simulate a well for deployment of down-hole logging tools. The experiments are configured to simulate CO2 leakage by releasing CO2 into the bottoms of the columns. The scale of the LUCI facility will permit measurements to study CO2 flow over pressure and temperature variations that span supercritical to subcritical gas conditions. It will enable observation or inference of a variety of relevant processes such as buoyancy-driven flow in porous media, Joule-Thomson cooling, thermal exchange, viscous fingering, residual trapping, and CO2 dissolution. Experiments are also planned for reactive flow of CO2 and acidified brines in caprock sediments and well cements, and for CO2-enhanced methanogenesis in organic-rich shales. A comprehensive suite of geophysical logging instruments will be deployed to monitor experimental conditions as well as provide data to quantify vertical resolution of sensor technologies. The experimental observations from LUCI will generate fundamental new understanding of the processes governing CO2 trapping and vertical migration, and will provide valuable data to calibrate and validate large-scale model simulations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Buoyancy; Experimental; Joule-Thomson; Leakage; Storage","Brines; Buoyancy; Digital storage; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Porous materials; Sedimentary rocks; Well logging; Buoyancy driven flows; Experimental; Experimental conditions; Experimental facilities; Geologic carbon sequestrations; Joule-Thomson; Joule-Thomson cooling; Underground laboratory; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955437699

The efficiency of carbon capture must be improved to reduce the energy penalty because capture stage is the most energy-consuming stage in the entire process of CCS. Energy-efficient distributed carbon capture in hydrogen production has been demonstrated with an advanced membrane reformer system. We have already developed and operated an advanced 40 Nm3/h-class membrane reformer system and demonstrated its high hydrogen production efficiency of 81.4% (HHV), which is the world highest efficiency in terms of hydrogen production from natural gas. The system has another significant feature that the CO2 concentration in the reactor off-gas is as high as 70̃90% and CO 2 can be liquefied and separated easily with little energy loss. An apparatus for CO2 capture was combined to the membrane reformer system and over 90% of CO2 in the reactor off-gas was captured by cryogenic separation. The total energy efficiency of hydrogen production even with CO2 capture was still as high as 78.6% (HHV), which is 5∼10% higher than the conventional reforming technologies. The total CO2 emission from hydrogen production was decreased by 50% with only a 3% energy loss. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to evaluate the effects of the operating conditions of the system on hydrogen production efficiency and CO2 reduction rate. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture; CO2; Efficiency; Hydrogen; Membrane reactor","Bioreactors; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Energy dissipation; Gas permeable membranes; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Natural gas; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Cryogenic separation; Energy efficient; Energy penalties; Membrane reactor; Operating condition; Production efficiency; Reforming technology; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955437256

Carbon dioxide storage in the subsurface could be an important part of the present climate control initiative to reduce the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere. Layer of water-bearing permeable rock is assumed as a saturated porous medium, and the contained water can be replaced by compressed carbon dioxide. In such environment, water vapor flow can be developed from the thermal gradient caused by geothermal energy. High injection pressure is required to remove the fluid already present in the pores of solid skeleton hence accurate density calculation is important. So we use an extended ideal gas law to calculate the compressed carbon dioxide gas density. Temperature dependent entry pressure is accounting the surface tension and wetting angle role on the sorption equilibrium. Governing equations for numerical simulations are: mass balance equations for each component, i.e., water, vapor and carbon dioxide; energy balance equation. We have used a combined monolithic and staggered coupling scheme to solve these equations numerically using an automatic time stepping scheme.

To control the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these plants and sustain their operational competitiveness in a carbon constrained world, the CO2 in the flue gas stream has to be captured, cleaned up and compressed to make it suitable for pipeline transport and permanent storage in geological formations. The flue gas CO2 capture and processing, including integrated multi-pollutant control, provides a feasible and viable technological pathway towards this goal. For oxy-fuel combustion systems, the CO2 capture is best achieved by physical gas separation through a series of compression and cooling stages to liquefy and separate CO2 from non-condensable gases in the flue gas stream. The effectiveness of the CO2 capture and compression system depends on the process design and assessed using removal efficiency, level of purification and energy demand for a unit of captured CO2. If the CO2 capture process can also simultaneously remove other pollutants in the gas stream, then the whole process becomes more efficient and cost-effective. In this case, implementing an elaborate flue gas pre-treatment system will not be necessary. Hence, CO 2 capture technologies that are capable of simultaneously controlling emissions of multiple pollutants offer the potential to achieve emissions reduction at lower cost and reduced footprint, when compared to conventional emission control systems. For the new oxy-coal fired power plants, multi-pollutant control technologies can help designers of these plants select effective and less expensive compliance strategies, compared with compliance choices made when the requirements are addressed individually. CanmetENERGY has developed and successfully implemented an advanced and proprietary CO 2 capture and compression unit (CO2CCU) that is capable of capturing and generating a relatively pure CO2 product stream, while simultaneously removing the pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and mercury in the process condensate streams. The pilot-scale unit is currently integrated with the existing 0.3 MWth oxy-fuel Vertical Combustor Research Facility. This advanced CO2 capture system represents an integrated approach to oxy-fuel combustion with multi-pollutant and CO2 capture and provides a unique test platform for CO2 processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the recent pilot-scale test results of CanmetENERGY's CO2CCU. The unit was used to conduct experiments with a broad range of flue gas compositions, including different levels of CO 2 concentrations and a host of impurities in the flue gas stream. The real-time measurements of CO2 product and vent stream gas compositions as well as the analysis of condensate streams provide insight into the type of chemical reactions that are taking place under different pressure, temperature, and moisture levels. The experimental results help to explain some of the chemical reactions involved in the CO2 capture and compression for better optimizing the capture process. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption; Lead-chamber reactions; Multi-pollutant control","Adsorption; Argon; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Chemical reactions; Coal; Coal combustion; Combustion; Compliance control; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel systems; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Oxides; Pollution; Process design; Sulfur; Chamber reaction; Coal-fired power plant; Compliance strategies; Multi-pollutant control; Multi-pollutant control technology; Process-related parameters; Real time measurements; Technological pathways; River pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955435779

Geological storage of CO2 is perceived to be one of the most promising methods that could provide significant reduction in CO2 emissions over the short and medium term. Since a major concern regarding geological storage is the possibility of leakage, trapping CO2 in the solid form is quite attractive. Unlike mineral trapping, the kinetics of CO2-hydrate formation is quite fast, providing the opportunity for long-term storage of CO2. In this paper, we study storage of CO2 at conditions similar to those at depleted gas pools of Northern Alberta. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that CO2 hydrate is stable at temperatures that occur in a number of formations in Northern Alberta, in an area where significant CO2 emissions are associated with production of oil sands and bitumen. Numerical simulation results presented in this paper suggest that, upon CO2 injection into such depleted gas reservoirs, pressure would initially rise until conditions are appropriate for hydrate formation, enabling storage of large volumes of CO2 in solid form. These results show that, because of tight packing of CO2 molecules in the solid (hydrate), the CO 2 storage capacity of these pools is many times greater than their original gas-in-place. This provides a local option for storage of a portion of the CO2 emissions there. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Depleted gas reservoir; Hydrate; Storage","Climate change; Energy storage; Gas hydrates; Gases; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrates; Hydration; Oil sands; Petroleum reservoirs; Storage (materials); Depleted gas reservoir; Geological storage; Hydrate formation; Long-term storage; Mineral trapping; Original gas in places; Storage capacity; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955435031

The future role of CCS in the Finnish energy system is further assessed with energy and emission scenarios created with a comprehensive model called TIMES-Nordic. There are several large CO2 emission sources in Finland that could be potential candidates for CCS, including steel works, power and heat generating plants, as well as oil refineries. In 2008, the 12 largest facilities in the Finnish emission trading registry accounted for 30% of the total CO2 emissions in Finland. Since the Finnish bedrock is not suitable for large-scale geological storage of CO2, captured CO2 would most likely have to be transported to the North Sea or Barents Sea for long-term storage. Most of the largest CO2 emitting facilities are located on the coast line of Finland, which facilitates transportation of CO2 by ship. The current Finnish climate and energy policy largely focuses on increasing the share of renewable energy and nuclear power in energy conversion, which leaves less room for CCS. The preliminary results from the scenario calculations indicate that the share of CO2 mitigation by CCS in Finland would be less than 10 Mt/a CO2 by 2050. However, Finland has also large, stationary CO2 emissions originating from biomass combustion in the pulp and paper industry. When assuming that biogenic CO2 emissions would be included into the emission trading system, the CCS potential rises up to 18 Mt/a CO2 by 2050. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-CCS; Capture; Finland; Scenario; Storage","Carbon capture; Combustion; Commerce; Energy conversion; Energy policy; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Paper and pulp industry; Plants (botany); Bio-CCS; Capture; Comprehensive model; Emission trading systems; Energy and emissions; Finland; Pulp and paper industry; Scenario; Carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Combustion; Crude Oil; Greenhouse Gases; Paper Industry; Pulp Industry; Refiners; Storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955431654

This process avoids stripping CO2 as pure gas from absorbents and compression of CO 2, and therefore reduces energy consumption. The additives used in this process are recyclable ammonium salts, the NH4HSO4 and NH4HCO3. The results from extraction experiments show that NH4HSO4 was able to extract 100% of magnesium from serpentine at 100 °C after 3 hours. And the precipitation of hydromagnesite using NH4HCO3 solution is much more effective than using CO2, where the highest magnesium carbonation achieved 96%.

According to the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC, the global emissions in 2050 should be reduced by 50% at least compared to the 2000 level in order to achieve below around 2 degrees Celsius and 450 ppmv-CO 2eq.. However, the future improvement over 4% p.a. will be needed to achieve halving global emissions within a few percent of GDP losses, while the historical carbon intensity was improved by 1.2% p.a, There are large gaps between historical trends and the required efforts for such a challenging target. In addition, historical trends indicate that it is very difficult to achieve reductions in primary energy consumptions. Therefore, decarbonization of the energy, i.e., carbon intensity improvement, is indispensable for deep emission cuts. Although the developed countries had some trends of the decarbonization, it is also far from such targets of large emission reductions. De-carbonization technologies of nuclear power, renewable energies and Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) are significant. Most emission reduction scenarios including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and the International Energy Agency (IEA) show increase in carbon price to advance carbon emissions for the future under the assumptions on sustainable global cooperation for emission reductions. However, It is difficult to sustain global cooperative intention to tackle global warming over 100 years in a real world. The carbon price rather should be decreased in the long-run for sustainable development and sustainable global actions for emission reductions. In addition, historical and currently planed carbon prices of emission trading schemes in many countries are low in the real world, and high carbon prices, particularly explicit prices, are unacceptable politically. CCS development and deployment has risks of intermittent carbon price in near- and mid-term and of carbon price converging zero in long-term. This paper discusses this gap between proposed scenarios assuming ideal world including continuous increase in carbon price and politically acceptable carbon prices in the real world, and outlook of plausible CCS deployment considering the gap. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emission reduction; Carbon intensity; Sustainable development","Carbon dioxide; Carbonization; Climate change; Costs; Decarbonization; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon intensity; Developed countries; Emission trading scheme; Future improvements; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; International energy agency; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955431137

In this article, the total energy, CO2 emissions and costs of mineral carbonation are investigated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The life cycle investigation took into account energy and greenhouse gas emissions from mineral mining activities and shipment, the recovery of CO2 based on amine scrubbing technology and simulated scenarios of the net energy requirements for the carbonation process based on 'ideal' and worst case energy requirements. The CO2 avoided results from a total of 4 scenarios were in the range of 106.9 kg to 175.9 kg per 1 MWh. The percentage sequestration effectiveness results are from 32.9% to 49.7%. The life cycle costing results are 105.6 USD/tonne CO2 avoided and 127.2 USD/tonne CO2 avoided for two of the most favorable scenarios. However, it is highlighted that various engineering challenges have to be overcome before the 'ideal' carbonation reaction conditions represented in the simulation model can be achieved. The results will most likely fluctuate somewhere between the ideal and worst case conditions. The main energy penalties and associated CO2 emissions come mostly from CO2 recovery, pretreatment and mineralization process itself. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Energy use; Life cycle assessment; Simulation","Carbon; Carbonation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Minerals; Carbonation reactions; Energy requirements; Energy use; Engineering challenges; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mineral carbonation; Mineralization process; Simulation; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955430098

An 85% reduction in CO2 emissions until 2050 is imposed. The analysis is carried out with a techno-economic model (minimizing the system cost) including a detailed description of the present stationary European electricity generation system (power plants) and potential CO2 storage sites as obtained from the Chalmers Energy Infrastructure Database. The modeling puts a cap on CO 2 emissions from the system which gives a price on these emissions, i.e. similar to the effect of the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which is the main policy instrument for controlling GHG emissions within EU. Emphasize is put on analyzing turn-over in capital stock of the existing power plant infrastructure, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large scale introduction of CCS on a regional perspective, including the effect of investing in new transmission capacity between member states. The work compares two scenarios, one used in a previous work with significant growth in electricity consumption and one assuming that energy efficiency measures are successfully applied in line with the recent EU energy policy package. The results show that it is possible to meet an 85% CO2 reduction target by 2050 at a cost of some 50 to 80€/ton CO2 over the period up to 2050, but this will require large contributions from CCS and electricity from renewable sources (mainly wind and biomass). Yet, without significant energy efficiency measures it is questionable if such large investments in generation technologies are feasible. Thus, to reach an 85% reduction in CO2 emissions from the electricity generation system by 2050 is not a matter of choice between different technologies and energy efficiency measures but all of these are required and the crucial point is if there will be a high enough price on CO2 emissions. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Electrcity; EU-27; European; Generation; Infrastructure; System","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Electrcity; European; Generation; Infrastructure; System; Electric power system economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955428999

This paper presents first results of a systemic and long-term analysis of a future CCS implementation in India. It focuses on potential storage formations in the geological subsurface and the geographic match of these sinks with CO2 emissions of current and future large-point power plants. The analysis is framed by an overview on India's position on CCS, ongoing Indian research and development projects as well as its international activities. The geological potential for CO 2 sequestration in India is subject to large uncertainty because, so far, only few studies estimated it in a vague manner. A first meta-analysis shows that there is a huge variation between 48 Gt and 572 Gt of CO2. The main differences between the evaluated studies are the assumed capacities for deep saline aquifers and basalt formations. Taking the ongoing discussion and the existing uncertainties into account, the storage potential might be provided only by aquifers (in the range of 44 to 360 Gt of CO2) and hydrocarbon fields (2 to 7 Gt of CO2). The amount of CO2 emissions possibly available for sequestration is assessed by applying three substantially different long-term energy scenarios for India. These scenarios, indicating pathways between a ""low carbon"" and a ""high carbon"" development until 2050, result in cumulated CO2 emissions between 30 and 171 Gt if all new large-scaled power plants will be based on CCS from 2020 on. Compared with the sink capacities, only the CO 2 emissions of scenario S2 (30 Gt) could theoretically be stored with high certainty. Considering the scenarios S3 and S1, their CO2 emissions (94 Gt and 171 Gt, respectively) could only be sequestered if the aquifer capacity would prove to be usable. Geological storage sites do not appear to be located close to sources in South West, Central, North and North East India. This first rough analysis means that only those CO2 emissions occurring in the Western parts of North and West India, the Eastern part of South India as well as the South part of East India might be suited for sequestration nearby. A more detailed source-sink matching will follow in the next phase of the project, including results of expert meetings in India. Furthermore, this analysis will be complemented by an additional assessment from economic, ecological and resource-strategic points of view, which might further affect the potential for CCS. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Energy scenario; India; Long-term analysis; Storage potential","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Coal storage; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Deep saline aquifers; Energy scenarios; India; International activities; Long term analysis; Research and development projects; Storage potential; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955427390

In all, six emergent themes were identified - three affirmative and three negative arguments - which covered 70% of articles analysed. The data also revealed that the term 'clean coal' was most often associated with CCS technology, and that technical explanations were not often provided. Implications for energy policy, particularly in relation to communication and public engagement are discussed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Attitudes; Carbon capture and storage; Clean coal; Emerging technologies; Media; Perceptions","Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Digital storage; Greenhouse gases; Sensory perception; Attitudes; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS technologies; Clean coal; Emerging technologies; Media; Public engagement; Public perception; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955424325

Carbon capture and storage will play an integral part in future reduction of CO2 emissions together with energy optimization. Development of an efficient CCS infrastructure is the key to reaching proposed emission goal. In the current project the focus is on CO2 emissions in the Skagerrak-Kattegat region. The project encompasses all aspects of CCS, but in this article the focus is on CO2 transport infrastructure. Different infrastructure scenarios are proposed and costs are compared. This will be an iterative process and a final recommendation will be given by the end of the project period. Preliminary results will be provided in this article and are limited by the specified assumptions. Currently two scenarios, storage in the Skagerrak-Kattegat region and one outside, are estimated and compared. Both scenarios assumed that all the CO2 emitted in the region is available simultaneously and that no ramp-up is necessary. Storage in relatively close proximity to the emission sources is preferable in an economic perspective and the initial estimations indicate this. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cost estimation; Pipeline; Ship","Carbon; Carbon capture; Cost estimating; Greenhouse gases; Pipelines; Ships; Cost estimations; Current projects; Economic perspective; Emission sources; Energy optimization; Initial estimation; Iterative process; Transport infrastructure; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955424282

Initiated in 2000, the overall objective of CCP is to deliver major cost reductions for CO2 capture and demonstrate that geological storage is efficient, verifiable and secure. Phase 3 of The CO2 Capture Project (CCP3) is being undertaken during 2009-2013. Capture technologies for application in oil refineries, extraction of heavy oils and in power production from natural gas are included in the portfolio of CCP3. Demonstration of the next generation technologies is a key aspect of this phase. Two demos are currently planned, One such demonstration is currently in the advanced stages of construction, oxyfiring on a FCC Prototype unit located at the Petrobras' research complex in São Mateus, Paraná state, Brazil and a second demonstration is planned for 2011, oxyfiring on a Once-Through Steam Generator (OTSG) in Alberta, Canada. The storage monitoring and verification (SMV) program is focusing on key assurance issues and the field trialing of emerging and integrated technologies. Major projects include approaches to assessing and predicting long-term well integrity, understanding subsurface physico-chemical phenomena and monitoring technology cost-effectiveness and optimization.

Siemens bases its development efforts on an amino-acid salt solution as solvent, which has a negligible environmental impact and provides favourable properties for a low-energy capture process. The solvent features a high chemical and thermal stability and is easy to handle. The capture process is characterized by near-zero emissions. As a first step for validation of the determined solvent and process features on an industrial scale, the implementation of the capture process in a pilot plant is required. For this purpose, Siemens has installed a pilot plant at E.ON's coal-fired power plant Staudinger in Germany and started the operation in August 2009. The measured pilot plant process data are used to validate the computational process model, which refines the model accuracy and improves the reliability in terms of plant performance. The findings from pilot plant operation confirmed that an overall net plant efficiency penalty of less than six percentage points (without CO2 compression) for a state-of-the-art coal-fired steam power plant can be achieved. The paper also presents experiences from pilot plant measuring campaigns with regard to the impact of trace components such as SOx and NOx. Solvent losses due to related degradation effects can be minimized by an intelligent reclaiming concept. Loss due to oxygen degradation can be estimated to be less than one percent of hold-up per year. Suitable construction materials have been qualified. The results of the pilot plant operation will serve as basis for the implementation of a demonstration plant, which will be the final step before a full-scale commercial carbon capture plant project. Siemens has been selected as technology provider for the Meri-Pori Carbon Capture and Storage project in Finland, which is a potential funding candidate of the European Flagship Programme. The Meri-Pori power plant has an installed capacity of 565 MW and the capture demonstration project is supposed to treat half of the power plant's flue gas and to capture 90 % CO2 from the treated flue gas.

The technology of CCS involves a process of capturing CO2 from industrial and energy-related sources (such as a power plant), transporting it from its sources to the storage sites, and storing it in the geological structures for long-term isolation from the atmosphere. Although the technologies for capture and storage of CO2 have been globally investigated and verified, the development of transport infrastructure is still in the initial stage except some typical cases. Especially, the effect of impurities on transport and injection is not clearly resolved yet. Up to now, process design researches for CO2 transport and storage have been carried out mainly on pure CO2 cases. Unfortunately the real captured CO2 mixture contains many impurities such as N2, O 2, Ar, H2O, SOx, H2S. Some impurities can change the thermodynamic properties and then significantly affect the compression, purification, transport and injection processes. Among them, N2 can affect the CO2 transport process by its low boiling point. In other words, a small amount of nitrogen can make change flow conditions from single phase flow to two-phase flow. And a small amount of water in CO2 stream can trigger the clogging problem due to formation of hydrate. In this paper, a numerical evaluation of process design model was carried out. We compared and analyzed the relevant equations of state for CO2-N2 mixture. To quantitatively evaluate the predictive accuracy of the equation of the state, we compared numerical calculation results with reference experimental data. In addition, optimum binary parameters to consider the interaction of CO2 and N2 molecules were suggested based on the mean absolute percent error. With regard to CO 2-H2O mixture transport, the hydrate formation possibility was analyzed based on the hypothetical scenario in republic of Korea. To understand the physical behavior of CO2-imputities mixture, experimental investigations are necessary. We made an experimental facility which is consist of high pressure compression module, liquefaction module, mixing module, cooling module and transport test section. The flow behavior such as single phase and twophase pressure drop of CO2-N2 mixture pipeline transport was experimentally analyzed. Based on this experimental data, we may suggest some design guideline for CO2 pipeline transport. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage(CCS); Equation of state; Marine geological storage; N2 impurity; Two-phase flow","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Emission control; Equations of state; Geology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydration; Mixtures; Nitrogen; Pipelines; Process design; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Equation of state; Experimental facilities; Experimental investigations; Geological storage; High pressure compression; Transport infrastructure; Two-phase pressure drops; Two phase flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955422845

Independent designs of the pipeline network, well, and reservoir models do not account for the effects one system has on the others. Coupling the different models is necessary to effectively design the full system. This paper discusses a methodology of jointly optimizing the pipeline network, well, and storage systems. This method uses simple and fast models instead of fully coupled, complex, and integrated models. It is thus applicable in the early phases of projects, when system parameters are not fully characterized (i.e., for scenario building and sensitivity analysis). Two different projects are examined: a single well with a short pipeline and multiple wells with a long pipeline. These cases can be adapted to offshore or onshore conditions. Although vertical wells were considered for this study, the same methodology can be easily extended to deviated and horizontal wells. Depending on conditions, the constraints that will dominate the full system may come from either the reservoir model or the pipeline network and well models. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Coupling; Network; Reservoir; Storage","Carbon; Couplings; Data storage equipment; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Horizontal wells; Networks (circuits); Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pipelines; Reservoirs (water); Sensitivity analysis; Independent design; Integrated models; Pipeline networks; Reservoir modeling; Reservoir models; Scenario building; Storage systems; Underground storage; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955422827

Two such sites in Northern Ireland (Scawt Hill and Carneal Plug) have been investigated, where carbonation reactions of naturally-occurring cement minerals can be observed. Here, partially hydrated larnite-rich nodules have been reacting with atmospheric CO2 or dissolved bicarbonate ions at low temperatures over the last 10-20 thousand years. This has produced rims of carbonate minerals around hydrated low-temperature calcium silicate (CSH) minerals enclosing residual cores of primary high-temperature metamorphic calcium silicates and calcium aluminates (dominated by larnite, and often accompanied by wollastonite, spurrite, paraspurrite, brownmillerite, bredigite, andradite-grossular) with carbonation proceeding progressively from the outer margins of the nodules. Calcite and scawtite are the dominant secondary calcium carbonate minerals, but vaterite and aragonite have also formed. The carbonation produces dense, low-porosity carbonate rims. This is associated with a reduction in volume, accompanied by shrinkage and microfracturing of the underlying residual poorly crystalline CSH gel and its silica-rich alteration product, which has created significant secondary porosity in the altered material. Although some secondary calcium carbonate reaction products may partially mineralise the fractures, they do not seal the fractures completely, allowing further ingress of CO 2/bicarbonate. That said, the ingress rate has not been sufficient to completely carbonate the nodules, even after several thousand years. Uncertainties remain in terms of quantifying carbonation reaction rates and the CO2/HCO3- flux, and further work is needed to understand these potentially very useful analogues. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Analogue; Borehole; Carbonation; Cement; Storage","Aluminum compounds; Atmospheric temperature; Boreholes; Calcium; Calcium silicate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Cements; Energy storage; Fracture; Greenhouse gases; Hydration; Minerals; Porosity; Portland cement; Reaction rates; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Temperature; Analogue; Calcium silicate hydrate; Carbonate reaction; Carbonation process; Carbonation reactions; Naturally occurring; Performance assessment; Secondary porosity; Calcium carbonate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955421794

The Jing-Jin-Ji Region of North-Eastern China is a major contributor to China's CO2 emissions profile with large stationary sources currently contributing annual emissions of nearly 350 million tonnes CO2 per year, of which approximately 300 million tonnes CO2 has the potential to be captured and stored annually. Two scenarios for a CCS demonstration project located in the onshore section of the Bohai Bay region in Shandong Province in the North East of China were assessed in this study. Capture studies considered a polygeneration scenario while scoping studies were performed of storage potential within the onshore Bohai Bay area. Size scales of &lt;1 Mtonnes/year (c. 5 million tonnes storage capacity) and &gt;1Mtonnes/year (c. 100 million tonnes storage capacity) were considered. Introductory screening was performed for four areas to review their potential for development for CO 2 storage. These included two oilfield provinces, a regional saline formation and a coal mining area. A preliminary risk assessment was prepared covering both technical and non-technical issues. Order of magnitude costs likely to be incurred in implementing a CCS demonstration project were assessed. These included estimates of the cost of capture and conditioning of the CO 2, transportation to a storage site and the storage of the CO 2 in a geological formation. The cost of capture was expressed relative to a reference case comprising an IGCC without CCS. A single product, electricity, was considered.

While an attractive solution, geological storage of CO2 has inherent risk. Two primary concerns are recognized: 1) leakage of CO2 through caprock imperfections, and 2) brine displacement resulting in contamination of drinking water sources. Three mechanisms for both CO2 and brine leakage have been identified: diffuse leakage through the caprock, leakage through faults and fractures in the caprock, and finally, leakage through man-made pathways such as abandoned wells from oil and gas exploration. While the first two leakage mechanisms are important, we emphasize the risks associated with the presence of abandoned wells. This is due to the large number and density of wells from a history of oil and gas exploration around the world, and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the properties of these abandoned wells. With current proposed legislation in both the United States and Europe, a need is emerging for practical assessment of leakage risk. In order to accurately predict leakage of brine and CO2 from the injection layer, the geological information for the injection site and the location and makeup of the man-made leakage pathways previously alluded to must be taken into account. Unfortunately, both the geology and abandoned well metadata are typically high in uncertainty, which must be accounted for. With such a high number of random variables, the current state of the art is running many realizations of a system, using a Monte Carlo approach. This requires that the underlying solution algorithms be accurate, and efficient. In the past, many researchers in both academia and industry have turned to robust numerical analysis packages used in the oil industry. However, due to the large range of scales important to this problem (domains of tens of kilometers on a side affected by leakage pathways with diameters of tens of centimeters) such modeling techniques become computationally expensive for all but the most basic analysis. A computational model developed at Princeton University, and currently being commercialized by Geological Storage Consultants, LLC has been shown to be efficient with sufficient accuracy to allow for comprehensive risk assessment of CO2 injection projects. The model allows for mixing solution methods- using computationally expensive algorithms for formations of greater importance (e.g.- the injection formation) and more efficient, simplified algorithms in other areas of the domain. This ability to arbitrarily mix solution methods offers significant flexibility in the design and execution of models. This paper addresses the framework and algorithms used, and illustrates the importance of efficiency and parallelism using the case study of an injection site in Alberta, Canada. We show how the framework can be used for project planning, for risk mitigation (insurance), and for regulatory groups. Finally, the importance of flexible analysis tools that allow for efficient and effective management of computational resources is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Analytical models; Carbon capture and storage; Leakage along wells; Risk assessment","Analytical models; Brines; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Computer programming; Geological surveys; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Petroleum prospecting; Potable water; Risk assessment; Computational resources; Degree of uncertainty; Drinking water sources; Framework and algorithms; Geological information; Monte Carlo approach; Oil and gas exploration; Simplified algorithms; Abandoned wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955419726

Water vaporization in supercritical-phase CO2, is an endothermic reaction that may cool reservoir fluids. Such a cooling process may result in the precipitation of solid NaCl near the wellbore that deteriorates injectevity. We evaluated these processes with numerical simulation models that include processes of injectivity reduction and potential non-isothermal effects of commercial-scale CO2 injection. Processes of interest include the vertical CO2 profile within the wellbore, injectivity reduction and the potential non-isothermal processes including Joule- Thomson (heating and cooling) effects, exothermic CO2 dissolution, and heat changes associated with concomitant water vaporization. These processes are evaluated using numerical simulations of CO2 injection and associated pressure and temperature changes within an injection well using a wellbore dynamic code. In addition, we developed independent 2-D radially symmetric models of commercial-scale CO2 injection with the TOUGH2 simulator, using its ECO2N equation-of-state package. Results of our wellbore dynamic simulations suggest that three forces, including adiabatic (de-) compression of CO2, frictional energy losses, and conductive heat exchange between the injected CO2 and surrounding fluid/rock, govern the resulting CO2 thermal profiles within the injection well. In addition, as compressed CO2 flows from the injection well to the target storage formation, the induced pressure field begins to dissipate. Such pressure reduction induces Joule-Thomson cooling by adiabatic expansion. In the same zone, water vaporization within supercriticalphase CO2 occurs and induces NaCl precipitation; this precipitation process also cools the reservoir fluid. Finally, as supercritical-phase CO2 comes into contact with formation brine, exothermic CO2 dissolution offsets the cooling with an increase of the reservoir fluid temperature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Joule-thomson effect; Multiphase transport; Non-isothermal proocess; Water vaporization","Cooling; Dissolution; Energy dissipation; Equations of state; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Isotherms; Numerical models; Oil field equipment; Precipitation (chemical); Thermoelectricity; Vaporization; Wells; Joule-Thomson cooling; Joule-Thomson effect; Multiphase transport; Non-isothermal process; Nonisothermal; Pressure and temperature; Subsurface temperature; Water vaporization; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955419708

In PCC, an amine in aqueous solution can be used to selectively capture CO2 from a flue gas to usually achieve a targeted 90% CO2 removal. However, using a 30% wt solution of MonoEthanolAmine (MEA), 3.7 GJ/tCO2 is required to release the carbon dioxide from the solvent, which is not satisfactory either from the economical point of view, or from the environmental point of view. One alternative to improve the process is to tune the chemical properties of the solvent in order to obtain a higher cyclic capacity of absorption than the one of 30% wt MEA solution. This allows to reduce the total liquid flow rate in the CO2 capture plant, and thus the energy requirement for a given CO2 removal. Another alternative, which can be combined with the first alternative, is to tune the physical properties of the solvent in order to obtain a liquidliquid phase separation in the process. In this class of DMX™ solvents, the CO2 captured concentrates in one of the two phases and only a portion of the total flow rate has to be sent to the stripper and thus, the energy requirement for a given amount of CO2 captured is reduced. In this work, we present liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid equilibrium data obtained with different DMX™ solvents along with the corresponding estimations of the potential reduction of the liquid flow rate in the stripper. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption; Amines; Liquid-liquid equilibrium; Post-combustion; Regeneration energy","Absorption; Amines; Binary mixtures; Chemical properties; Combustion; Digital storage; Ethanolamines; Greenhouse gases; Liquids; Phase equilibria; Phase separation; Solutions; Solvents; Energy requirements; Liquid liquid equilibrium; Liquid-liquid phase separation; Physical and chemical properties; Post-combustion; Post-combustion carbon captures; Potential reduction; Regeneration energy; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955419366

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly seen as an important component of broadly based greenhouse gases reduction measures, such as the use of renewable energy sources or nuclear energy. Although the other greenhouse gases are more potent, the sheer volume of CO2 makes it dominant in term of its effect in the atmosphere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) uses 19% of emission reduction requirements as the target for CCS. Although a fossil fuel power plant is a large source of CO2 emissions, with CO2 capture these emissions can be reduced substantially. However, it must be recognized that CO2 capture significantly decreases power plant efficiency; therefore, extra resources (for example, coal in the case of a coal-fired power plant) are needed to compensate for the lost capacity. Extensive application of CO2 capture will require the construction of replacement power plants to compensate for the loss of electricity to the grid. CO2 transport and storage also contribute to an increase in emissions and waste generation, as well as an increase in energy and other resource consumption. To understand the implications, CCS activities should be studied from a full life cycle perspective. The objectives of this study is to conduct life cycle assessment of combining two energy systems, coal-fired power plant and CO2 EOR, as a new tool to evaluate environmental LCA of CCS with CO2 EOR option. In addition, this is an attractive tool for decision making of any CCS project. Various equations are applied into the GaBi software (a LCA software) to model this tool. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the primary approach used in this study to create the tool for CCS environmental evaluation. The Boundary Dam Power Station (BOPS) and the Weyburn-Midale CO 2 Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, are studied and modified as the case scenarios to find the potential and encourage the applications of CCS on both energy systems. Energy, using GJ as one of its unit, is considerably the product of this combining two energy resources as one system. The application of this tool effectively demonstrates the result of CCS system as life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) on carbon footprint and resource depletion. Other environmental impacts can, therefore, be analyzed by this tool as well. Three processes; coal mining, power plant including CO2 capture unit operation, and crude oil usage, must be presented when the global warming potential (GWP) of CCS is performed. In addition, the result demonstrates the GWP reduction is directly related to fossil fuel resource use efficiency. This means the lower GWP of CCS, the lower efficiency of fossil fuel resource use as well. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; LCA","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal fueled furnaces; Crude oil; Decision making; Emission control; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural resources; Natural resources management; Oil well flooding; Renewable energy resources; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Environmental evaluation; Global warming potential; International energy agency; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle perspectives; Use of renewable energies; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955418275

Large research programs are looking into optimizing production and reducing environmental impact from the different units. It is Vattenfall vision to be CO2 neutral in the Nordic countries in 2030 and for the entire group in 2050. To obtain these goals Vattenfall is very active in developing technologies for carbon capture and storage (CCS). In Denmark Vattenfall operates three coal-fired power plants and a screening survey in 2007, matching power plant and storage site location - source sink matching - pointed towards Nordjyllandsværket near the city of Aalborg as the most obvious plant with safe onshore storage opportunities only 30 km away. It was decided to develop the project into a full scale demo project with post-combustion capture, pipeline transport and onshore storage in an aquifer. The whole project has been driven by a very firm time schedule in order to meet the 2015 deadline.

It was developed under the 2005 EU-China NZEC Agreement which aims to demonstrate CCS in China and the EU. Collaborative research activities were conducted jointly by Chinese and UK experts from 30 organisations. China's energy demand is expected to continue growing significantly; however the share of coal is projected to decrease to around 50% by 2050. For the power generation and energy intensive industrial sectors, all of which remain heavily dependent on coal, CCS is the only option that can ensure a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. A range of CO2 capture technologies in coal-fired power generation have been examined. The more promising, near term options are post-combustion capture using Monoethanolamine in a state of the art pulverised coal power plant and pre-combustion capture in an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle unit. The cost of electricity generation with capture would be 463 and 413 RMB per MWh respectively for these options. Less mature capture technology options offer some potential to lower the overall cost, but this is within the range of uncertainties. Storage assessments were undertaken in two basins in North East China. These have potential to make use of CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) although the reservoirs are geologically complex and well integrity may be a significant risk. While CO 2 EOR would provide the opportunity for gaining initial experience with CO2 injection and storage, the capacity available for EOR in these regions appears insufficient for large scale CCS. It would therefore be necessary to assess and ultimately use saline aquifers for storage. An extensive saline aquifer formation has been identified in the Songliao Basin through the project. The average cost of electricity generation taking account of capture, transport and storage costs (assuming a storage site 200km from the power plant) would be 470 RMB per MWh for the most mature capture options, an increase of around 200 RMB per MWh compared with a Pulverised Coal reference plant without CCS. This is equivalent to a cost of avoided emissions of about 280 RMB (US $50.0) per tonne of CO2. There are several challenges that need to be addressed for CCS in China. These include the extra cost and energy penalty of CCS, the novelty of the technology, the lack of regulations governing the storage of CO2 underground and the availability of the necessary equipment for deployment of CCS in China. The China-UK NZEC Initiative has shown that CCS could provide a key, low carbon option for coal-based industry in China, particularly for power generation, which would enable the continued use of coal with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. An Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the European Commission and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology for Phase II of the China-EU NZEC Agreement in November 2009. Phase II will involve the selection of a demonstration project and the completion of a feasibility study. Phase III will involve the construction and operation of a CCS demonstration project in China. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capture; China; Coal; Storage","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coal storage; Combustion; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Enhanced recovery; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Industrial emissions; Oil well flooding; Precombustion; Pulverized fuel; Underground equipment; Capture; China; Coal-fired power generation; Collaborative research activity; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Memorandum of understanding; Ministry of science and technologies; Post-combustion captures; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955417771

Scope of this study is to compare systematically the different approaches, to summarise the results, address methodological variations and formulate guidelines to assign the various conclusions gathered from the studies. CCS is a wide field with various technological options. All studies show the expected reduction in GWP but often an increase in other impact categories, regardless of capture technology and fuel considered. Three parameter sets have been identified, which have a significant impact on the results: a) development of plant efficiencies and energy penalties; b) capture efficiency and purity of the CO2; c) fuel origin and composition. Although there are still big differences in the underlying assumptions of the studies and also some methodological shortcomings, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has proved to be a helpful tool to investigate the environmental consequences related to the introduction of CCS. Nevertheless, the number of existing studies is not sufficient to give a comprehensive picture and there is still a wide field of subjects and technologies which have not been covered yet. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Methodology approach; Study comparison; Technology evaluation","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Environmental consequences; Environmental evaluation; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methodology approaches; Study comparisons; Technology evaluation; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955417754

The Roadmap builds on the IEA BLUE Map scenario that leads to the stabilisation of CO2 emissions at 450ppm by 2050. Achieving this scenario will require an energy technology revolution involving a portfolio of solutions: greater energy efficiency, increased renewable energy technologies and nuclear power, and the near decarbonisation of fossil fuel-based power generation via carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this scenario CCS contributes almost 20% to the total emissions reductions required in 2050. Recommendations are made in the IEA CCS Roadmap on what is required to achieve this level of deployment not only technically, but also from a financial and regulatory point of view as well as in terms of public engagement and international collaboration, including the sharing of knowledge. This paper looks at progress made against these recommendations in the 12 months since the release of the roadmap. •Analysis undertaken by the IEA consistently identifies a significant role for CCS in mitigating global CO2 emissions. IEA analysis suggests that there will be a need to capture and store 10 Gt CO2 per year in 2050, from3400 projects globally to achieve the BLUE Map emissions reduction targets. •Significant progress is being made to launch large-scale demonstration facilities across the globe, with some 80 largescale integrated demonstration projects identified. As of April 2010, public funding commitments were in the range of USD 26.6 billion to USD 36.1 billion. •While 5500km of CO2 pipelines already exist and further infrastructure development is planned, it is however clear that to enable large-scale deployment of CCS, more joint planning of CO2 transportation infrastructure is required globally. •The status and availability of data on CO2 storage varies significantly around the world and is potentially a major constraint to rapid, widespread CCS deployment. In regions with the potential to store large volumes of CO2, a concerted effort will be required to characterise the basins in sufficient detail. •Much progress has been achieved in the legal and regulatory area. The first movers in establishing legal frameworks have generally been OECD countries. It is now important that the large emerging economies start developing their legal and regulatory frameworks. •Public awareness and acceptance is a key element in making CCS possible. Public concerns are legitimate and require a close dialogue and sharing of information with the local population. While companies developing transport and storage will need to lead on the engagement processes, governments and politicians have a vital role to play. •Several initiatives are in place for international dialogue and collaboration on the development and deployment of CCS. •While much progress has been made, many challenges still remain if CCS is to deliver at the scale required. The challenges are well-known and require concerted action by industry, governments, international organisations and civil society. Continued political leadership remains absolutely essential. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Nuclear fuels; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Fossil fuel-based power generation; Infrastructure development; International collaborations; International energy agency; Legal and regulatory frameworks; Renewable energy technologies; Transportation infrastructures; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955417294

These workshops were designed to explore the public's awareness and acceptance of the various low emissions energy technologies, including carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), and to assess whether a large group workshop format was an effective means of affecting change in awareness and acceptance of the various energy technologies. Initial results of these workshops, presented at the International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Technologies (GHGT) in 2008, found that the workshop was indeed effective. Results from an online survey conducted in October 2009 with 95 participants of the original workshops indicate that over the longer term awareness remains at a higher level than prior to workshop attendance, while changes in participants' attitudes were not sustained over time. However, the results of 22 follow-up in-depth interviews conducted in November and December 2009 found that many workshop participants reported a change in their awareness of and preference for the energy technologies, and that they pro-actively spoke with others and sought further information regarding the technologies and their place in a low carbon economy. While wind and solar energy were clearly favored, carbon mitigation was generally recognized as a complex issue requiring a portfolio of energy solutions. Building trust in the range of energy solutions, including carbon capture and storage, will require ongoing engagement and dialogue with members of the public. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Attitudes; Awareness; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Engagement; Perceptions; Trust","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Sensory perception; Solar energy; Surveys; Attitudes; Awareness; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Engagement; Trust; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955416734

Reconciling the world's ongoing reliance on fossil fuels with the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is one of our greatest challenges. Canada is taking this challenge seriously with climate change policies that include enhancing our global leadership in advancing one of the most promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuel use: carbon capture and storage (CCS). Federal and provincial governments in Canada are making substantial investments in CCS, committing upwards of CAD 3 billion in public funding towards seven large-scale fully-integrated CCS demonstration projects. The federal ecoENERGY Technology Initiative announced $151 million for the initial engineering and/or pilot stages of seven potential demonstration projects in 2008. The 2009 federal budget created Clean Energy Fund, which included $610 million for CCS demonstrations. The Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have also committed funding for demonstrations, in particular $2 billion by Alberta. This public funding will leverage additional investment from industry, for projects that will each capture and store on the order of 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year, coming on-line starting in 2015 or sooner. In order to generate early benefits from these investments, Government of Canada intends to create a knowledge sharing framework for CCS demonstration projects in Canada. The learnings from this first wave of demonstration projects should be disseminated in order to reduce challenges for the next generation of CCS projects and to build competitive advantage. This work will also support and provide input to the knowledge sharing and best practice guidelines being currently developed by Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI). Given that this level of information has not been shared in the past, establishing such a framework will pose several challenges such as concerns regarding the protection of the intellectual property (IP) and commercially sensitive information. Knowledge sharing will also support public engagement and capacity building programs, and it will provide an opportunity to assess the effectiveness and impact of the public investment. This paper will provide an overview and progress to date on the development of knowledge sharing and best practice guidelines in Canada. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Best practices; Canada; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Demonstration; Knowledge sharing","Budget control; Climate change; Competition; Demonstrations; Finance; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Investments; Knowledge management; Public policy; Best practice guidelines; Best practices; Canada; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change policies; Knowledge-sharing; Sensitive informations; Substantial investments; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955416681

In a conventional IGCC design without carbon capture, the syngas is purified for dust and hydrogen sulphide removal and then sent to a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) for power production. The hot GT flue gases are sent to Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) for steam generation. Additional power is produces by expanding the steam generated in a steam turbine. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are expected to play a significant role in the coming decades for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle is one of the power generation technologies having the highest potential to capture carbon dioxide with the low penalties in term of plant energy efficiency and cost. The modification of the IGCC design for carbon capture can be done in various plant concepts considering the carbon capture method to be used (e.g. pre- and post-combustion capture, syngas chemical looping etc.). This paper investigates various carbon capture methods suitable to be applied for an IGCC plant for power generation. The coal blended with biomass (sawdust) based IGCC case study investigated in the paper produces around 400 - 500 MW net electricity with more than 90 % carbon capture rate. An important focus of the paper is concentrated on overall energy efficiency optimization of the IGCC plant concepts with various carbon capture options by better heat and power integration of the main plant sub-systems (e.g. steam integration between gasification island, syngas conditioning line and the steam cycle, influence of heat and power demand for Acid Gas Removal unit etc.).

Heat integration can be used to reduce the energy penalty of all power stations combined with CCS. It is also found that when heat integration is considered, the heat that can be recovered in shockwave compressor inter/after-coolers reduces the amount of steam that needs to be extracted from the steam turbine. Hence, the net power output from the power station will be higher when shockwave compressors are used for CO2 compression compared to conventional turbo-machinery. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; Compression; Heat integration; Post combustion","Bituminous coal; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Combustion; Compaction; Greenhouse gases; Lignite; Machine design; Machinery; Steam turbines; Turbomachinery; Coal power plants; Coal power stations; Heat integration; Net power outputs; Post-combustion; Post-combustion captures; Power station design; Process integration; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955415200

From conception through siting and design, it enjoyed strong support from multiple stakeholder groups, which benefited the overall project. Understanding the stakeholder engagement process for this project provides valuable insights into the design of stakeholder programs for future CCS projects. FutureGen is one of few projects worldwide that used open competition for siting both the power plant and storage reservoir. Most site proposals were coordinated by State governments. It was unique in this and other respects relative to the site selection method used on other DOE-supported projects. At the time of site selection, FutureGen was the largest proposed facility designed to combine an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fueled power plant with a CCS system. Stakeholder engagement by states and the industry consortium responsible for siting, designing, building, and operating the facility took place simultaneously and on parallel tracks. On one track were states spearheading state-wide site assessments to identify candidate sites that they wanted to propose for consideration. On the other track was a public-private partnership between an industry consortium of thirteen coal companies and electric utilities that comprised the FutureGen Alliance (Alliance) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The partnership was based on a cooperative agreement signed by both parties, which assigned the lead for siting to the Alliance. This paper describes the stakeholder engagement strategies used on both of these tracks and provides examples from the engagement process using the Illinois semi-finalist sites. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Engagement; Public acceptance; Public perception; Site selection process; Stakeholder involvement","Coal; Coal industry; Coal storage; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Site selection; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Engagement; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Public acceptance; Public perception; Public private partnerships; Stakeholder involvement; U.S. Department of Energy; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955413503

Several independent industry and community sectors, such as petroleum, water, geological carbon storage, coal seam methane and geothermal, will be competing for access to, and the use of, limited pore space and the resources within it. These sectors are often in direct conflict, for example geothermal energy production and geological carbon storage (GCS) are almost mutually exclusive. Geothermal is also in competition with the water sector (agriculture, communities etc) for the right-to-produce fluids. This new environment requires an innovative and proactive response from government, one in which the relative value and benefit of a wide variety of known and potential resources can be quantitatively assessed, and thereby managed, for the benefit of the State. This requires the building of robust and high-resolution geoscience information and knowledge systems which support the informed management of basins as multiple use zones, thus enabling the GCS, geothermal, petroleum and water sectors to co-exist and prosper. These basin resource management frameworks must be constructed at a regional-scale to allow assessments to be made of potential impacts and relative values of all relevant earth resources. As part of the Victorian Government's geological carbon storage assessment, GeoScience Victoria's VicGCS initiative has been collating, interpreting and integrating a wide-range of disparate geoscientific data from the onshore and offshore Gippsland Basin, the premier geological carbon storage location in Australia. The data include the distribution and properties of sedimentary horizons and faults (including the construction of basin-scale 3D models), rock property data, fluid compositions (water, hydrocarbons etc) and fluid flow properties, pressure data, reservoir data and extensive investigations of containment, to build highly complex and predictive geoscience models. In addition to providing a quantitative and agreed means of assessing and managing earth resources, the models provide data and ideas which dramatically improve the understanding of the current and undiscovered resource inventory. The basin resource management framework for the Gippsland Basin provides government with the management tool-kit and knowledge necessary to develop an informed strategy to manage the basin's pore space and other resources, in order to maximize the benefit from each resource and to minimize potential conflicts between competing resource sectors. This knowledge will also facilitate the gazettal of GCS acreage, GCS roll-out, and provide the basis for monitoring the basin through the GCS life-cycle. For example, through sufficient understanding of fluid migration in the basin, it is possible to monitor plumes of injected CO2, as well as the far-field effects of the injected plumes (e.g. formation pressure and the water table) across the entire basin. The regional or basin-scale knowledge required by government complements the focused and much more site-specific studies undertaken by industry. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Containment; Geological carbon storage; Gippsland basin; Impacts; Injectivity-capacity","Carbon dioxide; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal storage; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Flow of fluids; Geology; Geothermal energy; Geothermal water resources; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Life cycle; Multiple zones; Natural resources management; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Resource allocation; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Carbon storage; Containment; Gippsland basins; Impacts; Injectivity; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955413442

Geological CO2 storage associated with CO2-EOR is of significant interest in these basins as it offers potential to increase oil production and provide additional fuel to meet China's increasing energy consumption. Although some CO2 is stored during such flooding projects, the greatest storage potential is only realised at the end of a field's productive life, when a depleted field can be used as a dedicated CO2 storage reservoir. The Songliao Basin, in North-eastern China has been the largest oil and gas producing province in China. The oilfields of the Daqing and Jilin oil provinces are estimated to have effective CO2 storage capacities of 593 Mt and 71.2 Mt respectively. Extrapolation of data from around the oilfields to the whole basin suggests that the most promising saline aquifer in the basin has a theoretical storage capacity of 692 Mt CO2: its effective storage capacity (which cannot be estimated due to lack of data) is likely to be considerably smaller however. Limited data availability means the estimate of storage capacity in this saline aquifer is based on gross simplifications and extrapolation across large areas (e.g. basin-scale) but could provide a basis for comparison with the potential for CO2 storage in other regions in China, or to help prioritise more detailed analysis. Although smaller, the onshore oilfields of the Subei-Yellow Sea Basin were also assessed, as the presence of mature oil and gas fields and natural CO2 accumulations, suggest suitable targets for storage may be found. The total effective storage capacity of the 108 hydrocarbon fields in this basin are estimated to be only 21 Mt CO2. While small, these fields may offer niche storage options for smaller industrial CO2 sources, but if CCS is to contribute to reducing China's growing CO2 emissions, then further evaluation and development of storage in saline aquifers is likely to be needed at the same time as storage in oil or gas fields. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","China; Songliao; Subei","Aquifers; Coal storage; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Extrapolation; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Industrial emissions; Natural gas fields; Offshore gas fields; Oil field development; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); China; Hydrocarbon fields; Near-zero emissions; Onshore oilfields; Songliao; Storage reservoirs; Subei; Tsinghua University , Beijing; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955411925

Box 78, 3100 AB Schiedam, Netherlands","For carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), various specifications of the water content in CO2 have been given. These specifications range from 40 to 500 ppm. Unfortunately, little has been published on the rationale behind these concentration limits. The present lack of clarity on the dryness requirements is undesirable, because eventually, we must come to a water content standard for CCS that ensures cost-efficient CO2 transport. The work presented here aims at analyzing CO2 transport to provide some basic input for this standard. CO2 captured from power plants always contains moisture. The water can be removed to a certain extent at the capture plant, but a small amount of water will remain. When the water is in solution in the CO2, there is no problem, but free water combined with CO 2 is very acidic. The corrosive nature of wet CO2 poses a threat to the transport system integrity. Economical considerations lead to the use of regular carbon steel, which is commonly used for most pipelines. Corrosion resistant steel would inhibit corrosion, but it would be prohibitively expensive to build CCS pipelines with this type of steel. On one hand, using regular carbon steel requires corrosion tests to quantify the destructive effects of free water in case it is present in the CO2. On the other hand, the occurrence of free water must be excluded as much as possible. No free water anywhere in the CO2 transport system would be the most straightforward way of protecting it. Drying captured CO2 costs both money and energy and reduces flexibility in the CCS chain, so a water concentration limit should not be more stringent than necessary. A quick overview of the solubility of water in CO2 is given to enable a discussion of the operational limits of the CCS transport chain. For normal operation, the pressure range of dense phase CO2 in a pipeline transmission system is between 85 and 150 bars onshore and between 85 and 200 bars offshore. The lower limit is determined by the critical point of CO 2 (73,8 bars for pure CO2, somewhat different for CO 2 with impurities). A pressure of 85 bars ensures the CO2 remains in the dense phase in case of a temporary shutdown. The upper limits of 150 and 200 bars are chosen with regard to safety and economical optimization. Expected CO2 characteristics in the transport network include a minimum temperature of 0 °C (onshore) or 4 °C (offshore) and a maximum temperature of over 30 °C immediately after a compressor. This leads to a water solubility of at least 1500 ppm during normal operation. Commissioning of a CO2 pipeline and blowdown scenarios are discussed. The relation between the CO2 conditions during planned blowdowns and the water content should be investigated. Unplanned blowdown could involve a rapid decompression and temperature drop, for which there are no validated models available. Therefore it is difficult to determine the right water concentration limit. It was found that for a good technical and economical basis for determining the required water concentration limit some questions remain to be answered. Cost data of drying installations are needed. It should be found out what are acceptable blowdown conditions as a function of water concentration. Some thermodynamical issues are brought up as well. Finally the impurities present in the captured CO2 will need to be taken into account. Although in the USA, no serious problems seem to have surfaced with around 500 ppm water in CO2, several research questions need to be addressed to arrive at a sound and cost efficient water concentration limit. This work is carried out within CO2EuroPipe, an EU research project under the 7th Framework Programme. This project, which runs for 2, 5 years, until November 2011, aims at paving the road towards large-scale, Europe-wide infrastructure for the transport and injection of CO2 captured from industrial sources and low-emission power plants. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Free water; Operation; Pressure; Temperature","Atmospheric composition; Carbon capture; Carbon steel; Chains; Corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Costs; Digital storage; Electric power transmission; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Pipelines; Plant shutdowns; Pressure; Solubility; Specifications; Temperature; Transportation; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Concentration limits; Corrosion-resistant steel; Free water; Minimum temperatures; Operation; Pipeline transmission; Water concentrations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955411887

As a matter of fact the majority of gasification-based power plants are equipped with oxygen-blown gasifiers which have two main advantages with respect to air-blown reactors: high values of cold gas efficiency and an N2 deprived syngas. The aim of this paper is to compare two different oxygen production technologies for oxidant supply to the gasification island. An IGCC power plant with pre-combustion CO2 capture has been modelled considering: (i) a cryogenic distillation ASU based on a pumped liquid oxygen cycle; (ii) an innovative OTM-based oxygen production technology integrated in the power island. An overall heat and material balance has been estimated to evaluate plant performances and compare the two options; our thermodynamic analysis shows a promising improvement of the overall plant performance for the OTM-based IGCC nonetheless several key issues deserve a more in depth analysis to asses the real potentialities of membrane-based oxygen production technology. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","ASU; Carbon capture and storage; IGCC; OTM","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Combined cycle power plants; Distillation; Environmental impact; Fuels; Gas plants; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Liquefied gases; Oxygen; Oxygen supply; Precombustion; Thermoanalysis; Cold gas efficiency; Cryogenic distillations; IGCC; In-depth analysis; Oxygen production; Plant performance; Pre-combustion co; Thermo dynamic analysis; Electric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955410944

Simple performance and economic models for each technology are examined in the context of a bifurcated - ""pre-CCS"" vs. ""post-CCS"" - climate regime in which CCTF uses CO2 that is, respectively, captured from power plant flue gases or taken from CCS pipelines. CCTF promises to improve domestic energy security by converting sunlight and waste CO2 into transportation fuels; in addition, these fuels are roughly climate neutral when CO2 is captured from either flue gases or directly from the atmosphere. However, after the power sector becomes largely decarbonized under a stringent climate policy, large point sources of concentrated CO2 are likely to be relatively rare, and unfortunately, fuels made from pipeline CO2 destined for storage do not have markedly reduced net GHG emissions. Thus, absent the development of economical CO2 capture from air, it's difficult to see how CCTF can play a significant long term role in decarbonizing the US transportation sector (and thus reaching US climate goals). © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Climate mitigation; Microalgae biodiesel; S2P; Transportation fuels","Algae; Biodiesel; Carbon; Carbon capture; Energy security; Flue gases; Fuel storage; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Pipelines; Climate mitigations; Concentrated co; Economic models; Low carbon transportations; Micro-algae; Sandia National Laboratories; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955410880

We acquired core samples and 3D seismic surveys from the site in order to better characterize the movement of the CO2 injection plumes. The samples of SACROC reef limestone were used for ultrasonic velocity measurements, detailed mineralogy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterization, Computed Tomography (CT) scanning, thin section studies, and porosity measurements. Using a NER AutoLab 1500 at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Core Flow Lab we have measured P and S wave velocities, porosity, and permeability at varying pressures, temperatures, and fluid saturations that simulate reservoir conditions after successive floods. Measurements were also taken with supercritical CO2 at in situ pressures and temperatures. We also modeled the expected velocities for our samples using the standard Gassmann and other rock physics. We created a tool that groups grayscale ranges into three categories, cleans boundaries between groups, and produces a polygon map of the macropores, micropores, mineral grains, and matrix. In addition, the CT and SEM pore maps were analyzed to reveal pore shape statistics. Pore volume, area, and connectivity is essential for chemistry experiments that will emulate time exposure of CO2 to limestone. Further, this analysis technique allows us to obtain pore orientation information, which is important in understanding the anisotropic conditions that may affect seismic data. This multi-scale approach can help to characterize what is occurring inside of the reservoir. Fine scale measurements of how CO2 affects pore-space dissolution can help to inform us of any changes in overall reservoir storage capacity due to changing porosity. Core-scale velocity measurements under in situ conditions will allow us to predict changes in future well log or seismic surveys. Combining microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale information should lead to a better understanding of the various processes at work when CO2 is sequestered in a limestone reservoir. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","4D seismic; AVO; Carbon sequestration; CT characterization; ImageJ; Pore scale properties; Rock physics; SEM image analysis","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Core samples; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Geological surveys; Greenhouse gases; Image analysis; Limestone; Minerals; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Porosity; Reefs; Reservoirs (water); Scanning electron microscopy; Seismology; Shear waves; Surveys; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Well logging; 4D seismic; Carbon sequestration; ImageJ; Pore scale; Rock physics; SEM image analysis; Computerized tomography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955410811

MRCSP (www.mrcsp.org) covers a large region across nine Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states, with several geologic provinces including: The Michigan and Appalachian Basins, the Cincinnati Arch Province, and the coastal sedimentary layers. Given the long history of coal production, much of the region is heavily dependent on coal-fired plants for electricity, and, therefore, subject to significant economic impact from carbon-emission constraints. The sedimentary formations or geologic structures across the region provide diverse options to mitigate the emissions through geologic storage of CO2. The validation for the storage potential comes through field assessments of injectivity and containment at three locations: One each in the Appalachian and Michigan Basins and one in the uplifted Cincinnati Arch region. All three field projects were conducted in a series of steps that contribute towards development of best practices for carbon capture and storage (CCS) validation that are applicable to the MRCSP region and elsewhere. Although specific practices are highly site dependent, the general steps include initial regional geologic assessment, site characterization through seismic surveys and drilling of test wells, permitting, outreach, development of a CO2 supply system, injection and monitoring operations, and post-injection monitoring and site closure. Collectively, the regional mapping and three field demonstrations provide significant insight into geologic storage feasibility over a range of rock types and properties. Two of the tested sites indicate injection and storage rates exceeding 1000 tonnes/day/well. Such rates suggest that commercial-scale applications should be possible with a reasonable number of wells. The regional mapping of these zones also indicates that the tested layers are likely to be continuous over a large area, and, therefore, have potential for large-scale, long-term injection operations required for the numerous CO2 sources in the region. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Appalachian basin, Michigan basin, Cincinnati Arch, Mt.

In this paper, based on life-cycle analysis, the role of the Energy Network has been investigated at the national level. Results show that with the import dependency of oil controlled in the range of 40%-60% during 2020 to 2030, up to 22% of the total capacity of coal fired supercritical power plants may be replaced by hundreds of new polygeneration plants for electricity and alternative fuels. When the oil import dependency will be kept from 40% to 60%, the Energy Network can save 20%-30% of energy and cut down 30%-40% of total costs every year compared to the present method with coal fired supercritical power plants and traditional alternative fuel plants with CO2 capture. And the Energy Network can capture more than 0.1 billion tons of CO2 with high concentration over 98% each year. Moreover, from the aspect of CCS, this Energy Network can realize as low as 15$/t of total CCS cost due to the quite low energy penalties of CO2 capture in the polygeneration systems and the combination of CO2 sources and storage sites. The new Energy Network has realized the proper combination of energy utilization and CO2 capture and storage according to the unique state of China. It is suitable for China and may play an important role in CCS in the future. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Energy network; Oil dependency; Polygeneration system","Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Low power electronics; Energy networks; Life cycle analysis; Low energy penalties; National level; Oil dependency; Poly-generation; Polygeneration system; Supercritical power plant; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955406328

In this paper, the alternative transportation options for CO2 from a Finnish capture plant case are assessed. The assessment includes selection of the most favourable storage areas, route planning for both ship and pipeline transportation, and cost estimates for both alternatives. An actual CCS demonstration is planned by the proprietor power companies of the chosen case plant, a coal condensing power plant on the coast of Western Finland, giving an interesting opportunity to discuss the results in the light of the current development of the demonstration plant. Transportation costs are presented for a ship transportation chain from the case plant to the North Sea and for a pipeline running towards the coast of the Barents Sea. The storage areas were chosen because of the potential storage capacity and currently operational injection activities in both regions. Pipeline transportation is found considerably more expensive than ship transportation as an option for CO 2 transportation from the case demonstration plant to the different storage sites. The levelized costs of shipping the captured CO2 to the geological formations under the North Sea are estimated to amount to 11,8 €/tCO2, excluding the costs for liquefaction. Matching a CO 2 source within EU to a sink outside EU depends on a consistent regulatory framework.

However, this process generates additional costs, mostly from the regeneration energy required to release the carbon dioxide from the solvent. Therefore, an intensive work is demanded to screen solvents based on thermodynamic properties and hence regeneration energy. In this work, we present thermodynamic results of CO 2 solubility in aqueous amine solutions from a 6-reactors High Throughput Screening (HTS) experimental device. Solubility measurements are performed on a set of 30 mono-amines with variable molecular structures. Thermodynamic properties are extracted using a comprehensive thermodynamic model and process simulations are performed to asses the energetic potential of these molecules for CO2 capture. A simple correlation is then build to connect lab-scale properties to the regeneration energy required in the process.

One of the essential concerns in geologic storage is the risk of CO2 leakage from the storage formations. CO2 may leak through various pathways in the cap-rock overlying the storage aquifer. Characterization of the CO2 leakage pathways from the storage formations into overlying formations is required. We present a flow and pressure test to locate and characterize the leaks. The flow test is based on the injection (or production) of water into (or from) a storage aquifer at a constant rate. The pressure is measured at one or several monitoring wells in an aquifer overlying the storage aquifer, which is separated by an aquitard. The objective of the test is to locate and characterize any leakage through the separating aquitard. We present an inverse procedure to obtain the leakage pathway transmissibility and location, based on the pressure measurements in the presence of noise. A single monitoring well allows good determination of the leak magnitude but provides limited constraints on location. Adding a second monitoring well provides two-dimensional location of the leak location in the presence of noise/uncertainty in pressure measurements. It seems plausible that the use of multiple monitoring wells could enable cost-effective and sensitive detection of leakage over a large area. Unlike seismic imaging which only detects leakage when CO2 penetrates the leak, these methods are able to test for leaks before CO2 injection, or during injection but before the CO2 plume reaches the leak. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Inverse problem; Leakage characterization; Pressure monitoring","Aquifers; Characterization; Cost effectiveness; Greenhouse gases; Inverse problems; Location; Monitoring; Pressure measurement; Water injection; Wells; Geologic storage; Geological storage; Leakage characterization; Leakage detection; Monitoring wells; Pressure monitoring; Reducing emissions; Sensitive detection; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955401695

However, if a natural gas plant is provided with a CCS system, additional energy is required to compress the captured CO2. Therefore, JGC Corporation and BASF SE have started joint development of a new solvent-based CO2 capture technology, called HiPACT (High Pressure Acid gas Capture Technology), which improves the energy efficiency of the CO2 capture and compression units in a natural gas plant. HiPACT solvent is robust against the high temperatures associated with solvent regeneration at high pressures. Therefore, the regeneration process used in HiPACT can be operated well above atmospheric pressure, which significantly reduces the energy consumption of the CO 2 compression unit. Further, HiPACT solvent absorbs a larger amount of CO2 per volume unit than other solvents, thus resulting in lower energy consumption for pumping and regeneration of the solvent. When compared to conventional technology, it is estimated that HiPACT can yield cost reductions of more than 25 percent. A recent pilot test has validated the key features of the HiPACT solvent, its thermal stability and CO2 absorption performance, and it has been decided to carry out a large-scale demonstration test. This paper presents the results of a batch test and a pilot test, both of which validated the key features of HiPACT, and presents the results of a case study which shows HiPACT's advantages over state-of-the-art technology currently used worldwide. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capture; High pressure; High temparature; HiPACT; Natural gas","Atmospheric pressure; Carbon capture; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Solvents; Capture; High pressure; High temparature; HiPACT; Large scale demonstration tests; Natural gas exploration; Solvent-based technology; State-of-the-art technology; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955401303

The correct choice of materials for piping, vessels and all types of equipment will be vital in ensuring the long-term performance, safety and high operational availability of the capture plants through their lifetime. Controlling capital and operating costs related to materials will help enable a wider and faster roll-out of carbon capture systems. It is apparent that there is a need to investigate the potential materials degradation and corrosion risks in the carbon capture processes and the related material selection issues. The International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas (IEA GHG) Research and Development Programme has sponsored a study of corrosion issues and materials selection in carbon capture, transport and storage. This paper summarises some of the outcomes of that study relating to the carbon capture systems. The focus is on materials degradation risks from the process streams and materials issues specific to the carbon capture processes. An overview is provided of corrosion and materials issues related to the three main carbon capture processes (Post-combustion, Pre-combustion (IGCC) and Oxy-fuel).

The same holds for the EU and some of its Member States like the United Kingdom. This paper discusses several scenarios for the Netherlands within the context of a liberalised and a more and more connected energy market in Northwest-Europe. The research reported here shows that CCS on new coal fired power plants does not pose a threat to the increase in the electricity production by large quantities of wind energy in the electricity system, and vice versa. For renewable energy, several additional policies are in place mainly in the form of financial support as long as these renewable options are not yet profitable. For CCS, financial support is only granted now for a selection of the first demonstration projects now planned in the EU. It is not yet clear if large scale CCS and high shares of wind energy can be incorporated in a balanced way in the electricity system. This paper shows that from a technical and economic point of view, there is room for both, and under which conditions such a two fold growth will be feasible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Wind power; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Coal-fired power plant; Demonstration project; Electricity production; Electricity system; Financial support; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955401096

In the present document their geographic distribution is associated with localization of the sedimentary basins as well as the potential geologic reservoirs for CCS is presented, thus providing concrete basis to define and optimize longer term goals, consistent with Brazil's volunteer commitment to help mitigate the effects of global climate change. It was found that USA, England, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Netherlands and Japan not only are quite active in the research and technologic development, but also have strong relationships between them, owning several joint products. Historic data point out an increase in ethanol annual production in the last years, being produced mainly by Sao Paulo (61% of the domestic production). The CO2 emissions were estimated for each Brazilian state based on the ethanol production and the CO2 emissions due to the fermentation process. There were 26,959,209 m3 of total ethanol produced, corresponding to about 11.2 billion m3 of CO 2 emissions at 20°C and 1 atm, and to about 29 million m 3 of CO2 in reservoir conditions. The CCS scenarios were built considering porosity in the range from 18% to 24%, using the average of the Brazilian basins for oil production. The Paraná Basin should receive over twenty million m3 of CO2, encompassing eight Brazilian states, which requires from 110 to 147 million m3 of rock. Other Basins, such as Ceará, Marajó or Maranhão, Pelotas, Potiguar, Recôncavo or SEAL, and Tacutu require from 12 to 10,861 thousand m3 of rock, having each one a specific requirement. In all scenarios, the rock volumes are smaller than the real Basins volume, thus a very favorable negative balance can be achieved for bioethanol. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bioethanol; CCS; Geologic sotorage","Bioethanol; Carbon; Carbon capture; Climate change; Digital storage; Ethanol; Geographical distribution; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoirs; Bio-ethanol production; Domestic production; Ethanol production; Fermentation process; Geologic reservoirs; Geologic sotorage; Global climate changes; Reservoir conditions; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955399524

The storage of CO2 could affect the composition of inorganic and organic components in the reservoir, consequently influencing microbial activities. To study the microbial induced processes together with geochemical, petrophysical and mineralogical changes, occurring during CO2 storage, long-term laboratory experiments under simulated reservoir P-T conditions were carried out. Clean inner core sections, obtained from the reservoir region at the CO2 storage site in Ketzin (Germany) from a depth of about 650 m, were incubated in high pressure vessels together with sterile synthetic formation brine under in situ P-T conditions of 5.5 MPa and 40 °C. A 16S rDNA based fingerprinting method was used to identify the dominant species in DNA extracts of pristine sandstone samples. Members of the α- and β-subdivisions of Proteobacteria and the Actinobacteria were identified. So far sequences belonging to facultative anaerobic, chemoheterotrophic bacteria (Burkholderia fungorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens) gaining their energy from the oxidation of organic molecules and a genus also capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth (Hydrogenophaga) was identified. During CO2 incubation minor changes in the microbial community composition were observed. The majority of microbes were able to adapt to the changed conditions. During CO2 exposure increased concentrations of Ca 2+, K+, Mg2+ and SO42- were observed. Partially, concentration rises are (i) due to equilibration between rock pore water and synthetic brine, and (ii) between rock and brine, and are thus independent on CO2 exposure. However, observed concentrations of Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ are even higher than in the original reservoir fluid and therefore indicate mineral dissolution due to CO2 exposure. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","In situ P-T conditions, microbial and geochemical analysis; Ketzin","Analytical geochemistry; Bacteria; Calcium; Geochemistry; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Pressure vessels; Storage (materials); Structural geology; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Fingerprinting methods; Geochemical analysis; Ketzin; Laboratory experiments; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Mineralogical changes; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955398983

To gain more knowledge, we soft-linked WorldScan, an applied general equilibrium model for global policy analysis, with MARKAL-NL-UU, a techno-economic energy bottom-up model of the Dutch power generation sector and CO2 intensive industry. Results from WorldScan show that CO 2 prices in 2020 could vary between 20 €/tCO2 in a GRAND COALITION scenario, in which all countries accept greenhouse gas targets from 2020, to 47 €/tCO2 in an IMPASSE scenario, in which EU-27 continues its one-sided emission trading system without the possibility to use the Clean Development Mechanism. Results from MARKAL-NL-UU show that an emission trading system in combination with uncertainty does not advance the application of CCS in an early stage, the rates at which different CO2 abatement technologies (including CCS) develop are less crucial for introduction of CCS than the CO2 price development, and the combination of biomass (co-)firing and CCS seems an important option to realise deep CO2 emission reductions. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Applied general equilibrium model; Climate mitigation policy; Linear optimisation model","Carbon capture; Climate models; Commerce; Costs; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Linear programming; Optimization; Abatement technologies; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate mitigations; Emission reduction; Emission trading systems; General equilibrium models; Optimisation models; Stable investments; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955398549

After 5 years of operation, the project has developed a substantial storage-unit characterisation and monitoring dataset. The question we address in this paper is: which reservoir features have proven most critical in controlling the injection performance so far? This is also an important question for future CO2storage sites, as part of the planned global ramp-up in CCS as a greenhouse gas mitigation option. Our main findings are that structural geological and rock mechanical aspects are most critical in the early injection phase, while characterisation of the pore space, combined with the dynamically created fracture permeability, becomes more important when considering the medium to long-term effects (10-1000 years) including geochemical, fluid dynamical and geomechanical aspects. When considering the quantity and type of data that are needed to sufficiently characterise this CO2storage site, high quality 3D seismic proves to be highly valuable (despite its relatively high cost). For the pore space characterisation, core samples from both the reservoir and the caprock are vital in order to calibrate and properly interpret static and dynamic well data. Finally, monitoring datasets, including well-head gas and tracer data, time-lapse seismic data, and satellite (InSAR) monitoring data need to be interpreted and only bring true value when utilised with detailed geological descriptions and models of the subsurface. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Characterisation; Faults; Fractures; Pore space; Storage","Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Energy storage; Faulting; Fracture; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Mechanical permeability; Monitoring; Seismology; Wellheads; Characterisation; Fracture permeability; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Injection performance; Long-term effects; Mechanical aspects; Pore space; Time-lapse seismic data; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955398452

Greece generates almost 92% of its electrical power requirements from fossil fuels, with lignite accounting for about 63% of the total while the share of liquid fuels and natural gas is 14% and 22% respectively (2007). Total CO2 emissions increased from 83.15 Mt in 1990 to 113.56 Mt in 2007. This increase of 36.57% from 1990 to 2007 is mainly attributed to the increased electricity production (average annual rate of 3.6% for the period). Taking into consideration the forecasts for increase in the electricity demand over the coming years and the old and low-efficiency units that should be either renovated or replaced by new units, the capture and geological storage of CO2 is considered as a critical climate change mitigation option at national level. In particular, the cost calculations are focused on CO 2 transport from a new capture-ready 650 MWe coal fired power plant using supercritical steam cycle, to be erected in the Region of Western Macedonia, to potential geological formations via pipeline and the subsequent storage in deep saline aquifers. The cost estimations are based on a pipeline transport infrastructure linking one large CO2 source with individual storage sites. The results from the geological characterisation and the storage capacity of the identified Prinos, West Thessaloniki, and Messohellenic Trough - Pentalophos saline formations in the Tertiary sedimentary rocks of Greece will be presented. To conclude, the geological properties of the sedimentary basins in Greece appear to to have the potential to sequester billions of tons of CO2 for CCS implementation. The identified geological reservoirs occur within approximately 100-200 km of the majority of stationary CO 2 emissions in Greece, which is favourable in terms of infrastructure costs for the development of a CO2 pipeline transport network. However a range of R&amp;D activities is required in order to assess the effective CO2 storage potential of saline aquifers in Greece like a more detailed site -specific geological analysis, stratigraphic mapping and correlation, petrophysical property characterization, generation of quantitative and dynamic 3-D geological models, geochemical simulations etc. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Coal-fired power plant; Greece; Mesohellenic trough; Prinos saline aquifer; Western macedonia","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Climate change; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Cost estimating; Costs; Electric power generation; Exploratory geochemistry; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Pipelines; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Stratigraphy; Thermoelectric power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Greece; Macedonia; Mesohellenic trough; Saline aquifers; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955398080

However, low thickness and structural complexity may constrain the economic exploitation of many coal deposits. Taking into account these circumstances, underground coal gasification (UCG) can offer an economical and sustainable approach for coal exploitation and subsequent feedstock generation from the syngas. The UCG process produces a high-calorific synthesis gas mainly consisting of methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which can be used for electricity generation or feedstock production at the surface. Considering the latter, the Urea process can be applied to establish the nitrogen based fertilizer carbamide (CH4N2O). The required feedstock for carbamide production in the Urea process can be supplied by UCG syngas. The aim of the present study was the development of an integrated carbon utilisation concept based on the coupled UCG-Urea process. A significant amount of carbon dioxide from the UCG synthesis gas is required for carbamide production in the Urea process, while the excessive carbon dioxide can be re-injected into the cavities resulting in the coal seams and surrounding strata after the gasification process. Thus, a new approach for utilisation of carbon dioxide resulting from coal combustion was developed to provide a coupled technology also comprising geological storage of excessive carbon dioxide. A theoretical feasibility study considering UCG-Urea process economics and potentials of UCG and carbon dioxide storage in the gasified strata was conducted for a selected study area in northern Bangladesh revealing the high competitiveness of the combined technology on the international feedstock markets. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbamide; Carbon dioxide utilisation; Underground coal gasification; Urea","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbonization; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal gasification; Coal storage; Economics; Feedstocks; Gas generators; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Nitrogen fertilizers; Proven reserves; Synthesis gas; Urea; Carbon dioxide storage; Combined technology; Electricity generation; Feedstock production; Gasification process; Nitrogen-based fertilizers; Structural complexity; Underground coal gasification; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955396053

Beside the use of carbon dioxide as a solvent for supercritical fluid extraction, increasing interest in physical chemical properties of CO2 exists as Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) starts to play an important role to limit anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Therefore CO2 processing and pipeline technologies became of considerable commercial importance, especially in the context of future underground storage of CO2. As example the CO2 compression process with gas separation membrane in post-combustion capture was simulated with PRO/II® software. Through adopting several different equations of states, phase diagrams of different CO2 - N2 gas mixtures were calculated and compared with the aforementioned accurate thermodynamic and transport properties calculation results. This type of validation is very useful for process engineering analysis. Further investigations related to the compression process were carried out for the different CO2 gas mixtures, which are generated from the gas separation membrane capture process. Specific energy of the compression process was analysed for each gas mixture. The energy consumption and the state of the compressed compounds are strongly influenced by the N2 composition in the mixture. The impurities in multi-component CO2 mixtures vary strongly depending on the different capture technologies. The calculation of reliable phase diagrams of CO2 mixtures provides guidelines for optimization of compression, pipeline transport, and storage processes. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Thermodynamic properties; Thermophysics","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide process; Effluent treatment; Energy utilization; Equations of state; Gas mixtures; Gas permeable membranes; Gases; Graphic methods; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Phase diagrams; Pipelines; Supercritical fluid extraction; Supercritical fluids; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Transport properties; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Engineering analysis; Gas separation membrane; Physical chemical property; Post-combustion captures; Thermodynamic and transport properties; Thermophysics; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955395488

The following advantages must be emphasized: leakage-free CO2 fixation that does not require post-storage monitoring; the overwhelmingly large capacity offered by mineral resources available worldwide; and as recognized more recently, the possibility to operate with the CO2 containing gas directly, removing the very expensive CO2 separation step from the CCS process chain. Also, the solid products can be used in applications ranging from land reclamation to iron- and steelmaking. Here, a staged process for mineral sequestration that resulted from a decade of R&amp;D work in Finland is applied to two serpentinite rocks from Lithuania and Finland, respectively. The process involves production of magnesium hydroxide from the mineral, with ammonium sulphate as the extractant (which is recovered downstream), followed by carbonation in a pressurized fluidized bed at 20-40 bar, 450-550°C. Benefits of this route are that 1) the carbonation reaction heat is taken benefit of, 2) only magnesium hydroxide is carbonated, 3) solid residue, magnesium carbonate and iron oxides are obtained as separate streams, 4) no expensive or non-recoverable chemical additives are used and 5) the pressure in the carbonation process is relatively low. The results show that magnesium hydroxide can be effectively extracted from the two serpentinites at somewhat different extraction process conditions, while the magnesium hydroxide particles produced (∼170μm, ∼340 μm) can be carbonated for 45-50 % within 10 minutes at 20 bar, ∼500°C.

Traditionally, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is an essential tool for process optimization through the application of exergy and exergy destruction (irreversibility) concepts. An exergy analysis provides a guide for identifying those systems and equipments with larger irreversibility. Modifications in the design of these systems may lead to reduction of thermodynamic inefficiencies in CO2 capture facilities, improving their performance and reducing costs.

The holistic perspective offered by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can help decision makers to compare alternative CO2 capture and storage technologies in a life cycle perspective. This paper, at first, introduces the principles of the dynamic LCA model developed for oxy-fuel combustion and post-combustion power generation with CO2 capture, transport and injection processes. Next, a comparative life cycle assessment of alternative CO2 capture technologies is presented. Results show that, at life-cycle level, the post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion CCS cases can reduce the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) by 78.8% and 80.0% respectively compared to conventional power plant without CCS. Other environmental impacts, such as Ecotoxicity, Human toxicity and Acidification, vary significantly with the different CO2 capture routes employed. Finally, by comparing the results obtained with the most recent LCA studies of post-combustion power generation with CO2 capture and storage, it is shown that the plant level, gate-to-gate studies provide significantly variable results and generally overestimate life cycle environmental impacts. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Life cycle assessment; Oxy-fuel combustion; Post-combustion","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Toxicity; Capture and storage technologies; Comparative life cycle assessment; Conventional power plants; Energy consumption rates; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Oxyfuel combustion; Post-combustion; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955392390

CST uses reflecting surfaces to focus solar energy onto collectors, generating extreme heat than can be used for a variety of purposes. The current focus of CST is large-scale electrical power generation. However, new applications, such as solar fuels, are quickly gaining momentum. One key shortcoming of CST technology is its sensitivity to disruptions in sunlight availability over time. CST systems require either thermal energy storage or backup systems to operate during heavy cloud periods or at night. On the other hand, fossil-based energy systems have high availability and reliability, but they generate substantial CO2 emissions compared to equivalent CST processes. A novel solution would combine the benefits of CST technology and of fossil-fueled energy systems. Such a solar-fossil hybrid system would guarantee energy availability in the absence of sunlight or stored solar energy. The addition of carbon capture to these systems could reduce their carbon intensity to almost zero. This paper introduces three important solar-fossil hybrid energy systems: (1) Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC), (2) Solar-assisted post-combustion capture (SAPCAP), and (3) Solar gasification with CO2 capture. These novel concepts have great potential to overcome the inherent limitations of their component technologies and to achieve superior greenhouse gas mitigation techno-economic performance in large-scale applications. The paper describes the features of the three solar-fossil hybrid systems described earlier, discusses its advantages and disadvantages, and provides examples of applications. The goal of this manuscript is to introduce experts in the CCS and CST fields to the opportunities of integration between these technologies and their potential benefits. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating solar thermal; Gasification; Hybrid; Hydrogen; Integrated solar combined cycle; Post-combustion capture; Syngas","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fossil fuel power plants; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Solar energy; Solar heating; Concentrating solar; Hybrid; Integrated solar combined cycles; Post-combustion captures; Syn-gas; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955390955

The remainder is used at power plants within Wyoming to generate approximately 7% of U.S. electricity. Carbon capture and storage from these power stations could significantly reduce U.S. carbon emissions. Wyoming statutes and rules proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality regarding subsurface carbon storage require that CO 2 injection must not affect established or potential drinking water aquifers, oil and gas fields, or other mineral estates. Wyoming has several potential large-scale geologic carbon storage reservoirs that meet these criteria, in the form of saline aquifers in regional basins and uplifts. The Wyoming Carbon Underground Storage Project has recently been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the state of Wyoming to 1) assess the CO2 storage potential of two possible locations in southwestern Wyoming: the Moxa Arch and the Rock Springs Uplift, 2) develop a system for displaced fluid management, 3) plan monitoring and verification activities, and 4) design infrastructure in preparation for geologic carbon sequestration. The Wyoming Carbon Underground Storage Project represents collaboration between the University of Wyoming, the Wyoming State Geologic Survey, ExxonMobil Corporation, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Baker Hughes Incorporated. The authors are involved primarily in the geologic stratigraphic and structural characterization of the Moxa Arch and Rock Springs Uplift. The Moxa Arch is an anticline that trends from the Uinta Mountains, 200 km north-northwest to the eastern front of the Wyoming fold-and-thrust belt. Potential storage reservoirs on this large geologic structure include the Jurassic Nugget Sandstone, the Mississippian Madison Limestone, and the Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite. The Nugget Sandstone is a heterogeneous and anisotropic eolian deposit that has been extensively exploited for oil and gas at certain locations on the Moxa Arch, which complicates its usage as a repository for carbon dioxide. The Madison Limestone is a proven storage reservoir; ExxonMobil has been injecting CO 2 (up to 25 MMCFD) and H2S (up to 65 MMCFD) into the Madison Limestone on the Moxa Arch for seven years at the Shute Creek Gas Plant. The Bighorn Dolomite is stratigraphically complex with large variations in porosity and permeability due to primary burrowing and repeated dolomitization and dedolomitization. Depending on location on the anticline, the Nugget Sandstone lies 3 to 6.5 km below the surface (-1 to -4.5 km subsea), and the Bighorn Dolomite and Madison Limestone range from 4.5 to 8 km below the surface (-2.5 to -6 km subsea). The Moxa Arch is structurally uncomplicated; it is a basement-involved anticline formed by a west-vergent Late Cretaceous-age thrust fault, with gently-dipping limbs (0 to 5 degrees). Leakage risk is extremely low because impermeable evaporite (anhydrite) intervals overly the potential reservoirs, and preliminary interpretation of seismic data reveal that few faults exist other than the main thrust. The Naughton Power Plant, a 707 MW coal-fired power station emitting up to 6 Mt of CO2 per year, lies 30 km west of the crest of the anticline. The Rock Springs Uplift, 100 km east of the Moxa Arch, extends 80 km north from the Wyoming-Utah border. The target storage reservoirs are the Pennsylvanian Weber Sandstone (correlative to the Tensleep Sandstone) and the Mississippian Madison Limestone. The Weber Sandstone exhibits wide variations in reservoir properties (porosity and permeability) due to dune/interdune/intradune facies changes, and appears to have experienced local secondary diagenesis that further reduced porosity. The Madison Limestone is expected to have similar reservoir properties to its lithologic correlative on the Moxa Arch. The Weber Sandstone and Madison Limestone range in depth from 2 to 6 km below the surface (0.3 to -4.5 km subsea), depending on location on the anticline. The Rock Springs Uplift offers challenges for structural analysis. Like the Moxa Arch, the Uplift was formed by a Late Cretaceous-age west-vergent basement-involved reverse fault, but the limbs of the fold are at steeper dips (approximately 15 degrees on the west limb, shallower on the east limb), and these limbs are cut at depth by additional reverse faults. In a hydrocarbon field on the southeastern flank of the uplift there is a possibility that condensate is migrating from the Weber Sandstone along one of these reverse faults, suggesting that the trap is breached. In addition, a series of east-west trending normal faults cut Cretaceous shales at the surface, possibly with throws that exceed the thickness of the uppermost regional seal. It is necessary to determine if these eastwest faults also compromise the Triassic units that could provide a seal above the Weber Sandstone. The Jim Bridger Power Plant (coal-fired) is located on the east flank of the Rock Springs Uplift; it has 2200 MW capacity and emits up to 18 Mt of CO2 per year. Future U.S. energy demands will draw heavily on Wyoming's coal-fired power plants, and the state is taking steps to sequester the produced carbon. Wyoming hosts several large geologic traps that if properly risked and evaluated have promise as long-term, stable repositories for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Based upon our preliminary assessment of the multiple clastic and carbonate receiving formations in the Moxa Arch and Rock Springs Uplift, and the experience of successful injection at ExxonMobil's Shute Creek Gas Plant, these geologic structures in southwestern Wyoming are among the most promising large CO 2 geologic storage sites in the United States. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Geologic carbon sequestration; Moxa arch; Rock springs uplift; Wyoming","Aquifers; Arch bridges; Arches; Buildings; Carbon capture; Coal; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Fault slips; Faulting; Forestry; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Limestone; Location; Natural gas fields; Offshore gas fields; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Porosity; Potable water; Rocks; Sandstone; Seismology; Stratigraphy; Structural geology; Tectonics; Water injection; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Department of environmental qualities; Geologic carbon sequestrations; Los Alamos National Laboratory; Northwestern United States; Structural characterization; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Wyoming; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955390305

A number of publications have investigated the definition, engineering requirements, economic and finance of CCR for China. However there remain a number of questions regarding the extent to which a plant's physical location might constrain the feasibility of CCS retrofit. To address this issue, a Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used as a tool for mapping current and planned large carbon dioxide sources in Guangdong, also illustrating potential storage sites and calculating possible carbon dioxide transportation route. This paper investigates the location factors that should be considered when locating new build CCR power plants and demonstrates the methodology of using GIS software with spatial analysis in planning new build power plant in Guangdong. A preliminary study has identified over 30 large power plants within the region, with plant locations and historical emission data collected and presented in ArcGIS. Factors such as distance to potential storage site, route of CO2 pipeline, extra space on site and potential development plan etc. were investigated in the modelling and calculated the potential source and sink solution. The study then moves on to suggest possible new build plant locations which can be easily fitted in to the current network, based on economic optimisation. The scope for future coal plant development combined with a possible nuclear plant siting plan is discussed towards the end of the paper. Guangdong province, which owns the third largest coal-fired power installed capacity out of 31 provinces, generated over 8% of China's total electricity every year for the past 15 years. CO2 storage opportunities could be found in the surrounding South China Sea, where Guangdong has a total of 4,300 km of coastline and some small scale oil fields on shore within the region. It is also among the first places to start the national open and reform policy in China. The province is one of the richest in China, with the highest GDP among all other provinces since 1989, and the foreign trade accounts for more than a quarter of China's total amount. It also contributes around 12% of the total national economic output. Currently, the provincial government is proposing a low carbon roadmap, which is the first of its kind in China. The work has created a totally new thinking on capture ready power plant planning. This differs from existing studies (e.g. [2], [3], [4]), which aim to investigate the existing carbon dioxide emission sources at specified location and provide source and sink matching analysis. Instead the study focuses on policy implementation for new build capture ready power plants. Three clusters within Guangdong province are identified as potential temporary CO2 storage hubs before transporting the gas to a long term storage site. When officials are planning new power plant locations from a capture ready perspective, the plants should not necessarily be close to storage sites in straight line, but rather should be within a reasonable distance of a cluster. Transport of the captured CO2 will not be limited to pipelines, but could be extended to road and rail tankers. Power plant parameters and storage site data were collected for this research. Public transportation, utilities, landscapes, river, land used and population data were referenced from various sources; therefore, some of the data could be out of date. Nevertheless, it should still provide enough information when deciding the location of the transport cluster. Any future work could build on the existing model with updated data. Moreover, it could fit in with the national natural gas transportation network and utility planning network to provide long term integrated energy system analysis. The paper could provide policy makers, investors and urban planning officials with a view on how conventional thermal power plant investment and planning could be optimised, using Carbon Capture Ready designs, to keep the CCS retrofitting option open. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capture ready; CCS ready; GIS analysis","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Investments; Land use; Location; Natural gas transportation; Oil fields; Pipelines; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Retrofitting; Roadbuilding materials; Thermoelectric power plants; Transportation; Transportation routes; Capture ready; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide sources; CCS ready; GIS analysis; Integrated energy systems; Potential storage sites; Power plant parameters; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955389346

In the scenario it is based on, CCS will provide approximately 20% of the total CO2 emissions reductions out to 2050. Achieving this contribution of emissions reductions will require an ambitious CCS growth-path, with 100 projects needed globally by 2020 and over 3000 by 2050. In both 2020 and 2050 the major developing countries, including South Africa will need to contribute to CCS deployment. South Africa has a heavily coal-dependent economy with 94 % of electricity production coming from coal. In addition to this, South Africa also meets approximately 30% of its domestic fuel -oil demand through the conversion of coal and gas to transportation fuels. The combination of these two factors means that South Africa is as dependant on coal as any country in the world, placing the country as the 13th largest CO2 emitter in the world. Currently South Africa is experiencing electricity shortages where the reserve margin is below desired levels on a daily basis. Consequently, deployment of electricity generation capacity is seen as a priority. With the slow development of renewable energy and the deployment of nuclear energy currently under review, the required short term increase in electricity production is likely to come from new, coal plant that will be expected to be in operation for 50-60 years, thus continuing the country's dependence on coal for some time to come. At the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen, South Africa announced that it would take nationally appropriate mitigation actions to enable a reduction in national GHG emissions equating to a deviation of 34% below the ""Business as Usual"" emissions growth trajectory by 2020 and a 42% deviation below the below ""Business as Usual"" emissions growth trajectory by 2025, pended upon the provision of sufficient funding and technology support. Given all these factors, CCS could be a crucial technology for South Africa in the near future. This paper looks to discuss the current status of CCS in South Africa. This includes looking at the key outcomes o f the recently released South African CCS Research and Development Roadmap and the milestones it outlines, such as the development of a geological storage atlas by 2010, a CO2 test injection by 2016, and a demonstration project operating by 2020. It also looks at how the South African government is positioned toward CCS, including how CCS fits with the countries priorities of poverty alleviation, economic growth, sustainable development, job creation and ensuring the most efficient use of domestic resources. In addition the paper looks at the manner in which the South African government could go about regulating the operation of CCS projects. The paper will discuss the options available to South Africa to fund CCS demonstration and deployment domestically including via the clean development mechanism (in the event that the question of using this mechanism in the CCS context is dealt with at the international level), development banks and other, appropriate, development finance institutions. Public awareness and engagement on CCS will also be covered, given the crucial role the public play in the smooth progress of projects. Finally the paper will look at international collaboration on CCS including the role South Africa can play internationally and what more the international CCS community can offer. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS; Developing country; South africa","Briquetting; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Coal transportation; Developing countries; Economics; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy policy; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Petroleum transportation; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Clean Development Mechanism; Electricity generation capacity; Electricity production; International collaborations; Research and development; South Africa; South African government; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955388729

Despite significant investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, that Canada and others are making, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast that as the global economy continues to grow, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world's energy supply for decades. Reconciling the world's ongoing reliance on fossil fuels with the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is then one of our greatest challenges. Canada is taking this challenge seriously with climate change policies that include enhancing our global leadership in advancing one of the most promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuel use: carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS is only one of several technologies that must be deployed and is not a 'silver-bullet' for meeting Canada's target of reducing its GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. Yet, CCS is one of the only technologies currently available for making emissions reductions from large-scale fossil fuel usage - and, thus, will be a critical component of the technology puzzle for Canada to meet its emissions reduction objectives. Canada has a number of key sectors where the deployment of CCS is needed and there are opportunities to advance the technology. These include coal-fired electricity plants, the oil sands, and natural gas processing (e.g. from the new development of shale gas) - though the opportunity and demand for advancing CCS technology also exists in other sectors such as chemicals, fertilizer, steel making, and cement. Federal and provincial governments in Canada are making substantial investments in CCS, committing upwards of $3 billion in public funding towards seven large-scale fully-integrated CCS demonstration projects. The federal ecoENERGY Technology Initiative announced $151 million for the initial engineering and/or pilot stages of seven potential demonstration projects in 2008. The 2009 federal budget created Clean Energy Fund, which included $610 million for CCS demonstrations. The Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have also committed funding for demonstrations, in particular $2 billion by Alberta. This public funding will leverage additional investment from industry, for projects that will each capture and store on the order of 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year, coming on-line starting in 2015 or sooner. This paper will provide an overview of Canada's actions on advancing CCS deployment, with a focus on the CCS demonstration program and current R&amp;D activities in Canada. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Demonstrations; Economic geology; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Finance; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural gas; Oil sands; Oil shale processing; Shale; Shale oil; Steelmaking; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change policies; Coal-fired electricity; Demonstration programs; International energy agency; Natural gas processing; Primary energy consumption; Substantial investments; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955387715

A novel technique, currently under development, shows potential to add value to sequestered CO2, promote its utilization, and bridge the gap between its supply and demand, thus allowing the development of fully-integrated and reliable CO2market. This technique is referred to as ""CO2Interim Storage"", or briefly, CIS. CIS involves storing CO2for a finite period of time to be subsequently utilized in CO2Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and potentially other industrial processes. The feasibility of CO2storage is assessed based on three major variables: the distance between CO2source and storage medium, the general trend of CO2storage in and delivery from the storage medium (primarily governed by the market dynamics of supply and demand), as well as the frequency of CO2injection into and extraction from the storage medium. The importance of CIS as a major tool for CO2market and infrastructure development becomes clear upon comparing this new technology to the widely implemented underground natural gas (NG) storage and assessing its role in energy hybridization and in meeting variable and localized CO2demand. In this study, the flow of CO2in underground storage reservoirs is numerically simulated to provide general analysis of the technical aspects associated with varying CO2injection rates. The simulations show that the CO2plume and pressure buildup profiles are comparable for constant and variable injection rates. Also, in the cases of variable injection, the pressure variation dampens as injection proceeds with time. In addition, a case-study is conducted in which CIS is implemented to meet the CO2demand for EOR operations in the state of Wyoming from CO2emissions of in-state coal power plants. This is achieved via modeling an integrated source-sink CO2network. The results show that the economic attractiveness of the project is dependent on the availability of CO2, the distance between CO2sources, interim storage sites, and sinks, as well as the price and demand of CO2for EOR. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Enhanced oil recovey; Flow modeling","Commerce; Economics; Enhanced recovery; Greenhouse gases; Oil well flooding; Underground gas storage; Commercial applications; Enhanced oil recovery; Enhanced oil recovey; Flow model; Industrial processs; Infrastructure development; Pressure variations; Underground storage; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955386665

The influence of discourse is particularly important in the innovation phases prior to commercialization when innovation activities are focused on research, development and demonstration, and when feasibility and costs of alternatives systems cannot yet be tested by market dynamics. This paper provides a state-level comparative analysis of CCS discourse in the U.S. to provide insights about the socio-political context in which CCS technology is advancing and being considered in four different states: Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, and Texas. This research combines analysis of interviews of state-level energy stakeholders and media analysis of state-level newspapers. In semi-structured interviews, state-level energy policy stakeholders were asked to explain their perceptions of the potential opportunities and risks of CCS technology within their unique state context. Interview texts were coded to assess the frequency and extent of various different frames of CCS opportunities and risks including technical, political, economic, environmental, aesthetic, and health/safety. A similar coding scheme was applied to analysis of state-level newspaper coverage of CCS technology. Here, the frequency of these different framings of CCS opportunities and risks in state-level print media was assessed. This analysis demonstrates wide variation in state-level CCS discourse and perceptions of the potential opportunities and risks associated with CCS technology. This mixed-methods approach to characterizing the socio-political context for CCS advancement in these four states contributes to improved understanding of state-level variation in energy technology innovation, provides valuable information about energy technology development in these specific states, and also offers insight into the very different sub-national discourses associated with emerging low-carbon energy technologies in the U.S. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Discourse; Media; Policy","Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Innovation; Newsprint; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Comparative analysis; Competing technologies; Discourse; Emerging technologies; Low-carbon energy technology; Media; Semi structured interviews; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955384667

The aquifer pressure resulting from the injection of carbon dioxide can provide all or part of the inlet pressure for the desalination system. Residual brine from such a process could be reinjected into the formation at net volume reduction, such that the volume of fresh water extracted is comparable to the volume of CO2 injected into the formation. Such a process could provide additional CO2 storage capacity in the aquifer, reduce operational risks (e.g., fracturing, seismicity, leaking) by relieving overpressure in the formation, and provide a source of low-cost fresh water to offset costs or operational water needs equal to about half the water usage of a typical coal ICGG power plant. We call the combined processes of brine removal, treatment, and pressure management active reservoir management. We have examined a range of saline formation water compositions propose a general categorization for the feasibility of the process based total dissolved solids (TDS): • 10,000-40,000 mg/L TDS: Standard RO with ≥ 50% recovery • 40,000-85,000 mg/L TDS: Standard RO with ≥ 10% recovery; higher recovery possible using 1500 psi RO membranes and/or multi-stage incremental desalination likely including NF (nanofiltration) • 85,000-300,000 mg/L TDS: Multi-stage process using process design that may differ significantly from seawater systems • &gt; 300,000 mg/L TDS brines: Not likely to be treatable Brines in the 10,000-85,000 mg/L TDS range appear to be abundant (geographically and with depth) and could be targeted in planning CCS operations. Costs for desalination of fluids from saline aquifers are in the range of $400-1000/ acre foot of permeate when storage aquifer pressures exceed 1200 psi. This is about half of conventional seawater desalination costs of $1000-1400/acre foot. Costs increase by 30 to 50% when pressure must be added at the surface. The primary reason for the cost reduction in pressurized aquifers relative to seawater is the lack of need for energy to drive the high-pressure pumps. An additional cost savings has to do with less pre-treatment than is customary for ocean waters full of biological activity and their degradation products. An innovative parallel low-recovery approach is proposed that would be particularly effective for saline formation waters in the 40,000-85,000 mg/L TDS range. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Reverse osmosis; Water","Aquifers; Bioactivity; Brines; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Cost reduction; Costs; Degradation; Desalination; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Recovery; Reservoir management; Reverse osmosis; Saline water; Seawater; Water; Water filtration; Water treatment; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon sequestration; Degradation products; Desalination systems; High pressure pumps; Seawater desalination; Total dissolved solids; Water treatment technologies; Produced Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955384663

Estonia produces the largest amounts of CO2 emissions in the region, due to the combustion of Estonian oil shale for energy production. Owing to the shallow sedimentary basin containing mainly potable groundwater, the geological conditions are unfavourable for CO2 storage in Estonia. Therefore the main Estonian power company Eesti Energia is searching for CO2 storage options in the neighbouring regions. The most favourable geological conditions for CO2 storage in the Baltic Region are found in Latvia in the Middle Cambrian reservoir, sealed by Ordovician clayey carbonate rocks. The total CO2 storage capacity of 16 largest structural traps exceeds 400 million tonnes (Mt). Two power plants close to the city of Narva, with annual CO2 emissions of 8.0 and 2.7 Mt were chosen for the economic modelling of the capture-transport-sink scenario using the GeoCapacity Decision Support System (DSS) based on the GeoCapacity GIS database. Two anticlinal structures of Latvia, Luku-Duku and South Kandava with the area of 50-70 km 2 were selected for the CO2 storage. The depth of the top of the Cambrian reservoir is 1020-1050 m, the thickness 28-45 m; permeability of sandstone is more than 300 mD, and the trap storage efficiency factor 40%. The conservative storage capacity of these structures 40 and 44 Mt of CO2 respectively will be enough for 8 years. The estimated pipeline length required for CO2 transportation is about 800 km. The oxyfuel capture technology is applied in this scenario. With a conservative storage capacity for 8 years of emissions, avoidance costs are rated at € 37.4 per tonne of CO2. The total cost of the project estimated by the Decision Support System using the GeoCapacity GIS is about € 2.8 billion for 30 years of payment period. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Baltic; Cambrian; Economic modelling; Mineral carbonation","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Electric utilities; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Oil shale; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Shale oil; Anticlinal structure; Baltic; Cambrians; Decision support system (dss); Economic modelling; Geological conditions; Mineral carbonation; Potable groundwater; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955384126

In this context ""risk evaluation"" encompasses multiple scales. Yet a risk management program aims to maximize the chance of project success by assessing, monitoring, minimizing all risks in a consistent framework. The 150,000-km2 Illinois Basin underlies much of the state of Illinois, USA, and parts of adjacent Kentucky and Indiana. Its potential for CO2 storage is first-rate among basins in North America, an impression that has been strengthened by early testing of the injection well of the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium's (MGSC's) Phase III large scale demonstration project, the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP). The IBDP, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), represents a key trial of GS technologies and project-management techniques. Though risks are specific to each site and project, IBDP risk management methodologies provide valuable experience for future GS projects. IBDP views risk as the potential for negative impact to any of these five values: health and safety, environment, financial, advancing the viability and public acceptability of a GS industry, and research. Research goals include monitoring one million metric tonnes of injected CO2 in the subsurface. Risk management responds to the ways in which any values are at risk: for example, monitoring is designed to reduce uncertainties in parameter values that are important for research and system control, and is also designed to provide public assurance. Identified risks are the primary basis for risk-reduction measures: risks linked to uncertainty in geologic parameters guide further characterization work and guide simulations applied to performance evaluation. Formally, industry defines risk (more precisely risk criticality) as the product L*S, the Likelihood multiplied by the Severity of negative impact. L and S are each evaluated on five-point scales, yielding a theoretical spread in risk values of 1 through 25. So defined, these judgment-based values are categorical and ordinal - they do not represent physically measurable quantities, but are nonetheless useful for comparison and therefore decision support. The ""risk entities"" first evaluated are FEPs - conceptual Features, Events, and Processes based on the list published by Quintessa Ltd. After concrete scenarios are generated based on selected FEPs, scenarios become the critical entities whose associated risks are evaluated and tracked. In IBDP workshops, L and S values for 123 FEPs were generated through expert elicitation. About 30 experts in the project or in GS in general were assigned among six facilitated working groups, and each group was charged to envision risks within a sphere of project operations. Working groups covered FEPs with strong spatial characteristics - such as those related to the injection wellbore and simulated plume footprint - and ""nonspatial"" FEPs related to finance, regulations, legal, and stakeholder issues. Within these working groups, experts shared information, examined assumptions, refined and extended the FEP list, calibrated responses, and provided initial L and S values by consensus. Individual rankings were collected in a follow-up process via emailed spreadsheets. For each of L and S, three values were collected: Lower Bound, Best Guess, and Upper Bound. The Lower-Upper Bound ranges and the spreads among experts can be interpreted to yield rough confidence measures. Based on experts' responses, FEPs were ranked in terms of their L*S risk levels. FEP rankings were determined from individual (not consensus or averaged) results, thus no high-risk responses were damped out. The higher-risk FEPs were used to generate one or more concrete, well defined risk-bearing scenarios for each FEP. Any FEP scored by any expert as having associated risk of at least moderate level - roughly the top half of the evaluated list - was used to generate risk scenarios. Textual risk-response information collected during the FEP evaluation process was augmented after scenarios were defined. Risk responses were then disaggregated into approximately 200 risk-response actions, which were regrouped into 30 areas of function or expertise. Each ""risk response action group"" has been assigned to a specific individual to organize and confirm its execution. Responses to the higher identified risks have influenced plans for reservoir characterization, monitoring, communications, and coordination among project member organizations. Uncertainties in geologic parameters are being addressed through sensitivity analysis in reservoir simulations and through further data acquisition. Because the risk-bearing scenarios are linked to formal, assigned risk-response actions, they provide a basis for tracking and managing risk throughout the project. Important benefits of face-to-face, ""live"" expert elicitation include team formation and the subsequent establishment of project understandings, roles, and working relationships. Interchanges that occur during a FEPs-based elicitation process can stimulate conceiving and considering risk-bearing chains of events, and can help avoid blind spots that could occur if all scenarios were pre-defined.

This paper describes the results of the first phase of investigation of the NearCO 2 project, which focuses on lessons learned from consultation related to CCS project implementation and analogous developments in recent years. Eight case studies have been reviewed to help determine the nature of the communications and consultation strategies used by project developers as part of energy project approval processes. The chosen range of case studies represents a number of different regulatory environments throughout the European Union and a number of different technologies. The consideration of a number of different contextual factors as part of a multi-case study approach has helped to identify factors that underpin the relationship between communications and project outcomes, as a means of informing consultation exercises for future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture; Ccs; Energy; Public opinion; Public perceptions; Risk","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; International law; Project management; Public risks; Risk perception; Risks; Social aspects; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Communication strategy; Energy; Energy infrastructures; Project implementation; Public opinions; Public perception; Regulatory environment; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955381570

The CO2 avoidance cost is the CO2 tax at which the product cost is the same for either a fossil fuel plant without CO2 mitigation (but paying the CO2 tax) or the same fossil fuel plant that includes the added capital and efficiency losses of adding CCS (but avoiding most of the CO2 tax). The CO2 tax must be higher than this CO2 avoidance cost to justify the higher risks, capital, and lower efficiency of utilizing CCS. Understanding which issues impact CO2 avoidance costs the most is fundamental to economically encouraging the massive CO2 reductions enabled with CCS. SFA Pacific recently completed two similar economic analyses of coal-based power plant CO2 mitigation costs. Both analyses included the options of converting to lower CO2 emissions with natural gas (with and without CCS) and continued coal use with and without CCS. One analysis was for an existing coal-based power plant baseline as part of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Workshop and Report entitled Retrofitting of Coal-Fired Power Plants for CO2 Emissions Reductions [1]. The second analysis was for a new coal-based power plant baseline as part of an analysis of CO2 mitigation options by the U.S. Business Roundtable entitled The Balancing Act: Climate Change, Energy Security and the U.S. Economy [2]. However, the resulting CO2 avoidance costs for these two analyses were very different. Specifically, the CO2 avoidance cost was about twice as high for the existing coal power plant than for the new coal power plant baseline. There are basic technical and economic reasons for this big difference in CO2 avoidance costs. They are best explained by simply showing the costs and performance of each baseline without and then with CCS in simple, transparent, and consistent one-page models. This enables easy, insightful side-by-side direct comparisons. Since first developing a cost and performance economic screening model of CCS for our GHGT-4 paper in 1998 [3], SFA Pacific has continued to improve the model which focuses on objectivity by stressing transparency and consistency with easy to compare cases. SFA Pacific has clearly shown identical inputs for key items such as fuel costs, non-fuel operating costs, unit capital costs, contingencies, site location factors, cost indexes, and especially capital charges. This makes it easy to see that power costs for the existing coal power plant baseline can be very low when the power plant is old and most of the existing capital is already paid-off. This GHGT-10 paper presents the most updated SFA Pacific analysis of CCS retrofit for existing coal power plant CO2 mitigation. The paper focuses on showing and explaining why the CO2 avoidance costs can be much higher for the existing plants versus new fossil fuel power plants. CO2 taxes which are high enough to discourage new coal power plants with high CO2 emissions would likely have little or no impact on existing coal power plants. Until the over 1,200 GW of existing old coal power plants begin reducing their high CO2 emissions, there can be little net reduction in worldwide CO2 growth. Converting or replacing this large capacity of existing coal power plants is essential to obtaining large CO2 reductions [4]. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Ccs; Retrofit","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Operating costs; Retrofitting; Taxation; Business Roundtable; Coal based power plants; Coal-fired power plant; Emissions reduction; Fossil-fuel plants; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Mitigation options; Retrofit; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955381022

By 2030, E.ON will reduce the specific CO2 emissions to 360 grams per kilowatt hour, half the 1990 figure. Thus, besides increasing the share of renewables and maintaining the nuclear share, E.ON identified the need to advance the technology of fossil fuel fired power plants. E.ON pursues a strategy of replacing power stations at the end of their life cycle with new, state-of-the-art power stations which are ready to be equipped with CCS (carbon capture and storage) and therefore ""capture ready"". Moreover, E.ON is developing CO2 capture and storage as this technology has the potential to drastically reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. Beginning in 2020, E.ON intends to have large scale CCS technology available. E.ON's coordinated strategy encompasses research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) and is directed towards pre combustion capture, oxyfuel and post combustion capture with a focus on the latter. E.ON is working together with international partners to further develop the existing technologies for capturing of CO2 by testing advanced technologies in several pilot plants at our sites. The goal of the pilot projects is to optimise the downstream capture of CO2 from flue gas (post combustion capture) hence reducing the auxiliary power consumption of the capture process. An update on the pilot projects, suppliers and achievement made will be given. Besides improving the capture process itself the technology needs a significant increase of the treatable flue gas capacity compared to today's limits known from chemical industry. Therefore E.ON is also involved in the development of demo scale projects proving the feasibility of the full CCS chain (including transport and storage). E.g. our Kingsnorth power station in the UK has entered the next stage of the UK Government's carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition after developers. We submitted an Outline Solution Bid competition on 9 November 2009. The competition is aiming to deliver the UK's first fullscale CCS demonstration project. We have come to an agreement with both the European Commission and the Dutch Government on the funding of our ROAD-project. This is our joint project with Electrabel (part of GDF SUEZ) at Rotterdam- Maasvlakte (NL). The Dutch part of the funding is now before the European Commission for State Aid approval. We will report about the projects and the progress made in our market units. In addition E.ON is engaged in the development of storage sites and transport routes for CO2. Our business unit E.ON Gas Storage is involved in several research and development activities. The paper will highlight E.ON's main CCS activities. An overview will be given as well as an update on the status of the current projects and available results. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capture; CCS; E.ON; Storage","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Combustion; Energy storage; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Pilot plants; Precombustion; Transportation routes; Capture; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CCS(carbon capture and storage); Coordinated strategies; E.ON; Fossil fuel fired power plants; Post-combustion captures; Research and development; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955378491

Thus, the German Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources started a discussion of some of the issues with mining authorities and industry that led to the proposal of some procedures, criteria catalogs and check lists, that may be used for site characterization, risk assessment and monitoring of storage sites. Background for these discussions was the European CCS directive and its technical Annexes.

Although significant work has been undertaken by the industry to reduce the levels of CO2 emissions through initiatives such as increasing energy efficiency, recycling of by-product fuels, maximizing the recycling of scrap steel and increasing the use of renewable energy, for the industry to achieve further reductions in CO2 emissions it will need to implement new or breakthrough technologies including carbon capture and storage (CCS). The objective of this study is to assess the cost and feasibility of implementing CO2 capture at existing steel making facilities in Australia. The costs of capturing CO2 from existing direct atmospheric emission points at an integrated steel mill and scrap mini mill are estimated. The results indicate that carbon capture might reduce the CO 2 emissions at a 5 million tonne plant by over 7.5 million tonnes annually at a cost of A$77 to A$100 per tonne CO2 avoided. At a mini mill, CO2 emissions could be reduced by 0.1 tonnes annually at a cost of over A$250 per tonne CO2 avoided. Based on current technology, carbon capture would require a carbon price of at least A$65 per tonne emitted to be economically attractive. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Industry; Iron and steel; Solvent capture","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy efficiency; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Industry; Iron; Iron and steel plants; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Steel scrap; Steelmaking; Atmospheric emission; Breakthrough technology; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Integrated steel mills; Iron and steel; Manufacturing industries; On currents; Use of renewable energies; Iron and steel industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955376939

As part of its mission to facilitate technology transfer and develop guidelines from lessons learned, DOE is developing a series of best practice manuals (BPMs) for carbon capture and storage (CCS). The ""Site Screening, Site Selection, and Initial Characterization for Storage of CO2 in Deep Geological Formations"" BPM is a compilation of best practices and includes flowchart diagrams illustrating the general decision making process for Site Screening, Site Selection, and Initial Characterization. The BPM integrates the knowledge gained from various programmatic efforts, with particular emphasis on the Characterization Phase through pilot-scale CO2 injection testing of the Validation Phase of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (RCSP) Initiative. Key geologic and surface elements that suitable candidate storage sites should possess are identified, along with example Site Screening, Site Selection, and Initial Characterization protocols for large-scale geologic storage projects located across diverse geologic and regional settings. This manual has been written as a working document, establishing a framework and methodology for proper site selection for CO2 geologic storage. This will be useful for future CO2 emitters, transporters, and storage providers. It will also be of use in informing local, regional, state, and national governmental agencies of best practices in proper sequestration site selection. Furthermore, it will educate the inquisitive general public on options and processes for geologic CO2 storage. In addition to providing best practices, the manual presents a geologic storage resource and capacity classification system. The system provides a ""standard"" to communicate storage and capacity estimates, uncertainty and project development risk, data guidelines and analyses for adequate site characterization, and guidelines for reporting estimates within the classification based on each project's status. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Characterization; Partnerships; Sequestration; Storage framework, NETL","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Decision making; Digital storage; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Technology transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon sequestration; Classification system; Decision making process; Partnerships; Sequestration; Site characterization; U.S. Department of Energy; Site selection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955376857

GL52 7RZ, United Kingdom","Deep saline formations are expected to store gigatonnes of CO2 over the coming decades, making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation. At present, our experience of deep saline formation storage is limited to a small number of demonstration projects that have successfully injected megatonnes of captured CO2. However, concerns have been raised over pressurization, and related brine displacement, in deep saline formations, given the anticipated scale of future storage operations. Whilst industrial-scale demonstration projects such as Sleipner and In Salah have not experienced problems, generic flow models have indicated that, in some cases, pressure may be an issue. The problem of modeling deep saline formation pressurization has been approached in a number of different ways by researchers, with published analytical and numerical solutions showing a wide range of outcomes. The divergence of results (either supporting or negating the pressurization issue) principally reflects the a priori choice of boundary conditions. These approaches can be summed up as either 'open' or 'closed': a) open system models allow the formation pressure to dissipate laterally, resulting in reasonable storage scenarios; b) closed system models predict pressurization, resulting in a loss of injectivity and/or storage formation leakage. The latter scenario predicts that storage sites will commonly fail to accommodate the injected CO2 at a rate sufficient to handle routine projects. Our models aim to demonstrate that pressurization and brine displacement need to be addressed at a regional scale with geologically accurate boundary conditions. Given that storage formations are unlikely to have zero-flow boundaries (closed system assumption), the boundary contribution to pressure relief from low permeability shales may be significant. At a field scale, these shales are effectively perfect seals with respect to multiphase flow, but are open with respect to single phase flow and pressure dissipation via brine displacement at a regional scale. This is sometimes characterized as a 'semi-closed' system. It follows that the rate at which pressure can be dissipated (and CO2 injected) is highly sensitive to the shale permeability. A common range from submillidarcy (10-17 m2) to sub-nanodarcy (10-22 m2) is considered, and the empirical relationships of permeability with respect to porosity and threshold pressure are reviewed in light of the regional scale of CO2 storage in deep saline formations. Our model indicates that a boundary permeability of about a microdarcy (10-18 m2) is likely to provide sufficient pressure dissipation via brine displacement to allow for routine geological storage. The models also suggest that nanodarcy shales (10 -21 m2) will result in significant pressurization. There is regional evidence, from the North Sea, that typical shale permeabilities at depths associated with CO2 storage (1-3 km) are likely to favor storage, relegating pressurization to a manageable issue. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Model; Pressurization; Shale permeability; Storage","Boundary conditions; Brines; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Models; Offshore gas fields; Pressurization; Shale; Accurate boundary conditions; Analytical and numerical solutions; Boundary permeability; Deep saline formations; Demonstration project; Empirical relationships; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Pressure dissipation; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955375822

This provides an indication of the location and scale of opportunities to gain further experience in the application of CCS. This by using captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from sour gas resources, which are presently undeveloped or underdeveloped, for carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO 2-EOR). Currently there are globally many undeveloped or underdeveloped sour gas accumulations containing a significant fraction of CO2. The high CO2 content between 15% and 80%, as well as in some cases the addition of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), severely limits the economic and environmental viability of sour gas resources. Globally a total resource of around 4 trillion m3 of net hydrocarbon gas and 15000 MT of associated CO2 has been identified. This was done by summing individual undeveloped and underdeveloped fields with ultimate recoverable proven and probable resources larger than 14 billion m3 each of net hydrocarbon gas and CO2 content between 15% and 80%. Development of these fields could be enabled by the availability of a cost effective gas separation method such as the Controlled Freeze Zone™ (CFZ) technology, and of viable CO2 enhanced oil recovery opportunities (CO2-EOR) to reduce the cost of CO2 capture, transportation and storage. Sour gas resources have been mapped globally using the IHS fields and reservoirs database from 2009. The largest concentrations of sour gas are located in SE Asia &amp; NW Australia, Central USA, Middle East and North Africa. In the USA, Middle East and North Africa, which are oil rich, there is significant potential for CO2-EOR opportunities. The relative absence of significant oil accumulations in SE Asia &amp; NW Australia will in many cases require the storage of CO2 in saline aquifers, as is planned for the Gorgon field in Australia. The challenges of developing natural gas fields with a high CO2 content can be best illustrated by ExxonMobil's development of the LaBarge field. This field, located in SW Wyoming, USA, was discovered in 1963, but production was delayed until 1986 because of the challenging gas composition of 65% carbon dioxide, 21% methane, 7% nitrogen, 5% hydrogen sulfide, and 0.6% helium. It is the lowest hydrocarbon content natural gas commercially produced in the world. Currently the majority of the recovered CO2 is transported and sold to EOR operators. Additionally, construction of a commercial demonstration facility for ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze Zone™ (CFZ) gas treatment technology has been completed at Shute Creek, Wyoming. The CFZ™ technology allows the single step separation of CO2 and other contaminants from a natural gas stream without the use of solvents or absorbents. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Controlled Freeze Zone; Enhanced oil recovery; World wide sour gas resources","Aquifers; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Energy resources; Enhanced recovery; Gas industry; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen sulfide; Hydrogeology; Location; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Nitrogen; Oil field development; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum reservoirs; Petroleum transportation; Sour gas; Sulfur determination; Development potential; Enhanced oil recovery; Gas compositions; Gas resource; Hydrocarbon content; Middle East and North Africa; Oil accumulation; Sour gas accumulations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955374350

An extensive monitoring program is being considered in order to ensure the Carbon Capture and Geological Storage (CCGS) projects efficiency. However, there are several challenges to be confronted concerning the CO2 monitoring in such adverse conditions as the Presalt reservoirs. Among the existing techniques for monitoring offshore storage sites, some of them have already technological maturity and applicability to the Pre-salt environment but other methods must rely on some development or methodology adaptation to the specific features of these fields and they will be initiatives of the PRO-CO2 technological program of PETROBRAS Research Center.

CCS is currently the leading option in Alberta. A key to making it viable is a system that allows multiple emitters to gather, capture, and transport their CO 2 to the best sinks, efficiently and economically. The oil sands are located in Northern Alberta. Geological formations suitable for CO2 storage exist in the South-West region, ∼400 km from the sources. Implementing CCS will necessitate transporting roughly 30 megatonnes of CO 2 to suitable sinks. One of the best sinks is the underground aquifer in the Redwater Reef near Ft. Saskatchewan, with an estimated preliminary capacity of one gigatonne of CO2, or 37 years of CO2 emissions from oil sands, at 2007 rates. In this study, we compare two schemes to transport CO2 from oil sands operations by capturing CO 2 and: 1) transporting it in its supercritical state to storage in the Redwater Reef and 2) transporting it in solution to Redwater, regenerating the solvent on-site and storing the CO2 in the Redwater Reef. The fugitive emissions of Case 1 are consistently higher than those of Case 2. This is due to the former's electricity demands and the fact that the emissions associated with energy for solvent regeneration are not captured. Case 1 is more susceptible to electricity cost fluctuations than Case 2, but the latter is more susceptible to changes in the price of fuel. Although the CAPEX is similar for both, Case 2 benefits more from economies of scale than Case 1; the OPEX for Case 1 is 3.5% higher. The avoidance costs of Case 2 are lower on a gross basis (111 vs. 114 $/tonne CO2) and on a net basis (327 vs. 851 $/tonne CO2). © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Alberta; Canada; Oil sands; Oxyfuel; Pipeline; Regeneration","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Costs; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Oil sands; Petroleum transportation; Pipelines; Reefs; Sand; Alberta; Canada; Electricity demands; Geological formation; Oil sands operations; Oxy-fuels; Regeneration; Solvent regenerations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955372762

Alongside this, sustainable development of energy resources is a prime target for the Total group, which strives constantly to reduce the GHG intensity of its production activities. On new projects and for major plant modifications, this is achieved by optimizing energy efficiency and preventing continuous flaring of produced gas, which is marketed or re-injected instead. On current producing installations, a continuous improvement process to address flaring reduction and energy efficiency is on-going. However in view of the coming development challenges, Total is further considering the development of facilities with a limited GHG footprint, by the means of emissions reduction through carbon capture and sequestration. Designing capture-ready installations is the first step on this path. It is a challenging task owing to the evolving nature of available technology, the high energy demand and correlative emissions of carbon and the unusual specific constraints in dedicated Oil and Gas energy plants. This paper presents our experience in this learning process applied to the oil &amp; gas industrial environment. With the collaboration ofTechnip, Total initiated a study on the integration of carbon-capture solutions within cogeneration plants. On the strength of its in-house experience of oxy-combustion and acid gas removal, of transport and re-injection of acid gases, Total considered both oxy-combustion and post-combustion as promising technologies. The objective of the study was to assess the potential of each technology to tackle carbon capture on the two main types of thermo-mechanic converters present in a cogeneration plant: turbines and boilers, as well as evaluate the constraints. Alternative cogeneration plant concepts, with or without combined cycle were considered, to challenge further the impact of capture on cogeneration design. The actual operating conditions of a typical cogeneration plant burning clean natural gas, particularly its flue gas emissions, compatible with the target project's constraints, were proposed as the design basis for capture systems of various scales. The requirement to keep to simple capture concepts was critical in view of the challenging economic environment of carbon capture, the evolving technology and the probable tightening of emission-reduction targets. Due to the uncertainties as to the final fate of the carbon dioxide, EOR or/and geo-storage, nearby or distant, in depleted fields or saline aquifers, being considered, several CO2 conditioning process options were defined. The integration of capture-ready building blocks within the plants was a significant step in the design process for alternative cogeneration plants, and enabled the synergies and constraints of operating the capture systems to be identified.

Fossil fuel power plants are one of the main sources of CO2 emission and several methods are under development to capture CO2 from power plants. In this paper, CO2 capture from a natural gas fired steam cycle power plant using oxyfuel combustion technology is studied. Oxy-fuel combustion is an interesting option since CO2 concentration in the flue gas is highly increased. The Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) developed by Carnegie Mellon University (USA) is used to evaluate the effect of this capture technology on the plant efficiency and economic parameters of the system. The IECM uses regression models based on other studies to evaluate the required energy for oxygen production unit (air separation unit) and CO2 purification and compression unit. In this work, these two units are simulated using the Aspen Plus software in parallel with the IECM, and the results are compared with the results of the IECM. This comparison verified that the power requirement evaluations from the IECM performance model and the Aspen Plus software are approximately the same. Since CO2 capture and transport are cost and energy intensive, the cost of electricity (COE) in capture plants increases significantly. According to the assumptions in this study, the cost of electricity for both the base plant and the capture plant are calculated using the IECM cost model. The cost of electricity for the base plant is equal to 66.8 $/MWh while the cost of electricity for the capture plant is 123.7 $/MWh. In addition, cost of CO2 avoided can be calculated by using the cost of electricity and CO2 emission rate in the base and capture plants. If CO2 storage cost or CO2 benefit is not considered, the cost of CO 2 avoided is about 104 $/ton CO2 for a 237 MW power plant. However, it is shown in this study that if the captured CO2 is used for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the nearby oil fields (assuming 100 km distance), the revenue gained can compensate for the extra cost of electricity produced by the oxy-fuel combustion natural gas steam cycle and consequently reduces the cost of CO2 avoided. A rule of thumb is used to evaluate the amount of EOR revenues. According to this rule of thumb, 0.25 ton of crude oil is recovered per ton of CO2 injected. A relation between gas and oil price is therefore required to consider an integrated natural gas fired steam power plant, CO2 pipeline and oil field as an overall system. Assuming that natural gas price is a function of oil price, a rough estimation of oil price in which Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is economically feasible can be found. In this study, the relationship between oil and gas price is based on a polynomial function. This function is determined according to the time series information of natural gas and oil price in recent years (1997-2008) in the United States. The prices of these fuels in Iran were not used because the prices are heavily subsidized. The results show that at high oil prices, about $60/bbl, all the costs of CO2 capture and transport to oil field can be compensated by EOR revenues which makes the integrated power plant and CCS with EOR economically feasible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cost of electricity; EOR revenues; Oxy-fuel combustion","Air cleaners; Air purification; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Computer software; Costs; Crude oil; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Function evaluation; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gasoline plants; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Regression analysis; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carnegie Mellon University; Cost of electricity; Economic feasibilities; Natural gas and oil prices; Oxy-fuel combustion technology; Oxyfuel combustion; Time series informations; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955370230

This objective is imperative because at present, six coal-to-liquid facilities in Shaanxi Province are capturing and venting significant quantities of CO2. The Wyoming State Geological Survey and the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Energy Resource and Chemical Engineering conducted a feasibility study to determine the potential for geological CO2 sequestration in the northern Ordos Basin near Yulin. The Shaanbei Slope of the Ordos Basin is a huge monoclinal structure with a high-priority sequestration reservoir (Majiagou Formation) that lies beneath a 2,000+ meter-thick sequence of Mesozoic rocks containing a multitude of lowpermeability lithologies. The targeted Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the location of interest is more than 700 meters thick. The carbonate reservoir is located at depths where pressures and temperatures are well above the supercritical point of CO2. The targeted reservoir contains high-salinity brines (20,000-50,000 ppm) that have little or no economic value. The targeted reservoir is continuous as inferred from well logs, and cores show that porosity ranges from 1 to 15% with average measured porosity of 8%, and that permeability ranges from 1-35 md. This paper focuses on calculations that will help evaluate the capacity estimates through the use of high-resolution multiphase numerical simulation models, as well as a more simple volumetric approach. The preliminary simulation results show that the Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the Ordos Basin has excellent potential for geological CO2 sequestration and could store the CO2 currently emitted by coal-to-liquid facilities in Shaanxi Province for hundreds of years (i.e., 9 Mt/year CO2; 450 Mt over a 50-year period at one injection site). © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Co2 storage capacity; Ordos basin; Performance assessment","Economic analysis; Energy resources; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Metamorphic rocks; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Planning; Porosity; Well logging; Carbonate reservoir; CO2 storage; High salinity brines; Monoclinal structures; Multi-phase numerical simulation; Northern Ordos Basin; Ordos Basin; Performance assessment; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955370218

The coupled absorption/desorption system to remove the CO2 from the flue gas is highly integrated with the power plant and the downstream CO2 compression, transportation and storage. With increasing portion of alternative energy forms like e.g. wind power, the demand on modern coal-fired power plants to provide regulating net power is increasing, leading to frequent and fast load changes during operation. To make the implementation of CCS to these plants technically and economically feasible, the capture process has to be able to follow these fast load changes without restraining the overall plant performance. To investigate the transient behavior of the individual plant components, as well as the overall dynamic performance of the capture unit, step response tests have been performed at a 1 ton CO2/hour pilot plant for the amine-based post-combustion process within the EU project CESAR. The purpose of the tests was to gain knowledge about possible problems or bottlenecks during a dynamic operation where the plant is going from one operation point to another. Three operation parameters were changed stepwise and the response of the entire system was monitored. In this paper the results of the tests are shown and the response of the system is analyzed. In general, no unexpected observations were made and no bottlenecks were found during the step response tests performed. The overall system acts like a buffer for any perturbation at the inlet, which is a wanted effect considering the future downstream compression unit. The average time for the entire system to reach the new steady state operating conditions after the perturbation was between 1h 15min and 1h 45 min. However the interaction of the coupled absorber/desorber system led to fluctuations in the system, when all parameters have been changed simultaneously. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","MEA; Pilot plant; Post-combustion; System response; Transient test","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Combustion; Ethanolamines; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Pilot plants; Step response; Wind power; Absorption/desorption; Coal-fired power plant; Open loop step response; Post-combustion; Post-combustion captures; Steady-state operating conditions; System response; Transient tests; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955369756

The decarbonization of baseload electricity is met by significant expansions of nuclear power and renewable energy generation technologies as well as the application of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies applied to both coal and natural gas fired power plants. Relatively little attention has been paid thus far to whether intermediate and peaking units would respond the same way to a climate policy given the very different operational and economic context that these kinds of electricity generation units operate under. In this paper, the authors discuss key aspects of the load segmentation methodology used to imbed a varying electricity demand within the GCAM (a state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Model) energy and economic modelling framework and present key results on the role CCS technologies could play in decarbonizng subpeak and peak generation (encompassing only the top 10% of the load) and under what conditions. To do this, the authors have modelled two hypothetical climate policies that require 50% and 80% reductions in US emissions from business as usual by the middle of this century. Intermediate electricity generation is virtually decarbonized once carbon prices exceed approximately $150/tonCO2. When CO2 permit prices exceed $160/tonCO2, natural gas power plants with CCS have roughly the same marketshare as conventional gas plants in serving subpeak loads. The penetration of CCS into peak load (upper 6% here) is minimal under the scenarios modeled here suggesting that CO2 emissions from this aspect of the U.S. electricity sector would persist well into the future even with stringent CO2 emission control policies in place. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Baseload; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS; Climate change; Electricity generation; Intermediate; Peak; Subpeak","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal storage; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Nuclear fuels; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Base-loads; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Electricity generation; Intermediate; Peak; Subpeak; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955367183

Recent high-level studies by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme (IEAGHG) have estimated realistic global capacity available in depleted oil and depleted gas fields to be 130 and 65 Gt, respectively, based on mass balance considerations from hydrocarbon reserve information. However, comparable estimates for deep saline formation (DSF) storage require an analytical approach that considers the fraction of pore space in storage formations that could be occupied by injected CO2. Many regional mapping initiatives have shown that potential DSF storage capacities are typically at least an order of magnitude higher than in depleted fields. Computationally similar methodologies to estimate DSF storage resources have been developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF); in both, a storage coefficient, E (or efficiency factor), is used to derive resource estimates. The E coefficient takes account of various geological and technical factors that could restrict the amount of pore space available for storage but does not take into account economic, regulatory, and source-sink matching considerations. IEAGHG and DOE commissioned a study in 2008 by the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC), to improve the accuracy of storage coefficients for DSF. As there was insufficient real-world CO2 injection data to derive a representative range for E, geological input parameters were derived from global hydrocarbon reservoir data as a proxy for DSF. Modeling allowed derivation of probabilistic ranges of storage coefficients at both sitespecific and formation levels for clastic, carbonate, and dolomite lithologies. The overall mean value of E for all lithologies was calculated as 2.6% at the formation level. A key assumption made in the study was that DSF will predominantly act as ""open"" systems, whereby pressure and displaced formation fluids can be safely dissipated through the wider storage formation and adjacent strata. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Mapping; Proven reserves; Carbon sequestration; Co2 geological storages; Deep saline formations; Environmental researches; Hydrocarbon reserves; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Mass balance considerations; U.S. Department of Energy; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955367054

In the scenario it is based on, CCS will provide approximately 20% of the total CO2 emissions reductions out to 2050. To achieve this contribution it will require an ambitious CCS growth path with 100 projects needed globally by 2020 and over 3000 by 2050. In both 2020 and 2050 the major developing countries will need to contribute to this deployment. Brazil has a unique electricity and emissions profil e. Over 80% of Brazils electricity is produced from hydropower with the rest being made up by a combination of fossil fuels, biomass, and nuclear. This means the energy emissions in Brazil are relatively low. Many people within Brazil see stopping the deforestation of the Amazon as the key emissions reduction mechanism for Brazil. However, the contribution to CO2 emissions from coal is expected to increase due to 6000MW of coal power that is planned to be installed in Brazil by 2030, although this still only represents 2.7% of grid compared to 83% from renewables. CCS in Brazil will be more relevant to industry rather than for electricity generation. In particular CCS could be crucial for the development of some of the ""Pre-salt"" petrol eum fi elds which bring new challenges. Although there are no conclusive studies on the concentration o f carbon dioxide (CO2) in the region, some wells have shown concentrations of CO2 above those found in the Campos Basin, while others showed concentrations close to zero. Still, Petrobras have proactively committed to not releasing to the atmosphere, the CO 2 associated with the natural gas produced in the pre-salt layer. In addition, the pre-salt oil is considered of good quality, light oil and therefore, the refining process consumes less energy and will emit less CO 2 when compared to the processing of heavier crude. This paper looks to discuss the current status of CCS in Brazil. This includes looking at the current status of a number of demonstration projects that are already underway in Brazil as well as additional ones that are planned. The paper will also discuss the.

The total reaction rate of mineral and CO2 is always dependent on the slowest partial reaction, and with olivine the obtained conversion values were not correlated to dissolution rates. These direct carbonation results indicate that the precipitation rate of magnesite and not the dissolution rate of olivine was rate limiting for the reaction between olivine, CO2 and H2O at 185°C and 115 bar. In industrial carbonation scenarios where the dissolution rate is not limiting, process optimization has to focus on the maximizing the precipitation kinetics. In industrial processes were precipitation is rate limiting, a conventional ball mill is probably the best alternative due to the low energy consumption, while in processes where the dissolution is rate limiting, more energy intensive pre-treatment methods may have potential. In the context of geological CO 2 storage, the precipitation rate of carbonate will influence CO 2 mineral trapping, and it is possible that precipitation kinetics is not equal to dissolution kinetics. Injection of CO2 into reservoir will lower the pH and thereby dissolve several minerals. The balance between dissolution and precipitation is dependent on the kinetics and solubility of the present minerals and possible products, where silica and carbonates probably are the most important. Mineral precipitation is unwanted in the storage formation due to lowering of porosity and possibly the permeability, but with time carbonate precipitation is positive due to mineral trapping of CO 2. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Dissolution; Experimental; Kinetics; Mills; Mineral carbonation; Modelling; Precipitation","Ball mills; Carbonation; Dissolution; Energy utilization; Enzyme kinetics; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Kinetics; Minerals; Models; Olivine; Optimization; Precipitation (chemical); Reaction kinetics; Reaction rates; Salinity measurement; Silicate minerals; Carbonate precipitation; Dissolution kinetics; Experimental; Low energy consumption; Mills; Mineral carbonation; Mineral precipitation; Precipitation kinetics; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955366533

But there is considerable uncertainty as to the role that carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit could play in this development. The State Council in China has set a target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40% by 2020 compared with the level for 2005. Although this provides some policy impetus for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in China, it is also important to note that over 350 GW of coal-fired power plant capacity has been built within the past five years and that these power plants are expected to operate for at least another 25 years. Because coal is an affordable and accessible fuel in China, both the China Electricity Council (CEC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that another 300 GW of supercritical and ultra-supercritical new coalfired power plants will be constructed in the next decade to satisfy the growing energy demand of the country [1,2]. But unless other options to reduce emissions can be implemented, a simple consideration of the emissions they produce suggests that some of these recently built power plants may be required to shut down within the next two decades to address Chinese and/or international climate policies. During the past five years, the national policy of 'closing smaller and/or inefficient units to build large and more efficient units' has been implemented not only to save energy, but also to reduce specific carbon dioxide emissions (i.e. reduced gCO2/kWh of electricity produced). Forcing early plant closure has, however, proved to be a difficult task under the institutional framework of the Chinese electricity sector, because these plants usually had not reached the end of their design lifetimes. Also it was only partially successful in the context of CO2 reduction in the sense that companies wanted to build large plants to increase electrical output and strict rules meant they could only do this by closing a specified amount of older plant. But the end result was still that more coal was burnt and hence total CO2 emissions to atmosphere increased. Retrofitting some of the existing power plants to capture CO2 , which by contrast can achieve an absolute decrease in CO2 emissions to atmosphere for an analogous loss in plant output (to the closures previously enforced) is therefore, an important option to address the threat of climate change while maintaining in the meantime the country's electricity supply from coal. A preliminary investigation of over 100 large power plants in China was conducted to determine their potential for a retrofit with CO2 capture, transport and storage. Factors assessed included geographic location, space on site, plant layout, water restriction, coal supply, efficiency, FGD status and potential access to storage sites. Based on these criteria, retrofitting prospects were evaluated and rated. It appears that about 45% of existing power plants may suffer from 'carbon lock-in' status, i.e. their emissions could not be abated using CCS technology, at least at 'reasonable' cost. Critical factors that would preclude capture retrofit are, not surprisingly, access to storage sites and unsuitable plant layout and/or space on site. Variations in other factors would affect the level of retrofitting cost, but this effect could be positive as well as negative. In principle, plants would be retrofitted in an order that reflects the extent to which these site specific factors would give higher or lower retrofit costs. The results aim to provide an overview of the potential issues that need to be considered by stakeholders, policy makers and manufacturing companies when deciding the market potential for CCS retrofit technology in China. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Capture ready; Carbon capture retrofit; CCS; CCS ready; Google analysis","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Costs; Fire tube boilers; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Plant layout; Plant shutdowns; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Capture ready; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon dioxide emissions; CCS ready; Google analysis; Institutional framework; International energy agency; Manufacturing companies; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955366114

It was intended to help energy policy-makers develop and implement more effective strategies to accelerate the deployment of emerging energy technologies. The theoretical underpinnings lie in the fields of sustainability science, political science, and risk perception. Part of the objectives of the SPEED framework are to identify the dominant socio-political influences on energy technology decisions and examine how policy can facilitate a societal response to climate change by contributing insights to stakeholders. The focus is at the state level because it is at the state level that emergent energy technologies are sited, permitted, and built. The purpose of this study was to examine the structure of communication about carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology from the perspective of individuals actively involved in decisions that affect deployment and diffusion. We use density of function-system networks to examine differences between states and categories stakeholders. The information is used to inform the discussion of the current structure of communication and how it might present either barriers or opportunities for CCS innovation. Five function systems are used, each divided into benefits (positive) or risks (negative) associated with CCS: economic benefit (ECP), economic risk (ECN), environmental benefit (ENP), environmental risk (ENN), health and safety benefit (HLP), health and safety risk (HLN), political benefit (POP), political risk (PON), technical benefit (TEP), and technical risk (TEN). An additional category of CCS statements that could not be definitively assigned to one of these categories was included as an 'other' category (OTP and OTN). Networks were constructed for all stakeholders, each state, and each stakeholder type based on ties of shared intensity of communication about the particular frame. From these networks, density measurements were calculated and reported. In the case studies presented here, technical risk dominates communication about CCS at the state level. The economic, technical, and political system functions appear to present the greatest barrier due to largely negative communication. This study focuses on how the development of shared meaning creates ties between individuals in a CCS policy network. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Network analysis; Network density; Resonance","Climate change; Electric network analysis; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Resonance; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Social sciences; Sustainable development; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Emerging energy technologies; Energy policy makers; Environmental benefits; Network density; Political dimensions; Political influences; Sustainability science; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955365084

The activation procedure and the hydrogen sorption kinetics of these alloys were studied by thermogravimetry at different temperatures in the range from 100 °C to 380 °C.

The morphology of the nano-Ni powder is filamentary or aciniform, and the Ni crystallites contain a relatively low density of lattice defects, mainly twins. Oxygen and carbon impurities formed surface films. In contrast, a submicro-Ni powder contains less C and a much lower O concentration, resulting in significantly less surface film formation compared to the finer nano-Ni. Catalytic properties of these powders, as an additive to MgH2 hydrogen storage media, have been investigated. When ball-milled with high-enthalpy hydrides, viz. MgH 2, the nano-Ni exhibits strong catalytic properties and lowers greatly the activation energy (EA) by 50%, but does not affect the enthalpy. Consequently, the desorption temperature can be lowered by almost 100 °C. It is anticipated that when ball-milled with low-enthalpy complex hydrides, this new nanonickel catalyst will have a paramount effect on destabilization of mostly kinetically stabilized hydride complexes.

Maximum of five and three H2 molecules are adsorbed on V-capped and V-inserted VC3H3 structures, respectively. This corresponds to the hydrogen uptake capacity of 10.07 and 6.66 wt% for the former and the latter, respectively. The first added hydrogen molecule is adsorbed in dihydride form on V-capped as well as V-inserted VC3H3 complex. A complex with a dissociated hydrogen molecule adsorbed has higher binding energy than that of molecular hydrogen adsorbed. The nature of interactions between H 2 molecules and organometallic complex is studied using many-body analysis approach.

The novelty of the current research work lies in the methods of generalization taking into consideration the effects of temperature-dependent nonadiabaticity and quantum-correlated (entangled) movement under desired temperature conditions. The investigation was examined taking into account the biradical state of a hydrogen molecule. In addition, the hydrogen architecture depends on the way of intercoordination between very unequal in length bonds in singlet and triplet hydrogen biradicals. Two orientations of hydrogen biradical are considered (parallel and perpendicular).

Wherein, LOH (particularly cycloalkanes) are used for transporting the hydrogen in chemical bonded form at ambient temperature and pressure. The hydrogen is delivered through a catalytic dehydrogenation process. The aromatics formed in the process are used for carrying more hydrogen by a subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Cost economics were performed on a system which produces 10 kg/h of hydrogen using methylcyclohexane as a carrier. With proprietary catalysts we have demonstrated the possibility of hydrogen storage of 6.8 wt% and 60 kg/m 3 of hydrogen on volume basis. The energy balance calculation reveals the ratio of energy transported to energy consumed is about 3.9. Moreover, total carbon footprint calculation for the process of hydrogen delivery including transportation of LOH is also reported. The process can facilitate a saving of 345 tons/year of carbon dioxide emissions per delivery station by replacing gasoline with hydrogen for passenger cars. There is an immense techno-economic potential for the process. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In a DSC test the melting of LiAlH4 is completely eliminated by the addition of 5 wt% n-Ni incorporated by high energy ball milling. The LiAlH4 + 5 wt% n-Ni system processed by ball milling desorbs ∼4.8 wt% H2 at 120 °C within 2000 s. At 120 °C within a 5000 s time interval the desorption reaction occurs fully in a solid state in one step according to the following reaction: LiAlH4 → 1/3Li3AlH6 + 2/3Al + H2. This reaction is completely non-volatile. At 140 °C and higher temperatures the desorption reaction of ball milled LiAlH4 + 5 wt% n-Ni occurs fully in a solid state most likely in two steps according to the following reactions: (1) LiAlH4 → 1/3Li3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H2 and (2) 1/3Li3AlH6 → LiH + 1/3Al + 0.5H2. However, XRD patterns after reaction (2) do not show the presence of LiH but instead, they show the presence of LiOH.

Concerning the binding strengths of the alkali metals, the density functional theory calculations reveal that Li is bound strongest to the host framework, followed by K and Na. Decoration with Li also results in the highest hydrogen adsorption energies among the studied alkali metals. Furthermore, Zn-MOF16 exhibits the highest hydrogen adsorption energies near the metal oxide cluster, while hydrogen binding strengths at organic linker sites do not differ substantially between Zn-/Mg-/Ca-MOF16.

Potential applications of storage-guaranteed systems range from small installations for remote telecoms, water-pumping and single dwellings, to farms and whole communities for whom grid connection is too expensive or otherwise infeasible, to industrial, military and humanitarian uses. In this paper we explore some of the technical issues surrounding the use of hydrogen storage, in conjunction with a PEM electrolyser and PEM fuel cell, to guarantee electricity supply when the energy source is intermittent, most typically solar photovoltaic. We advocate metal-hydride storage and compare its energy density to that of Li-ion battery storage, concluding that a significantly smaller package is possible with metal-hydride storage. A simple approach to match the output of a photovoltaic array to an electrolyser is presented. The properties required for the metal-hydride storage material to interface the electrolyser to the fuel cell are discussed in detail. It is concluded that relatively conventional Mischmetal-based AB5 alloys are suitable for this application. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ti-doped pyracylene III with the Ti atom lying on a pentagon is the most stable isomer with substitutional energy of 4.73 eV/mol. Up to three H2 molecules can be adsorbed on to the Ti atom through charge transfer and partially chemisorptions due to the partially filled d orbitals and positive charges on Ti. Totally seven H2 molecules can be adsorbed on Ti-doped pyracylenes with mixture of chemo- and physisorption.

A single storage device, i.e., a supercapacitor (ultracapacitor) module, is in the proposed structure. The main weak point of fuel cells (FCs) is slow dynamics because the power slope is limited to prevent fuel starvation problems, improve performance and increase lifetime. The very fast power response and high specific power of a supercapacitor complements the slower power output of the main source to produce the compatibility and performance characteristics needed in a load. The energy in the system is balanced by d.c.-bus energy regulation (or indirect voltage regulation). A supercapacitor module functions by supplying energy to regulate the d.c.-bus energy. The fuel cell, as a slow dynamic source in this system, supplies energy to the supercapacitor module in order to keep it charged. The photovoltaic array assists the fuel cell during daytime. To verify the proposed principle, a hardware system is realized with analog circuits for the fuel cell, solar cell and supercapacitor current control loops, and with numerical calculation (dSPACE) for the energy control loops. Experimental results with small-scale devices, namely, a PEMFC (1200 W, 46 A) manufactured by the Ballard Power System Company, a photovoltaic array (800 W, 31 A) manufactured by the Ekarat Solar Company and a supercapacitor module (100 F, 32 V) manufactured by the Maxwell Technologies Company, illustrate the excellent energy-management scheme during load cycles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Converter; Energy management; Fuel cell; Photovoltaic array; Supercapacitor; Voltage control","Ballard Power Systems; Bus energy; Control algorithms; Converter; Current control loop; D-space; Energy control; Hardware system; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid power sources; Load cycle; Management scheme; Numerical calculation; Performance characteristics; Photovoltaic arrays; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells; Power out put; Renewable energy source; Slow dynamics; Specific power; Storage devices; Super capacitor; Ultracapacitors; Voltage regulations; Weak points; Analog circuits; Capacitor storage; Capacitors; Electric potential; Energy policy; Industry; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Remote control; Solar power generation; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956705703
