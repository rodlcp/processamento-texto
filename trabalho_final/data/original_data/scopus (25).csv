The diagnostic allows measurement of the absolute XUV energy and average power in two selected wavelength bands, at 11.4 and 13.4 nm. In addition, the pulse-to-pulse and long-term XUV stability of the source can be assessed, as well as the contamination of multilayer XUV optics exposed to the source. This paper describes the full calibration procedure: all optical elements were calibrated at the wavelength of operation by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt at the storage ring Bessy II, a full analysis of geometrical factors was done, and the influence of the spectral emissivity of the source on the calibration was analyzed in detail. The calibration was performed both for the centroid wavelength as for the full bandwidth of the diagnostic. The total uncertainty in the absolute calibration allowed measurement of source characteristics with an uncertainty of less than 5%, and a shot-to-shot repeatability to less than 2%. The uncertainty was mainly determined by external factors like background gas distribution and spectral source characteristics.

The central obscuration of Schwarzschild optics is also considered. For a numerical aperture of 0.65, typical of an infrared microscope, the maximum energy density of the focused electric field is reduced by ∼50%, compared to paraxial focusing calculations that do not consider a central obscuration. With a large numerical aperture, some light rays strike the focal plane at grazing incidence, producing longitudinally polarized radiation. For a numerical aperture of one, focused edge and synchrotron radiation produce similar spots of longitudinally polarized radiation, whose diameter is about one-half wavelength. The small size and large radiation field of these spots may be useful in experiments that require localized radiation with polarization perpendicular to the sample surface. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Performances of the detection system based on a CCD camera and a converter screen have been recently improved using 6LiF/ZnS:Ag scintillators with different thickness. Indeed, reducing the layer of the scintillator improved considerably the spatial resolution while keeping a reasonable efficiency. Furthermore, a neutron velocity selector was temporarily added to the setup to perform radiography and tomography experiments with monochromatic neutron beams. Basic properties of transmitted beams were studied to assess the applicability of this device in neutron imaging. Of interest was the enhancement of the L/D-ratio by selecting neutron beams of short wavelengths. Cold neutron tomography demonstrated to be a useful technique in various spheres of activity, such as aerospatial industry or radioactive waste storage.

A super-ferric storage ring has been constructed in which the field is to be known to 0.1 ppm. In addition, a new type of air core superconducting inflector has been developed and constructed, which successfully serves as the injection magnet. The injection magnet cancels the storage ring field, 1.5 T, seen by the entering muon beam very close to the storage ring aperture. At the same time, it gives negligible influence to the knowledge of the uniform main magnetic field in the muon storage region located at just 23 mm away from the beam channel. This was accomplished using a new double cosine theta design for the magnetic field which traps most of the return field, and then surrounding the magnet with a special superconducting sheet which traps the remaining return field. The magnet is operated using a warm-to-cold cryogenic cycle which avoids affecting the precision field of the storage ring. This article describes the design, research development, fabrication process, and final performance of this new type of superconducting magnet. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We present the first quantitative nondestructive assay of the plutonium content of fast-breeder reactor spent-fuel assemblies while still underwater in their facility storage pond. We have calibrated and installed an underwater neutron coincidence counter (Spent Fuel Coincidence Counter (SFCC)) in the BN-350 reactor spent-fuel pond in Aqtau, Kazakhstan. A procedure has been developed to convert singles and doubles (coincidence) neutron rates observed by the SFCC into the total plutonium content of a given BN-350 spent-fuel assembly. The plutonium content has been successfully determined for spent-fuel assemblies with a contact radiation level as high as ∼105Rads/h. Using limited facility information and multiple measurements along the length of spent-fuel assemblies, the combined measurement and facility declaration error is ∼8%. A simplified one-point measurement procedure leads to a combined measurement and facility declaration error of ∼13%. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

They are the flight spare X-ray mirror from the JET-X/Spectrum-X program and an MOS CCD (CCD22) of the type currently operating in orbit as part of the EPIC focal plane camera on XMM-Newton (SPIE 4140 (2000) 64). The JET-X mirrors were first calibrated at the Max Plank Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics' (MPE) Panter facility, Garching, Germany in 1996 (SPIE 2805 (1996) 56; SPIE 3114 (1997) 392). Half-energy widths of 16 arcsec at 1.5 keV were confirmed for the two flight mirrors and the flight spare. The calibration of the flight spare was repeated at Panter in July 2000 in order to establish whether any changes had occurred during the 4yr that the mirror had been in storage at the OAB, Milan, Italy. The results reported in this paper confirm that the resolution of the JET-X mirrors has remained stable over this storage period. In an extension of this test program, the flight spare EPIC camera was installed at the focus of the JET-X mirror to simulate the optical system of the Swift XRT. Tolerances in the mirror focal length, the on-axis and off-axis point spread functions were measured and calibration data sets were used to obtain centroid positions of X-ray point sources. The results confirmed Swift's ability to determine the centroid positions of sources at 100mCrab brightness to better than 1 arcsec and provided a calibration of the centroiding process as a function of source flux and off-axis angle. The presence of background events in the image frame introduced errors in the centroiding process and this was accounted for by reducing the sampling area used for the centroiding algorithm. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Depending on fluctuation, beam transmission efficiency from the linac to the booster synchrotron was significantly affected, and beam intensity in the booster synchrotron changed 20-30%. This caused delay of optimization of the various parameters in the booster synchrotron. More problematic, the beam intensities stored in each rf (radio frequency) bucket of the storage ring at SPring-8 were all different from each other. The users utilizing synchrotron radiation requested that the beam intensity in each rf bucket be as uniform as possible. It was thus a pressing necessity to stabilize the beam energy in the linac. Investigation of the cause has clarified that the various apparatuses installed in the linac periodically changed depending on circumstances and utilities such as the air conditioner, cooling water and electric power. After various improvements, beam energy stability in the linac of <0.06% rms was attained. Consequently, the beam intensity in each rf bucket required by users was almost satisfactorily improved. This paper describes the processes used to search for the origin of the beam energy fluctuation and the remedy. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One parameter entering the Schwinger equation for the calculation of the spectral photon flux of bending magnet radiation is the electron beam energy. So at BESSY II the electron beam energy is measured by two independent techniques one of which is described in this paper: the photons from a CO2-laser are scattered in a head-on collision with the stored electrons. From the spectrum of the backscattered photons that are detected by an energy-calibrated HPGe detector the electron beam energy can be determined.

The method is partly based on the Fourier transform of the observed electron decay signal, which is known in this experiment only after some time ts after injection. It is shown that the standard Fourier transform would give a wrong frequency distribution even if the signal were known immediately after injection. Only the cosine Fourier transform with the properly determined initial time t0 (different for different detectors placed along the orbit) gives the correct frequency distribution in such a case. As for a later starting time, ts &gt; t0, a special procedure must be used to find t0 and to compensate for the lack of information about the signal between t0 and ts. The new technique is highly accurate and radically different from that used by CERN in its muon g-2 experiment. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the radiation environment within high-energy storage rings makes essential the determination of the degree of radiation sensitivity as well as the mechanisms of radiation-induced demagnetization. Sample Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets were irradiated at the Advanced Photon Source with bending magnet X-rays up to an absorbed dose of approximately 280 Mrad (1 Mrad = 10 kGy). Sample magnets were also irradiated with 60Co γ-rays up to an absorbed dose of 700 Mrad at the National Institute of Standards and Technology's standard gamma irradiation facility. Changes in the residual induction were found to be within the experimental uncertainties for both the X-ray and γ-ray irradiations. Sample Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets were then irradiated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Californium User Facility for Neutron Science with fast neutrons up to a total fast fluence of 1.61 × 1014 n/cm2, and with thermal neutrons up to a total thermal fluence of 2.94 × 1012 n/cm2. The fast-neutron irradiation revealed changes between residual induction measurements of the sample magnets before and after irradiation of 0.6% and greater for fast-neutron fluence levels of 2 × 1013 n/cm2 and above. Thermal-neutron irradiation revealed changes in the residual induction measurements of the sample magnets before and after irradiation that were within the experimental uncertainties for thermal-neutron fluence levels up to 3 × 1012 n/cm2. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several sets of group constants for eight different temperatures between 0.1 and 2.5 K in a neutron energy region of 0.1 μeV to 10 eV are generated. A model UCN source of pure liquid 4He is analyzed, in which UCNs are produced by down-scattering of cold neutrons, stored optically by total reflection at the surface, and destroyed by the neutron β-decay only. The following results are obtained: (a) As lowering temperature below about 0.5 K, UCN density exhibits saturation behavior because of no significant up-scattering of UCNs. (b) In addition to single down-scattering of a 1 meV neutron, multiple scattering of a higher-energy neutron contributes largely to UCN production, nearly doubling UCN density.

The high brightness beamlines using undulator radiation are the most sensitive to electron beam oscillations. Therefore, Photon Beam Position Monitors (PBPM) are being built as detectors of beam movement and as references for feedback systems. The PBPM must not be destructive and has to be suitable for continuous usage. Usual storage ring configurations permit a significant part of the radiation coming from the upstream and downstream dipoles to be superimposed with the undulator radiation. A novel detector, based on spectroscopic techniques, has been developed at ELETTRA. It can be tuned on the working energy of the undulator from a few eV to some keV. A detailed description of the detector layout and its working principle is presented. Its performance with respect to the stability requirements of the beam of synchrotron radiation is also analysed. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Detectors; Diagnostics; Electron spectroscopy; Photon; Photon beam position monitors; Synchrotron radiation","Electron beams; Electron spectroscopy; Proton beams; Synchrotron radiation; Photon beam position monitors (PBPM); Radiation detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037147894

The degradation of the response of position-sensitive X-ray tomography detectors in the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak is found after neutron exposure produced by deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium plasma fusion experiments. For the purpose of further detailed characterization of the neutron degradation effects, an azimuthally varying-field (AVF) cyclotron accelerator is employed using well-calibrated neutron fluence. These neutron effects on the detector responses are characterized using synchrotron radiation from a 2.5GeV positron storage ring at the Photon Factory (KEK). The effects of neutrons on X-ray sensitive semiconductor depletion thicknesses are also investigated using an impedance analyser. Novel findings of (i) the dependence of the response degradation on X-ray energies as well as (ii) the recovery of the degraded detector response due to the detector bias application are found and interpreted by systematically combined methods using a synchrotron facility, a cyclotron facility, a fusion plasma device, material analysis methods along with our recent theory on semiconductor X-ray responses. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Radiation Protection, Fachereich Measurements Laboratory, Köpenicker Allee 120-130, 10312 Berlin, Germany","For transport and interim storage of spent fuel elements from power reactors and vitrified highly active waste (HAW) from reprocessing, various types of casks are used. The radiation exposure of the personnel during transportation and storage of these casks is caused by mixed photon-neutron fields and, frequently, the neutron dose is predominant. In operational radiation protection, survey meters and even personal dosemeters with imperfect energy dependence of the dose-equivalent response are used, i.e. the fluence response of the devices does not match the fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion function. In order to achieve more accurate dosimetric information and to investigate the performance of dosemeters, spectrometric investigations of the neutron fields are necessary. Therefore, fluence spectra and dose rates were measured by means of a simple portable Bonner multisphere spectrometer (BSS). The paper describes briefly the experimental set-up and evaluation procedure. Measured spectra for different locations, types of casks and inventory are discussed. The spectra provide a basis to determine dose rates and other integral quantities with higher accuracy and for choosing suitable area monitors, respectively, to establish correction factors applied to the dosemeter reading. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
