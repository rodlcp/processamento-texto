Low-cost aluminum is fed directly to the stack, which produces hydrogen fuel on site, through the Al-H2O reaction. This design is not only cost-efficient, but also eliminates the need for hydrogen storage. Unlike the conventional MFC stacks which generally require complex electrolyte distribution and management, the present Al-feed MFC stack requires only a single electrolyte stream, flowing successively through individual cells, which is finally utilized for hydrogen generation. In this manner, the whole system is greatly simplified while the operational robustness is also improved. With 2 M sodium hydroxide solution as electrolyte and kitchen foil Al as fuel, the present six-cell stack (in series) exhibits an open circuit voltage of nearly 6 V and a peak power density of 180.6 mWcm−2 at room temperature. In addition, an energy density of 1 Whg−1(Al) is achieved, which is quite high and comparable with its proton exchange membrane-based counterparts. Finally, pumpless operation of the present stack, together with its practical applications are successfully demonstrated, including lightening LED lights, driving an electric fan, and cell phone charging. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum-water reaction; Microfluidic fuel cell; Simplified fluid management; Stacking","Aluminum; Electrolytes; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Light emitting diodes; Microbial fuel cells; Microfluidics; Mobile phones; Open circuit voltage; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Aluminum-water reactions; Electrolyte distribution; Fluid management; Microfluidic fuel cell; Peak power densities; Proton exchange membranes; Sodium hydroxide solutions; Stacking; Solid electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997283869

A promising candidate is the lithium-sulfur technology with the potential to increase the energy density of the battery by a factor of 3-5. However, so far the many problems with the lithium-sulfur system have not been solved satisfactory. Here we report on a new approach utilizing a self-standing reduced graphene oxide based aerogel directly as electrodes, i.e. without further processing and without the addition of binder or conducting agents. We can thereby disrupt the common paradigm of ""no battery without binder"" and can pave the way to a lithium-sulfur battery with a high practical energy density. The aerogels are synthesized via a one-pot method and consist of more than 2/3 sulfur, contained inside a porous few-layered reduced graphene oxide matrix. By combining the graphene-based aerogel cathode with an electrolyte and a lithium metal anode, we demonstrate a lithium-sulfur cell with high areal capacity (more than 3 mAh/cm 2 after 75 cycles), excellent capacity retention over 200 cycles and good sulfur utilization. Based on this performance we estimate that the energy density of this concept-cell can significantly exceed the Department of Energy (DEO) 2020-target set for transport applications. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007039838

Drawn by the wide range of services they provide, no upfront costs and 24/7 availability across all personal devices, customers are well-aware of the benefits that these solutions can bring. However, most users tend to forget-or worse ignore-some of the main drawbacks of such cloud-based services, namely in terms of privacy. Data entrusted to these providers can be leaked by hackers, disclosed upon request from a governmental agency's subpoena, or even accessed directly by the storage providers (e.g., for commercial benefits). While there exist solutions to prevent or alleviate these problems, they typically require direct intervention from the clients, like encrypting their data before storing it, and reduce the benefits provided such as easily sharing data between users. This practical experience report studies a wide range of security mechanisms that can be used atop standard cloud-based storage services.

While data corruption stemming from faulty hardware or software is usually covered by those services, it is not the case when the erasure is due to malicious activities from the storage provider itself. Therefore the need for anti-tampering countermeasures needs to be addressed for the customer to feel comfortable enough to use the service. In the context of the SafeCloud project, our goal is to provide an extensible platform to implement and evaluate censorship resistant storage systems for long term storage.

In particular, the harvesting system is composed by an Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC) suitably coupled with an electroacoustic absorber by means of an AC/DC converter. The aims of the proposed work are i) to assess the technical feasibility to compensate the decay voltage via an acoustic harvester; and ii) to evaluate how such compensation can improve the performance of the targeted EDLC. Concerning the first aim, the experimental results show that the required sound pressures to charge the EDLC up to its nominal voltage range from 118 dB up to 122 dB (re. 20 μPa). The EDLC charging times range from couple of hours up to several hours. The charging powers range from few mW up to several tens of mW and the energy efficiency of the whole system ranges from 5% up to 35%. Concerning the second aim of the paper, further experimental results illustrate a non-negligible improvement of the capability of the EDLC to deliver high-pulsed currents. In particular, after compensating the EDLC decay voltage via the proposed acoustic harvester, the rise time required to deliver a high pulse current is even 170% lower than the one obtained without any previous decay voltage compensation. The associated current peak value and root mean square value are 20 % higher. © 2016 IEEE.","Acoustic Energy Harvesting; Dynamic supercapacitors behavior; Redistribution phenomenon; Residual charge; Supercapacitor modeling",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010075930

This technology concentrate a large amount of energy into main spot. To collect all the available energy harvest from the solar panel, a thermal energy storage is required to convert the heat energy to one of the purpose such as electrical energy. With the idea of energy storage application that can be narrow down to commercial application such as cooking stove. Using latent heat type energy storage seem to be appropriate with the usage of phase change material (PCM) that can release and absorb heat energy at nearly constant temperature by changing its state. Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) was selected to use as PCM in this project. This paper focus on the heat loading process and the melting process of the PCM in the energy storage using a computer simulation. The model of the energy storage was created as solid three dimensional modelling using computer aided software and the geometry size of it depend on how much it can apply to boil 1 kg of water in cooking application. The materials used in the tank, heat exchanger and the heat transfer fluid are stainless steel, copper and XCELTHERM MK1, respectively. The analysis was performed using a commercial simulation software in a transient state. The simulation run on different value of velocity but kept controlled under laminar state only, then the relationship of velocity and heat distribution was studied and the melting process of the PCM also has been analyzed. On the effect of heat transfer fluid velocity, the higher the velocity resulted in higher the rate of heat transfer. The comparison between the melting percentages of the PCMs under test conditions show that NaNO3 melts quite faster than KNO3. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Application programs; Computer software; Energy storage; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Melting; Metal melting; Nitrates; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Stainless steel; Thermal load; Three dimensional computer graphics; Velocity; Commercial applications; Constant temperature; Energy storage applications; Heat distribution; Rate of heat transfer; Simulation software; Three dimensional modelling; Transient modelling; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008469169

It converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle braking and coasting to the compression energy. This energy is stored in the storage device called the accumulator. The system is planned to be used on the dual hydro-pneumatic hybrid driveline and applied to a hydraulic hybrid passenger car. The aim of this paper is to find the effect of charging parameters on the storage performance through simulation. Through the storage behaviour, the desirable and optimal sizing of the accumulator can be selected. The paper emphasized on the effect of pressure elevation, pre-charge pressure, effective volume, thermal reaction and required time of the accumulator's charging process. The circuit of charging process has been designed and simulated by using the hydraulic tool in the Automation Studio software. The simulation results were corroborated through the component specification for data rationality. Through the simulation, it was found that pre-charge pressure had a significant effect on the charging process. It determined the efficiency of the effective volume. The higher the pressure elevation, the higher the effective volume. Nevertheless, the more energy required to compress the nitrogen gas in the bladder. Besides, in term of volume displacement, higher volume displacement reduced charging time and lower the fluid temperature. The simulation had been positively highlighted the critical point in charging process which later on, benefited the sizing process in the component selection specification. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Automobiles; Digital storage; Hydraulic accumulators; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Nitrogen; Pneumatics; Specifications; Transportation; Vehicles; Virtual storage; Component selection; Component specification; Compression energy; Effect of pressure; Fluid temperatures; Pre-charge pressures; Storage performance; Volume displacements; Pressure effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008467311

In this report, six polythiophene and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT)-based CRPs with a diethyl terephthalate unit covalently bound to the polymer chain by various linkers have been synthesized and characterized electrochemically. The effects of the choice of polymer backbone and of the nature of the link on the electrochemistry, and in particular the cycling stability of these polymers, are discussed. All CRPs show both the doping of the polymer backbone as well as the redox behavior of the pendent groups and the redox potential of the pendent groups in the CRPs is close to that of corresponding monomer, indicating insignificant interaction between the pendant and the polymer backbone. While all CRPs show various degrees of charge decay upon electrochemical redox conversion, the PEDOT-based CRPs show significantly improved stability compared to the polythiophene counterparts.

This study aims to develop an extended tool known as Probability-Power Pinch Analysis (P-PoPA) using probability theory to simplify the process of Power Pinch Analysis in considering efficiency losses. The method targets for a Hybrid Power System with various current type from generation to demand, generation to storage, or storage to demand. The procedure of the method is illustrated using an electricity-deficit scenario where both AC–DC generation and AC–DC demand are present. The new methodology which adapts the same concept as the Stand-Alone Hybrid System Power Pinch Analysis utilizes data extracted from an ideal (considering no efficiency losses) graphical Power Pinch Analysis and Power Cascade Table and multiplying the extracted data with a probability factor to obtain an estimated target (considering efficiency losses) for the power system. In this study, three design parameters are determined for a system with 208 kW h AC source and 50 kW h DC source and 170 kW h AC demand and 98 kW h DC demand. The external energy that is needed for the system is identified as 38.93 kW h and the energy capacity of energy storage is 42.20 kW h and power capacity of energy storage is 8.79 kW.

Clients arriving at the network are interested in retrieving measurements from an arbitrary set of sensors of some fixed size s. We show that the sensors broadcast measurements according to a phase-type distribution. We determine the probability distribution of the time needed for a client to retrieve s sensor measurements. We provide a closed-form expression for the retrieval time of s sensor measurements for an asymptotically large capacity of the sensor battery or the rate at which energy is harvested. We also analyze numerically the retrieval time of s sensor measurements under various assumptions regarding the battery capacity of the sensors, the energy harvesting and consumption processes. The results provide a lower bound for the energy storage capacity of the sensors for which the retrieval time of measurements is below a targeted level. It is also shown that the ratio between the energy harvesting rate and the broadcasting rate significantly influences the retrieval time of measurements, whereas deploying sensors with large batteries does not significantly reduce the retrieval time of measurements.

Green tea (GT) (Cammellia sinensis) is the most consumed beverage in the world. The potential action mechanisms of GT include anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and lipid-lowering properties. Objective This study analyzed the effects of GT on cardiac remodeling following coronary occlusion in rats. Methods Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control (C), control green tea (GT), myocardial infarction (MI), and myocardial infarction and green tea (MI–GT). GT and MI–GT were fed with standard chow with 0.25% Polyphenon 60 (Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Oakville, ON, Canada). After 3 months of observation, echocardiographic and isolated heart study, oxidative stress, energy metabolism, serum lipids, extracellular matrix, and apoptosis were evaluated. Results GT reduced cardiac hypertrophy and improved systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Concerning oxidative stress, GT reduced protein carbonyl, increased Nrf-2, and restored antioxidant enzyme activity to the control pattern. Energy metabolism was affected by MI that presented with lower fatty acid oxidation and accumulation of triacylglycerol, increased serum lipids, impairment of the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. GT stimulated the glucose pathway and mitochondrial function after MI by increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase, Complex I, ATP synthase, and glycogen storage. In addition, MI changed the extracellular matrix including MMP-2 and TIMP-1 activity and increased apoptosis by 3-caspase, all of which were attenuated by GT. Conclusion GT attenuated cardiac remodeling after MI, associated with improvement in systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Oxidative stress, energy metabolism, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix alterations are all potential mechanisms by which GT may take part. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Antioxidant; Cardiac remodeling; Green tea; Myocardial infarction","carbonyl derivative; caspase 3; gelatinase A; glucose; glycogen; lipid; plant medicinal product; polyphenon 60; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; pyruvate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; transcription factor Nrf2; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; plant extract; tea; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; citric acid cycle; controlled study; diastolic dysfunction; diet supplementation; echocardiography; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; experimental myocardial infarction; extracellular matrix; fatty acid oxidation; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle remodeling; isolated heart; lipid blood level; male; mitochondrion; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; systolic dysfunction; tea; animal; drug effects; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle remodeling; metabolism; Myocardial Infarction; pathophysiology; physiology; Wistar rat; Animals; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tea; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990847685

A microgrid is formed by a set of microsources of electric power, loads and storage elements, which may operate connected or isolated from the main grid. However, since it is based on generators composed of programmable electronic converters, microgrids have usually low short-circuit power what makes them very susceptible to power quality (PQ) problems. This paper presents an analysis of the series operation between passive and active filter connected to an AC microgrid operating isolated from the main grid.

This pre-execution results in prefetch requests that are overwhelmingly accurate (95% in a realistic system configuration for the memory intensive SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks), much more so than a global history buffer (GHB) or stream prefetcher (by 13%/19%). However, we also find that current runahead techniques are very limited in coverage: They prefetch only a small fraction (13%) of all runahead-reachable cache misses. This is because runahead intervals are short and limited by the duration of each full-window stall. In this work, we explore removing the constraints that lead to these short intervals. We dynamically filter the instruction stream to identify the chains of operations that cause the pipeline to stall. These operations are renamed to execute speculatively in a loop and are then migrated to a Continuous Runahead Engine (CRE), a shared multi-core accelerator located at the memory controller. The CRE runs ahead with the chain continuously, increasing prefetch coverage to 70% of runahead-reachable cache misses. The result is a 43.3% weighted speedup gain on a set of memory intensive quad-core workloads and a significant reduction in system energy consumption. This is a 21.9% performance gain over the Runahead Buffer, a state-of-The-Art runahead proposal and a 13.2%/13.5% gain over GHB/stream prefetching. When the CRE is combined with GHB prefetching, we observe a 23.5% gain over a baseline with GHB prefetching alone. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Chains; Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Hardware acceleration; Instruction streams; Memory controller; Performance Gain; Realistic systems; Runahead execution; State of the art; System energy consumption; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009380372

Within a short time their operation can be switched between the different operational regimes thus enhancing the stabilization of the electric grid. These qualities in combination with the operation even at off-design conditions offer a high flexibility to the energy market. However, pump turbines pass through operational regimes where their behaviour becomes unstable. One of these effects occurs when the flowrate is decreased continuously down to a minimum. This point is the physical limitation of the pump operation and is very difficult to predict properly by numerical design without a model test. The purpose of the present study is to identify the fluid mechanical phenomena leading to the occurrence of instabilities of pump turbines in pump mode. A reduced scale model of a ANDRITZ pump turbine was installed on a 4-quadrant test rig for the experimental investigation of unstable conditions in pump mode. The performed measurements are based on the IEC60193-standard. Characteristic measurements at a single guide vane opening were carried out to get a detailed insight into the instabilities in pump mode. The interaction between runner and guide vane was analysed by Particle Image Velocimetry. Furthermore, high-speed visualizations of the suction side part load flow and the suction recirculation were performed. Like never before the flow pattern in the draft tube cone became visible with the help of a high-speed camera by intentionally caused cavitation effects which allow a qualitative view on the flow pattern in the draft tube cone. Suction recirculation is observed in form of single vortices separating from each runner blade and stretching into the draft tube against the main flow direction. To find an explanation for the flow phenomena responsible for the appearance of the unstable head curve also characteristic velocity distributions on the pressure side were combined with high-speed visualizations on the suction side of the pump turbine model. The results enhance the comprehension of the physical background leading to the instability and improve the numerical predictability of the instability in pump mode.",,"Electric load flow; Flow patterns; Fluid mechanics; High speed cameras; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Pumped storage power plants; Pumps; Turbines; Velocity measurement; Visualization; Characteristic measurements; Characteristic velocities; Experimental analysis; Experimental investigations; High-speed visualization; Particle image velocimetries; Reduced scale models; Reversible pump-turbine; Hydraulic turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012071202

This study analyzes the mechanical properties of a solid polymer electrolyte material for structural battery applications by means of reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, conditions for improving load carrying capacity are considered. With the aim of determining optimum salt concentration for mechanical performance, we report the findings on the electrolyte salt effects on the polymer's mechanical properties, including hydrostatic failure behavior. The findings indicate a possibility for stiffness improvement above a threshold concentration value, as well as significant differences in isotropic compression and expansion failure behavior. In isotropic expansion and shear, small failure strength and failure strain reduction at increasing salt concentration is observed. In hydrostatic compression no material failure is observed up to 10 GPa.

Furthermore, these microgrids may operate in islanded mode for short periods in which energy balance is important. This paper proposes a fast control method to control domestic assets in an islanded microgrid by means of 2-way communication and local measurement data. By using the potential of domestic assets, required capacity of backup storage and power ratings of backup generators can be decreased and/or the operation time of the islanded microgrid can be increased.

As one of the promising solutions, energy cooperatives have recently drawn attention. Unlike most of the existing proposed strategies (e.g., storage), there is not much known yet about the practical importance of energy cooperatives. Taking a data-driven approach, we quantify the power variability reduction (which we also call the reliability gain) for three neighborhood level types of cooperatives: energy generation, energy demand, and energy prosumer. We show how the reliability is scaled by the size of coalition and the time scale for these three energy cooperatives. We gain several interesting insights which are vital for designing and planning neighborhood level energy cooperatives. For example, we find that energy demand cooperatives have the largest reliability gain among all. Using the central limit theorem asymptotic results, we show that the demand energy variations up to 15 minutes of different homes are almost independent of each other. We also find that small coalitions of sizes 10 and 20, respectively, for energy demand and energy prosumer cooperatives are sufficient to capture most of the reliability gain of the grand coalition. For the special case of energy generation cooperatives, our results differ from an existing empirical study (in the context of geographical diversity) at a different location, suggesting that designing an efficient energy generation cooperative is jurisdiction-dependent. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Smart power grids; Asymptotic results; Central Limit Theorem; Data-driven approach; Empirical studies; Energy generations; Energy variations; Power variability; Practical importance; Reliability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010190087

We investigated the impact of nanoconfinement in carbon scaffolds on the hydrogen and ammonia release properties of LiNH2 and its catalytic activity in NH3 decomposition. Ammonia release from macrocrystalline LiNH2 begins at 350°C, while confined LiNH2 releases ammonia from below 100°C under helium flow. This ammonia release consisted of 30.5 wt % ammonia in the first cycle and was found to be partially reversible. Above 300°C, hydrogen is also released due to an irreversible reaction between LiNH2 and the carbon support to form Li2NCN. Ni-doped LiNH2/C nanocomposites were active in the catalytic decomposition of ammonia into N2 and H2 with 53% conversion at 400°C and a gas hourly space velocity of 13000 h-1. This is comparable to the performance of a commercial-type Ru-based catalyst where 79% conversion is observed under the same conditions. This work demonstrates that nanoconfinement is effective for improving the functionality of LiNH2. The versatility of this system offers promise in a number of different areas including hydrogen/ammonia storage and ammonia decomposition catalysis.

C. suppressalis substantially reduces rice yields in temperate regions of Asia, but little is known about how rice plants defend themselves against this herbivore at molecular and biochemical level. Results: In the current study, we combined next-generation RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques to investigate the changes in gene expression and in metabolic processes in rice plants that had been continuously fed by C. suppressalis larvae for different durations (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h). Furthermore, the data were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. There were 4,729 genes and 151 metabolites differently regulated when rice plants were damaged by C. suppressalis larvae. Further analyses showed that defense-related phytohormones, transcript factors, shikimate-mediated and terpenoid-related secondary metabolism were activated, whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed by C. suppressalis feeding. The activated defense was fueled by catabolism of energy storage compounds such as monosaccharides, which meanwhile resulted in the increased levels of metabolites that were involved in rice plant defense response. Comparable analyses showed a correspondence between transcript patterns and metabolite profiles. Conclusion: The current findings greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of induced defense response in rice plants against C. suppressalis infestation at molecular and biochemical levels, and will provide clues for development of insect-resistant rice varieties. © 2016 The Author(s).","Amino acids; Carbohydrates; Induced response; Next generation sequencing; Oryza sativa; Phenylpropanoids; Phytohormones; Plant-insect interactions; Terpenoids","phytohormone; plant protein; transcriptome; animal; genetics; metabolism; metabolome; moth; Oryza; parasitology; physiology; plant stem; Animals; Metabolome; Moths; Oryza; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Proteins; Plant Stems; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002328224

Nanosheets are defined by their molecular thickness and large lateral dimensions, which typically differ by 2–5 orders of magnitude. They exhibit a wide range of interesting properties, e.g., flexibility, transparency, semiconductivity, photosensitivity, photocatalytic activity, redox properties, a large specific surface area and a high chemical stability. A large and growing library of metal oxide and hydroxide nanosheet compositions is available from the literature. Moreover, the easy control over nanosheet composition via modification of the layered parent compound provides many opportunities for introducing and optimizing their functional properties.

Changes in lifestyle such as increased physical activity and a healthy diet can be crucial tools for treating obesity. Intake of rose hip, the fruit of several plants belonging to the Rosaceae family, has been shown to reduce body fat mass and prevent body weight gain. Thus, the aim of the study was to elucidate potential mechanisms through which rose hip inhibit diet-induced obesity. Methods: C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high fat diet with (RH) or without (CTR) rose hip supplementation for three months. In vivo indirect calorimetry was monitored, as well as gene expression and protein levels of different adipose depots. Results: Although no differences in energy intake were found compared to the CTR group, RH prevented body weight gain and lowered blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol levels. Indirect calorimetry showed that RH-fed mice have significantly higher EE during the dark phase, despite comparable voluntary activity. Moreover, when challenged with treadmill running, RH-fed mice exhibited higher metabolic rate. Therefore, we hypothesized that RH could stimulate the brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity or may induce browning of the white adipose tissue (WAT). Compared to the CTR group, gene expression and protein levels of some brown and ""brite""markers, together with genes able to promote brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis (such as ucp1, tbx15, bmp7, and cidea), as well as phosphorylation of AMPK, was increased in WAT (but not in BAT) of RH-fed mice. Conclusions: Taken together these results indicate that dietary rose hip prevents body weight gain by increasing whole body EE and inducing browning of WAT. Thus, it has potential therapeutic implication for treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. © 2016 The Author(s)","Browning; Diet; Energy expenditure; Obesity; Rose hip","cholesterol; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; osteogenic protein 1; uncoupling protein 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bmp7 gene; brown adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; C57BL 6 mouse; caloric intake; cell differentiation; cholesterol blood level; cidea gene; controlled study; diet induced obesity; diet supplementation; energy expenditure; enzyme phosphorylation; gene; gene expression; glucose blood level; in vivo study; indirect calorimetry; insulin blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; metabolic disorder; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; Rosaceae; rose hip; tbx15 gene; thermogenesis; treadmill exercise; treatment duration; ucp1 gene; weight gain; white adipose tissue browning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000981885

In order to develop the proposed method, these experiments aim at obtaining cell surface overshoot in temperature profiles consequent upon current discharge impulses that are used as reference inputs. A set of dedicated experimental validations is included in this paper to verify the accuracy of the proposed method for different states of health of the cell and environmental conditions. The results show an error in the temperature prediction of <1.8% in the entire predicted temperature subject to generic current discharge profiles as well as a negligible error on the predicted peak temperature.

The large-scale integration of EVs into power grid brings both challenges and opportunities to the system performance. On one hand, the load demand from EV charging imposes a heavey impact on the stability and efficiency of power grid. On the other hand, EVs could potentially act as mobile energy storage systems to improve the power network performance, such as load flattening, fast frequency control, and facilitating renewable energy integration. Evidently, uncontrolled EV charging could lead to inefcient power network operation or even security issues. This has spurred on enormous research interest in designing charging coordination mechanisms. A key design challenge here lies in the lack of complete knowledge of events that occur in the future. Indeed, the amount of knowledge of future events signifcantly impacts the design of efcient charging control algorithms. This article focuses on introducing online EV charging scheduling techniques that deal with di?erent degrees of uncertainty and randomness of future knowledge. In addition, we highlight the promising future research directions for EV charging control. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Charging (batteries); Data storage equipment; Electric network analysis; Scheduling algorithms; Vehicle-to-grid; Coordination mechanisms; Design challenges; Energy storage systems; Environment friendly; Future research directions; Renewable energy integrations; Research interests; Scheduling techniques; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012973898

Reliable information about the energy output has arisen only in recent years; however, it is still not easily accessible, and sometimes its sources are closed. Despite these facts, solar energy researchers, observers and designers devote special attention to this type of SAC systems. In this study, performance evaluation is performed for the PV-SAC technology, in which low-power (up to 15 kWp of cooling power on average) systems are used. Such a system contains a PV electric-driven compression chiller with cold and heat sensible thermal storage capacities, and a rejected energy unit used for preheating domestic hot water (DHW). In a non-cooling season, it is possible to partly employ the system in the reverse mode for DHW production. In this mode, the ambient air serves as a heat source.

This work is to investigate the dynamic performance of a heat pump system directly driven by a wind turbine. The heat demand of a detached single family house was simulated in details. According to the simulations, the wind turbine is not able to provide the electricity demanded bythe heat pump all the time due to the intermittent characteristic of wind power. To solve it, an electric energy storage system was included. Obviously, increasingthe size of battery can always reduce the probability of load loss. However, different from the energy storage system, increasing the capacity of wind turbines is not necessary to reducethe probability of load loss instead, due to the different start-up speedsfor different capacities of wind turbines. In order to maximize the system benefit, it is of great importance to optimize the capacity of the wind turbine and the size of the energy storage system simultaneously based on dynamic simulations. © 2016 The Authors.","dynamic performance; heat pump; probability of load loss; space heating; standalone system; wind power","Climate change; Computer aided software engineering; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heating; Loss of load probability; Mechanisms; Probability; Pumps; Space heating; Wind power; Wind turbines; Building sectors; Dynamic performance; Electric energies; Energy storage systems; Heat pumps; Reducing energy consumption; Single-family house; Standalone systems; Electric load loss",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010867702

One problem occurring after storage is premature degreening of disk florets. We want to understand the physiological background of disk floret degreening in order to allow breeding against sensitivity to degreening. Disk floret degreening occurs in two steps: first, there is loss of green colour resulting in yellowing, and after that, disk florets turn brown. Sucrose feeding after storage prevents disk floret degreening. Pulsing flower stems with potassium chloride with the same osmolarity compared to the sucrose treatment did not have an effect on degreening. Therefore, the effect of sucrose did not seem to be osmotic but related to energy metabolism. Because of this relation with carbohydrate metabolism, we hypothesized that genotypic differences are explained by their carbohydrate content during the postharvest phase. However, the carbohydrate content of a sensitive and insensitive genotype did not explain these genotypic differences. The sensitive genotype showed higher carbohydrate content during the postharvest phase compared to the insensitive genotype. Our results indicate that storage induced disk floret browning is caused by carbohydrate starvation, but genotypic differences are probably explained by a difference in sensitivity to carbohydrate starvation. © 2016, International Society for Horticultural Science.

Glycogen synthesis is regulated by Protein Targeting to Glycogen (PTG), a member of specific glycogen-binding subunits of protein phosphatase-1 (PPP1). It positively regulates glycogen synthesis through de-phosphorylation of both glycogen synthase (activation) and glycogen phosphorylase (inactivation). In cultured astrocytes, PTG mRNA levels were previously shown to be enhanced by the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. To achieve further insight into the role of PTG in the regulation of astrocytic glycogen, its levels of expression were manipulated in primary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of tagged-PTG or siRNA to downregulate its expression. Infection of astrocytes with adenovirus led to a strong increase in PTG expression and was associated with massive glycogen accumulation (>100 fold), demonstrating that increased PTG expression is sufficient to induce glycogen synthesis and accumulation. In contrast, siRNA-mediated downregulation of PTG resulted in a 2-fold decrease in glycogen levels. Interestingly, PTG downregulation strongly impaired long-term astrocytic glycogen synthesis induced by insulin or noradrenaline. Finally, these effects of PTG downregulation on glycogen metabolism could also be observed in cultured astrocytes isolated from PTG-KO mice. Collectively, these observations point to a major role of PTG in the regulation of glycogen synthesis in astrocytes and indicate that conditions leading to changes in PTG expression will directly impact glycogen levels in this cell type. © 2016 The Authors","Glia; Glucose metabolism; Insulin; Noradrenaline","calcein; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; glycogen synthase; insulin; messenger RNA; noradrenalin; phosphoprotein phosphatase 1; protein; protein targeting to glycogen; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; adenovirus infection; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; astrocyte; controlled study; dephosphorylation; down regulation; gene overexpression; genetic transfection; glucose metabolism; glycogen synthesis; immunofluorescence microscopy; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; protein targeting; Western blotting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006274462

These new designs created a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) behavior, where the performance and energy consumption of memory accesses depend on the place where the data is located in the memory hierarchy. Accesses to local caches or memory controllers are generally more efficient than accesses to remote ones. A common way to improve the locality and balance of memory accesses is to determine the mapping of threads to cores and data to memory controllers based on the affinity between threads and data. Such mapping techniques can operate at different hardware and software levels, which impacts their complexity, applicability, and the resulting performance and energy consumption gains. In this article, we introduce a taxonomy to classify different mapping mechanisms and provide a comprehensive overview of existing solutions. © 2016 ACM.","Cache memories; Communication; Data mapping; NUMA; Shared memory; Survey; Thread mapping","Buffer storage; Communication; Controllers; Energy utilization; Mapping; Memory architecture; Surveying; Data mappings; Hardware and software; Non uniform memory access; NUMA; Shared memory; Shared memory architecture; Shared memory system; Thread level parallelism; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005949183

Szafrana 2, Zielona Góra, 65-516, Poland","A dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is used in a power distribution system to protect sensitive loads against voltage disturbances. The commonly used DVR system contains a converter with direct current (DC) link and energy storage elements. The DC energy storage part of the system is the most expensive element and has a large value. As an alternative, therefore, DVR systems can use alternating current AC/AC converters without DC energy storage. This paper presents the properties of a DVR system based on a direct matrix converter using three control methods: in-phase, pre-sag, and energy-optimal. The paper defines basic mathematical relationships and static characteristics and describes the range of voltage compensation by use of the described compensation methods. Simulation results are obtained and presented in order to verify the correctness of the compensation. The features of such a DVR system configuration are considered in the context of alternative applications for commonly used converters with DC-link energy storage power converters. Application of the matrix converter in electrical power systems is still not very popular, due to limited output voltage and the complex structure and process control. This article is an attempt to show the usefulness of the matrix converter in spite of its limitations and the complexity of the design. © The Author(s) 2016.","Dynamic voltage restorer; matrix converter; voltage sag compensation","AC-AC power converters; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Matrix converters; Power converters; Voltage regulators; Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR); Electrical power system; Mathematical relationship; Power distribution system; Static characteristic; Voltage compensation; Voltage disturbances; Voltage sag compensation; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000399365

RE or EV can cause voltage unbalance and low power factor when it injects or absorbs real power from the network. The energy storage system can be connected to the network to manipulate the power flow from or to those devices with the use of reactive power as a complementary support, hence correcting the voltage unbalance and power factor effectively without wasting any generated energy. To be able to correct the voltage unbalance and power factor effectively under the intermittent power of RE and EV, a novel fuzzy controller is developed and implemented in the energy storage to manipulate the flow of real and reactive power between the energy storage and the network based on the network conditions. The fuzzy controller is able to reduce any voltage excursions with the use of real and reactive power from the energy storage, hence reducing the voltage unbalance and improving the power factor. Numerous experiments have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller. The experimental results show that the voltage unbalance and power factors are constantly maintained below the thresholds under the high intermittent power output of the photovoltaic systems. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Fuzzy controller; Power factor; Renewable energy; Voltage unbalance","Controllers; Data storage equipment; Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Electric machine control; Electric power factor; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Low power electronics; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Distributed energy storages; Energy storage systems; Fuzzy controllers; Integration of renewable energies; Power factors; Real and reactive power; Renewable energies; Voltage unbalances; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996644316

One well-established pinch analysis that has been used in power systems design and optimisation is called Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA). In PoPA, both graphical and numerical approaches have provided an insight on the systematic approach to target and design various power systems. By only visualising the minimum amount of outsource energy required by the power system, the graphical PoPA method as a whole does not show the purchasing of outsource energy based on the exact time intervals. Using graphical PoPA, the objective of this study is to determine a proper strategy to buy and sell outsource electricity to improve the overall performance of a hybrid power system comprising renewable power generators and energy storage system. The strategies are made based on three design parameters: energy-related capacity, power-related capacity of energy storage and maximum grid power rating between centralised grid and hybrid power system. While deciding on the best strategy and heuristics to be implemented, the effects on system operation and economy are indirectly analysed. It is experimented that the output can benefit electricity consumers or producers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electricity; Hybrid power system; Optimisation; Power Pinch Analysis","Electricity; Optimization; Sales; Capacity of energies; Electricity consumers; Energy storage systems; Hybrid power systems; Numerical approaches; Optimisations; Pinch analysis; Supply side managements; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996587285

The occurrence of cell division in storage cells is particularly interesting in light of the important role that these cells play in the physiology of tardigrades. We present data on the occurrence of mitosis in storage cells of the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer (Richters, 1903), and analyse mitotic cells in relation to different body characteristics, including egg development stage, moulting, gut content, body length, number and size of oocytes, and shape and size of the storage cells. Mitosis was present in ~20% of all animals, and was more frequent in juveniles than in adults. The proportion of cells with mitosis (‘mitotic index’) was low: 0.76% in juveniles and 1.47% in adults. In juveniles, none of the measured phenotypic characters had significant predictive power for mitosis, whereas in adult animals in moult or in late egg developmental or post-laying stage were more likely to have mitotic storage cells. The association with the later part of the moulting process was particularly strong. The low mitotic index and the strong association with moulting suggests that mitosis in storage cells may be connected with somatic growth rather than cell renewal, and that the purpose of cell division may relate to a need of more cells to support the enlarged body after moulting. However, the specific life cycle of tardigrades, where energy intake and depletion, egg development, and moulting is highly intertwined and synchronized, make conclusions about the functional role of mitosis in storage cells difficult, however, and more studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms inducing mitosis in these interesting cells. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","cell division; coelomocytes; development; mitotic index; moulting; tardigrada",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996558105

ESR experiments were performed at low and high temperatures (130–400 K) to examine the characteristic properties of the radical intermediates that are produced in ampicillin by gamma radiation treatment. Unirradiated ampicillin presented no ESR signal but irradiated samples exhibited ESR spectra with four resonance peaks spread over a magnetic field range of 8 mT. The spectral parameters of the central resonance line of the spectrum are g = 2.0044 and ΔHpp = 0.08 mT. An exponential growth function of the applied dose was found to describe best the experimental dose–response data and it was found that ampicillin did not exhibit the feature of a good dosimetric material as its ESR intensity was relatively weak even for the samples irradiated at high level of doses. Gmean value of gamma-irradiated ampicillin was found to be 4.6 ± 0.9 × 10−9mol/J, which is very small compared to irradiated alanine solid sample. However, the discrimination of irradiated ampicillin from unirradiated one was possible even ∼3 months after storage at normal conditions. The simulation calculations indicated that gamma irradiation created two different radical species in solid ampicillin. Decay activation energy of the radical species which is mostly responsible from central intense resonance line is calculated to be 55.6 ± 3.2 kJ/mol by using the signal intensity decay data derived from annealing studies. It was concluded that ampicillin could be sterilized by gamma radiation and ESR spectroscopy can be used as a potential technique to monitor its radiosterilization process. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ampicillin; Electron spin resonance; radiation sterilization","Activation energy; Amino acids; Digital storage; Dosimetry; Electrons; Electrospinning; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Magnetic moments; Paramagnetic resonance; Radiation; Resonance; Spin dynamics; Sterilization (cleaning); ampicillin; Characteristic properties; Irradiated samples; Potential techniques; Radiation sterilization; Radiation treatments; Simulation calculation; Spectral parameters; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996553630

Here, we construct a rechargeable Ni/Zn battery with a Co-doped Ni(OH)2 (CNH) and Zn materials on nickel nanowire arrays (NNA) for electrodes. The CNH cathodic material can be electrochemically deposited onto the NNA, which can deliver a high capacity of 346 mA h g−1 at current density of 5 A g−1. Co doping can effectively stabilize Ni(OH)2 with only ~10% capacity loss over 5 000 charge/discharge cycles at 30 A g−1. For anode, the design of Zn on NNA considerably lowers the risk of corrosion and dendrite form ation. As a result, ultrafast rechargeable Ni/Zn batteries are obtained, exhibiting a cell voltage of ~1.75 V, energy density of 148.54 Wh kg−1 (4.05 Wh L−1) and power density of 1.725 kW kg−1 (based on the mass of active materials) with a charging time of &lt;1 min.

To this aim, a focused experimental campaign consisting in high-temperature/high-pressure oedometric tests has been carried out. The results show that the thermo-mechanical volume change behaviour of Opalinus Clay is heavily affected by the OCR: thermal expansion is found when the heating is carried out at high OCR, whereas irreversible thermal compaction is observed when heat is applied at a vertical effective stress that is sufficiently close to the vertical effective yield stress. The study of the thermal cyclic behaviour shows that expansive irreversible strains can occur upon first heating at high OCR and that a reversible behaviour follows during subsequent thermal cycles. The experimental results reveal an impact of temperature on yielding: a decrease in the yield threshold is detected when compression is applied at high temperature with respect to the yield threshold found at low temperature. Compressibility and swelling indexes are not significantly influenced by thermal changes, as well as the oedometric modulus and the secondary compression coefficient, whereas consolidation processes are found to occur faster at high temperature.

This paper investigates the optimal design and operation of distributed energy systems as well as optimal heating network layouts for different economic and environmental objectives. A mixed integer linear programming model was used for multi-objective optimisation to minimize total cost and carbon emissions. Improvements include the coupling of equipment and network modelling across many buildings, detailed CHP operational constraints, the inclusion of network heat losses, and improved modelling of thermal storage. The model was used on a case study consisting of eleven residential buildings and one commercial building for various design scenarios (available technologies, network layout limitations, operating constraints). Design results (capacities, network layouts) and operational results (energy supply breakdowns) are presented. The results show that district heating can deliver emissions savings of 23% over a standard solution for the same cost. The optimal number of heating network links increases as more stringent carbon emissions targets are implemented. Limits on possible network routes have significant impacts on the optimal technology capacities and on operational schedules.

In particular, we calculate incremental gross value added (GVA), employment and import dependency impacts of two such low-carbon power production portfolios for the Netherlands. We combine technology specific techno-economic bottom-up data with a macro-economic multi-regional Input-Output-Table containing high sectoral detail. For the total economy, we find the differences between these scenarios to be small. Still, gross value added, and employment are lower under the CCS-inclusive strategy, while import dependency is higher. For the power sector, the differences between the scenarios are, however, considerable. Furthermore, our analysis shows that also for other sectors the differences between the scenarios could be large.

In this work, GO was solvothermally reduced in the presence of imidazolium-based poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) of poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) to produce a PIL-modified reduced GO (PIL-rGO) composite. The integration of PILs with rGO is capable of preventing the restacking of rGO sheets, and hence, providing a large electrolyte ion-accessible surface and an abundant interior space for charge storage by enlarging the interlayer spacing in PIL-rGO. The PIL-rGO composite was then used as the supercapacitor electrode associated with a compatible IL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte. The PIL herein improves the interface wettability between the electrode and electrolyte, and the IL electrolyte enables a wide potential window as well. Specific capacitances correspond to 196 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, 160 F/g at 2 A/g, and 144.8 F/g at a scan rate of 60 mV/s, which are much higher than those (104 F/g at 2 A/g, and 48.1 F/g at 60 mV/s) of pure rGO. The capacitance retention is as high as 80.7% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a discharge current density of 2 A/g. The interfacial charge-transfer resistance of the PIL-rGO electrode (4.6 Ω) is also much lower than that of the rGO electrode (18.7 Ω).

The main quality parameters of the concentrates were comparatively investigated after reconstitution with different storage times and temperatures. The parameters investigated were: color, turbidity, pH, titratable acidity, anthocyanin content, percent polymeric color, antioxidant activity, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and volatile profile. The anthocyanin content, volatile content and turbidity values of osmotically distillated samples were found to be higher than those of the thermal concentrates. Neither HMF nor furfural was detected in the samples soon after the processing; however, levels of process contaminants were found to increase gradually throughout the storage period in both concentrates. Thermal evaporation resulted in markedly higher HMF and furfural formation in comparison to the osmotic distillation process. The anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of the concentrates decreased, whereas polymeric color ratio and turbidity values increased within longer storage time and higher storage temperature. Industrial relevance Concentration is one of the key steps affects the chemical and physical properties of black mulberry juice since black mulberry phytochemicals, mainly anthocyanins, are labile to heat treatment and storage. Thermal evaporation has some drawbacks such as loss of fresh juice flavors, color degradation, reduction of nutritional value and formation of mutagenic compounds such as HMF and furfural. These drawbacks require alternative methods that involve minimal processing.

The work uses real-world household energy consumption data (measurements) as the input to a household energy consumption model. The model maximizes household self-sufficiency, by minimizing the amount of electricity purchased from the grid, and thereby also maximizing the level of self-consumption of PV electricity, i.e., the amount of PV-generated electricity that is consumed in-house. This is done for different combinations of PV installation sizes (measured in array-to-load ratio; ALR: ratio of the PV capacity to the average annual electric load of a household) and battery capacities for different categories of single-family dwellings in Sweden (i.e., northern latitudes). The modeling includes approximately 2000 households (buildings). The results show that the use of batteries with capacities within the investigated range, i.e., 0.15–100 kW h, can increase the level of self-consumption by a practical maximum of 20–50 percentage points (depending on the load profile of the household) compared to not using a battery. As an example, for a household with an annual electricity consumption of 20 MW h and a PV installation of 7 kWp, this range in increased self-consumption of PV-generated electricity requires battery capacities in the range of 15–24 kW h (actual usable capacity), depending on the load profile of the specific household. The practical maximum range is determined by the seasonality of PV generation at Swedish latitudes, i.e., higher levels of increased self-consumption are possible, however, it would require substantially larger batteries than the up to 100 kW h investigated in this work. Thus, any additional marginal increment in battery capacity beyond the range investigated results in a low level of utilization and poor additional value. Furthermore, our results reveal that when a battery is used to store PV-generated electricity in-house, self-sufficiency increases (as compared to not using a battery) by 12.5–30 percentage points for the upper range of the investigated PV capacities (ALR of 6). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Households; Self-consumption; Self-sufficiency; Solar photovoltaics","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Annual electricity consumption; Household energy consumption; Households; Northern latitudes; Percentage points; Self-consumption; Self-sufficiency; Solar photovoltaics; Electric power generation; energy use; household energy; installation; photovoltaic system; residential energy; seasonality; self sufficiency; solar power; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984942539

Other developments, like in-home storage or peer-to-peer exchange within a neighbourhood, also contribute to the transition. This paper explores the emerging rise of these prosumers of electricity and its implications, in particular for grid management and electricity supply in the Netherlands. Methods: With the help of an agent-based model, we illustrate the evolution of prosumption in a small Dutch-oriented residential community in five scenarios. The second part of the paper discusses the implications of the modelled rise in prosumption. Results: Depending on the number of prosumers, combined with storage and peer-to-peer supply, we found a share of prosumption in this local community of about 28–30 %. The community will require less electricity from the central power plants. These model results also indicate that the management of the local network will become more important if more households become prosumers in combination with storage and peer-to-peer supply. Conclusions: These trends affect current business models of DSOs and electricity production and supply companies. The latter are facing a loss of turnover which needs to be compensated by developing alternative business models. And, DSOs have to deal with the new needs on the local grid which also require an adaptation of their business models. Developing business models in cooperation with local energy communities could be an attractive alternative to explore. © 2016, The Author(s).","Business models; DSO; Electricity production companies; Electricity supply companies; Peer-to-peer; Prosumption; Residential storage","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Digital instruments; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Business models; Electricity production; Electricity supply; Peer to peer; Prosumption; Peer to peer networks; business; economic analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy conservation; energy use; model test; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; residential energy; sustainability; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983628375

Ex R. E. Fries) is an oilseed with the potential for cultivation in Brazil as a source of renewable energy in areas with tropical conditions. Crambe oil contains erucic acid, giving it economic importance for use in the electricity sector. Crambe oil can be used in insulating fluids and in the manufacture of chemical products and biodiesel without competing with human food production. As it is a new crop in Brazil, the scientific literature on crambe is still scarce. This review discusses general aspects of agricultural production and the potential applications of crambe associated mainly with the manufacture of biodiesel. The topics discussed in this review include: (i) genetic improvement of crambe; (ii) agronomic practices of production, pests, diseases, harvesting, storage, and economic viability; (iii) industrial use of crambe oil as an electrical insulator and in biodiesel; (iv) detoxification of the co-product generated during oil extraction for use in animal feed and use of the co-product in the natural bioremediation of contaminants; and (v) the challenges of increasing crambe production. Crambe has a remarkable future as a source of renewable energy in Brazil. Strategies to boost its cultivation, such as the identification of improved varieties and optimization of production system logistics, marketing, and resource allocation, should be adopted. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Brassicaceae; Crambe abyssinica; Energy crops; Renewable energy","Agriculture; Biodiesel; Bioremediation; Crops; Cultivation; Data mining; Detoxification; Economics; Fatty acids; Fuel storage; Oils and fats; Oilseeds; Agricultural productions; Brassicaceae; Crambe abyssinica; Electrical insulators; Energy crops; Genetic improvements; Renewable energies; Scientific literature; Manufacture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982179146

However, recent research has shown that the adoption of deployment policies carries the potential of locking in the technology that is most cost-effective at the point of policy introduction, but may be inefficient in the long term. The present paper contributes to the emerging literature on the role of deployment policies in creating path-dependency and eventually technology lock-in. While previous studies focused on the relationship between lock-in and the technology-specificity of deployment policies, this paper introduces a new factor: the existence of multiple applications for a technology. We argue that this factor is highly relevant for technological lock-in and should be considered by policy makers. To support our argument, we simulate the competition among four stationary battery technologies across energy system applications in an investment simulation model. This simulation shows that the degree of competition among technologies differs strongly across applications, which corresponds with a highly varying lock-in probability. Hence, selecting applications in deployment policies very likely corresponds to selecting technologies. We discuss the implications of these results for both policy makers and for the academic debate on deployment policies and technological lock-in as well as on technology assessment and governance more generally. Based on the notion that policies can have different technology-specificity levels, we develop the idea of the application-specificity of policies and provide examples of currently enacted deployment policies that vary in terms of their technology and application specificity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Energy storage; Multi-purpose technology; Path-dependency; Techno-economic model; Technological lock-in; Technology policy","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economics; Energy storage; Investments; Lock-in; Multi-purpose; Path dependency; Techno-economic model; Technology policy; Locks (fasteners)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979655985

Previous studies mostly used a gross evaporation approach for water footprint assessment where all the evaporation is attributed to hydropower. They fail to consider both evapotranspiration before the dam construction, which should be deducted from the footprint, and the seasonal storage dynamics of water. These considerations are critical for assessing reservoir impacts on water scarcity using temporally explicit water stress indices. This study seeks to fill this gap: we calculate the water footprints of ∼1500 hydropower plants which cover 43% of the global annual hydroelectricity generation. Apart from reduced water availability, alterations of the flow regime can also adversely affect ecosystems. Therefore, environmental flow requirements are also analysed. This novel approach for the water footprint assessment of hydropower indicates that previous studies mostly overrated the impacts of hydropower on water scarcity, often because reservoirs store water in periods of low scarcity and release water during months of high water scarcity. By contrast, flow alterations generally affect the environment more than water consumption. Since impacts vary broadly among plants, plant-specific evaluations are necessary. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental flow requirements; Life cycle assessment; Renewable energy; Water scarcity","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Water supply; Environmental flow; Hydroelectricity generation; Hydropower plants; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Water availability; Water scarcity; Reservoirs (water); dam construction; electricity generation; energy resource; evapotranspiration; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; life cycle analysis; renewable resource; resource scarcity; water availability; water footprint; water stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979239799

When one turbine sheds its load, the other turbines in the same hydraulic unit become overloaded and may shed their loads, which is referred to as a “one-after-another (OAA)” load-shedding process. An extremely high water-hammer pressure (WHP), namely, high spiral case pressure (SCP) or low draft tube pressure (DTP), may arise in this case, directly threatening the safety of the PSS. The objective of this study was to theoretically determine the hydraulic connections between the turbines and reveal the mechanism of the rapid rise in the WHP under the OAA load-shedding conditions. Theoretical derivations inferred that the drastic pressure changes in a trail shedding turbine (TST) are caused by the hydraulic connection with the lead shedding turbine (LST) in the S region. Furthermore, numerical simulations and model experiments were performed for the OAA load-shedding process, which confirmed the validity of the theoretical analysis. Finally, an analysis was conducted on the distribution of the water inertia in the upstream and downstream branch pipes, and engineering measures were proposed to guarantee the safe operation of PSS systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Hydraulic connection; Model test; OAA load shedding; Pump-turbine; Pumped-storage station; Transient pressure","Electric power plant loads; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulic turbines; Pumped storage power plants; Rivers; Solar energy; Turbines; Water hammer; Hydraulic connection; Load-shedding; Model tests; Pump-turbines; Pumped storage station; Transient pressures; Electric load shedding; experimental study; hydraulics; model validation; power plant; pressure effect; probability; solar power; testing method; turbine; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976257608

Assembly of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles under a magnetic field could lead to highly ordered superstructures, providing distinctive magnetic properties. In this work, a low-cost fabrication technique was demonstrated to assemble sub-20-nm iron oxide nanoparticles into crystalline superstructures under an in-plane magnetic field. The gradient of the applied magnetic field contributes to the anisotropic formation of micron-sized superstructures. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field promotes the alignment of magnetic moments of the nanoparticles. The strong dipole-dipole interactions between the neighboring nanoparticles lead to a close-packed pattern as an energetically favorable configuration. Rod-shaped and spindle-shaped superstructures with uniform size and controlled spacing were obtained using spherical and polyhedral nanoparticles, respectively. The arrangement and alignment of the superstructures can be tuned by changing the experimental conditions. The two types of superstructures both show enhancement of coercivity and saturation magnetization along the applied field direction, which is presumably associated with the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic dipole interactions of the constituent nanoparticles and the increased shape anisotropy of the superstructures.

In this work we utilized the well-controlled structure copper wires, originated from AAO template. Such well controlled structure offer better capacitance values due to easily excess of ions to the surface of wires. Performance of material was check in 3 M of potassium hydroxide (KOH). Specific capacitance (Cs) was calculated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Charge discharge (CDC) test. The capacitance calculate on base on CV at 25 mV/s was 101.37 F/g while CDC showed the capacitance of 90 F/g at 2 A/g. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006004140

The used GEM detector has one-dimensional, 128 channel readout structure. The channels are connected to the radiation-hard electronics with configurable analog stage and fast ADCs, supporting speeds of 125 MSPS for each channel. The digitalized data is sent directly to the FPGAs using fast serial links. The preprocessing algorithms are implemented in the FPGAs, with the data buffering made in the on-board 2Gb DDR3 memory chips. After the algorithmic stage, the data is sent to the Intel Xeon-based PC for further postprocessing using PCI-Express link Gen 2. For connection of multiple FPGAs, PCI-Express switch 8-to-1 was designed. The whole system can support up to 2048 analog channels. The scope of the work is an FPGA-based implementation of the recorder of the raw signal from GEM detector. Since the system will work in a very challenging environment (neutron radiation, intense electro-magnetic fields), the registered signals from the GEM detector can be corrupted. In the case of the very intense hot plasma radiation (e.g. laser generated plasma), the registered signals can overlap. Therefore, it is valuable to register the raw signals from the GEM detector with high number of events during soft X-ray radiation. The signal analysis will have the direct impact on the implementation of photon energy computation algorithms. As the result, the system will produce energy spectra and topological distribution of soft X-ray radiation. The advanced software was developed in order to perform complex system startup and monitoring of hardware units. Using the array of two one-dimensional GEM detectors it will be possible to perform tomographic reconstruction of plasma impurities radiation in the SXR region.","Computing (architecture, farms, GRID for recording, storage, archiving, and distribution of data); Micropattern gaseous detectors (MSGC, GEM, THGEM, RETHGEM, MHSP, MICROPIC, MICROMEGAS, In-Grid, etc); Modular electronics; Plasma diagnostics - charged-particle spectroscopy","Analog to digital conversion; Charged particles; Digital storage; Electron multipliers; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Magnetoplasma; Nuclear instrumentation; Plasma diagnostics; Radiation; Signal analysis; Signal processing; X ray spectroscopy; Charged particle spectroscopy; Computing (architecture, farms, GRID for recording, storage, archiving, and distribution of data); FPGA-based implementation; Gas electron multipliers; Gaseous detectors; Laser generated plasmas; Pre-processing algorithms; Tomographic reconstruction; Neutron irradiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001004311

For titanium and titania, silver ion implantation can endow them with good bactericidal ability without compromising the compatibility with osteoblast cells and sometimes even improve the biological functions. In Ag-implanted titanium, micro-galvanic effects occur between the Ag nanoparticles and titanium substratum forming a proton-depleted region which may cause bacteria death due to the disturbance of their energy production process. In ion-implanted titania, the electron storage ability of the nanoparticles may facilitate electron transfer between titania and bacteria membranes resulting in bacteria death. These reactions involve a very small amount of released Ag ions thus simultaneously favoring cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. With respect to biodegradable magnesium and magnesium alloys, ion implantation can achieve the balance between corrosion protection and bacteria prevention. Ion implantation of the suitable elements followed by O ion implantation produces a dense metal oxide layer on the surface to protect the materials from rapid corrosion.

However, write operations on STT-RAM have considerably longer latency and higher energy consumption than conventional SRAM. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed to relax STT-RAM's non-volatility and to have it work in a fast and low power mode. Under this volatile mode, refresh operations are needed to guarantee data correctness if their lifespan is larger than the retention time. It is observed that this refresh overhead is significant for data in stencil loops with the characteristic of constant read and write dependencies. This paper proposes a loop scheduling technique which can traverse loops in a new direction such that data lifespan can be greatly shortened. Therefore, overall refresh overhead can be efficiently mitigated so as to improve performance and reduce power consumption. The experimental results indicate that access latency and dynamic energy can be improved by 21.4∼96.0% and 22.0∼95.5% respectively by the proposed scheduling scheme. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Magnetic leakage; Magnetic storage; Scheduling; Static random access storage; Conventional sram; High storage density; Improve performance; Loop scheduling; Low leakage power; Magnetic radiation; Scheduling schemes; Write operations; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006836486

However, energy harvesting powered embedded systems suffer from frequent execution interruption due to unstable energy supply. To bridge intermittent program execution across different power cycles, non-volatile processor (NVP) was proposed to checkpoint register contents during power failure. Together with register contents, the cache contents also need to be preserved during power failure. While pure non-volatile memory (NVM) based cache is an intuitive option, it suffers from inferior perfto high write latency and energy overhead. In this paper, we will propose replacement and checkpoint policies for SRAM and NVM based hybrid cache in NVPs whose execution is interrupted frequently.

For long-term storage, solar fuels seem to be a good option. Direct solar water splitting could play an important role in the production of these solar fuels. One of the main challenges of this process is the charge separation and collection at the interfaces. The knowledge on photovoltaic (PV) junctions can be used to tackle this challenge. In this work, the use of doped layers to enhance the electric field in an a-SiC:H photocathode, and the use of thin-film silicon multijunction devices to achieve a stand-alone solar water splitting device are discussed. Using a p-i-n structure as a-SiC:H photocathode, a current density of 10mA/cm2 is achievable. The p-i-n structure proposed also indicates the suitability of traditional PV structures for solar water splitting. In addition, hybrid devices, including a silicon heterojunction PV device, are proposed. A combination of the a-SiC:H photocathode with a nc-Si:H/c-Si is demonstrated and potential STH efficiencies of 7.9% have been achieved.

The governing equations are based on energy balance in the spherical capsules where the results are compared numerically using simple, explicit and finite difference technique. The results obtained are used only for charging process. The effects of mass flow rate and inlet heat transfer fluid temperature are investigated on the time duration for solidification.

The MGs are capable to manage energy generation, storage and demand, making the user less dependent of the main grid, but more responsible for energy utilization and generation. It means the advanced control technics have to be applied in MGs. One of the important control issues in MG is related to reactive power sharing. The classical droop control does not provide the appropriate reactive power sharing, what may cause the reactive power circulation. This problem can be easily solved by equal reactive power sharing algorithm, however the limitation of active power resulted from keeping equal reactive power may occur and the converter will not be working with maximum available active powers. In order to provides better exploitation of RESs and to avoid reactive power circulation, the novel proportional reactive power sharing has been developed.

Mitigation of CO2 via carbon capture and storage (CCS) routes have less motivation from a commercial point of view. Therefore, an integrated system is of paramount importance to convert CO2 into value-added products such as methane (CH4) using solar energy (photosynthesis) or surplus electrical energy in hydrolysis for production of reactant hydrogen to use in CO2 methanation. To date, great efforts have been made to investigate both the reaction mechanism and catalysts development for methanation. Here in this review, up to date references have been cited, which are aimed at giving researchers a comprehensive overview of CO2 methanation with respect to the recent advancements in reaction mechanism, catalytic materials, and the novel combination of metal active phase and its synergy. Both thermochemical and electrochemical routes of CO2 methanation have been discussed, mainly focusing on thermochemical routes.

The LHCb detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer, which measures proton-proton interactions at the LHC. The operational bunch crossing rate is several orders of magnitude above the current abilities of data recording and storage. Therefore, a trigger system has been implemented to reduce this rate to an acceptable value. The LHCb trigger system has been redesigned during the 2013-2015 long shutdown, achieving offline-quality alignment and calibration online. It also allows analyses to be performed entirely at the trigger level. In addition, having the best performing reconstruction in the trigger gives the possibility to fully use the particle identification selection criteria and greatly increases the efficiency, in particular for the selection of charm and strange hadron decays.

Hybridizing a CSP plant with a PV system can increase the overall plant capacity factor by allowing thermal energy to be stored while the PV plant is in production and thus help to achieve a fully dispatchable solar electricity production system. A power generation and economic analysis of two hybrid CSP + PV plant models were developed considering a range of plant capacities based on parabolic trough or central receiver plants, combined with a PV system. Environmental conditions were considered for a site in the Atacama Desert, which is a hotspot of solar energy development in the country and shares the solar radiation characteristics of northern Chile. The study conducts a parametric analysis and optimization of the storage and power block sizes for the CSP plants in terms of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), when the nominal capacity of the PV plant is varied. The annual production of the plants is calculated using the Transient System Simulation program (TRNSYS), which uses a new component library developed for that purpose. From the results of the simulations, the high potential for hybrid CSP + PV plants in the Atacama Desert is clear, because the high levels of irradiation available in northern Chile provide a competitive electricity cost, allowing investors to access PPA contracts at competitive prices and achieving competitive costs with respect to other energy sources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Baseload electricity production; CSP + PV hybrid; High capacity factor; TRNSYS","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Solar energy; Solar power plants; CSP + PV hybrid; Electricity production; Environmental conditions; High capacity; Parametric -analysis; Plant capacity factors; Radiation characteristics; TRNSYS; Electric power generation; economic analysis; electricity generation; environmental conditions; irradiation; optimization; performance assessment; power plant; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power; Atacama Desert; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988312156

Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However, most of the comments in social media, blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries, for various household profiles, with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear, almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100% self-consumption (i.e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast, the cost of domestic Li-Ion storage is most likely still too high for a large-scale market uptake in Europe; (3) home battery profitability and future uptake depend mainly on the indirect subsidies for self-consumption provided by the structure of retail prices; (4) the self-sufficiency rate varies widely between households. For a given household, the volume of self-consumption cannot be predicted in a deterministic way. Along with these results, this study also provides a database of synthetic household profiles, a simulation tool for the prediction of self-consumption and a method for the optimal sizing of such systems. © 2016 The Author(s)","Battery; Electricity; Household; Prosumer; PV; Retail; Self-consumption","Costs; Electric batteries; Electricity; Social networking (online); Solar energy; Battery; Household; Prosumer; Retail; Self-consumption; Lithium-ion batteries; catalyst; database; economic analysis; European Union; prediction; profitability; self sufficiency; social media; solar power; statistical analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983792031

The system consists of a fuel processor, a PEM stack, and a battery providing power for the startup, shutdown, and for covering load transients; however, the developed prototype system is not optimised. Before redesigning it for mass production, the optimal size of the main components needs to be identified to enable the best possible exploitation of the technology.

However, variability and uncertainty of wind speeds create challenges for balancing in the power systems and in many cases require improvements in ramping capabilities of the system along with additional reserved generation capacity. Ramping capability as well as generation reserves could be provided by different technologies such as thermal and hydro generation and different types of energy storage. The last option is considered to be a possible solution for power systems with large wind generation.

A multi-objective (cost versus carbon emissions) mixed integer linear programming model is developed and applied to a microgrid case study. The optimisation model is based on the coupling of an energy hub modelling approach for system design and operation, and a linearized electrical grid model for steady-state power flow calculation in order to optimize the overall design and operation of a microgrid. The trade-off between electrical storage (ES) and grid upgrade options is examined and performance is compared to a reference case. Additionally, the optimal locations, capacities and charging power of an electrical storage are determined. The results showed that the grid upgrade is only viable in the lowest carbon emissions after the installation of the electrical storage. © 2016 IEEE.","Electrical storage; Energy hub; Microgrid; MILP; Steady-state analysis","Economic and social effects; Electric load flow; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Design and operations; Energy hubs; Micro grid; MILP; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimisation models; Steady state power flow calculation; Steady-state analysis; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002202517

Nonlinear expressions such as thermal generation costs and hydro production are usually represented by convex piecewise linear approximations. Even though dynamic piecewise linear (DPWL) models - which evolve as the problem is being solved - are advantageous as compared to static PWL models (which are computed a priori), its applicability to SDDP-based approaches is hampered by the fact that it is not possible to build a model for all nodes that may be visited during its iterative procedure. As a consequence, we lose the advantage of such DPWL models, which is to approximate the nonlinear expressions only around the regions of optimal operation, which are scenario-dependent. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new state-dependent dynamic piecewise linear model for thermal generation costs, where we build a DPWL for each system state, which are defined as the combination of system energy storage level at a given time step and the inflow scenario of the SDDP solving strategy. We assess the performance of this model for small / medium scale hydrothermal problems. © 2016 IEEE.","Benders decomposition; Generation planning; Piecewise linear models; Stochastic programming","Costs; Dynamic programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Piecewise linear techniques; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Benders decomposition; Generation planning; Hydro-thermal coordinations; Non-linear optimization problems; Piecewise linear approximations; Piecewise linear modeling; Piecewise linear models; Stochastic dual dynamic programming; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001736150

At the same time, energy demands should also be managed and minimised to curb the rising GHG. Transitioning towards cleaner energy supply may also take time due to economic, political, technology readiness and public acceptance reason.

It accounts for a considerable amount of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Due to the increasing awareness of global warming, more energy efficient cement production is increasingly being emphasized. One of the priorities is to reduce the energy demand and innovate the production process to move towards the cleaner production as: Energy efficiency improvements; Waste heat recovery; Reduction of clinker/cement ratio and use of alternative raw materials; Substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources. When the GHG emissions at source opportunities are close to being exhausted, the other mitigations options should be considered such as: CO2 capture and storage. This is however in most cases not the final solution from the point of Life cycle assessment (LCA). In recent years various mitigation measures are gaining on the importance and the cement industry is more and more shifting to cleaner production. Among the others, there are two measures, which can reduce the GHG emissions considerably: the use of alternative raw materials and alternative fuels. The challenge for the cement industry is to use alternative raw materials especially those originating from other industries where they are considered as by-products or even waste. Some of these by-products include: Bottom ash from municipal solid waste incinerators; Fly ash from coal power plants; Gypsum from the desulfurization plants used in power plants. Another important measure is the energy efficiency improvement in existing cement plants. There are various approaches for controlling and improving the energy efficiency within existing cement manufacturing units, however, mathematical modelling, simulation, optimisation and Process Integration are increasingly gaining in importance. The mathematical modelling approach uses the numerical simulations for the investigation of the thermo-chemical processes occurring inside of the manufacturing unit. The results gained are being used to enhance the efficiency of cement production. They improve the understanding of the flow characteristics and transport phenomena taking place inside the cement combustion unit. The objective of this paper is to review the current status of the cleaner cement manufacturing, the cement industry's shifting to alternative raw materials and alternative energy sources, and the modelling of the thermo-chemical processes inside the cement combustion units. Additionally, some critical issues, which up to now have not been adequately resolved, are outlined. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative energy source; Alternative raw material; Cleaner cement industry; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emission","Alternative fuels; Ash handling; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Cements; Coal combustion; Energy efficiency; Fly ash; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Manufacture; Municipal solid waste; Pollution control; Power plants; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Alternative energy source; Alternative raw material; Cement manufacturing process; Desulfurization plant; Energy efficiency improvements; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste incinerator; Thermo chemical process; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971282289

Detecting the changes occurring in the frequency spectrum of the EAF voltages fast and accurately has crucial importance to eliminate the undesired effects of harmonics and interharmonics using advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters, synchronous static compensators, energy storage systems, and etc. The aim of the research work presented here is to reduce the spectral leakage effects experienced by Fourier analysis based methods by estimating the spectral model parameters using nonlinear least squares. The Fourier spectrum of the signal is used as apriori information; however, the proposed model does not suffer from the spectral leakage problems encountered by the Fourier analysis based methods in case of fundamental frequency variation, which frequently occurs in the existence of EAF plants in an electrical system. Moreover, the proposed model permits frequency detection at a much higher resolution than the Fourier analysis based methods. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic and field data and it has been shown that it is able to detect frequency components and the corresponding amplitudes and phases of harmonics and interharmonics with high accuracy for EAF plants. © 2016 IEEE.","Electric arc furnace (EAF); harmonics; interharmonics; nonlinear least squares estimation; power quality (PQ)","Digital storage; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Furnaces; Harmonic analysis; Least squares approximations; Electric arc furnace; Electrical arc furnaces; Energy storage systems; Fundamental frequencies; harmonics; Harmonics and interharmonics; Inter-harmonics; Non-linear least squares; Electric furnaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002289005

One of the technological challenges concerns its storage in a safe, compact, low mass and high gravimetric capacity manner. In this sense, many Hydrogen Storage Materials (HSM) have been investigated to house this source of energy, such as Simple Hydrides, Borohydrides, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Alanates, AB5 Alloys, Ammonia Borane, Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene. Scientific advances aside, less attention has been paid in establishing a panorama of the technological developments in HSM. To assess the technological advances in HSM, patent analysis can be carried out using bibliometrics and text mining approaches in order to forecast the future trend of development and the main players involved in this process. In this work, we evaluated the technological life cycle stage, HSM class prominence and the role of different countries in HSM patenting. The results show that overall HSM patenting decreased after 2007, except in the case of China. On the other hand, the USA, Japan, China and the European Union (EU) were the main patenting territories. Simple Hydrides and Borohydrides were the main classes of HSM that received more attention from the USA and the EU, while Japan had a high share in Solid Solution Alloys. The life cycle stage of HSM seems to be between the first prototype market experiences and full market deployment, even though future assessment is needed to fine-tune the analysis. The developed indicators may also support the funding of new projects and decision making. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bibliometrics; Hydrogen storage; Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Technological forecasting","Carbon; Commerce; Crystalline materials; Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage alloys; Information science; Life cycle; Organometallics; Patents and inventions; Storage (materials); Technological forecasting; Yarn; Bibliometrics; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Patent analysis; Science and technology indicators; Solid solution alloy; Technological advances; Technological challenges; Technological development; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994614183

These technologies enable the control of residential consumption, local small-scale generation, and energy storage systems to respond to time-varying prices. However, shifting loads simultaneously to lower price periods is likely to put extra stress on distribution system assets such as distribution transformers. Especially, additional new types of loads/appliances such as electric vehicles (EVs) can introduce even more burden on the operation of these assets, which is an issue that needs special attention. Such extra stress can cause accelerated aging of distribution system assets and significantly affect the reliability of the system. In this paper, the impact of a smart neighborhood load on distribution transformer aging is investigated. The EMS of each household is designed to respond to prices and other signals emitted by the responsive load serving entity within the relevant demand response strategy. An optimization framework based on mixed-integer linear programming is presented in order to define the EMS structure. Then, the equivalent aging of the distribution transformer is examined with a thermal model under different scenarios. The case studies that are presented indicate that the integration of EVs in residential premises may indeed cause accelerated aging of the distribution transformers, while the need to investigate the efficiency of dynamic pricing mechanisms is rendered evident. © 2015 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Electric vehicle; Energy management system; Smart neighborhood; Transformer aging","Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Housing; Integer programming; Smart power grids; Distribution transformer; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimization framework; Residential consumption; Small-scale generations; Smart neighborhood; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016410914

Recently it was reported that progranulin (PGRN) insufficiency and deficiency associated with GD in human and mice, respectively. However the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that PGRN binds directly to GCase and its deficiency results in aggregation of GCase and its receptor LIMP2. Mass spectrometry approaches identified HSP70 as a GCase/LIMP2 complex-associated protein upon stress, with PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. Additionally, 98 amino acids of C-terminal PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase and HSP70. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and animal models. These findings not only demonstrate that PGRN is a co-chaperone of HSP70 and plays an important role in GCase lysosomal localization, but may also provide new therapeutic interventions for lysosomal storage diseases, in particular GD. © 2016 The Authors","Gaucher disease; HSP70; Lysosomal storage diseases; Pcgin; Progranulin; β-glucocerebrosidase","glucosylceramidase; heat shock protein 70; progranulin; glucosylceramidase; GRN protein, human; heat shock protein 70; lysosome associated membrane protein; protein aggregate; protein binding; recombinant protein; signal peptide; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; confocal microscopy; controlled study; DNA sequence; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Gaucher disease; gene mutation; human; human cell; immunoelectron microscopy; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein purification; site directed mutagenesis; surface plasmon resonance; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting; animal; cell line; disease model; drug effects; fibroblast; Gaucher disease; genetics; knockout mouse; lysosome; metabolism; physiological stress; Animals; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Fibroblasts; Gaucher Disease; Glucosylceramidase; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins; Lysosomes; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Phenotype; Protein Aggregates; Protein Binding; Recombinant Proteins; Stress, Physiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002593635

We applied a rat model of night-shift work to assess the immediate effects of such a shift in food intake on metabolism. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 8 h of forced activity during their rest (ZT2-10) or active (ZT14-22) phase. Food intake, body weight, and body temperature were monitored across four work days and eight recovery days. Food intake gradually shifted toward rest-work hours, stabilizing on work day three. A subgroup of animals was euthanized after the third work session for analysis of metabolic gene expression in the liver by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results show that work in the rest phase shifted food intake to rest-work hours. Moreover, liver genes related to energy storage and insulin metabolism were upregulated, and genes related to energy breakdown were downregulated compared to non-working time-matched controls. Both working groups lost weight during the protocol and regained weight during recovery, but animals that worked in the rest phase did not fully recover, even after eight days of recovery. In conclusion, three to four days of work in the rest phase is sufficient to induce disruption of several metabolic parameters, which requires more than eight days for full recovery. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Animal model; Body temperature; Body weight; Circadian rhythmicity; Food intake; Gene expression; Metabolism; Night work; Shift work","animal experiment; animal model; body temperature; body weight; circadian rhythm; food intake; gene expression; human; insulin metabolism; liver; male; metabolic parameters; metabolic regulation; night work; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; rat; rat model; rest; shift worker; storage; Wistar rat; animal; body temperature; body weight; circadian rhythm; eating; gene expression; homeostasis; metabolism; physiology; work schedule; Animals; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Circadian Rhythm; Eating; Gene Expression; Homeostasis; Humans; Liver; Male; Metabolism; Models, Animal; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Work Schedule Tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995388350

In this article we provide a balanced assessment of the compromise between these losses and demonstrate that for a broad range of electrochemical reactors, the use of microfluidics can enhance the energy conversion efficiency.

Metabolome profiling in patients and animal models may identify affected metabolic pathways and reveal new biomarkers of disease progression. Using liver metabolomics we have shown a starvation-like condition in a knock-in (Bcs1lc.232A&gt;G) mouse model of GRACILE syndrome, a neonatal lethal respiratory chain complex III dysfunction with hepatopathy. Here, we hypothesized that a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD, 60% dextrose) will alleviate the hypoglycemia and promote survival of the sick mice. However, when fed HCD the homozygotes had shorter survival (mean ± SD, 29 ± 2.5 days, n = 21) than those on standard diet (33 ± 3.8 days, n = 30), and no improvement in hypoglycemia or liver glycogen depletion. We investigated the plasma metabolome of the HCD- and control diet-fed mice and found that several amino acids and urea cycle intermediates were increased, and arginine, carnitines, succinate, and purine catabolites decreased in the homozygotes. Despite reduced survival the increase in aromatic amino acids, an indicator of liver mitochondrial dysfunction, was normalized on HCD. Quantitative enrichment analysis revealed that glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, and urea cycle were also partly normalized on HCD. This dietary intervention revealed an unexpected adverse effect of high-glucose diet in complex III deficiency, and suggests that plasma metabolomics is a valuable tool in evaluation of therapies in mitochondrial disorders. © 2016 by the authors.","BCS1L; Dextrose diet; GRACILE syndrome; Metabolite; Mitochondrial disorder; Mouse model; Nutrition","arginine; carnitine; cytochrome c oxidase; glycine; glycogen; phenylalanine; purine; serine; succinic acid; threonine; tyrosine; amino acid; BCS1L protein, mouse; carbohydrate diet; chaperone; glycogen liver level; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; urea; amino acid metabolism; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carbohydrate diet; complex III deficiency; controlled study; glycogen liver level; hypoglycemia; lipid storage; liver histology; metabolome; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; protein degradation; respiratory chain; survival rate; urea cycle; administration and dosage; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; carbohydrate diet; deficiency; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug effects; genetics; liver mitochondrion; metabolism; metabolome; mutation; pharmacology; principal component analysis; procedures; Amino Acids; Animals; Dietary Carbohydrates; Electron Transport Complex III; Liver Glycogen; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria, Liver; Mitochondrial Diseases; Molecular Chaperones; Mutation; Principal Component Analysis; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994494535

Our schemes rely on the observation that on the average only 10% of the register bits are changed by the instructions. In this study, we propose a combination of architectural and circuit level techniques that exploit this inefficiency for the register file's write power reduction using an update-based scheme. We show that for a 64-bit datapath it is possible to reduce the energy dissipation of the register file up to 25% for individual benchmark programs and by 21% on the average across all simulated benchmarks with a negligible performance compromise. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Low-power design; Microprocessors; Register file; SRAM","Benchmarking; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Microprocessor chips; Static random access storage; Benchmark programs; Circuit levels; Data paths; Low-power design; Modern architectures; Power reductions; Register files; Used components; Electric losses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994338845

A new multi-purpose beamline was then installed at the LNLS using the SCW as a photon source. The XDS is a flexible beamline operating in the energy range between 5 and 30 keV, designed to perform experiments using absorption, diffraction and scattering techniques. Most of the work performed at the XDS beamline concentrates on X-ray absorption spectroscopy at energies above 18 keV and high-resolution diffraction experiments.

This causes the formation of unfavourable flow patterns in the draft tube of turbines and pump-turbines. At partial load operation, a precessing cavitation vortex rope is formed at the Francis turbine runner outlet, acting as an excitation source for the hydraulic system. In case of resonance, the resulting high-amplitude pressure pulsations can put at risk the stability of the machine and of the electrical grid to which it is connected. It is therefore crucial to understand and accurately simulate the underlying physical mechanisms in such conditions. However, the exact impact of cavitation and hydro-acoustic resonance on the flow velocity fluctuations in the draft tube remains to be established. The flow discharge pulsations expected to occur in the draft tube in resonance conditions have for instance never been verified experimentally. In this study, two-component Laser Doppler Velocimetry is used to investigate the axial and tangential velocity fluctuations at the runner outlet of a reduced scale physical model of a Francis turbine. The investigation is performed for a discharge equal to 64 % of the nominal value and three different pressure levels in the draft tube, including resonance and cavitation-free conditions. Based on the convective pressure fluctuations induced by the vortex precession, the periodical velocity fluctuations over one typical precession period are recovered by phase averaging. The impact of cavitation and hydro-acoustic resonance on both axial and tangential velocity fluctuations in terms of amplitude and phase shift is highlighted for the first time. It is shown that the occurrence of resonance does not have significant effects on the draft tube velocity fields, suggesting that the synchronous axial velocity fluctuations are surprisingly negligible compared to the velocity fluctuations induced by the vortex precession. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Cavitation; Doppler effect; Electric power transmission networks; Flow velocity; Francis turbines; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Laser Doppler velocimeters; Phase shift; Pumped storage power plants; Renewable energy resources; Resonance; Tubes (components); Velocity; Vortex flow; Vorticity; Cavitation vortex ropes; Cavitation-free condition; Convective pressure fluctuations; Francis turbine runner; Laser Doppler Velocimetry; Renewable energy source; Tangential velocities; Velocity fluctuations; Hydraulic turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991709130

This sector has not historically received much attention when it comes to improving energy efficiency due to limited resources, lower priority given to energy issues, rather small energy-saving potential for a single company, and great heterogeneity of the SMEs. However, the accumulative energy-saving potential for SMEs can be quite high and achieved at very low costs, partly because most improvements are found in support processes and are relatively easy to implement. Various public policies, such as industrial energy audit programmes, serve as a means for overcoming barriers to energy efficiency in the sector of SMEs. One example is the Swedish Energy Audit Programme (SEAP), a stand-alone audit programme functioning between 2010 and 2014. The aim of this paper is to examine the programme by means of process and impact evaluation. The results show that the programme resulted in annual net energy efficiency savings equivalent to 340 GWh/year or 6% of the 713 participating companies' energy end use. The implementation rate in the audit programme was 53%. On average, the public cost of one implemented measure was € 700. Derived from the amount of energy saved, the audit programme's annual cost-effectiveness is €7/MWh saved energy. This paper adds a significant scientific contribution due to the method used for evaluation. Multiple company visits and availability of quantitative data from 713 companies gave the possibility to address the additionality effects and estimate net energy savings more precisely. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy audit policy programme; Energy efficiency measures; Energy policy; Energy policy evaluation; Small and medium-sized enterprises","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Barriers to energy efficiencies; Efficiency measure; Energy audit; Energy policy evaluations; Energy saving potential; Industrial energy use; Scientific contributions; Small and medium sized enterprise; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990932103

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of seed moisture content, packaging, and storage conditions such as temperature and relative humidity on the quality of seeds from Minas Gerais State, during a 12-month storage period. The research had two independent assays: (I) the seeds were stored with three moisture contents/ranges 4.0≤6.0%; 6.0≤8.0% and 8.0≤10.0% in impermeable packages, under room temperature and at 10°C; (II) seeds with approximately 5.9% of moisture content were stored in three different types of packages: a) permeable, b) semi-permeable and c) impermeable. Three storing conditions were tested: a) room temperature and RH under laboratory conditions; b) 15°C and 45% RH; c) 20°C and 55% RH. Water content, germination rate and germination speed index were evaluated at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months of storing. The best germination results were obtained with the moisture range of 6.0≤8.0%, with seeds kept at room temperature; while the seeds stored at 10°C, regardless the moisture range, did not survive. The stored seeds with 5.9% moisture content and at both 15°C/45%RH and 20°C/55% RH conditions, independently of the package type used, showed the best results. Thus, macaw palm seeds can be classified as intermediates seeds. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

To serve as the PCM, commercial-grade paraffin was placed inside evacuated tubes equipped with heat pipes. Experiments were performed to assess the impact of paraffin application on the thermal performance of the ETC/S system. The use of paraffin extended the operating time of the solar thermal system by enabling the recovery of stored heat during the discharge cycle. In addition, the lower mean temperature of the heating medium compared with that in a conventional evacuated tube collector (ETC) resulted in less heat loss from both the test stand piping and the ETC/S unit itself. Notably, it was possible to bring the temperature of the heating medium to a useful level (approx. 45 °C). The results also showed that in comparison with an ETC, the total amount of useful heat obtained from the paraffin-integrated ETC/S system was increased by 45–79%, depending on the mass flow rate of the heating medium during the discharge cycle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Latent heat; Phase-change material; Solar collector; Solar energy; Thermal energy storage","Heat pipes; Heat storage; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Commercial grade; Discharge cycles; Evacuated tube collectors; Evacuated tubes; Mass flow rate; Mean temperature; Solar thermal systems; Thermal Performance; Paraffins; energy conservation; experimental study; heating; latent heat flux; performance assessment; phase transition; solar power; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989959392

At the same time, they can be highly damaging to property, infrastructure, and life. Because of their high energy, mountain watercourses are highly vulnerable to environmental changes affecting their catchments and channels. Many factors have modified and frequently still tend to modify the environmental conditions in mountain areas, with impacts on geomorphic processes and the frequency, magnitude, and timing of floods in mountain watercourses. The ongoing climate changes vary between regions but may affect floods in mountain areas in many ways. In many mountain regions of Europe, widespread afforestation took place over the twentieth century, considerably increasing the amounts of large wood delivered to the channels and the likelihood of jamming bridges. At the same time, deforestation continues in other mountain areas, accelerating runoff and amplifying the magnitude and frequency of floods in foreland areas. In many countries, in-channel gravel mining has been a common practice during recent decades; the resultant deficit of bed material in the affected channels may suddenly manifest during flood events, resulting in the failure of scoured bridges or catastrophic channel widening. During the past century many rivers in mountain and foreland areas incised deeply; the resultant loss of floodplain water storage has decreased attenuation of flood waves, hence increasing flood hazard to downstream river reaches. On the other hand, a large amount of recent river restoration activities worldwide may provide examples of beneficial changes to flood risk, attained as a result of increased channel storage or reestablished floodplain water storage. Relations between geomorphic processes and floods operate in both directions, which means that changes in flood probability or the character of floods (e.g., increased wood load) may significantly modify the morphology of mountain rivers, but morphological changes of rivers can also affect hydrological properties of floods and the associated risk for societies. This paper provides a review of research in the field of floods in mountain environments and puts the papers of this special issue dedicated to the same topic into context. It also provides insight into innovative studies, methods, or emerging aspects of the relations between environmental changes, geomorphic processes, and the occurrence of floods in mountain rivers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental change; Flood; Geomorphic change; Mountain river","channel morphology; environmental change; environmental conditions; flood; floodplain; mountain environment; mountain region; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989945426

In this study, we focused on the conditional impacts of FDIs and industrialization on energy productivity using a panel data consisting of thirteen (13) East African countries covering 1980–2011. The baseline result shows that higher income and a well-integrated economy are pro-energy productive, but FDIs and intense industrialization are anti-energy productive in the sub-region. This result remains robust even when we exclude the high income group and control for income group effects. Income significantly promotes energy productivity more in low income group than middle income group. Intense industrialization and FDIs significantly decreases energy productivity only in low income countries. Trade openness significantly promotes energy productivity only in middle income group. We have shown that FDIs and income, intense industrialization and FDIs, and intense industrialization and globalization are complementary forces that promote energy productivity in East Africa but this is more evident for the middle income group than the low income group in the sub-region. Based on the result, we recommend a quadruplet programme called the “Growth, Industrial, Foreign investment and Trade programme” (GIFTP).

Summary: Leaf senescence – the coordinated, active process leading to the organized dismantling of cellular components to remobilize resources – is a fundamental aspect of plant life. Its tight regulation is essential for plant fitness and has crucial implications for the optimization of plant productivity and storage properties. Various investigations have shown light deprivation and light perception via phytochromes as key elements modulating senescence. However, the signalling pathways linking light deprivation and actual senescence processes have long remained obscure. Recent analyses have demonstrated that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are major transcription factors orchestrating dark-induced senescence (DIS) by targeting chloroplast maintenance, chlorophyll metabolism, hormone signalling and production, and the expression of senescence master regulators, uncovering potential molecular links to the energy deprivation signalling pathway. PIF-dependent feed-forward regulatory modules might be of critical importance for the highly complex and initially light-reversible DIS induction. © 2016 The Authors.

One of the key features of smart grid is to provide a redundant high quality power for the consumers. In islanded microgrid, the under frequency and/or voltage collapse, caused by power deficiency, can lead to power outage. The current practice is to shed the load demand until the frequency and voltage are restored. However, the redundancy in supplying power has no meaning as long as the loads are shed. The main objective of this paper is to propose a power management system (PMS) that protects the microgrid against the load shedding. PMS is able to control the microgrid in both centralized and decentralized fashions. To prevent under frequency load shedding (UFLS), this work proposes using battery energy storage system (BESS) to compensate for the power mismatch in the islanded microgrid. A method is presented to estimate the rate of change of frequency and to calculate the power deficiency. The approximated value is exploited as the set-point to dispatch BESS. PV and battery plants are supposed to share the reactive power demand proportionally and thus regulate the voltage at the load bus. This work also suggests two outer control loops, namely, frequency restoration loop (FRL) and difference angle compensator (DAC). These loops ensure microgrid smooth transition from islanded mode to grid-connected mode. The microgrid is configured to investigate the effective utilization of exiting solar PV plant connected to distribution network in Sabah Malaysia. The microgrid is implemented in PSCAD software and tested under different scenarios. The microgrid with PMS shows operational stability and improvements in comparison with the original system. The results indicate that PMS can effectively control the microgrid in all operating modes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Photovoltaic; Power management system; Renewable energy; Smart microgrid; Under frequency load shedding","Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy storage; Outages; Power management; Restoration; Smart power grids; Software testing; Battery energy storage systems; Photovoltaic; Power management systems; Renewable energies; Smart Micro Grids; Underfrequency load-shedding; Electric load shedding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988615446

Unlike the conventional methods which only use either filtration based controller (FBC) or fuzzy logic controller (FLC), the proposed control strategy comprises of a low-pass filter (LPF) and FLC. Firstly, LPF removes the high dynamic components from the battery demand. FLC minimizes the battery peak current demand while constantly considering the state-of-charge of the supercapacitor. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm optimizes the membership functions of the FLC to achieve optimal battery peak current reduction. The proposed system is compared to the conventional system with battery-only storage and the systems with conventional control strategies (Rule Based Controller and FBC). The proposed system reduces the battery peak current, battery peak power, maximum absolute value of the rate of change of power and average absolute value of the rate of change of power by 16.05%, 15.19%, 77.01%, and 95.59%, respectively as compared to the conventional system with battery-only storage.

That is why the reduction of energy consumption by increasing electrified urban transport, such as trams, trolleybuses, light rail and underground is becoming an increasingly important issue. Energy recovery during braking is possible in all modern electric vehicles, but in many cases this possibility is not fully taken advantage of, inter alia, because of an inadequate power supply structure. The aim of this article is to present practical examples of implementation of eco-friendly solutions in urban municipal transport. The article shows a thorough analysis of braking energy dispatch in the urban traction power supply system, which was based on extensive measurement research conducted in Gdynia trolleybus network. The authors applied multi way measurement method using Global Positioning System. The optimal conditions for implementation of several methods of energy recovery (storage energy systems, reconfiguration of supply system, using auxiliaries) have been shown. Great emphasis has been put on the confirmation of the results by means of research and experimental measurement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption reducing; Energy recuperations; Public transport; Supercapacitor; Trolleybus","Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Recovery; Trackless trolleys; Trolley cars; Urban transportation; Energy recuperation; Environmental awareness; Measurement methods; Measurement research; Public transport; Super capacitor; Traction power supply system; Trolleybus; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986000866

This may lead to higher CO2 emissions of the Swiss power supply due to domestic fossil power generation or electricity imports. For compliance with the Swiss CO2 law, low carbon technologies such as renewable energies and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) gain importance. In order to support rational decision-making in this context, we compare various domestic and foreign renewable and non-renewable power supply options for Switzerland in 2035 based on environmental, economic, social and security of supply related indicators using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Our evaluation puts a focus on CCS technologies and uses (a) a novel approach that allows calculating the distribution of the MCDA results of all possible unique weighting profiles, and (b) two specific weighting profiles. The results show that domestic potentials for hydro and biogas power should be primarily exploited. Among the fossil and import options, natural gas plants with or without CCS and solar-thermal electricity imports are viable. Plants with CCS face a key trade-off: they may trigger social conflicts which must be weighed against the desired CO2 emission reductions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Power generation; Sustainability assessment; Switzerland","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Life cycle; Power generation; Sustainable development; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon technologies; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Rational decision making; Solar thermal electricity; Sustainability assessment; Switzerland; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; decision making; electricity generation; energy policy; fossil fuel; import; life cycle analysis; nuclear power; renewable resource; resource assessment; sustainability; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984688391

The intensive fossil fuel consumption in steel industry is associated with CO2 emission. In the absence of economically feasible and efficient methods for capture and storage of enormous quantities of CO2 emissions from steel industry, the use of biomass products as a source of energy and reducing agents provides a promising alternative solution for green steel production. However, the biomass application in iron and steel industry is still limited and it suffers strong competition from fossil fuels. The challenges of biomass usage in steel industry are included technical and economic aspects which required synergy between steelmaking and bioenergy sectors. Although intensive work has been carried out separately, there is a lack of link between these two vital sectors. The present article provides a comprehensive review of recent research progresses which have been conducted on biomass upgrading and analysing the opportunities and obstacles for biomass implementation in iron and steel industry. In the first part, an overview on the energy consumption and CO2 emissions in different iron and steelmaking routes is clarified. Moreover, the potential approaches of biomass conversion processes and upgrading technologies are reviewed. In the second part, an attention has been paid to the utilization of torrefied/pyrolyzed biomass in the energy-intensive ironmaking processes. Biomass addition to coal blend during cokemaking and its influence on the product coke quality is discussed. The partial and complete substitution of coke breeze with biochar in sintering process and its influence on the product sinter quality is explained. The impact of charcoal top charging or injection into blast furnace has been elaborated. Benefits and limitations of biomass application in each process are thoroughly discussed.

Some of these renewable sources have an uncontrollable output and managing the variability is challenging. The current upward trend in renewables participation will demand even more flexibility from the energy systems. Among several options for increasing flexibility, energy storage (ES) is a promising one considering the variability of many renewable sources. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive updated review of ES technologies, briefly address their applications and discuss the barriers to ES deployment. Methodology involves the description and the analysis of ES many existing and developing technologies. ES applications are discussed briefly using logistic and parametric classification logics. As result of this study, it will be pointed out that no ES technology outstands simultaneously in all technical characteristics and consequently, selection should be driven on a case base analysis. Economic feasibility of ES business models and establishment of a well-suited regulatory environment are major issues to unlock ES deployment. Regarding energy transition, Power-to-Gas, Power-to-Liquids and Solar-to-Fuel technologies are very promising and further studies about these technologies are required to better understand their possibilities and how to overcome the barriers to their practical usage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity storage; Renewable energy integration; Sustainable energy systems","Climate change; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Renewable energy resources; Economic feasibilities; Electricity storages; Parametric classification; Regulatory environment; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy systems; Electric energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979082237

According to national statistics, the number of horses in Sweden is currently 360,000 and is continuing to increase. This result in increasing amounts of horse manure that has to be managed and treated, which is currently done using practices that cause local, regional, and global environmental impacts. However, horse manure and its content of nutrients and organic material could be a useful fertiliser for arable land and a substrate for renewable energy production as biogas. The aim of the paper is to identify and describe potentially critical factors in horse keeping determining the amount (total mass) and characteristics (nutrient content and biodegradability) of horse manure, and thus the potential for anaerobic digestion. A systematic combining approach is used as a structural framework for reviewed relevant literature. All factors identified are expressed as discrete choices available to the horse keeper. In all, 12 different factors were identified: type and amount of feed, type and amount of bedding, mucking out regime, residence time outdoors, storage type and residence time of manure in storage, spreading and soil conditions, and transport distance and type of vehicle fuel used. Managing horses in terms of these factors is of vital importance in reducing the direct environmental impacts from horse keeping and in making horse manure attractive as a substrate for anaerobic digestion.

Working with energy management personnel inside companies can help to overcome these barriers. However, this is not a common practice among SMEs. Participation in industrial energy-efficiency networks (IEENs) can be a means of introducing customized energy management practices into SMEs. In such a network, industrial companies get support for a period of three to four years from an external network coordinator to determine energy efficiency potential, implement energy-efficiency measures, and monitor energy performance. The method has been used widely in Switzerland and Germany, while in other countries the experience has not proven successful thus far. To show the effects of networking among industrial companies, it is important to evaluate networks quantitatively and qualitatively. This aspect is missing from the field of energy efficiency research, not least with regard to evaluation methods. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate Swedish IEENs and suggest methods for evaluating IEENs. The aim of this study is to review IEENs with particular emphasis on Swedish IEENs. The results show that in Sweden, a common notion of IEENs has not yet been established, and projects with different characteristics and designs fall under the category of IEEN. The lack of a standard approach to running and evaluating IEENs makes it difficult to evaluate Swedish networks quantitatively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency measures; Energy management; Evaluation method; Industrial energy efficiency; Industrial energy efficiency networks","Electric energy storage; Energy management; Human resource management; Barriers to energy efficiencies; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency improvements; Evaluation method; Industrial companies; Industrial energy efficiency; Management practices; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978204407

Under the experimental conditions (carrier gas velocities and adsorption temperatures) the micropore diffusion resistance was found to be the mass transfer controlling step. Matching the first moment of the response peaks to the mathematical model the Henry's Law constants and heat of adsorption at zero loading were determined. The axial dispersion, external film, macropore and micropore diffusion coefficients, and activation energy for diffusion of NO in the micropores were calculated from the analysis of the second moments of the response peaks. For successive NO pulses without regeneration between the pulses, the retention times of the response peaks decreased and peak areas increased with the injection number indicating irreversible adsorption. The reversibly adsorbed NO could be desorbed by purging with an inert gas at the adsorption pressure and temperature. Temperature programmed desorption profile obtained by heating the NO saturated adsorbent to 400 °C under inert flow revealed presence of multiple irreversibly adsorbed species in NZ with different thermal stabilities. Desorption of these species was not achieved during the heating up to 400 °C which makes the natural zeolitic materıal suitable for NO storage rather than for cyclic adsorptive separation processes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Adsorption; Chromatography; Diffusion; Natural zeolite; Nitric oxide","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Adsorption; C (programming language); Desorption; Diffusion; Inert gases; Mass transfer; Microporosity; Nitric oxide; Temperature programmed desorption; Zeolites; Adsorption temperature; Adsorptive separation; Carrier gas velocity; Concentration pulse; Experimental conditions; Henry's Law constant; Irreversible adsorption; Natural zeolites; Chromatography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978204142

Currently, natural gas storage for use in transportation is accomplished primarily through compressed natural gas (CNG) technologies and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which require large amounts of energy. In recent years, the storage technology of absorbed natural gas (ANG) on porous materials has been studied, fundamentally highlighted by reduced energy use and increased safety in the transport of gaseous fuel. In this sense, the present study aimed to gather information about the main adsorbent materials which are being studied and the conditions normally employed in surveys that use ANG technology, as well as pointing out the main challenges for the storage of biogas in the adsorbed form at low pressures and room temperature in an attempt to meet the target of 180 V/V established by Department of Energy. Researchers reported high storage capacities in moderate conditions of temperature and pressure; however, the biggest challenge of the research involving methane adsorbed is also achieving high rates of desorption with the lowest possible energy expenditure.

All three variables significantly affected (p < 0.05) moisture, aw, hardness and elasticity of panettones. The selected formulation (46 g/kg starch, 14 g/kg inverted sugar and 7 g/kg sucrose) was added to potassium sorbate (1 g/kg), citric acid (10 g/kg) and both additives (1 g/kg sorbate + 10 g/kg citric acid and 0.5 g/kg sorbate + 5 g/kg citric acid). From 16 to 24 days (35 °C/60% RH), panettones without coating and without additives (controls) showed growth of mold/yeast; while with both additives coating, fungal growth was observed from 40 days. When using potassium sorbate, mold/yeast was not detected until 48 days. During storage, there was reduced water activity, moisture, elasticity and cohesiveness of panettones with additives, while the reverse occurred in controls. The incorporation of food-graded antimicrobial compounds in the packaging films of potato starch coatings in concentrations lower than those normally used for mini panettones increased up to 130% their shelf life and may contribute to product loss reduction during storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Active coating; Anti-microbial effect; Citric acid; Potassium sorbate; Storage","Citric acid; Coatings; Elasticity; Energy storage; Food additives; Food preservation; Moisture; Molds; Potassium; Potassium sorbate; Starch; Sugar (sucrose); Active coatings; Anti-microbial effects; Antimicrobial compounds; Consumer acceptability; Development and applications; Packaging films; Physicochemical property; Quality attributes; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974829729

Analyses show that distribution of a surface coated with carbon, 5-7 nm thickness by tannic acid and nanostructured LiCoPO4/C cathode exhibits a higher and stable reversible capacity (155.2 mAh g-1) with the long voltage plateau nearly 4.8 V. Furthermore, this cathode exhibits capacity retention as 91% after 80 cycles and this value makes it one of the highest of those reported to date. The LiCoPO4/C electrode is produced simultaneously under high pressure and using microwave energy and this has an influence on excellent cycling behavior.

The experiment was established in 1994 on a sandy loam and compares two tillage systems, conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing (MP) and no-till (NT). Crops are grown in a six-year rotation, namely peas (Pisum sativum L.) - winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - field beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) - winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) - sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) - silage maize (Zea mays L.). This study investigated the impact of the two tillage systems on (i) nutrient distribution and storage in the soil profile, (ii) the depth distribution of soil organic carbon and (iii) crop productivity. Soil samples were collected layer-by-layer following cultivation layers and natural soil horizons in a metal frame (0.5 m × 0.5 m cross-sectional area) down to 0.5 m depth. The layer boundaries were approximately 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for NT, and 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for MP. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TotN), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), pH, and bulk density were measured for each layer. The nutrient distribution was rather uniform within the plough layer in MP. In NT, there was strong stratification, with higher nutrient concentrations in the upper layers for TotN, K and Mg. This was associated with crop residue retention on the surface and reduced plant uptake due to low pH. In contrast, the distribution of P and Ca in NT was rather uniform in the 0-30 cm layer, with a trend towards maximum concentrations at around 20 cm depth. Total storage of nutrients per ha in the whole soil profile was similar in NT and MP for all nutrients. SOC stocks did not differ between NT and MP, although the depth distribution of SOC concentration was significantly different. The long-term average crop yield was slightly higher in NT than in MP, but the difference was not significant. Crop yield was significantly higher in NT for winter cereals (winter wheat, winter barley) and legumes (field beans and peas), but lower for root and tuber crops (sugar beet, potatoes). It can be assumed that the high crop yields in NT in the Oberacker long-term field experiment are due to the well-balanced crop rotation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Crop rotation; Direct drilling; Mouldboard ploughing; Storage; Stratification","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Energy storage; Grain (agricultural product); Nutrients; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Sugar beets; Thermal stratification; Barley (hordeum vulgare l.); Crop rotation; Direct drilling; Long-term field experiments; Maximum concentrations; Mouldboard ploughing; Nutrient concentrations; Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Soil surveys; barley; concentration (composition); crop residue; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivation; experimental study; legume; long-term change; nutrient uptake; plowing; potato; seed treatment; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; sugar beet; zero tillage; Switzerland; Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Phaseolus vulgaris; Pisum sativum; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973402930

Hydrogen is widely regarded as an energy carrier that could circumvent this need, particularly in sight of the foreseeable spread of fuel cell cars that would use this “renewable H2”. The latter would be produced using electrolyzers, which in their better established form cannot fulfill the targeted H2-price due to the low current densities (&lt;0.5Acmgeom−2) associated to their liquid electrolyte. Alternatively, devices based on proton- and anion-exchange membranes are currently under development, and a new kind of co-electrolysis cell in which CO2 is reduced into hydrocarbons is also envisaged. Electrocatalysts play a crucial role in all of these systems, but the interplay between their surface and the reaction medium (in the so-called interface) is often overlooked in the quest towards better performance. With this motivation, this review discusses the current knowledge of the interfacial catalysis of the three (co-)electrolysis relevant reactions (i.e., the evolution of H2 and O2, and the reduction of CO2). From this, we identify pH and surface oxidation state as the key electrolyte- and surface-related parameters for which further understanding could lead to improved kinetics, and propose strategies for the tentative design of better electrocatalysts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy conversion; Energy storage; Hydrogen; pH; Power-to-gas; Surface","Alkaline fuel cells; Catalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Ion exchange membranes; pH; Surface reactions; Surfaces; Anion exchange membrane; Energy conversion and storages; Hydrogen evolution; Interfacial effects; Liquid electrolytes; Low current density; Relevant reactions; Surface-related parameters; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973103436

Subsequently, power generation using micro-gas turbine (MGT) is getting more and more attention. In particular, externally fired micro-gas turbine (EFMGT) is preferred among small-scale distributed generators, mainly due to high fuel flexibility, high overall efficiency, environmental benefits, and low maintenance requirement. The goal of this work is to evaluate the performance of an EFMGT-based standalone polygeneration system with the help of computational simulation studies. The main focus of this work is to develop a dynamic model for an EFMGT. The dynamic model is accomplished by merging a thermodynamic model with a mechanical model of the rotor and a transfer function based control system model.

We utilize data from geothermal fields from three different tectonic provinces of Turkey: North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), and western Anatolia. Our modeling approach distinguishes between possible subsurface processes that control CO2 gas contents in the geothermal systems - mixing, degassing, dissolution, and calcite precipitation. The approach is predicated on selecting pristine gas compositions, which is achieved by eliminating those samples likely to reflect crust-mantle mixing (via CO2/3He vs. R/RA relationships), and shallow-level degassing (via CO2 vs. δ13C relationships). Remaining samples are then used to discriminate between dissolution and calcite precipitation processes using δ13C vs. CO2/3He relationships. Based upon temperature- and pH-dependent fractionation between CO2 and He gases, and carbon isotopes (δ13C), quantitative estimates from Rayleigh fractionation models suggest dissolution as the major CO2 trapping mechanism, accounting for up to 95% of the variations in gas compositions. Calcite precipitation accompanies dissolution at high temperatures characteristic of reservoir conditions, and can stabilize up to 80% of the emplaced CO2 in some instances. The relative contribution of calcite precipitation to CO2 stabilization, however, is generally minor (≤25%) compared to dissolution (≥75%) and appears to change as a complex function of the nature and duration of water-rock interaction along with temperature. As shown by this study, CO2-He systematics provide a promising tool to predict and monitor the behaviour of CO2 in storage systems like geothermal fields which have recently gained interest as prospective storage sites for enhanced geothermal heat recovery projects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcite precipitation; CO2 storage; Dissolution; Geothermal systems; He-CO2 systematics","Aquifers; Calcite; Carbon; Degassing; Digital storage; Dissolution; Gases; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Hydrogeology; Mixing; Waste heat; Calcite precipitation; Geothermal systems; North Anatolian Fault Zone; Quantitative estimates; Rayleigh fractionation; Relative contribution; Reservoir conditions; Water rock interactions; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; degassing; dissolution; geothermal system; precipitation (chemistry); trap (geological structure); Anatolia; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968843719

However, it is challenging to design effective real-time energy storage management strategies that can deliver assured optimality, without being hampered by the uncertainty of volatile electricity prices and renewable energy supplies. This paper presents a simple effective online algorithm for the charging and discharging decisions of energy storage that minimizes the electricity cost in the presence of electricity price fluctuations and renewable energy supplies, without relying on the future information of prices, demands, or renewable energy supplies. The proposed algorithm is supported by a near-best worst-case guarantee (i.e., competitive ratio), as compared with the offline optimal decisions based on full future information. Furthermore, the algorithm can be adapted to take advantage of limited future information, if available.

In this paper, we propose a new control framework for reliable scheduling and provision of frequency reserves by aggregations of commercial buildings. The framework incorporates energy-constrained frequency signals, which are adopted by several transmission system operators for loads and storage devices. We use a hierarchical approach with three levels: 1) reserve capacities are allocated among buildings (e.g., on a daily basis) using techniques from robust optimization; 2) a robust model predictive controller optimizes the HVAC system consumption typically every 30 minutes; and 3) a feedback controller adjusts the consumption to provide reserves in real time. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to estimate the reserve capacities in simulations with typical Swiss office buildings and different reserve product characteristics. Our results show that an aggregation of approximately 100 buildings suffices to meet the 5-MW minimum bid size of the Swiss reserve market. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Ancillary services; demand response; energy constraints; frequency control; robust model predictive control","Air conditioning; Climate control; Electric power transmission; Office buildings; Optimization; Robust control; Virtual storage; Ancillary service; Commercial building; Energy-constrained; Feedback controller; Hierarchical approach; Product characteristics; Robust optimization; Transmission system operators; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955060621

Little energy needs to be expended to overcome potential energy changes, but a great deal is lost through friction and low-efficiency energy conversion. Hydrogen would be ideal as a synthetic fuel because it is lightweight, highly abundant and its oxidation product (water) is environmentally benign, but storage remains a problem. The clean way to produce hydrogen from water is to use sunlight in combination with photovoltaic cells and water electrolysis, although other forms of primary energy and other water-splitting processes are generally used. The chemical energy per mass of hydrogen is at least three times larger than that of other chemical fuels. Hydrogen adsorbs at solid surfaces depending on the applied pressure and temperature. The variation of attractive surface forces as a function of distance from the surface decides whether van der Waals-type weak physisorption of molecular hydrogen occurs, or whether dissociation and chemisorption of atomic hydrogen takes place. For storage purposes in mobile applications, the adsorption of hydrogen has been studied mainly on carbon species, but light and reasonably cheap materials of high surface area should prove to be attractive as well. In this work nanocomposites with sulfonated poly(ether imide) and faujasite-type zeolite doped with aluminium were prepared using different amounts of nanoparticles. Their morphology and hydrogen storage capacity were evaluated. Hydrogen sorption tests were carried out and there was a significant increase in the amount of hydrogen to the composite relative to the one without aluminum. Considering previous results it is scientifically interesting to continue research on the interaction of hydrogen with different and well-characterized polymer-based nanocomposites. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995785885

Current transactional schedulers are designed with performance in mind, leaving unattended other important metrics such as energy consumption. In order to address this important concern, this paper presents a novel heuristic, called Dynamic Serializer (DS), for scheduling transactions with the aim of reducing energy consumption and improving the energy-delay product (EDP) of transactional applications. DS serializes the execution by choosing either a spinlock or mutex according to a dynamic profile based on abort rates. The idea is to use a spinlock when a transaction is likely to succeed in the near future, since spinning while waiting for the lock is faster than blocking as in the case of a mutex. On the other hand, a mutex is used in case transactions need to wait a long time before resuming because in this case energy can be saved by blocking a thread and enabling the processor Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to act. DS exploits this tradeoff to improve the EDP of transactional programs. Experimental results with an Intel Core i7 with 8 logical threads and the STAMP benchmark show an EDP improvement of up to 17% and an average of 4.9% compared to LUTS-Dynamic, a state-of-the-art scheduling heuristic for transactional systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Scheduling; Storage allocation (computer); Systems analysis; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy delay product; Energy-aware scheduling; Reducing energy consumption; Scheduling heuristics; Transaction scheduling; Transactional memory; Transactional systems; Power management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000785530

Although many WSN-based SHM systems have been deployed, we notice that the design of many systems has deviated from the real requirements in SHM. For example, many systems focus on energy-efficiency, which is however not the requirements for many SHM applications where only a-few-hour data collection is required. A large portion of the existing systems strives to improve wireless throughput, which we believe, is not a viable approach for data-intensive SHM applications. On the other hand, some real requirements in SHM, such as high-frequency and synchronized sensing with real-time onboard data storage, fast, reliable and unified wakeup of sensor nodes in the presence of some events, and embedding efficient and effective SHM algorithms in resource-limited sensor nodes, etc., have not been fully addressed.

According to the Design Space Exploration (DSE) of the proposed MAC unit, a MAC instance with four accumulator registers (MAC4reg) is selected as a good choice for target kernels. In this paper, a 64-PE 16-bit (processing element) SIMD instance without MAC support is taken as the baseline. For a head-to-head comparison, a 64-PE 16-bit SIMD with MAC4reg (MacSim4) and the baseline SIMD are all implemented in HDL and synthesized with a TSMC 40nm low-power library. Five streaming application kernels are mapped to both architectures. Our experimental results show with MAC4reg the runtime and energy consumption are reduced up to 38% and 42% respectively. Besides, a 4-layer CNN-based detection application is also fully mapped onto the proposed MacSim4. Working at 950MHz, MacSim4 reaches a throughput of 62.4 GOPS, which meets the requirement of real-time (720P HD, 30fps) detection. The energy consumption per PE per operation is very low, 4.7pJ/Op excluding SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and 4.8pJ/Op including a 2k-entry SRAM bank. As a prototype, the proposed SIMD is mapped into an FPGA and can run all the kernels. © 2016 IEEE.","High Performance; Loop Tiling; Low Power; MAC; SIMD","Cache memory; Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Random access storage; Systems analysis; Color space conversion; Design space exploration; High Performance; Loop tiling; Low Power; SIMD; Single-instruction multiple-data architectures; Static random access memory; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999017247

This battery sizing composes vehicle conceptual sizing equation. This method is useful for an assessment of Solar Powered UAS use in specific missions and serving as a start point for a more detailed design.

In this scenario, electric traction, with its inherent zero local emissions, high efficiency and improved operational performance (acceleration and hill climbing potential), emerges as a desired option for public transport systems. Transit buses, the prevailing transport system in cities, and, hence, strong contributors to traffic environmental impact on urban areas, can reduce considerably their environment burden with the use of electric traction. This means less local pollutants, specially particulate matter - PM and nitrogen oxides - NOx, currently the ""Achilles heel"" of diesel engines, as well as CO2 greenhouse emissions - GHG. The so called autonomous electric bus - e-bus, i.e. that one independent of electric grid, fed while running solely by an energy storage device - ESD (batteries, ultracapacitor, flywheel) and charged at bus stops into the so called ""opportunity charge"" concept emerges as the best option for short range/medium demand corridors in downtown areas, as enables a low vehicle space and weight impairment for ESD assembly, in benefit of passenger capacity and operational performance. The so called ultracapacitors or supercapacitors are energy storage devices based mainly on the highly reversible electrostatic double layer capacitance, formed at the interface between an electrode and an electrolyte solution. Their charge and discharge process, in contrast to battery technologies (based on chemical reactions), occurs upon the movement of ions. With no chemical bonds being made or broken, very fast charge and discharge processes are possible, even at low temperatures, with lifecycle of over 1 million cycles with minimal degradation, albeit at a lower energy density than batteries. These features favor ultracapacitor use in high power burst charge (charge at bus stops and regenerative brake) and discharge (acceleration and uphill climbing) regimes, typical of ""stop and go"" urban cycles. In this context, ultracapacitor buses appears as a promising technology to be used in short range central bus routes, in which e-bus runs solely with ultracapacitor ESS (without batteries) and can travel along its route with few seconds' ultrafast charging (up to 500 kw) events at predetermined bus stops or a single, few minutes' charge each time upon returning to its terminal (depending on the duty cycle and air conditioning use). This work is supposed to present an overview of ultracapacitor basics technology and an evaluation of the applicability of this groundbreaking cutting edge technology into central short range transit bus market, followed by a technical evaluation of some prototypes ultracapacitor bus experiences currently in test in Europe and China. © 2016 SAE International.",,"Air conditioning; Bond strength (chemical); Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Capacitor storage; Charging (batteries); Diesel engines; Electric discharges; Electric traction; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrostatic devices; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Land vehicle propulsion; Nitrogen oxides; Proven reserves; Secondary batteries; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Alternative propulsion systems; Charge and discharge; Cutting edge technology; Electrolyte solutions; Electrostatic double layer; Environmental concerns; Operational performance; Public transport systems; Supercapacitor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020495847

In this contribution, we describe the first synthesis of a novel family of structurally well-defined PILs functionalized with catechol/pyrogallol/phenol pendants by organometallic-mediated radical polymerization (OMRP) using an alkyl-cobalt(III) complex as initiator and mediating agent. The living character of the chains is also exploited to produce di- and triblock PILs, and the facile counteranion exchange reactions afforded a library of PILs-bearing free phenol/catechol/pyrogallol moieties. Electrochemical investigations of catechol/pyrogallol-derived PILs in aqueous medium demonstrated the characteristic catechol to o-quinone transformations, whereas, quasi-reversible doping/undoping with supporting electrolyte cations (Li+/tetrabutylammonium+) has been observed in organic media, suggesting a bright future for this new family of redox-active PILs as cathode material for secondary energy storage devices. Also, pendant catechol/pyrogallol groups mediated sustained anchoring onto the gold surface conferred PILs properties to the interface. As a proof-of-concept, both the adsorption and inhibition of proteins on polymer modified surfaces have been demonstrated in real time using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation technique. The exquisite physicochemical tunability of these innovative surface- and redox-active PILs makes them excellent candidates for a broad range of potential applications, including ""smart surfaces"" and electrochemical energy storage devices. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Cathodes; Cobalt compounds; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Organometallics; Phenols; Redox reactions; Cath-ode materials; Controlled synthesis; Electrochemical energy storage devices; Electrochemical investigations; Poly(ionic liquid)s; Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation techniques; Supporting electrolyte; Tunable properties; Ionic liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994048434

The design of such systems is further constrained by increasing leakages due to technology scaling and/or increased data retention requirements. These conflicting requirements make leakage reduction of digital logic and SRAM a primary objective for efficient system realization. In this work, we discuss the effectiveness of advance leakage reduction techniques in 40nm (HYT technology) for SRAM and digital logic. For SRAM memory, adding error correction coding (ECC) to the memory subsystem can provide new trade-offs which will be advantageous for these low-duty cycle systems. We show that decreasing the data retention voltage while preventing errors using ECC will help decrease the leakage current by 45% (leakage power by 70% for SRAM). For the digital logic, test and simulation data shows that reverse body biasing (RBB) can reduce the logic leakage current by ∼3x in the worst case process and temperature conditions. However, it should be carefully implemented as RBB causes increase in leakage current at nominal temperatures due to higher junction currents. Moreover, the asymmetric biasing where PMOS is biased by 0.7V and NMOS by 0.3V provides optimum results. RBB can also help reducing the switching energy at low frequency due to increased contribution of leakage to total energy compare to conventional technologies. We also show that increasing the gate length by 20% can help reduce the leakage current by 2x while there is minimal penalty on dynamic power and speed. Combining the asymmetric RBB application and increased gate-length can result in ∼6x leakage reduction. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Computer circuits; Economic and social effects; Error correction; Integrated circuit design; Leakage currents; Microcontrollers; Static random access storage; Systems analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Data retention voltages; Error correction coding; Internet of Things (IOT); Leakage mitigation; Leakage reduction techniques; Low-power microcontrollers; Reverse body biasing; Temperature conditions; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997426717

The system architecture comprises of RF WLAN source, wireless channel, an efficient dual band microstrip patch antenna, an impedance matching network, 4-stage voltage rectifier and a storing circuit. Matching network ensures the maximum power transfer from source to load. HSMS-2850 Schottky diodes are used in rectifier design, which provide low forward voltage and low substrate leakage. The proposed system design is used to analyze the effect of distance on RF power obtained at receiving side. The size of storage capacitor is chosen carefully such that it can store sufficient amount of charge and takes reasonable charging time. Moreover, the circuit parameters are varied to optimize the designed circuit that provides the maximum efficiency of 45% and 22% at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz respectively, at a distance of 1 meter from source. Simulated results show that for received RF power of 5 dBm the system can provide 1.3 mW power across 10 kω load, which can be enough to energize the low power devices.

Counter electrode (CE), which is an important component in DSSCs, functions as an electron transfer agent as well as the regenerator of redox couple. Hitherto, various methods and materials were used to prepare different counter electrodes.Among these materials, conducting polymers have been widely investigated and employed in various applications such as sensors, supercapacitors, energy storage devices, DSSCs and others. In this study, Polythiophene (PTh) conducting polymer was successfully synthesized by electrochemical deposition method, and employed as an alternative to expensive platinum (Pt) CE for DSSC. Besides, PTh conducting polymer was electrochemically deposited via cyclic voltammetry method on FTO substrates. The morphology of the PTh film was characterized by SEM and AFM. Finally, the photovoltaic performance of PTh CE based DSSC was compared with PEDOT CE based device.

Because of omission of thermo-mechanical steps that are present in any traditional energy conversion technology (e.g. gas turbine) fuel cells show increased efficiency in comparison. Compact sizes and modular scalability predestines this technology for distributed energy generation including but not limited to renewable energy sources (e.g. wind, solar). Fuel cells technology also addresses other very important part of distributed renewable energy generation. Because of the unreliable energy production rates and the usual for renewable energy sources mismatch between energy supply and demand, some sort of energy storage is needed to store surplus of produced energy and release it when needed. Reversible fuel cells, that generate hydrogen from available surplus of energy and then generate energy from that stored fuel when needed are cheaper and more ecologically friendly alternative to usually used batteries. This technology is still under development, including research at IEn OC CEREL. In the early development of reversible fuel cells, new types of nickel oxide and porosity forming carbon was evaluated for this task.

ETS is the technology of converting off-peak electricity into heat and using it in household heating 24 h a day. An ETS system is comprised of electric heating elements which are embedded within a high-density solid matrix. Since the thermal energy is stored in the solid matrix during off-peak hours and is discharged during peak hours, it results in significant savings in the household heating cost. A numerical model is developed to analyze the performance of the ETS unit, the central component of the presented system. The energy conservation equations for the solid matrix and air domains are formulated. Solid matrix is modeled as a porous medium, where radial heat conduction is neglected. The governing system of differential equations with boundary and initial conditions is solved using the Finite Volume Method. The developed model allows determining the air temperature at the outlet of the Electric Thermal Storage unit. Despite the simplified assumptions considered in the numerical model formulation, a good coincidence of the computation results with experimental data is reached.

In this work, a rapid charging tube-in-tank LTES system is developed by applying a compact spiral coil tube and paraffin/expanded graphite composite PCM with a high thermal conductivity simultaneously. Numerical simulation coupling heat transfer at the solid-liquid interface is used to investigate the thermal energy storage performance of the LTES system and the results show a good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that heat transfer temperature difference has a great influence on performance of the LTES system, while Reynolds number has a relatively little effect especially when Reynolds number is higher than 8700. Besides, the optimal ratio of the helix radius of the spiral coil tube to the radius of the PCM tank is confirmed to be between 0.53 and 0.64. Moreover, increasing bulk density of the composite PCM can bring about a shorter thermal energy storage time.

The MILP model does so by optimising the area of roof mounted flat plate solar thermal collectors and the volume of thermal energy storage that are required to minimise the annual capital and operational cost of the overall energy system. A new formulation of the MILP is presented in which the model is decomposed into two sub-modules that are iteratively solved. One module determines the optimal sizing of the solar thermal collectors and storage tank. The other module optimises the hourly energy production of the solar collectors based on the impact that the collector inlet stream temperature has on the collector efficiency. This iterative formulation is compared to both a conventional MILP formulation and a dynamic simulation model to determine if the iterative formulation results in a design tool that is able to accurately represent the dynamic behaviour of a solar domestic hot water system, while maintaining the computational tractability and scalability of the model. The novel iterative MILP formulation is applied to a case study of an apartment building in Rheinfelden, Switzerland. The results indicate that conventional MILP formulations overestimate the amount of energy that solar thermal collectors are able to produce, resulting in an oversizing of the required thermal storage tank. However, the iterative MILP model more accurately predicts the energy production of the solar collector, leading to the more realistic sizing of the component technologies. This result is important when evaluating the financial feasibility of solar thermal collector systems in comparison to other renewable generation technologies, as an overestimation of the generation potential of solar thermal collectors may result in an incorrect assessment of their investment attractiveness. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","MILP; Optimisation; Solar thermal; Thermal energy storage","Apartment houses; Collector efficiency; Energy storage; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Investments; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Water; Waterworks; Computational tractability; MILP; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimisations; Renewable generation technologies; Solar domestic hot water systems; Solar thermal; Integer programming; energy; linear programing; optimization; simulation; solar power; storage tank; stream; temperature profile; thermal power; Aargau; Rheinfelden; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982741617

In this work, we report a commercial membrane (VANADion), consisting of a porous layer and a dense Nafion layer, as a promising alternative to Nafion 115. In the dual-layer structure, the porous layer (∼210 μm) can offer a high ionic conductivity and the dense Nafion layer (∼20 μm) can depress the convective flow of electrolyte through the membrane. By comparing with the conventional Nafion 115 in a VRFB, it is found that the change from the conventional Nafion 115 to the composite one results in an increase in the energy efficiency from 71.3% to 76.2% and an increase in the electrolyte utilization from 54.1% to 68.4% at a current density of as high as 240 mA cm−2. In addition, although two batteries show the comparable cycling performance at current densities ranging from 80 mA cm−2 to 240 mA cm−2, the composite membrane is estimated to be significantly cheaper than the conventional Nafion 115 due to the fact that the porous layer is rather cost-effective and the dense Nafion layer is rather thin. The impressive combination of desirable performance and low cost makes this composite membrane highly promising in the VRFB applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage; Flow battery; Performance evaluation; VANADion","Composite membranes; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Membranes; Ohmic contacts; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Commercial membranes; Convective flow; Cycling performance; Dual layer structure; Ohmic resistance; Performance evaluation; VANADion; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries; composite; cost analysis; electrolyte; energy efficiency; membrane; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; redox conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982676267

Methods C57Bl/6 mice received a control (C) or a high-fat diet (H) and half of them had free access to a running wheel 5 days/week (CE and HE, respectively) for 10 weeks. Energy intake, nonexercise activity (global activity, distance covered and average speed of displacement in the home cage) and energy expenditure (EE) were evaluated at weeks 5 and 10 during the 2 days without the wheels. Results High-fat diet increased weight gain in H (110%) and HE (60%) groups compared to C and CE groups, respectively, with no effect of exercise. Wheel running increased energy intake (26% CE, 11% HE in week 5; 7% CE, 45% HE in week 10) and decreased distance covered (26% for both CE and HE in week 5; 35% CE and 13% HE in week 10) and average speed (35% CE and 13% HE in week 5; 45% CE and 18% HE in week 10) compared to the respective nonexercised groups. In week 10 there was an interaction between diet and exercise for global activity, which was reduced nearly 18% in CE, H, and HE groups compared to C. Access to a running wheel increased EE in week 5 (11% CE and 16% HE) but not in week 10, which is consistent with the period of highest running (number of turns: weeks 1–5 nearly 100% > weeks 6–10 for CE and HE groups). EE was reduced in H (19%) and HE (12%) groups compared to C and CE, in week 10. Conclusion Voluntary running causes a compensatory decrease in nonexercise activity and an increase in energy intake, both contributing to the lack of effect of exercise on body mass. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Compensation; Energy homeostasis; High-fat diet; Spontaneous physical activity; Voluntary exercise","animal experiment; animal model; Article; body mass; caloric intake; controlled study; energy expenditure; exercise; lean body weight; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; running; velocity; weight reduction; adipose tissue; adverse effects; animal; body weight; C57BL mouse; calorimetry; disease model; energy metabolism; metabolism; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; time factor; leptin; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Weight; Calorimetry; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Leptin; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981239950

Photoluminescence, thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence spectra were recorded and discussed together with thermoluminescent glow curves. The Pr3+ and Tb3+ ions constitute luminescent centers and participate in the energy storage. However, as the thermoluminescence glow curves showed, the Ti, Hf and Nb co-dopants have a significant impact on glow curve pattern, in particular on the temperature at which the maximum thermoluminescence occurred. For the Tb,Ti and Pr,Ti as well as for the Pr,Nb one main TL peak appeared around 360–370 °C. For other compositions it varied from 210 °C for Tb,Nb, through 230 °C for Tb,Hf to 250 °C for Pr,Hf. In either case additional TL components of lower intensities were observed. They spread over 50–450 °C. The TL data led to the conclusion that the co-dopant – a necessary component to induce a significant energy storage capacity in the materials – may not be directly involved in trapping the excited carriers. Instead, it may rather generate other point defects which, individually or as clusters, would do the work. Energy storage was found to be connected with an appearance of an induced excitation/absorption band spreading over around 350–500 nm and peaking near 400 nm. A prolonged stimulation into this band caused green (for Tb-series) or red (for Pr-series) optically stimulated emission. Such a stimulation allows entirely bleaching out the induced absorption. The optically stimulated luminescence for all members of the Tb-series led to luminescence from both C2 and C3i sites offered by the host lattice. All compositions of the Pr-series produced optically stimulated emissions upon 400 nm radiation only by means of the Pr3+ occupying the C2 site. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Defects; Energy storage; Lu2O3; Optically stimulated luminescence; Thermoluminescence",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970024569

The cleanness and planar growth of all layers was checked in-situ, immediately after deposition by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Planar growth was also revealed in ex-situ studies by Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy. In the case of the trilayers the bottom and the top Fe sublayers were deposited in different deposition conditions to obtain relatively high difference in their coercive fields.

Soil physical quality (SPQ) indices are not an exception to this rule. There is no unique revealing parameter or index that enables evaluating soil structure. In high-intensity biomass production systems, SPQ indices are useful tools for management decisions because they indicate the sustainability of soil organic matter dynamics, drainage, infiltration, heat transfer, and storage processes. This work examines five energy parameters and two hydraulic energy functions for evaluating physical quality in terrestrial vegetative ecosystems. These indices are based on numerical integration of the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and on soil water content at field capacity, and they manifest the absolute aeration energy, the absolute water retention energy, the relative aeration energy, the relative water retention energy, and the relative air-water energy. This integration technique includes the use of all points of the SWRC. A script for fitting the parameters of the van Genuchten equation and for solving all the presented indices in this work was developed and made available. The energy indices and hydraulic functions were derived and validated for SWRCs, from several German, US, and Brazilian soils under different management, comparing them with other previously published SPQ indices. Our findings reveal that the energy indices and functions can be applied to assess the energy associated with the soil physical structure. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Air; Chemical analysis; Decision support systems; Heat transfer; Soil moisture; Soils; Biological variables; Integration techniques; Management decisions; Numerical integrations; Qualitative analysis; Soil organic matter dynamics; Soil physical quality; Soil water retention curves; Function evaluation; aeration; energy; heat transfer; hydraulic property; infiltration; physical property; soil drainage; soil management; soil organic matter; soil quality; soil structure; soil water; water content; water retention; biomass; drainage; hydraulics; index method; qualitative analysis; sustainability; Brazil; Germany; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991593704

The research team comprises the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), embodied by the European Commission, DG Energy, Directorate EURATOM Safeguards; the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB); two universities; and several United States national laboratories. The Next Generation of Safeguards Initiative–Spent Fuel project team is working to achieve the following technical goals more easily and efficiently than in the past using nondestructive assay measurements of spent fuel assemblies: (1) verify the initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time of facility declaration; (2) detect the diversion or replacement of pins, (3) estimate the plutonium mass, (4) estimate the decay heat, and (5) determine the reactivity of spent fuel assemblies. This study focuses on spectrally resolved gamma-ray measurements performed on a diverse set of 50 assemblies [25 pressurized water reactor (PWR) assemblies and 25 boiling water reactor (BWR) assemblies]; these same 50 assemblies will be measured with neutron-based NDA instruments and a full-length calorimeter. Given that encapsulation/repository and dry storage safeguards are the primarily intended applications, the analysis focused on the dominant gamma-ray lines of 137Cs, 154Eu, and 134Cs because these isotopes will be the primary gamma-ray emitters during the time frames of interest to these applications. This study addresses the impact on the measured passive gamma-ray signals due to the following factors: burnup, initial enrichment, cooling time, assembly type (eight different PWR and six different BWR fuel designs), presence of gadolinium rods, and anomalies in operating history. To compare the measured results with theory, a limited number of ORIGEN-ARP simulations were performed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Burnup; Cooling time; Final disposal; Gamma spectroscopy; Germanium detector; Non-destructive assay; Nuclear safeguards; Passive gamma; Spent fuel","Boiling water reactors; Cooling; Fuels; Human resource management; Nondestructive examination; Pressurized water reactors; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Waste management; Burn up; Cooling time; Final disposals; Gamma spectroscopy; Germanium detector; Nondestructive assay; Nuclear Safeguards; Passive gamma; Gamma rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979497436

In this work, hierarchical carbon coated WO3 (WO3/C) with a unique mesoporous structure and metal-organic framework derived nitrogen-doped carbon hollow polyhedra (MOF-NC) are prepared and adopted as the anode and the cathode for Li-HSCs. The hierarchical mesoporous WO3/C microspheres assembled by radially oriented WO3/C nanorods along the (001) plane enable effective Li+ insertion, thus exhibit high capacity, excellent rate performance and a long cycling life due to their high Li+ conductivity, electronic conductivity and structural robustness. The WO3/C structure shows a reversible specific capacity of 508 mA h g-1 at a 0.1 C rate (1 C = 696 mA h g-1) after 160 discharging-charging cycles with excellent rate capability. The MOF-NC achieved the specific capacity of 269.9 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1. At a high current density of 6 A g-1, 92.4% of the initial capacity could be retained after 2000 discharging-charging cycles, suggesting excellent cycle stability.

The viscoelastic effects due to dynamic asymmetry between bitumen and polymer are represented in the model by introducing a composition-dependent mobility coefficient. A double-well potential for PMB system is proposed on the basis of the Flory-Huggins free energy of mixing, with some simplifying assumptions made to take into account the complex chemical composition of bitumen. The model has been implemented in a finite element software package for pseudo-binary PMBs and calibrated with experimental observations of three different PMBs. Parametric studies have been conducted. Simulation results indicate that all the investigated model parameters, including the mobility and gradient energy coefficients, interaction and dilution parameters, have specific effects on the phase separation process of an unstable PMB. In addition to the unstable cases, the model can also describe and predict stable PMBs. Moreover, the phase inversion phenomenon with increasing polymer content in PMBs is also well reproduced by the model. This model can be the foundation of an applicable numerical tool for prediction of PMB storage stability and phase separation behaviour. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Phase separation; Phase-field method; Polymer modified bitumen; Storage stability","Bituminous materials; Finite element method; Forecasting; Free energy; Numerical methods; Phase interfaces; Phase transitions; Polymers; Separation; Viscoelasticity; Finite element software; Flory-huggins free energies; Gradient energy coefficients; Phase field methods; Phase-separation process; Polymer-modified bitumen; Simplifying assumptions; Storage stability; Phase separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974808182

With the purpose of achieving nanocomposites with high dielectric constant, low loss and high breakdown strength, our group has focused on the microstructure construction of nanoparticles and grafting modification of polymer matrix. Various hybrids of metal nanoparticles randomly deposited on the surface of ceramic particles were prepared, including BaTiO3-supported Ag (BT-Ag), BaTiO3-suported Cu with a capping layer (BT-Cu), and BaTiO3 nano fiber-supported Ag (BTnf-Ag). The hybrid particles serving as filler in composites have effectively improved the dielectric constant and suppressed the increase of dielectric loss.

JEDEC member companies indicate that parallel memory protocols will remain key to such memories, though widening the bus (increasing the pin count) to address larger capacities would cause multiple issues ultimately reducing the speed (the peak data rate) and cost-efficiency of the protocols. Thus to stay high-speed and cost-efficient, parallel memory protocols should address larger capacities using the available number of pins. This is accomplished by multiplexing the pins to transfer each address in multiple bus cycles, implementing Multi-Cycle Addressing (MCA). However, additional address-transfer cycles can significantly worsen performance and energy efficiency. This paper contributes with the concept of adaptive row addressing that comprises row-address caching to reduce the number of address-transfer cycles, enhanced by row-address prefetching and an adaptive row-access priority policy to improve state-of-the-art memory schedulers. For a case-study MCA protocol, the paper shows that the proposed concept improves: i) the read latency by 7.5% on average and up to 12.5%, and ii) the system-level performance and energy efficiency by 5.5% on average and up to 6.5%. This way, adaptive row addressing makes the MCA protocol as efficient as an idealistic protocol of the same speed but with enough pins to transfer each row address in a single bus cycle. © 2016 ACM.","Address bus; Energy; Fairness; Memory-request scheduling; Parallel memory protocols; Performance; Row-address width","Buses; Costs; Digital storage; Memory architecture; Scheduling; Address bus; Energy; Fairness; Parallel memory; Performance; Request scheduling; Row-address width; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995460846

Buildings must be, according the plan, nearly zero energy and should reach this goal by implementing cost-effective (passive-) measures for a high energy performance and application of sustainable energy source(s) for the remaining demand. In this research, a study is done on recently completed Dutch sustainable and nearly zero energy buildings, from which can be concluded that the goal from the Energy Performance of Building Directive now is rarely met. Most buildings use aquifer thermal storage system with a heat pump and thermal activated building systems. However, to really meet the nearly zero energy and low CO2 emissions goal, in 2019 for public buildings and 2021 for all buildings, more focus is needed from the design teams in the early design phase toward cost-effective solutions. Life cycle costs are an important decision driver for achieving a cost-effective, nearly zero energy building. A new method, which incorporates additional benefits as productivity increase, sick leave reductions, Public Relations, and higher renting value, reveals that then an “economic optimal nearly zero energy building” can be met easier in the near future.

One of the major challenges for the implementation of these technologies is the energy efficiency. Empirical enhancement of plasma reactors' performance has proven to be insufficient in this regard. Numerical models are therefore becoming essential to get insight into the process for optimization purposes. The chemistry in non-Thermal plasmas is the most challenging and complex part of the model due to the large number of species and reactions involved. The most recent reaction kinetics model for carbon dioxide (CO2) dissociation in non-Thermal microwave plasma considers more than one hundred species and thousands of reactions. To enable the implementation of this model into multidimensional simulations, a new reduction methodology to simplify the state-To-state kinetic model is presented. It is based on four key elements: 1) all the asymmetric vibrational levels are lumped within a single group or fictitious species, 2) this group follows a non-equilibrium Treanor distribution, 3) an algebraic approximation is used to compute the vibrational temperature from the translational temperature based on the Landau-Teller formula and 4) weighted algebraic expressions are applied, instead of complex differential equations, to calculate the rates of the most influencing reactions; this decreases substantially the calculation time. Using this new approach, the dissociation and vibrational kinetics are captured in a reduced set of 44 reactions among 13 species. The predictions of the reduced kinetic model regarding the concentrations of the heavy species in the afterglow zone are in good agreement with those of the detailed model from which the former was derived. The methodology may also be applied to other state-To-state kinetic models in which interactions of vibrational levels have the largest share in the global set of reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051323739

This paper proposes a novel bidirectional nonisolated multi-input converter (MIC) topology for hybrid systems to be used in electric vehicles composed of energy storage systems (ESSs) with different electrical characteristics. The proposed converter has the ability to control the power of ESSs by allowing active power sharing. The voltage levels of utilized ESSs can be higher or lower than the output voltage. The inductors of the converter are connected to a single switch; therefore, the converter requires only one extra active switch for each input, unlike its counterparts, hence resulting in reduced element count. The proposed MIC topology is compared with its counterparts concerning various parameters. It is analyzed in detail, and then, this analysis is validated by simulation and through a 1-kW prototype based on a battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Batteries; bidirectional; hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs); multi-input converter (MIC); ultracapacitors (UCs)","Electric inverters; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Microwave integrated circuits; Solar cells; Topology; bidirectional; Electrical characteristic; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy system; Input voltage sources; Multiinput; Ultracapacitors; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018288650

Possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions and related costs at the largest Brazilian refinery have been estimated. The abatement costs related to energy saving options are negative, meaning that feasibility exists without specific income due to emission reductions. The assessment shows that short-term mitigation options, i.e., fuel substitution and energy efficiency measures, could reduce CO2 emissions by 6% of the total current refinery emissions. It is further shown that carbon capture and storage offers the greatest potential for more significant emission reductions in the longer term (up to 43%), but costs in the range of 64 to162 US$/t CO2, depending on the CO2 emission source (regenerators of FCC units or hydrogen production units) and the CO2 capture technology considered (oxyfuel combustion or post-combustion).

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The synthesis of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic is based on a mechanical activation method. The following sintering at 1273 K ascertains the Bi4Ti3O12 appears to be of single phase crystallizes in orthorhombic form, whose conductivity is determined from the dielectric function in the context of Kramers-Kronig relation on which of this is measured in the frequency domain at varying temperatures. The evaluation of conductivity data is mainly in terms of activation energy. Findings: We find that the separately discussed dc and ac conductivities in similar manner are best isolated into two distinct temperature regions. Charge transport by hopping to the target localized states is the relevant conduction mechanism in bringing insights into the dynamic responses. Variable range and small polaron hopping models associated with the adiabatic small polaron are the decent choices, each of which explaining the dc conductions in these temperature regions. The former involves distant hops, whereas the latter denotes as nearest-neighbour hopping. The percolation treatments applied in the dc conductivity yield promising results if different percolation expressions are used. The correlation between dc and ac conductions for each temperature is irrefutably made through the Barton-Nakajima-Namikawa fitting. In frequency dependence ac regions, the thermally activated hopping carriers are transported in a correlated to a random manner between preferred sites. Performing a Summerfield ac scaling in these temperature regions leads to different scenarios in view of time-temperature superposition principle. Applications/Improvements: Further experiments are encouraged to support the hopping conduction mechanisms from another aspect in order to prompt the use as energy storage function in the electromagnetic application.","Bi4Ti3O12; Charge Carriers; Conductivity; Ferroelectric Ceramic; Hopping Conduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010755544

However, energy harvesting powered embedded systems suffer from frequent execution interruption due to unstable energy supply. To bridge intermittent program execution across different power cycles, non-volatile processor (NVP) was proposed to checkpoint register contents during power failure. Together with register contents, the cache contents also need to be preserved during power failure. While pure non-volatile memory (NVM) based cache is an intuitive option, it suffers from inferior performance due to high write latency and energy overhead. In this paper, we will propose replacement and checkpoint policies for SRAM and NVM based hybrid cache in NVPs whose execution is interrupted frequently. Checkpointing aware cache replacement polices and smart checkpointing polices are proposed to achieve satisfactory performance and efficient checkpointing upon a power failure and fast resumption when power returns. The experimental results show that the proposed architectures and polices outperform existing cache architectures for NVPs. © 2016 ACM.","Checkpointing; Energy harvesting; Hybrid cache; IoT; Non-volatile processor","Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Hardware; Hardware-software codesign; Internet of things; Program processors; Reconfigurable hardware; Static random access storage; Cache architecture; Cache replacement; Check pointing; Hybrid caches; Internet of Things (IOT); Non-volatile; Non-volatile memory; Proposed architectures; Outages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995387412

Therefore, our aim was to test key drivers of β-diversity patterns along a strong, natural environmental gradient for seven widely different organisms groups, that is, root-Associated fungi, litter fungi, soil nematodes, vascular plants, epiphytic lichens, beetles, and spiders. Using previously published community-level data from boreal-forested islands, we calculated α-diversity and β-diversity for each of the seven organism groups. Out of several available environmental variables, we identified four variables, that is, ecosystem age, total C storage, net primary productivity (NPP), and N-To-P ratio, as potential predictors of variation in β-diversity. We found that ecosystem age was the variable with the highest overall importance. We then used two different methods to quantify the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes underlying patterns in β-diversity along the ecosystem age gradient, and our detailed knowledge based on prior data collection in the study system to mechanistically explain among-group differences in these patterns. We found divergent responses in β-diversity along the age gradient for the seven different organism groups, due to among-group differences in the relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic community assembly, and attributed these results to reliance on resources from different energy channels that are not always related to NPP. Our results highlight the necessity to consider the importance of taxon-specific resources, and not only NPP, to obtain an understanding of β-diversity patterns among organism groups and ecosystems, as well as large-scale patterns in biodiversity. They therefore also suggest that management and protection of β-biodiversity in the landscape requires explicit consideration of a wide range of habitats. © 2016 Jonsson et al.","Beetles; Biodiversity; Deterministic Processes; Fungi; Lichens; Nematodes; Spiders; Stochastic Processes; Vascular Plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993927140

In an electricity system with high shares of IRES implemented in the network, energy balancing like storage is needed to secure grid stability and smooth demand satisfaction. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) is at this moment the best option for large scale storage. Switzerland has strong ambitions to further develop their PHS sector and become the battery of Europe. In this research, the potential of the Swiss PSH plants is explored, whilst taking inflow into the upper reservoirs of the PHS plants into consideration. To simulate electricity imbalance, Germany is used as a case study. Germany already has a high penetration of IRES and has plans to increase installed IRES capacity. By using an energy planning model (PowerPlan), three future scenarios of the German electricity system were designed, each with a different set of IRES installed (solar, mixed and wind). Results show that the Swiss battery ambition offers most benefits to a wind-oriented scenario, reducing both shortages as well as surpluses. Water inflow in Swiss PHS-reservoirs is of minor importance when looking at security of supply, although it was shown that the solar-scenario profits more from inflow in terms of system stability. However, a potential conflict was observed in the solar-scenario between the need for electricity storage and the storage of natural inflow, resulting in more surpluses in the system when inflow was taken into account. © 2016, The Author(s).","Germany; Intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES); Local hydrology; Pumped hydro storage (PHS); Scenarios; Switzerland","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; System stability; Germany; Pumped hydro storage (PHS); Renewable energy source; Scenarios; Switzerland; Pumped storage power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992753536

We hypothesized that the circulating redox metabolome is a master metabolic regulatory system that impacts all organs and modulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, energy production and changes in lipid turnover in many cells including adipocytes. Methods Differentiated human preadipocytes were exposed to the redox couples, lactate (L) and pyruvate (P), ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB) and acetoacetate (Acoc), and the thiol-disulfides cysteine/ cystine (Cys/CySS) and GSH/GSSG for 1.5-4 hours. ROS measurements were done with CM-H2DCFDA. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was assessed by a modification of the thiobarbituric acid method. Lipolysis was measured as glycerol release. Lipid synthesis was measured as 14C-glucose incorporated into lipid. Respiration was assessed using the SeaHorse XF24 analyzer and the proton leak was determined from the difference in respiration with oligomycin and antimycin A. Results Metabolites with increasing oxidation potentials (GSSG, CySS, Acoc) increased adipocyte ROS. In contrast, P caused a decrease in ROS compared with L. Acoc also induced a significant increase in both LPO and lipid synthesis. L and Acoc increased lipolysis. ßOHB increased respiration, mainly due to an increased proton leak. GSSG, when present throughout 14 days of differentiation significantly increased fat accumulation, but not when added later. Conclusions We demonstrated that in human adipocytes changes in the external redox state impacted ROS production, LPO, energy efficiency, lipid handling, and differentiation. A more oxidized state generally led to increased ROS, LPO and lipid turnover and more reduction led to increased respiration and a proton leak. However, not all of the redox couples were the same suggesting compartmentalization. These data are consistent with the concept of the circulating redox metabolome as a master metabolic regulatory system. © 2016 Jones IV et al.

New analytical and approximate solutions are presented for predicting drawdown and buildup sand-face transient temperature behaviors of a fully penetrating vertical well in an infinite-acting homogeneous reservoirs. The solutions account for the effects of Joule-Thomson (J-T) heating/cooling, transient adiabatic fluid expansion/compression, convection, and conduction. The solutions are compared and verified with the solutions from three different non-isothermal simulators that solve the mass and thermal energy balance equations rigorously and simultaneously. The impacts of various parameters such as wellbore storage, skin zone near the wellbore, thermal conductivity, and outer reservoir boundary conditions on the sand-face temperature responses are also investigated and discussed. Drawdown and buildup sand-face temperature data are shown to exhibit three infinite-acting radial flow (IARF) periods (represented by semi-log straight-line equations); early-time IARF reflecting the adiabatic expansion/compression effects in the skin zone if it exists, intermediate-time IARF reflecting the J-T effect in the skin zone, and late-time IARF reflecting the J-T effect in the non-skin zone.

In addition, dispatchable generation resources should be capable of adjusting their power output on a short term basis not only to alleviate uncertainties of nondispatchable generation and load fluctuations but also to correct for forecast errors. This paper presents a long-term planning approach to co-optimize capacities of energy storages and fast-ramping generation. We model and integrate the capability of the storage to provide multiple services for the system. Our formulation takes into account wind generation and demand forecast errors as well as short-term fluctuations. A stochastic optimization problem is formulated consisting of hourly and intrahour time scales. The approach determines the optimal size of newly deployed generation and storage resources to provide adequate generation capacity and ramping needed to support hourly demand. Additionally, our method ensures that the system is capable of following the net load in intrahour time intervals, as well as mitigating the impact of short-term wind power and load fluctuations. In this formulation, power balance, network security, and system ramping capability are stochastic constraints being modeled as chance constraints. A 3-bus and the IEEE 24-bus test systems are studied to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Energy storage; fast-ramping unit; load following; ramping capability; regulation; short-term fluctuations","Energy storage; Forecasting; Optimization; Wind power; Fast-ramping; Load following; ramping capability; regulation; Short term; Network security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988893702

The process consists of two stages: day-ahead, where the dispatch plan is determined by using forecast of the aggregated consumption and local distributed generation (prosumption), and real-time operation, where the mismatch between the actual prosumption realization and dispatch plan is compensated for thanks to adjusting the real power injections of the BESS with model predictive control (MPC). MPC accounts for BESS operational constraints thank to reduced order dynamic grey-box models identified from online measurements.

The main purpose is to find the optimum configuration of the supply chain and DHS to meet the heat demand of a particular locality. The model combines cost and service level objectives and accounts for biomass supply, material flow, capacity, demand and technical constraints. The problem is formulated as a fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that comprises multiple biomass types and system uncertainties. To explore the viability of the proposed model, computational experiments are performed on a real-world case. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the impacts of cost and capacity limit of thermal energy storage, as well as heat demand, on the objective functions and thermal storage capacity.

Rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes and L6G8C5 myocytes were cultured for 48 h in normoxic or hypoxic conditions at the optimal, reduced or increased iron concentration. The mRNA expression levels of markers of apoptosis [B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2; inhibition) and Bcl-2-activated X protein (Bax; induction)], atrophy (Atrogin), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase 2; PKM2) and iron metabolism [transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1; iron importer), ferroportin 1 (FPN1; iron exporter), ferritin heavy chain (FTH; iron storage protein) and hepcidin (HAMP; iron regulator)] were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and cell viability was measured using an tetrazolium reduction assay. Cardiomyocytes and myocytes, when exposed to hypoxia, demonstrated an increased Bax/Bcl-2 gene expression ratio (P<0.05). Additional deferoxamine (DFO) treatment resulted in further increases in Bax/Bcl-2 in each cell type (P<0.001 each) and this was associated with the 15% loss in viability. The analogous alterations were observed in both cell types upon ammonium ferric citrate (AFC) treatment during hypoxia; however, the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and associated viability loss was lower compared with that in case of DFO treatment (P<0.05 each). Under hypoxic conditions, myocytes demonstrated an increased expression of PKM2 (P<0.01). Additional DFO treatment caused an increase in the mRNA expression levels of PKM2 and Atrogin-1 (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively), whereas AFC treatment caused an increased mRNA expression of PKM2 (P<0.01) and accompanied decreased mRNA expression of Atrogin-1 (P<0.05). The expression augmentation of PKM2 during hypoxia was greater upon low iron compared with that of ferric salt treatment (P<0.01). Both cell types upon DFO during hypoxia demonstrated the increased expression of TfR1 and HAMP (all P<0.05), which was associated with the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (all R>0.6 and P<0.05). In conclusion, during hypoxia iron deficiency impairs the viability of cardiomyocytes and myocytes more severely compared with iron excess. In myocytes, during hypoxia iron may act in a protective manner, since the level of atrophy is decreased in the iron-salt-treated cells.","Apoptotic activity; Cardiomyocyte; Hypoxia; Iron deficiency; Iron excess; Iron metabolism genes; Skeletal myocyte","atrogin 1; CD71 antigen; deferoxamine; ferric ammonium citrate; ferritin; ferritin heavy chain; ferroportin 1; hepcidin; iron; messenger RNA; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase 2; unclassified drug; iron; oxygen; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell hypoxia; cell viability; controlled study; energy metabolism; gene expression; iron transport; nonhuman; protein degradation; rat; skeletal muscle cell; animal; apoptosis; cardiac muscle cell; cell hypoxia; cell line; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; skeletal muscle cell; Animals; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line; Gene Expression Regulation; Iron; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxygen; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988515869

Graphene oxide, usually obtained by exfoliating graphite, provides a way towards flexible, low-cost, bulk production paper-like materials known as buckypapers. Recently, graphene oxide and graphene buckypaper have been used as fillers for preparing composites. The buckypapers are freestanding thin porous network of carbon fillers bound by van der Waals interactions. Several techniques have been used to fabricate graphene oxide and graphene-based paper-like materials such as vacuum filtration method; spin coating technique, resin infiltration technique, evaporation-induced, and self-assembly technique. Among these, the most suitable technique is Langmuir-Blodgett assembly, where the graphene oxide paper formed is usually highly uniform. Free standing polymer/graphene oxide and polymer/graphene paper materials show remarkable mechanical stiffness and excellent flexibility combined with outstanding electrical conductivity. Incorporating polymer into graphene oxide and graphene buckypaper may modify the polymer and filler properties producing high performance materials. The buckypaper made from functionalized filler may form networks that facilitate penetrating matrix chains and result in composites with improved mechanical performance. Due to their outstanding physical, thermal, and electrical properties, these papers have promising applications such as; body armour, aerospace structure improvement, armoured vehicles, flexible energy storage devices, sensors, memory devices, transparent conductors, and photovoltaics. © The Author(s) 2015.","Buckypaper; freestanding; graphene; graphene oxide; Langmuir-Blodgett assembly; polymer/graphene paper","Armor; Armored vehicles; Automobile manufacture; Carbon; Filled polymers; Fillers; Military vehicles; Paper; Polymers; Self assembly; Vacuum applications; Vacuum evaporation; Van der Waals forces; Buckypaper; Electrical conductivity; freestanding; Graphene oxides; High performance material; Langmuir-Blodgett assembly; Self-assembly technique; Van Der Waals interactions; Graphene",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985955467

When a combi-storage is used in combination with a heat pump, the temperature stratification efficiency of the storage is a decisive factor for the overall efficiency and thus, for the consumed end-energy of the system. In particular, fluid that is entering the storage with a high velocity may cause considerable mixing, thus, destroying stratification and leading to poor system performance. This work presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of direct horizontal inlets at midheight of a typical solar combi-storage of about 800 L volume. Different inlet diffusor designs were simulated, and laboratory measurements were used to validate CFD experiments. For the given tank geometry, mass flow rates, and inlet position, it is found for a fluid inlet temperature of 30 °C that fluid velocities should be below 0.1 m/s and Reynolds numbers below 3000-5000 at the outlet of the diffusor in order to avoid the disturbance of a hotter 50 °C zone above the inlet. Furthermore, the fluid path within the diffusor must exceed a minimum length that corresponds to three to four times the hydraulic diameter of the diffusor.

However, the low cycle efficiency and the lithium dendrite formation during repeated charge/discharge cycles hinder the practical application of metallic lithium anodes. Herein, we report a distinctive ZrO2/POSS multilayer deposited on PE separators by a simple layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly process to enable excellent rate capability and cycle life of lithium metal batteries. The ZrO2/POSS multilayer on PE separators weakens the solvation effect of lithium ions and significantly enhances the electrolyte uptake of separators, which is responsible for the enhanced ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number, as well as the improved Li/electrolyte interfacial stability. These advantageous characteristics of the resulting PE separators effectively decrease the electrode polarization and protect lithium metal anodes against lithium dendrites formation during repeated charge/discharge cycles, endowing LiCoO2/Li unit cells with both excellent electrochemical performance and high safety.

To achieve expected performance, system sizes in a NZEB must be properly selected. Parameter uncertainties have been proved to have significant impacts on system sizing and need to be systematically considered. Due to complex uncertainty impacts, proper system sizing in a NZEB with multi-criteria performance is always a real challenge. To deal with the challenge, this study presents a genetic algorithm-GA based system sizing method for NZEBs. Taking users’ multi-criteria performance requirements as constraints, the proposed method aims to minimize total system initial costs by selecting proper sizes of five different systems under uncertainties. The five systems include an air-conditioning system, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a thermal energy storage system and an electrical energy storage system. The performance requirements come from three diverse criteria which are zero energy, thermal comfort and grid independence. Using real weather data of 20 years in Hong Kong, the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting proper system sizes corresponding to user specified performance requirements. In addition, the results indicate conventional descriptions of parameter uncertainties need to be improved for better system sizing of NZEBs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Energy storage; Genetic algorithm; Net-zero energy building; System sizing; Uncertainty","Air conditioning; Digital storage; Energy storage; Heat storage; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Wind turbines; Electrical energy storage systems; Net-zero energy buildings; Parameter uncertainty; Performance requirements; Photovoltaic panels; System sizings; Thermal energy storage systems; Uncertainty; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981501490

Under these circumstances, there is a great interest in alternative energy resources, especially those that are able to reduce the emission of atmospheric pollutants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the burning emissions of the following binary mixture and biofuels: commercial diesel (diesel with 5% of biodiesel, B5), pure soy biodiesel (B100), additivated biodiesel (B100 adt) stored at 40 °C for 1, 2, and 3 weeks, and additivated ethanol (Ethanol adt). The burning emissions were evaluated by the levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and total particulate matter (TPM). The quality of the biofuels was given by oxidative stability during storage. The combustion products were originated from a diesel cycle stationary engine, operating in 1800 rpm and 0% load. For a greater reliability in the results, some figures of merit were evaluated for the determination of BTEX by gas chromatography and flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and the particulate matter was determined by gravimetric analysis. Results show that operating time of the engine influences combustion efficiency. During the initial 15 min, cold engine start, there was increasing in BTEX and TPM emissions, when comparing B100 and B5. Regarding to the storage period of 1–2 weeks, B100, B100 adt, and B5 showed reduction of approximately 36%, 16%, and 4% for TPM, respectively. Evaluating each component of BTEX, the benzene emissions were greater for biofuels, which is in agreement with previous studies. As observed for TPM, the storage time of 1–2 weeks was beneficial for the mitigation of aromatic emissions. A reduction about 60% percent was measured for benzene and ethylbenzene. However, these emissions can also be influenced by the engine operating conditions (load and speed), engine type, and characteristics of biofuels. Additivated ethanol also presented low emissions for these pollutants as well as the lowest percentage of emissions of TPM. It is noteworthy that Ethanol adt present the lowest percentage of benzene emission. © 2016","Biodiesel; BTEX; Diesel; Oxidative process; Particulate matter; Vehicular emission","Benzene; Binary mixtures; Climate change; Combustion; Crude oil; Engines; Ethanol; Ethylbenzene; Gas chromatography; Gravimetric analysis; Ionization of gases; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Reliability analysis; BTEX; Diesel; Oxidative process; Particulate Matter; Vehicular emission; Biodiesel; alcohol; benzene; biodiesel; biofuel; diesel fuel; ethylbenzene; ortho xylene; toluene; xylene; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; benzene; biofuel; BTEX; chemical compound; chemical pollutant; climate change; combustion; comparative study; crude oil; ethanol; fossil fuel; oxidation; particulate matter; traffic emission; air pollutant; Article; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; diesel engine; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; particulate matter; priority journal; reliability; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979911457

The electrosynthesis was performed in an aqueous solution of the 3,4-ethylenedioxytiophene (EDOT) monomer and graphene oxide (GOx) without supporting electrolyte. The amount of GOx was optimized to obtain the best electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite material. The just-prepared nanocomposite (pEDOT/GOx) was electrochemically reduced in order to decrease the number of oxygen-rich functional groups on the GOx surface, to increase the amount of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and, in consequence, to increase the electrical conductivity. SEM results show a uniform, wavy and layered structure of the nanocomposite. XPS analysis confirms a partial reduction of functional oxygen groups of GOx and a partial return to the graphene-like sp2 network in the process of electrochemical reduction. A new chemical bond has been detected between sulphur from thiophene rings and oxygen coming from graphene oxide as proof of direct chemical interaction between both components PEDOT and GOx. Electrochemical tests show that the polymer provides an excellent conductive matrix for the graphene oxide. The incorporated graphene oxide, on the other hand, improves the nanocomposite specific surface area. As a result, the nanocomposite exhibits much higher electric capacitance in comparison with the pure polymer or graphene oxide alone. Nanocomposites display fast charging/discharging processes and good electrochemical stability.

Decay activation energy of the radical mostly responsible from central intense resonance line was calculated to be 25.6±1.5 kJ/mol by using the signal intensity decay data derived from annealing studies performed at high temperatures. A linear function of the applied dose was found to describe best the experimental dose-response data. However, the discrimination of irradiated BH from unirradiated one was possible even 3 months after storage at normal conditions. Basing on these findings it was concluded that BH and BH containing drugs could be safely sterilized by gamma radiation and that ESR spectroscopy could be successfully used as a potential technique for monitoring their radiosterilizations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Benzydamine Hydrochloride; Electron Spin Resonance (ESR); Free radical; Radiation sterilization","Activation energy; Digital storage; Electrons; Electrospinning; Free radicals; Ionizing radiation; Magnetic moments; Resonance; Spin dynamics; Sterilization (cleaning); Benzydamine Hydrochloride; Kinetic features; Linear functions; Normal condition; Potential techniques; Radiation sterilization; Radiosterilization; Signal intensities; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; benzydamine; Article; controlled study; dosimetry; drug sterility; drug storage; electron spin resonance; gamma irradiation; high temperature; radiation dose; radiation sterilization; radiosensitivity; room temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978771280

The experimental results revealed that an increased weight percent of the additives, within the investigated range, enhanced the thermal properties for TES application. Adding 1.5 wt.% of Cu and Zn nanoparticles enhanced the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite by 20.6% and 61.5%, respectively. The thermal diffusivity was observed to increase proportionally as the thermal conductivity increases, whereas the specific heat decreases. The experimental results were compared with existing models, and they disagreed with the prediction results of the thermal conductivity values for all of the models in the literature. The Maxwell and Hamilton-Crosser models predicted the closest values to the experimental results; however, they underpredicted the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite, whereas the values from the other models significantly overpredicted the thermal conductivity values. The collector efficiency performance was enhanced by 15.5% when integrated with PCM-TES. A further enhancement was reported when the collector system was integrated with nanocomposite-TES.

The profit for the PV system owner can increase and the stress on the power grid can be reduced. Previous research in the field has focused on either self-consumption of PV power in individual buildings or PV power curtailment for voltage control. In this paper self-consumption of residential PV power in a community of several single-family houses was investigated using high-resolution irradiance and power consumption data. Cases with individual or shared battery energy storages for the houses were examined. PV power curtailment was investigated as a method to reduce feed-in power to the grid, i.e. peak shaving. Results indicated that the self-consumption ratio increased when using shared instead of individual storage. Reducing the feed-in power from the community by almost 50% only led to maximum 7% yearly production losses due to curtailment and storage losses. The economics for shared storage are slightly better than for individual ones. These results suggest that residential PV-battery systems should use (i) shared energy storage options if local regulations allow it and (ii) PV power curtailment if there are incentives to lower the feed-in power. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Curtailment; Peak power shaving; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Battery storage; Curtailment; Peak power shaving; Photovoltaics; Self-consumption; Electric power transmission networks; consumption behavior; energy balance; energy use; irradiance; photovoltaic system; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975801280

The prevailing compound in the mesocarp differs as the fruit ages, oil being the major storage compound. Acrocomia aculeata, macauba palm, is a conspicuous species in the tropical Americas. Because the species is highly productive in oil-rich fruits, it is the subject of domestication as an alternative vegetable oil crop, especially as a bioenergy feedstock. This detailed study first presents the macauba fruit growth and development patterns, morphological changes and accumulation of organic compounds. Fruits were monitored weekly in a natural population. The fruiting was supra-annual, and the fruit growth curve followed a double sigmoidal trend with four stages (S): SI—slow growth and negligible differentiation of the fruit inner parts; SII—first growth spurt and visible, but not complete, differentiation of the inner parts; SIII—growth slowed down and all structures attained differentiation; and SIV—second growth spurt and fruit maturation. In SII, the exocarp and endocarp were the main contributors to fruit growth, whereas the mesocarp and endosperm were responsible for most of the weight gain during SIV. In comparison with starch and oil, soluble sugars did not accumulate in the mesocarp. However, starch was transitory and fueled the oil synthesis. The protective layers, the exocarp and endocarp, fulfilling their ecological roles, were the first to reach maturity, followed by the storage tissues, the mesocarp, and endosperm. The amount and nature of organic compounds in the mesocarp varied with the fruit development and growth stages, and oil was the main and final storage material. The description of macauba fruit’s transformations and their temporal order may be of importance for future ecological and agronomical references. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomass; Domestication; Ecology; Macaw palm; New crop; Phenology","carbohydrate; organic compound; vegetable oil; water; anatomy and histology; Arecaceae; Brazil; crop; energy metabolism; fruit; geography; growth, development and aging; inflorescence; metabolism; time factor; Arecaceae; Brazil; Carbohydrates; Crops, Agricultural; Energy Metabolism; Fruit; Geography; Inflorescence; Organic Chemicals; Plant Oils; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975148268

EG was produced by microwave irradiation performed. It was found that the EG prepared exhibited the maximum sorption capacity of 85 wt% for d-Mannitol. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that d-Mannitol was uniformly dispersed in the micro holes of EG. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis indicated that the phase change temperature of the composite PCM was close to that of d-Mannitol, and its latent heat was equivalent to the calculated value based on the mass fraction of d-Mannitol in the composite. With the assistance of hot disk analyzer, the thermal conductivities of the composite PCM first rise and then drop with increasing of its densities, and similar linear relationships between the maximum thermal conductivity and mass fraction of expanded graphite or between corresponding compress density and mass fraction of expanded graphite were obtained. Thermal energy storage performance of the composite PCM was tested in latent thermal energy storage (LTES) system.

This study was, therefore, designed to examine the effects of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) on these potential biomarkers in two major energy storage tissues, adductor muscle (AM) and hepatopancreas (HP), of P. viridis after sub-lethal exposure to either metal for 10 days. The results showed that neither Cd nor Cu treatments affected the RNA/DNA ratio, glycogen and protein contents in AM and HP. As the most sensitive biomarker in P. viridis, the total lipid content in both AM and HP was significantly decreased in the treatment of 5 μg Cu/L and 0.01-0.1 μg Cd/L, respectively. However, soft-tissue body burdens of Cu or Cd did not significantly correlate with each of the four biomarkers regardless of the tissue type.

The sources of radiation exposure are short-lived radon decay products, mine waters containing radium 226Ra and 228Ra and the radioactive sediments that can precipitate out of these waters. For miners, the greatest exposure is usually due to short-lived radon decay products. The risk assessment is based on the measurement of the total potential alpha energy concentration (PAEC) and the evaluation of the related dose by using the dose conversion factor as recommended by relevant legal requirements. This paper presents the results of measurements of particle size distributions of ambient aerosols in an underground hard coal mine, the assessment of the radioactive particle size distribution of the short-lived radon decay products and the corresponding values of dose conversion factors. The measurements of the ambient airborne particle size distribution were performed in the range from a few nanometers to about 20 μm. The study therefore included practically the whole class of respirable particles. The results showed that the high concentration of ultrafine and fine aerosols measured can significantly affect the value of the dose conversion factors, and consequently the corresponding committed effective dose, to which the miners can be exposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Dose conversion factors; Hard coal mine; Particle size distribution; Short-lived radon progeny; Ultrafine and fine particles","Aerosols; Anthracite; Coal; Coal mines; Excavation; Groundwater; Light transmission; Miners; Particle size analysis; Radioactivity; Radon; Risk assessment; Size distribution; Committed effective dose; Dose conversion factor; Fine particles; Natural radioactivity; Potential alpha energy concentrations; Radon decay products; Radon progeny; Underground excavation; Particle size; coal; radioactive aerosol; radium 226; radium 228; radon; air pollutant; radon; radon daughter; aerosol; airborne survey; coal mine; concentration (composition); particle size; particulate matter; radiation exposure; radioactive decay; radioactivity; radionuclide; radium isotope; radon; risk assessment; size distribution; underground storage; aerosol; airborne particle; Article; coal mining; miner; natural radioactivity; particle size; radiation exposure; risk assessment; air pollutant; analysis; mining; occupational exposure; particle size; Poland; radiation monitoring; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Mining; Occupational Exposure; Particle Size; Poland; Radiation Exposure; Radiation Monitoring; Radon; Radon Daughters; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969776780

The fast growth can be expressed by an exponential function as in the case of Macedonian empire of the Alexander the Great whereas a sigmoidal growth can be expressed by power-law equation as in the case of Roman and Ottoman empires. The superpowers Russia and the USA follow somehow different mechanisms, Russia displays two different exponential growth behaviors whereas the USA follows two different power-law behaviors. They did not disturb and mobilize their social capacity much during the course of their rise. The decline and the collapse of an empire occur through a kind of fragmentation process, and the consequently formed small states become rather free in their behavior. The lands of the new states formed exhibit a hierarchical pattern, and the number of the states having an area smaller than the largest one can be given either by an exponential or power-law function. The exponential distribution pattern occurs when the states are quite free in their pursuits, but the power-law behavior occurs when they are under the pressure of an empire or a strong state in the region. The geological and geographical conditions also affect whether there occurs exponential or power-law behavior. The new unions formed such as the European Union and the Shanghai Cooperation increase the power-law exponent implying that they increase the stress in the international affairs. The viscoelastic behavior of the empires can be found from the scattering diagrams, and the storage (G′)and loss modulus (G′′), and the associated work-like and heat-like terms can be determined in the sense of thermodynamics. The G′ of Ottomans was larger than that of Romans implying that they confronted severe resistance during their expansion. The G′ of Russia is also larger than that of the USA; in fact the USA did not face severe resistance as they had an overwhelming superiority over native Americans. The G′>G′′ indicates solidity in the social structure and Romans, Ottomans, and Russians all have G′ larger than G′′. The G′ is slightly larger than G′′ for the USA indicating that they have had a very flexible social structure. By the same token the ratio of the work-like term to the internal energy is larger for Ottomans than that of Romans, and larger for the USA than that of Russia. That means the fraction of the total energy allocated to improve the social capacity is larger for Romans than that of Ottomans, and is larger for Russians than that of the USA. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","area; empire; energy; fall; heat; hierarchy; internal energy; loss modulus; Moghul; Ottoman; rate constant; rise; Roman; Russia; scaling; social capacity; Sociophysics; storage modulus; superpower; thermodynamics; USA; viscoelasticity; work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967203013

It is clean and free energy in comparison with conventional fossil fuels. However, the high stochastic nature of the wind could affect the power quality of a grid system fed from a wind turbine system. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a mature energy storage technology for handling wind fluctuation problems such that the generated energy could be supplied to the grid without affecting grid performance. This paper proposes a parallel connection of the CAES with a wind turbine to provide a continuous supply to the grid system with reduced wind power input fluctuations. Analysis was carried out using MATLAB Simulink to study the effectiveness of the parallel CAES system with changes in wind speed. The results were focussed on the grid's voltage and active power. The results showed that the proposed parallel CAES system was able to smooth out wind power fluctuations and able to provide continuous power supply to the grid system with lower power consumption during the CAES compression process when compared to the series CAES system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Compressed Air Energy Storage; Compression train; Grid voltage and grid power; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Wind fluctuation","Compressed air; Electric connectors; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Permanent magnets; Pressure vessels; Stochastic systems; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Energy storage technologies; Grid power; Lower-power consumption; Parallel connections; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Wind fluctuation; Wind turbine systems; Compressed air energy storage; compressed air; electricity; energy conservation; fluctuating asymmetry; fossil fuel; renewable resource; stochasticity; wind power; wind turbine; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966359565

Amongst the numerous reasons, lack of knowledge and haste are the most common ones. Except for a few substances subject to international agreements, the academic world benefits from a great latitude in the use of chemicals. To make colleagues aware of the hazards and risks associated to chemicals, and protect them accordingly, the Occupational Safety and Health service of the School of Basic Sciences (SB-SST) has decided to submit to authorization the purchase and manipulation of very hazardous chemicals. The process starts by a thoughtful discussion with the requester about the substance and whether a less hazardous alternative could be used instead. If the request is validated, the work procedure is analyzed and the protective measures for safe manipulation of the chemical checked. Consequently the SB-SST authorizes or not the personnel to order the compound. This innovative participative risk-management concept is illustrated herein with osmium tetroxide, as an example of a lethal compound used in chemistry, biology and electronic microscopy.

As PCM poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different molecular weight was applied and the effect of its incorporation on curing parameters, mechanical and morphological properties of acrylic bone cement was investigated. A significant decrease in maximum temperature from 65.8°C to 47.4°C and slight increase of setting time were observed. PEG introduction also contributed to the thermal stability of acrylic bone cement increase. SEM investigation of modified bone cement confirmed that the microstructure does not alter considerably because of PEG content. It was found that both PEG addition and incubation test contribute to an inconsiderable decrease in mechanical strength of bone cement. However, the mechanical strength increase can be caused by the fresh bone tissue incorporation into the pores appearing in bone cement. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, insufficient energy density and low cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries hinder their practical use for next-generation smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Electrospun carbon microfibers have recently been introduced as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, electrospinning is not feasible for mass production of carbon microfibers due to its complex processing condition, low production rate and high cost. Herein, we report centrifugal spinning, a high-rate and low-cost microfiber production method, as an alternative approach to electrospinning for carbon microfiber production and introduce centrifugally-spun carbon microfibers (CMFs) and porous carbon microfibers (PCMFs) as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Electrochemical performance results indicated that the highly porous nature of centrifugally-spun PCMFs led to increased Na+ storage capacity and improved cycling stability. The reversible capacity of centrifugally-spun PCMF anodes at the 200th cycle was 242 mAh g−1, which was much higher than that of centrifugally-spun CMFs (143 mAh g−1).

An overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. It is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. The expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships.

Herein, we design and synthesize hierarchical porous nanocomposite architectures consisting of mesoporous NaTi2(PO4)3 (MNTP) nanocrystals (NCs) with a pore size of about 10 nm and multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) networks for high-performance sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Our strategy is based on the hetero-assembly of MWCNTs and nanostructured building units by utilizing the screening effect of electrostatic repulsion in a solution engineered ionic strength using highly soluble ammonium salt to form three-dimensional hierarchical assemblies of MWCNT networks and packed MNTP NCs. Subsequent freeze-drying and calcination convert the assemblies into robust hierarchical porous MWCNTs-threaded particles. Calcination of residual ammonium salt introduces nitrogen into the MWCNTs. Such nanoarchitecture enhances electron/ion conductivity and structural stability as anode materials for SIBs. The nanocomposite has high initial Coulombic efficiency of 99%, high rate capability of 74.0 mAhg−1 at 50C, as well as long-term cycling stability with capacity retention of 74.3 mAhg−1 after 2000 cycles with only 0.012% loss per cycle at 10C.

Nevertheless, due to the application of perfluorinated membranes, VRFBs are plagued by not only the severe migration issue of vanadium ions, but also their high cost. Herein, we fabricate semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs), consisting of cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polysulfone (PSF), as alternative membranes for VRFBs. It is demonstrated that the PVP-based SIPNs exhibit extremely low vanadium permeabilities, which contribute to the well-established hydrophilic/hydrophobic microstructures and the Donnan exclusion effect. As a result, the coulombic efficiencies of VRFBs with PVP-based SIPNs reach almost 100% at 40 mA cm−2 to 100 mA cm−2; the energy efficiencies are more than 3% higher than those of VRFBs with Nafion 212. More importantly, the PVP-based SIPNs exhibit a superior chemical stability, as demonstrated both by an ex situ immersion test and continuously cycling test. Hence, all the characterizations and performance tests reported here suggest that PVP-based SIPNs are a promising alternative membrane for redox flow batteries to achieve superior cell performance and excellent cycling stability at the fraction of the cost of perfluorinated membranes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Polyvinylpyrrolidone; Selectivity; Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks; Vanadium permeability; Vanadium redox flow battery","Catalyst selectivity; Chemical stability; Crosslinking; Energy efficiency; Hydrophilicity; Interpenetrating polymer networks; Membranes; Vanadium; All vanadium redox flow battery; Donnan exclusion effect; Hydrophilic/hydrophobic; Perfluorinated membranes; Poly vinyl pyrrolidone; Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks; Vanadium permeabilities; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979609087

Achieving a uniform catalyst distribution in the porous electrode, which is closely related to the flow field design, is critically important to improve the ICRFB performance. In this work, the effects of flow field designs on catalyst electrodeposition and battery performance are investigated. It is found that compared to the serpentine flow field (SFF) design, the interdigitated flow field (IFF) forces the electrolyte through the porous electrode between the neighboring channels and enhances species transport during the processes of both the catalyst electrodeposition and iron/chromium redox reactions, thus enabling a more uniform catalyst distribution and higher mass transport limitation. It is further demonstrated that the energy efficiency of the ICRFB with the IFF reaches 80.7% at a high current density (320 mA cm−2), which is 8.2% higher than that of the ICRFB with the SFF. With such a high performance and intrinsically low-cost active materials, the ICRFB with the IFF offers a great promise for large-scale energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Energy storage; Flow batteries; Interdigitated flow field; Iron-chromium redox flow batteries; Mass transport","Catalysts; Chromium; Electric batteries; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Flow fields; Iron; Mass transfer; Redox reactions; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Battery performance; Catalyst distribution; High current densities; Interdigitated flow field; Mass transport limitation; Metallic particles; Performance enhancements; Serpentine flow fields; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979022772

Supercapacitors are viewed as essential energy storage devices that can continuously provide quick energy. The performance of supercapacitors is mostly determined by electrode materials that can store energy via electrostatic charge accumulation. This study presents new sustainable cellulose-derived composite electrodes which consist of carbon nanofibrous (CNF) mats covered with vapor-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNF/CNT electrodes have high electrical conductivity and surface area: the two most important features that are responsible for good electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes. The results show that the composite electrodes have fairly high values of specific capacitance (101 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1), energy and power density (10.28 W h kg-1 and 1.99 kW kg-1, respectively, at 1 A g-1) and can retain excellent performance over at least 2000 cycles (96.6% retention).

The formal potential (E0′) in aqueous solution at different pH as well as in MeCN containing equal amounts of pyridinium-triflates and the corresponding free pyridine with different pKa was investigated. E0′ could be completely recovered in MeCN, and by utilizing pyridine bases with different donor-acceptor strengths, a decrease of 61 meV/pKa was found that corresponded exactly to the pH dependence of E0′ in aqueous electrolyte. To separate the entropic and enthalpic contributions to E0′, temperature-dependent electrochemistry was performed. Two different modes of operation with changing pH/pKa between the two media were revealed. In MeCN, E0′ varies only because of the enthalpic contribution as the entropic contribution is unaffected by change in pKa. In water, there is primarily an entropic contribution to E0′ with changing pH due to solvation of the proton.

Unfortunately, system-level detection is challenging for DRAM failures that depend on the data content of neighboring cells (data-dependent failures). DRAM vendors internally scramble/remap the system-level address space. Therefore, testing data-dependent failures using neighboring system-level addresses does not actually test the cells that are physically adjacent. In this work, we argue that one promising way to uncover data-dependent failures in the system is to determine the location of physically neighboring cells in the system address space. Unfortunately, if done naively, such a test takes 49 days to detect neighboring addresses even in a single memory row, making it infeasible in real systems. We develop PARBOR, an efficient system-level technique that determines the locations of the physically neighboring DRAM cells in the system address space and uses this information to detect data-dependent failures. To our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the challenge of detecting data-dependent failures in DRAM in the presence of DRAM-internal scrambling of system-level addresses. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PARBOR using 144 real DRAM chips from three major vendors. Our experimental evaluation shows that PARBOR 1) detects neighboring cell locations with only 66-90 tests, a 745,654X reduction compared to the naive test, and 2) uncovers 21.9% more failures compared to a random-pattern test that is unaware of the neighbor cell locations. We introduce a new mechanism that utilizes PARBOR to reduce refresh rate based on the data content of memory locations, thereby improving system performance and efficiency. We hope that our fast and efficient system-level detection technique enables other new ideas and mechanisms that improve the reliability, performance, and energy efficiency of DRAM-based memory systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Energy efficiency; Location; Physical addresses; Testing; Data dependent; Experimental evaluation; Improving systems; Memory locations; Memory systems; New mechanisms; Random pattern; System enhancement; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977074680

Consequently, alternative power sources have been investigated for such situations and are widely reported; for example: wind, wave, tidal and solar generation. In isolation these technologies provide heavily disrupted electrical power, unless backed by a substantial and thereby expense power storage system. More recently, the emergent micro grid concept has facilitated the integration of these discrete power sources and has therefore extended their temporal utility, making them more useful to their host communities. However, with the addition of an energy storage device within the micro grid architecture (typically a battery bank) further enhancements to the around-the-clock accessibility of electrical power can be readily achieved for such system users. This paper explores the feasibility of developing a new, low speed Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) for use in the pacific region by small and isolated communities. Also, the specific electrical power needs, of the outlying communities, are presented prior to technical solutions being sought.

In application with significant cooling demand, it is a challenge to apply conventional trigeneration design due to the inherently low energy performance of the heat-driven cooling equipment. In addition, if the price difference between electricity and gas is not too distinct, economic feasibility would become a hurdle to implement trigeneration. However, the approach of SOFC-primed micro cogeneration can be considered, and the power generated was used for both air conditioning and electrical appliances, whereas the waste heat was recovered for water heating. Eventually, building cooling, heating and power demands could be fulfilled, particularly in the hot-humid season.

Here we investigate how myocardial lipid content and dynamics affect the function of the ischemic heart, and focus on the role of the lipid droplet protein perilipin 5 (Plin5) in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. Methods and results We generated Plin5−/− mice and found that Plin5 deficiency dramatically reduced the triglyceride content in the heart. Under normal conditions, Plin5−/− mice maintained a close to normal heart function by decreasing fatty acid uptake and increasing glucose uptake, thus preserving the energy balance. However, during stress or myocardial ischemia, Plin5 deficiency resulted in myocardial reduced substrate availability, severely reduced heart function and increased mortality. Importantly, analysis of a human cohort with suspected coronary artery disease showed that a common noncoding polymorphism, rs884164, decreases the cardiac expression of PLIN5 and is associated with reduced heart function following myocardial ischemia, indicating a role for Plin5 in cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Our findings indicate that Plin5 deficiency alters cardiac lipid metabolism and associates with reduced survival following myocardial ischemia, suggesting that Plin5 plays a beneficial role in the heart following ischemia. © 2016 The Author(s)","Lipid droplets; Myocardial ischemia; Perilipin 5","diacylglycerol; fat droplet; fatty acid; glucose; glycerolipid; glycogen; messenger RNA; palmitic acid; perilipin; perilipin 5; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; lipid storage droplet protein 5, mouse; muscle protein; signal peptide; triacylglycerol; adverse outcome; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; disease association; energy balance; fatty acid transport; gene expression; genetic variation; glucose transport; glucose utilization; heart disease; heart function; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle perfusion; heart protection; heart scintiscanning; human; human tissue; in vivo study; lipid analysis; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; major clinical study; metabolic disorder; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein expression; protein polymorphism; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival time; tissue level; animal; blood; cardiac muscle; coronary artery disease; deficiency; female; genetics; knockout mouse; male; metabolism; Myocardial Ischemia; pathology; Animals; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Muscle Proteins; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976607202

The considered integration options are heat deliveries to DH (district heating) systems or to nearby industries and integration with infrastructure for CO2 storage. The comparison is made to stand-alone configurations in which the excess heat is used for power production. The analysis considers future energy market scenarios and case studies in southwestern Sweden. The results show that integration with DH systems has small impacts on the NAP and the FPC and diverging (positive or negative) impacts on the GHG emissions. Integration with industries has positive effects on the economic and GHG performances in all scenarios. The FPCs are reduced by 7-8% in the methanol case and by 12-13% in the FT production case. The GHG emission reductions are strongly dependent on the reference power production. The storage of separated CO2 shows an increase in the GHG emission reduction potential of 70-100% for all systems, whereas the impacts on the economic performances are strongly dependent on the CO2e-charge. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass gasification; Economic performance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Process integration; System analysis","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; District heating; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasification; Industrial economics; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Synthetic fuels; Systems analysis; Biofuel production; Biomass Gasification; Economic performance; Emission reduction potentials; Fischer Tropsch; Power production; Process integration; Synthetic natural gas; Greenhouse gases; biofuel; carbon sequestration; comparative study; emission control; energy market; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; oil production; performance assessment; power generation; production system; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973169211

However, the low conductivity of sulfur and discharge products as well as polysulfide-shuttle effect between the cathode and anode hamper applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, we describe a novel and efficient S host material consisting of mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) fabricated in situ on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for Li-S batteries. The TiO2@rGO hybrid can be loaded with 72 wt % sulfur. The strong chemisorption ability of the TiO2 NCs toward polysulfide combined with high electrical conductivity of rGO effectively localize the soluble polysulfide species within the cathode and facilitate electron and Li ions transport to/from the cathode materials. The sulfur-incorporated TiO2@rGO hybrid (S/TiO2@rGO) shows large capacities of 1116 and 917 mA h g-1 at the current densities of 0.2 and 1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g-1) after 100 cycles, respectively. When the current density is increased 20 times from 0.2 to 4 C, 60% capacity is retained, thereby demonstrating good cycling stability and rate capability. The synergistic effects of TiO2 NCs toward effective chemisorption of polysulfides and conductive rGO with high electron mobility make a promising application of S/TiO2@rGO hybrid in high-performance Li-S batteries. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","chemisorption; lithium-sulfur battery; reduced graphene oxides; sulfur host material; TiO2 nanocrystals","Cathodes; Chemisorption; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Lithium; Nanocrystals; Polysulfides; Secondary batteries; Sound insulating materials; Sulfur; Titanium dioxide; High electrical conductivity; High electron mobility; Host materials; Lithium sulfur batteries; Polysulfide shuttles; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Specific energy density; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987748000

The major classes of suitable electrode materials used for the capacitors as well as an energy storage and conversion materials or other electrochemical devices are activated nanoporous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, conducting polymers, metal oxides, and polymer composites, which have been extensively reported in the literature. In addition, the well-known applications of advanced electrodes in metals production, energy storage in batteries and supercapacitors, and catalyst supports have appeared in the literature on both carbon materials and their interactions with electrolytes and redox systems. Since the significant application of graphite electrodes for electrochemical production of alkali metals, carbon materials have been broadly used in both analytical and industrial electrochemistry. The often-cited benefits of carbon electrodes contain reasonable cost, wide potential window, relatively inert electrochemistry, and electrocatalytic activity for a variety of redox reactions. Energy storage techniques appear as one of the most promising options in harvesting renewably generated energy during the optimum manufacture period for future use. Of the available electrical energy storage devices, fuel cells, batteries, and capacitors have been the technology of choice for most applications.

This significantly impacts performance and energy. For instance, the energy consumption share of communication and memory access may exceed 80%. Recently, the concept of Computation-in-Memory (CIM) was proposed, which is based on the integration of storage and computation in the same physical location using a crossbar topology and non-volatile resistive-switching memristor technology. To illustrate the tremendous potential of CIM architecture in exploiting massively parallel computation while reducing the communication overhead, we present a communication-efficient mapping of a large-scale matrix multiplication algorithm on the CIM architecture. The experimental results show that, depending on the matrix size, CIM architecture exhibits several orders of magnitude higher performance in total execution time and two orders of magnitude better in total energy consumption than the multicore-based on the shared memory architecture. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computational efficiency; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Matrix algebra; Memristors; Parallel architectures; Communication overheads; Data-intensive application; Matrix multiplication algorithm; Orders of magnitude; Parallel matrix multiplication; Processor communications; Shared memory architecture; Total energy consumption; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991738078

It is interesting to investigate whether this standard <i>F</i> ĝ' <i>†</i> space can also be applied to capture the shift of annual water balance in catchments with varying dryness. Previous studies have made significant progress in incorporating the storage effect into the Budyko framework for the non-steady conditions, whereas the role of groundwater-dependent evapotranspiration was not investigated. This study investigates how groundwater-dependent evapotranspiration causes the shift of the annual water balance in the standard Budyko space. A widely used monthly hydrological model, the ABCD model, is modified to incorporate groundwater-dependent evapotranspiration into the zone with a shallow water table and delayed groundwater recharge into the zone with a deep water table. This model is applied in six catchments in the Erdos Plateau, China, to estimate the actual annual evapotranspiration. Results show that the variations in the annual <i>F</i> value with the aridity index do not satisfy the standard Budyko formulas. The shift of the annual water balance in the standard Budyko space is a combination of the Budyko-type response in the deep groundwater zone and the quasi-energy limited condition in the shallow groundwater zone. Excess evapotranspiration (<i>1) could occur in dry years, which is contributed by the significant supply of groundwater for evapotranspiration. Use of groundwater for irrigation can increase the frequency of the <i>1 cases. © Author(s) 2016.",,"Catchments; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Runoff; Annual evapotranspirations; Annual water balance; Deep groundwaters; Ground water recharge; Hydrological modeling; Non-steady conditions; Shallow groundwater; Shallow water tables; Recharging (underground waters); catchment; estimation method; evapotranspiration; groundwater; irrigation system; recharge; shallow water; water table; China; Erdos Plateau; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986247564

These pyrroles show highly variable fluorescence properties and can be used as building blocks for the synthesis of electron-deficient oligopyrroles. The latter application is demonstrated through the development of π-extended porphyrins containing naphthalenediamide or naphthalenediimide units. These new macrocycles exhibit simultaneously tunable visible and near-IR absorptions, an ability to accept up to 8 electrons via electrochemical reduction, and high internal molecular free volumes. When chemically reduced under inert conditions, the most electron-deficient of these macrocycles revealed reversible formation of eight charged states, characterized by remarkably red-shifted optical absorptions, extending beyond 2200 nm.

Several ratios of MgH2-Sn (2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) destabilized system were investigated experimentally using a ball milling method. Based on the temperature-programme desorption results, the onset dehydrogenation temperature of the MgH2-Sn composite was consisted of two steps in the range of 235-250 °C and 325-340 °C. TiF3 catalyst was introduced to enhance the desorption temperature of the MgH2-Sn (4:1) system. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of the 4MgH2-Sn-10 wt% TiF3 composite was reduced to approximately 100 °C and 205 °C compared to the MgH2-Sn (4:1) and the as-milled MgH2. The Kissinger analysis established that the apparent activation energy for the first stage of the 4MgH2-Sn composite was reduced from 149.0 kJ/mol to 114.0 kJ/mol after adding 10 wt% TiF3. However, the addition of TiF3 did not result in improvement of the absorption process. The improvement of the dehydrogenation properties of the MgH2-Sn composite with the addition of TiF3 was due to the formation of Ti-containing and F-containing species. These species played a catalytic role in improving the dehydrogenation properties of the MgH2-Sn system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed solution can be dedicated, for example, to an external partition of lightweight construction. The capacity for latent heat storage allowed it to stabilize the temperature inside the insulation layer in a daily cycle and to minimize the temperature difference between the internal and external surfaces. In this paper, different positions of a PCM layer in the thermal insulation of an external wall were analysed. The main goal of this work was to find the best position of the PCM layer, taking into account the indoor temperature and the meteorological conditions. The authors propose two parameters: the amount of stored energy and the dynamism of the charging/discharging processes. Taking into account large temperature fluctuations on the external surface during summer and winter, it was concluded that, for this specific case, the most appropriate solution would be an external position of the PCM with a melting temperature of 20°C. © 2016 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).","external wall; heat storage; insulation; latent heat; PCM","Heat storage; Insulation; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Storage (materials); Walls (structural partitions); Charging/discharging; External environments; External walls; Indoor temperature; Light-weight constructions; Meteorological condition; Temperature differences; Temperature fluctuation; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955117104

Large reserves of natural gas exist worldwide, particularly in areas where the resources exceed the demand. Therefore, natural gas is liquefied for shipping; and its storage and regasification process usually occurs in onshore facilities. Recently, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) offshore terminals have been proposed as an attractive alternative solution. This paper presents a complete quantitative risk analysis (QRA) of undesired events that may occur during the loading and unloading of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) considering a typical LNG carrier and an offshore terminal similar to those operating in Brazil. Initially, a historical survey of accidents at LNG facilities, along with a detailed study of LNG carriers and LNG offshore terminals, is presented to support hazard identification. Once the potential hazardous events are categorized in some possible scenarios, a probabilistic potential hazard assessment is performed; moreover, the frequencies of occurrence of the undesired events are estimated. Afterwards, traditional consequence models are briefly discussed aiming to identify the weakness of each one that supports the specification of the model used in the consequence analysis of a specified case, which is evaluated by providing the data to estimate the total risk of the installation. The risk is evaluated in terms of social and individual risk.

It examines the relationships between six external factors (political stability, economic stability, stakeholder pressure, competition, energy transition and regulations) and sustainability goals through multiple regression analysis, using survey data from companies that operate in the O&G industry. Data analyses reveal that there are two types of sustainability goals namely strategic goals (SGO), which are conditional for long term survival, and functional goals (FGO), which are closely related to the companies' operational processes. The analyses also show that stakeholder pressure and economic stability are the most influential factors that could affect the goals. While competition within the O&G industry has a positive effect on the FGO, competition from the broader energy industry results in a negative effect on the SGO. The influence of energy transition relates to a higher focus on SGO. The results are useful in designing SSCM strategy that could help the O&G industry address the pressure from the external factors for more sustainable supply chain practices to achieve its sustainability goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","External factors; Oil and gas; Sustainability goals; Sustainable supply chain management","Competition; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Factor analysis; Gas industry; Industrial economics; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Business environments; External factors; Multiple regression analysis; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Political stability; Stakeholder pressures; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management; gas industry; oil industry; stakeholder; supply chain management; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989963277

Over the years, a number of control strategies have been developed for BESS to reduce the peak demand. The control strategies are however complex and confined to simulation evaluation only. The control strategies are also not tested in BESS set-up with limited capacity. A simple and yet comprehensive real-time active peak demand reduction control has therefore been developed and presented in this paper. The real-time active control has been evaluated experimentally using the university building as the site. The performance of the real-time control has been evaluated as compared to the fundamental control as well as the ideal reduction in simulation. Even though the capacity is limited, the results showed superiority and adoptability of the real-time active control as compared to the fundamental control, with peak demand reduction of about 8.64% as compared to 4.24%.

However, none was made on the maize-grass intercropping system in Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the ET and CO2 fluxes in a signal grass pasture intercropped with maize, in São João, Pernambuco, Brazil, in a drought year. Furthermore, the soil water storage (SWS) and leaf area index (LAI) were determined. The latent heat flux was the main consumer of the available energy and the daily and seasonal ET and CO2 variations were mainly controlled by rainfall, through the changes in soil water content and consequently in SWS. The agroecosystem acted as an atmospheric carbon source, during drier periods and lower LAI, and as an atmospheric carbon sink, during wetter periods and higher LAI values. In a dry year, the intercropping sequestered 2.9 t C ha−1, which was equivalent to 8.0 kg C ha−1 d−1. This study showed strong seasonal fluctuations in maize-grass intercropping CO2 fluxes, due to seasonality of rainfall, and that this agroecosystem is vulnerable to low SWS, with significant reduction in CO2 uptake during these periods. © 2016, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

The converters that connect the PV generator, loads, and energy storages to the dc bus choose their operation modes in response to the price. The proposed approach was applied to a stand-alone PV system with energy storage. Advantages of the proposed technique are scalability and intuitive programming effort due to the market analogy, so it may be helpful to developers of off-grid PV systems.

To efficiently explore and utilize the diverse renewable energy generations, we propose a theoretical framework for the cooperative planning of renewable generations in a system of interconnected microgrids. The cooperative framework considers the self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-Term investment costs and short-Term operational costs over the planning horizon. Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to deploy renewable energy generations, and how to split the associated investment cost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost. We also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to incentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from cooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong observatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework and demonstrate that all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system cost is reduced by 35.9% compared with the noncooperative planning benchmark. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","capacity planning; cooperative game; microgrid; Nash bargaining; renewable energy; Smart grid; storage","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Energy storage; Meteorology; Smart power grids; Capacity planning; Cooperative game; Micro grid; Nash bargaining; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984662584

Similar to various yarns with different physical and mechanical properties available in textile industry, different yarn supercapacitors should be developed as well. However, as a device, stretchable yarn supercapacitors suffer a lot from limited stretchability, complicated and high cost fabrication, which greatly restrict their wide adoptions. Here, we use urethane elastic fiber core spun yarns (UY) with intrinsic high stretchability for the first time, as a wearable scaffold for hosting conductive CNT and electrocapacitive PPy to fabricate large-scale highly stretchable yarn electrodes via a simple two-step process (CNTs dipping and PPy electrodeposition). The yarn supercapacitor keeps the excellent stretchability of the UY without using any extra stretchy substrate or wavy structure as most stretchable yarn supercapacitors used, and at the same time, exhibits a high areal capacitance of 69 mF cm−2 (normalized to two electrodes) as well as a good rate capacity. Furthermore, the capacitive performance of the yarn supercapacitor remains nearly unchanged even at a high strain of 80%. The high-performance stretchable yarn supercapacitor with the use of intrinsically stretchable yarns paves a way for the production of large-size fabrics for wearable electronic applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Stretchable; Urethane elastic fiber core spun yarn; Wearable; Yarn supercapacitor","Elasticity; Electrodes; Esters; Supercapacitor; Textile industry; Wearable technology; Wool; Yarn; Capacitive performance; Elastic fiber; Electronic application; Physical and mechanical properties; Stretchable; Two-step process; Wearable; Yarn supercapacitors; Spinning (fibers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979266075

In this study, we investigate the potential of using heat tracer tests for characterization of a shallow alluvial aquifer. A thermal tracer test was conducted in the alluvial aquifer of the Meuse River, Belgium. The tracing experiment consisted in simultaneously injecting heated water and a dye tracer in an injection well and monitoring the evolution of groundwater temperature and tracer concentration in the pumping well and in measurement intervals. To get insights in the 3D characteristics of the heat transport mechanisms, temperature data from a large number of observation wells closely spaced along three transects were used. Temperature breakthrough curves in observation wells are contrasted with what would be expected in an ideal layered aquifer. They reveal strongly unequal lateral and vertical components of the transport mechanisms. The observed complex behavior of the heat plume is explained by the groundwater flow gradient on the site and heterogeneities in the hydraulic conductivity field. Moreover, due to high injection temperatures during the field experiment a temperature-induced fluid density effect on heat transport occurred. By using a flow and heat transport numerical model with variable density coupled with a pilot point approach for inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field, the main preferential flow paths were delineated. The successful application of a field heat tracer test at this site suggests that heat tracer tests is a promising approach to image hydraulic conductivity field. This methodology could be applied in aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) projects for assessing future efficiency that is strongly linked to the hydraulic conductivity variability in the considered aquifer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Inverse modelling; Pilot points; Thermal tracer test","Aquifers; Digital storage; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hydraulic conductivity; Injection (oil wells); Inverse problems; Radioactive tracers; Testing; Transport properties; Water injection; Aquifer characterization; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Groundwater temperatures; Inverse modelling; Measurement interval; Pilot points; Thermal tracers; Tracer concentration; Groundwater resources; aquifer; aquifer characterization; groundwater; groundwater flow; heat transfer; hydraulic conductivity; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; temperature effect; testing method; water temperature; Belgium; Meuse River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978511919

The simulated system was validated with one-year measurements from a pilot plant situated in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland. The system is installed in an old kindergarten with a yearly heating demand of around 35 MWh and a high temperature hydronic heat distribution system (radiators). The pilot plant is composed of 50 m2 of covered and 14 m2 of uncovered collectors, both with selective coating; a heat pump of 17 kW, a sensible storage of 3.5 m3 and an ice storage of 75 m3. The monitored yearly system performance factor was 4.6. The system simulation was compared to measurements at monthly and yearly bases for global variables of interest such as system performance factor, energy flows between the collectors, ice storage, heat pump and combi-storage. The yearly difference in system performance (SPFSHP+) was found to be within the uncertainty range. After the system was validated, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The most sensitive parameter was found to be the variation of ground properties between two extremes, i.e. from wet clay to dry sand where differences up to 4% were found in the yearly SPFSHP+. Results from annual simulations with Meteonorm weather data were compared with results from simulations using measured weather data for the climate of Zurich. The average of the results of 13 years with real data showed an increase of SPFSHP+ of 24% compared to the results obtained with Meteonorm data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ice storage; Solar and heat pump; Solar thermal; Solar-ice","Digital storage; Heat pump systems; Meteorology; Pilot plants; Pumps; Sensitivity analysis; Solar heating; Dynamic system simulation; Heat pumps; Heating applications; Ice storage; Performance factors; Sensitive parameter; Solar thermal; System simulations; Ice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976527976

For solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell materials, standard 3-D measurements such as connected triple-phase boundary (TPB) length and effective transport properties partially inform on how local geometry and network topology causes variability in TPB accessibility. A new measurement, the accessible TPB, is proposed to quantify these effects in detail and characterize material performance. The approach probes the reticulated pathways to each TPB using an analytical electrochemical fin model applied to a 3-D discrete representation of the heterogeneous structure provided by skeleton-based partitioning. The method is tested on artificial and real structures imaged by 3-D x-ray and electron microscopy. The accessible TPB is not uniform and the pattern varies depending upon the structure. Connected TPBs can be even passivated. The sensitivity to manipulations of the local 3-D geometry and topology that standard measurements cannot capture is demonstrated. The clear presence of preferential pathways showcases a non-uniform utilization of the 3-D structure that potentially affects the performance and the resilience to alterations due to degradation phenomena.

Nonetheless, these conventional two-dimensional (2D) or planar structured flexible energy storage devices could not meet the demand for wearable or textile electronics. To meet this demand, in this work, a novel flexible fiber hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is fabricated using NiCo2O4 nanograss (NG)-array coated carbon fiber (NiCo2O4 NG@CF) as the positive electrode to provide a pseudocapacitance and porous carbon coated carbon fiber electrode as the negative electrode to provide an electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC). Particularly, the porous carbon is prepared from Lemon peel waste to obtain a low cost electrode material. Interestingly, the fabricated HSC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 17.5 F g-1 (25.03 mF cm-2) and an energy density of 6.61 Wh kg-1 (9.46 μWh cm-2) at the current of 1 mA, which is far better than previous reports. Moreover, three knitted fiber HSCs connected in series could successfully power up a red LED, even at a folded condition.

The role of DGSTs in the future energy systems planning of a rural agglomeration in Switzerland is examined using a cost optimization modeling approach. Heat and electricity demand for major sectors are considered. Scenarios introduce DGSTs in a stepwise manner to measure incremental impacts on future capacity planning compared to a baseline scenario. Sub-scenarios also examine the impacts of carbon mitigation policies, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out for key energy carriers and conversion technologies. DGSTs enable a significant reduction in electricity grid usage for the community considered. Small hydro with a storage reservoir and photovoltaics enable the community to become largely self-sufficient with over 80% reductions in grid imports by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. Storage enables maximum usage of the available hydro potential which also leads to network upgrade deferrals and a significant increase in photovoltaic installations. Investment decisions in small hydro are robust against cost variations, while heating technology investment decisions are sensitive to oil and grid electricity prices.

The emulsion stabilized with Tw 80 showed significant and fast creaming, a process that was prevented by the addition of the polymer. During the extensive coalescence of the emulsions stabilized by Tw 80, the Janus topology was retained for months of storage until, finally, separation of the oils occurred. This result strongly indicates an unexpected stabilizing action of the i nterfacial free energy. This conclusion was supported by a calculation for a realistic model system of the interfacial energy difference between two cases of coalescence. In the first case, the two coalescing Janus drops united into a larger Janus drop, while in the second case two drops formed, each with only one oil. The first case gave a spontaneous reaction (reduced interfacial energy), while the second one meant an increase of energy, i.e. it cannot happen without adding energy. The authors are aware that this stabilization is a new phenomenon in emulsion science with potential ramifications in future emulsion technology.

Therefore, this study analysed the effect of the method of storing chips obtained from short rotation willow on their thermophysical and chemical properties and on the biomass loss, depending on the method of storage and the type of cover, in the climatic conditions of Central-Eastern Europe. The experiment involved examination of five methods of storage of willow chips: with no cover (control), under permeable covers Toptex 200 and Toptex 300, under vapour-permeable foil and in a wooden shed. The chips were stored from March 2011 to March 2012. Use of cover made of permeable materials was found to improve the biomass quality: its moisture content decreased more than twice and its heating value increased more than twice. The energy content of the stored piles was also found to increase by 10% after a year of storage. The energy content was also found to increase in a roofed pile and to decrease in biomass covered with foil (-9%) and uncovered (-50%). Biomass loss for chips stored under permeable covers ranged from 3.8% to 5.1%. Similar findings were recorded for chips stored in a shed, while the effects were worse for the piles stored under vapour-permeable foil. The worst biomass parameters were recorded for an uncovered pile. Storage of willow chips in an open space under cover could be a cheaper alternative, which could improve the quality of willow chips compared to roofed warehouses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass losses; Biomass quality; Covering systems; Moisture content; Willow; Wood chips storage","Moisture; Moisture determination; Piles; Storage (materials); Wood products; Biomass quality; Climatic conditions; Energy content; Permeable material; Short rotation; Thermophysical; Willow; Wood chip; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; experimental study; moisture content; storage; Eastern Europe; Poland [Central Europe]; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974855913

We present an initial assessment of ethyl 3-ethoxybutyrate (EEB) as a biofuel in terms of its performance as a fuel oxygenate and its persistence in the environment. EEB can be produced from ethanol and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, a bacterial storage polymer that can be produced from non-food biomass and other organic feedstocks. Physicochemical properties of EEB and fuel-relevant properties of EEB-gasoline blends were measured, emissions of criteria pollutants from EEB as a gasoline additive in a production vehicle were evaluated, and fate and persistence of EEB in the environment were estimated. EEB solubility in water was 25.8 g/L, its Kow was 1.8, and its Henry’s Law constant was 1.04 × 10−5 atm-m3/mole. The anti-knock index values for 5 and 20 % v/v EEB-gasoline blends were 91.6 and 91.9, respectively. Reductions in fuel economy were consistent with the level of oxygenation, and criteria emissions were met by the vehicle operated over the urban dynamometer driving cycle (FTP 75). Predicted environmental persistence ranged from 15 to 30 days which indicates that EEB is not likely to be a persistent organic pollutant. In combination, these results suggest a high potential for the use of EEB as a renewable fuel source. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biofuels; Criteria pollutants; Dynamometer; Environmental persistence; Fuel oxygenates; Multimedia analysis; Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)","analytical method; biofuel; emission; environmental assessment; equipment; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; oxygenation; persistent organic pollutant; polymer; renewable resource; transport vehicle; Bacteria (microorganisms); alcohol; biofuel; ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate; exhaust gas; gasoline; hydroxybutyric acid; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; propionic acid derivative; air pollution; biomass; chemistry; exhaust gas; prevention and control; renewable energy; Air Pollution; Biofuels; Biomass; Ethanol; Gasoline; Hydroxybutyrates; Polyesters; Propionates; Renewable Energy; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974802761

In this study, the estuarine oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis were transplanted to two sites with similar hydrological conditions but different levels of metal pollution in Jiulong River Estuary over a six-month period. We characterized the time-series change of metal bioaccumulation and final metabolomics responses of oysters. Following transplantation, all metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the oyster digestive glands had elevated concentrations over time. By the end of six-month exposure, Cu, Zn and Cd were the main metals significantly differentiating the two sites. Using 1H NMR metabolite approach, we further demonstrated the disturbance in osmotic regulation, energy metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism induced by metal contaminations. Six months later, the oysters transplanted in the two sites showed a similar metabolite variation pattern when compared with the initial oysters regardless of different metal levels in the tissues. Interestingly, by comparing the oysters from two sites, the more severely polluted oysters accumulated significantly higher amounts of osmolytes (betaine and homarine) and lower energy storage compounds (glycogen) than the less polluted oysters; these changes could be the potential biomarkers for different levels of metal pollution. Our study demonstrated the complexity of biological effects under field conditions, and NMR metabolomics provides an important approach to detect sensitive variation of oyster inner status. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To accommodate large scale use of renewable energy sources for efficient power production and utilization, energy storage systems are necessary. Here, we introduce a scalable energy storage system which operates by performing cycles during which energy generated from renewable resource is first used to produce highly concentrated brine and diluate, followed up mixing these two solutions in order to generate power. In this work, we present theoretical results of the attainable energy density as function of salt type and concentration. A linearized Nernst-Planck model is used to describe water, salt and charge transport. We validate our model with experiments over wide range of sodium chloride concentrations (0.025-3 m) and current densities (-49 to +33 A m-2). We find that depending on current density, charge and discharge steps have significantly different thermodynamic efficiency. In addition, we show that at optimal current densities, mechanisms of energy dissipation change with salt concentration. We find the highest thermodynamic efficiency at low concentrate concentrations. When using salt concentrations above 1 m, water and co-ion transport contribute to high energy dissipation due to irreversible mixing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has been often prompted by more stringent energy policy objectives aiming at reducing carbon emissions, phasing out nuclear plants and promoting overall energy efficiency, while containing both capital and operating costs. In this respect the energy hub concept has proven to be a popular approach for operating technologies and units comprising diversified energy carriers, small-scale production units, storage devices and converter systems. Additionally, developments in communication network and control infrastructure afford the possibility, at least in principle, to actively steer and adjust the load on the demand side of the energy balance, leading to the formulation of demand side management (DSM) techniques. This paper proposes an EM solution that combines the features and advantages of both of the aforementioned approaches, i.e. the energy hub framework and DSM methods. The key idea is to combine the supply-side characteristics of energy hubs with the demand side flexibility yielded by the deployment of DSM schemes. This combined approach is validated on an existing building complex by formalizing its energy supply system as an integrated hub and by modelling its heating demand based on thermodynamic principles. Numerical results based on this experimental setup are presented, illustrating that the combined approach can lead to overall savings typically exceeding 10% compared to a baseline scenario where no EM solution is applied, i.e. where only a rule-based heuristic is employed to control the available energy assets, and underscoring the advantages brought by a systematically integrated modelling and optimisation approach. The proposed solution is thus of interest for a broad host of installations in the residential and commercial domain, and for the latter a specific real-world example has been explicitly considered and analysed. The obtained results are encouraging and warrant further analysis and investigation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the effects of these LUC on the abundance and community structure of animals that inhabit soils belowground through a field survey using chronosequences of land uses comprising native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane along a 1000-km-long transect across these two major tropical biomes in Brazil. Macrofauna community composition differed among land uses. While most groups were associated with samples taken in native vegetation, high abundance of termites and earthworms appeared associated with pasture soils. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected total abundance (X2(1) = 6.79, p = 0.03) and taxa richness (X2(1) = 6.08, p = 0.04) of soil macrofauna. Abundance increased from 411 ± 70 individuals m-2 in native vegetation to 1111 ± 202 individuals m-2 in pasture, but decreased sharply to 106 ± 24 individuals m-2 in sugarcane soils. Diversity decreased 24% from native vegetation to pasture, and 39% from pasture to sugarcane. Thus, a reduction of ~90% in soil macrofauna abundance, besides a loss of ~40% in the diversity of macrofauna groups, can be expected when sugarcane crops replace pasture in Brazilian tropical soils. In general, higher abundances of major macrofauna groups (ants, coleopterans, earthworms, and termites) were associated with higher acidity and low contents of macronutrients and organic matter in soil. This study draws attention for a significant biodiversity loss belowground due to tropical LUC in sugarcane expansion areas. Given that many groups of soil macrofauna are recognized as key mediators of ecosystem processes such as soil aggregation, nutrients cycling and soil carbon storage, our results warrant further efforts to understand the impacts of altering belowground biodiversity and composition on soil functioning and agriculture performance across LUC in the tropics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy crops; Land use change; Soil biodiversity","Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Biofuels; Carbon; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Tropics; Vegetation; Bioenergy crops; Community composition; Community structures; Ecosystem process; Land-use change; Nutrients cycling; Soil biodiversity; Soil carbon storage; Soils; soil organic matter; biodiversity; bioenergy; biome; cerrado; community structure; energy crop; land use change; relative abundance; soil fauna; species richness; sugar cane; ant; Article; beetle; biodiversity; Brazil; community structure; earthworm; energy crop; Isoptera; land use; macronutrient; nonhuman; pastureland; population abundance; priority journal; soil acidity; soil fauna; species richness; sugarcane; vegetation; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; chemistry; growth, development and aging; insect; invertebrate; Oligochaeta; physiology; soil; sugarcane; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Animalia; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Isoptera; Saccharum; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Brazil; Insecta; Invertebrates; Oligochaeta; Saccharum; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973131571

In the relevant literature, there are evidences of the possibilities on the partial or total replacement of hydrocarbon fuels with hydrogen in power plants and vehicle engines. However, some challenging issues particularly on hydrogen storage are remained to be resolved. This paper reviews and comments on addressing the effectiveness of hydrogen-enrichment on the engines and burners' performance includes the chemical kinetic analysis, the flame propagation structures and the effects of inhibitors on global burning velocity of hydrogen-hydrocarbon mixtures in different combustion bombs, chambers and vessels.

From the analysis of the onset desorption temperature and isothermal de/absorption kinetics, it was shown that MgH2 + 5 wt% K2NiF6 sample has the best performance. The 5 wt% doped sample started to release hydrogen at about 260 °C, which was a reduction of about 95 °C and 157 ºC compared with the as-milled and as-received MgH2. In addition, the de/absorption kinetics of the MgH2 + 5 wt% K2NiF6 were also improved significantly compared to the un-doped MgH2. The apparent activation energy for hydrogen desorption exhibited the decrement from 167.0 kJ/mol for as-milled MgH2 to 111.0 kJ/mol with the addition of 5 wt% K2NiF6. Moreover, the X-ray diffraction spectra displayed the formation of new phases of KF, KH, Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 by doping the K2NiF6 with MgH2 after the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation processes. The scanning electron microscope results revealed that MgH2 doped with 5 wt% K2NiF6 demonstrated the smallest particle size compared to the as-received and as-milled MgH2. It is believed that the formation of in situ active species of KF, KH, and Mg2Ni could provide a synergetic catalytic effect in enhancing the hydrogen sorption properties of MgH2. © 2016 Science Press","Catalyst; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; Solid state storage","Activation energy; Catalysts; Desorption; Hydrogen; Nickel; Particle size; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Apparent activation energy; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen sorption; Hydrogen storage properties; Magnesium hydride; Solid-state storage; X-ray diffraction spectrum; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967313052

Amorphous high-storage-capacity Li-Si has lower flow stresses than crystalline materials but there is evidence that the plastic flow stress depends on the conditions of charging and discharging, indicating important non-equilibrium aspects to the flow behavior. Here, a mechanistically-based constitutive model for rate-dependent plastic flow in amorphous materials, such as LixSi alloys, during charging and discharging is developed based on two physical concepts: (i) excess energy is stored in the material during electrochemical charging and discharging due to the inability of the amorphous material to fully relax during the charging/discharging process and (ii) this excess energy reduces the barriers for plastic flow processes and thus reduces the applied stresses necessary to cause plastic flow. The plastic flow stress is thus a competition between the time scales of charging/discharging and the time scales of glassy relaxation. The two concepts, as well as other aspects of the model, are validated using molecular simulations on a model Li-Si system. The model is applied to examine the plastic flow behavior of typical specimen geometries due to combined charging/discharging and stress history, and the results generally rationalize experimental observations. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd.

Cloud computing services are hosted in Cloud Data Centers (CDC) that deploy thousands of computation, storage, and communication devices leading to high energy utilization and carbon emissions. Renewable energy resources replace fossil fuels based grid energy to effectively reduce carbon emissions of CDCs. Moreover, waste heat generated from electronic components can be utilized in absorption based cooling systems to offset cooling costs of data centers. However, data centers need to be located at ideal geographical locations to reap benefits of renewable energy and waste heat recovery options. Modular Data Centers (MDC) can enable energy as a location paradigm due to their shippable nature. Moreover, workload can be transferred between intelligently placed geographically dispersed data centers to utilize renewable energy available elsewhere with virtual machine migration techniques. However, adoption of aforementioned sustainability techniques and technologies opens new challenges, such as, intermittency of power supply from renewable resources and higher capital costs. In this paper, we examine sustainable CDCs from various aspects to survey the enabling techniques and technologies. We present case studies from both academia and industry that demonstrate favorable results for sustainability measures in CDCs. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art research in sustainable CDCs.

Current vent hole designs for fruit cartons, however, often result from trials and errors or are developed in order to improve a specific package functionality, such as fruit cooling rate. This study presents a novel multiparameter evaluation process for ventilated fruit packaging. This multi-parameter strategy evaluates cooling rate and cooling uniformity, airflow resistance and energy efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics is used to evaluate the impact of internal trays and four vent hole designs. One of the designs investigated is currently used in commercial export of apples, while the other three are new configurations proposed to improve fruit cooling efficiency. Results showed that the addition of trays to the existing commercially used Standard Vent hole design increased ventilation energy consumption by 31 % compared to cartons without trays, but in the two newly proposed carton designs (Altvent and Multivent), the energy usage was reduced by 27 and 26 %, respectively, as airflow was distributed more evenly between the five fruit layers. The use of the new vent hole designs (Altvent and Multivent) compared to the Standard Vent design, also considerably improved cooling uniformity and energy efficiency during FAC, reducing cooling heterogeneity by 79 and 51 %, as well as energy consumption by 48 and 7 %, when packed with and without trays, respectively. By simultaneous evaluation of multiple parameters, this analysis approach thus unveiled the benefits and disadvantages of the new ventilated carton designs and can be used to further improve vent hole designs for specific cold chains. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Airflow; Carton design; Cold storage; Cooling efficiency; Forced air cooling; Ventilation","Cold storage; Computational efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics; Design; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fruits; Packaging; Ventilation; Vents; Airflow; Airflow resistance; Analysis approach; Cooling efficiency; Cooling uniformity; Forced air cooling; Multiparameter analysis; Multiple parameters; Cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965031348

The main concerns for wide adoption are the overall cost, the limited number of charging cycles (or lifetime), the depth of discharge, the low energy density and the sustainability of materials used. Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB) are a promising option to mitigate many of these shortcomings, and demonstration projects using this technology are being implemented both in Europe and in the USA. This study presents a model using MATLAB/Simulink, to demonstrate how a VRFB based storage device can provide multi-ancillary services, focusing on frequency regulation and peak-shaving functions. The study presents a storage system at a medium voltage substation and considers a small grid load profile, originating from a residential neighbourhood and fast charging stations demand. The model also includes an inverter controller that provides a net power output from the battery system, in order to offer both services simultaneously. Simulation results show that the VRFB storage device can regulate frequency effectively due to its fast response time, while still performing peak-shaving services. VRFB potential in grid connected systems is discussed to increase awareness of decision makers, while identifying the main challenges for wider implementation of storage systems, particularly related to market structure and standardisation requirements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the random write operations of NAND flash memory heavily affect the I/O performance, thus seriously degrading the application performance in mobile devices. The main reason for slow random write operations is the out-of-place update feature of NAND flash memory. Newly emerged non-volatile memory, such as phase-change memory, spin transfer torque, supports in-place updates and presents much better I/O performance than that of flash memory. All these good features make non-volatile memory (NVM) as a promising solution to improve the random write performance for NAND flash memory. In this paper, we propose a non-volatile memory for random access (NVMRA) scheme to utilize NVM to improve the I/O performance in mobile devices. NVMRA exploits the I/O behaviors of applications to improve the random write performance for each application. Based on different I/O behaviors, such as random write-dominant I/O behavior, NVMRA adopts different storing decisions. The scheme is evaluated on a real Android 4.2 platform. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the I/O performance and reduce the I/O energy consumption for mobile devices. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The vast majority of Earth’s surface is composed of water, which makes such networks a very interesting research topic and enables a variety of applications, i.e, from oil monitoring to real time water pollution control. The design of USNs is paramount to the network’s operation. In comparison to terrestrial wireless sensor nodes, USNs are more expensive, larger, and present greater energy consumption, due to the harsh conditions of the aquatic environment. This leads to different challenges that need to be addressed in the design of the node, including processing, communications, energy management, data sensing, and storage. This survey aids in the development of underwater sensor nodes, and underwater applications. We present a general architecture of USNs and discuss the basic functions that must be accomplished by each unit. We also present a comprehensive study of all elements that compose a sensor node, including microcontrollers, memories, sensors, and batteries. In doing so, we highlight which aspects should be of pivotal importance in the design of a USN and how they affect communication protocols and applications.

With a set of experiments on model carbon electrodes we gave evidence to the fact that some carbon materials promote spontaneous nucleation of lead crystals. We propose a mechanism such that the carbon, as soon as in a lead containing environment, immobilizes some lead on its surface. Such immobilized lead acts as nucleation seed for the deposition of lead when a current is passed through the material.

The advantage of the use of these technologies is that they could be more effective than conventional technologies in creating a local increase in the resilience of the network. This approach would allow for differentiating the reliability per (groups of) customers. Different smart grid technologies are evaluated based on how cost-effectively they can increase the local reliability. The creation of microgrids in combination with local energy storage and the reconfiguration of the network by remote switching, are the two smart grid technologies which are investigated in this paper. The use of energy storage can increase the reliability of a single node without affecting the other nodes, however the costs of implementing energy storage are still similar to the cost of conventional network reinforcement methods to locally increase the reliability. The cost of using remotely-controlled switches to increase the reliability at a single node is much lower.

From this point of view, artificial neural network (ANN) models are desired options to determine techno-economic performances of this kind of plants. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (CGP), used in the ANN to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage. The obtained statistical parameters showed that LM algorithm with 38 neurons in a single hidden layer looks as the best ANN model to predict the annual power generation (PGnet) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the presented PTSTPP. Moreover, the obtained weights from this topology were used in the LCOE analysis for determining the optimum system design.

Sepiolite is an important natural fibrous raw material. Nanoscale fibrous tubular structure of sepiolite becomes important in nanocomposite preparation. In this study, sepiolite/paraffin and sepiolite/decanoic acid nanocomposites were manufactured by the direct impregnation method. By the preparation of nanocomposites, PCM move in tubular channels of sepiolite, phase changing occurs in these tubes and surface area increases like as in microencapsulation. The structure and properties of nanocomposites PCMs (CPCM) have been characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The SEM results prove the successful preparation of phase change material/sepiolite nanocomposites and point out that the fibers of sepiolite is modified with phase change materials in the nanocomposite.

We identify that this additional latency has a substantial effect on performance for an important class of latency-critical memory operations: those that result in a cache miss and are dependent on data from a prior cache miss. We observe that the number of instructions between the first cache miss and its dependent cache miss is usually small. To minimize dependent cache miss latency, we propose adding just enough functionality to dynamically identify these instructions at the core and migrate them to the memory controller for execution as soon as source data arrives from DRAM. This migration allows memory requests issued by our new Enhanced Memory Controller (EMC) to experience a 20% lower latency than if issued by the core. On a set of memory intensive quad-core workloads, the EMC results in a 13% improvement in system performance and a 5% reduction in energy consumption over a system with a Global History Buffer prefetcher, the highest performing prefetcher in our evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computer architecture; Controllers; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Cache Miss; Memory access latency; Memory controller; Memory operations; Multi-core processor; On chips; Source data; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988360129

Trees are sustainable and renewable materials, which give us shelter and oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees are a primary resource that human society depends upon every day, for example, homes, heating, furniture, and aircraft. Wood from trees gives us paper, cardboard, and medical supplies, thus impacting our homes, school, work, and play. All of the above-mentioned applications have been well developed over the past thousands of years. However, trees and wood have much more to offer us as advanced materials, impacting emerging high-tech fields, such as bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Wood naturally has a hierarchical structure, composed of well-oriented microfibers and tracheids for water, ion, and oxygen transportation during metabolism. At higher magnification, the walls of fiber cells have an interesting morphology - a distinctly mesoporous structure. Moreover, the walls of fiber cells are composed of thousands of fibers (or macrofibrils) oriented in a similar angle. Nanofibrils and nanocrystals can be further liberated from macrofibrils by mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods. The obtained nanocellulose has unique optical, mechanical, and barrier properties and is an excellent candidate for chemical modification and reconfiguration. Wood is naturally a composite material, comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wood is sustainable, earth abundant, strong, biodegradable, biocompatible, and chemically accessible for modification; more importantly, multiscale natural fibers from wood have unique optical properties applicable to different kinds of optoelectronics and photonic devices. Today, the materials derived from wood are ready to be explored for applications in new technology areas, such as electronics, biomedical devices, and energy. The goal of this study is to review the fundamental structures and chemistries of wood and wood-derived materials, which are essential for a wide range of existing and new enabling technologies. The scope of the review covers multiscale materials and assemblies of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as other biomaterials derived from wood, in regard to their major emerging applications. Structure-properties-application relationships will be investigated in detail. Understanding the fundamental properties of these structures is crucial for designing and manufacturing products for emerging applications. Today, a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and performance of wood and wood-derived materials is advancing historical applications of these materials. This new level of understanding also enables a myriad of new and exciting applications, which motivate this review. There are excellent reviews already on the classical topic of woody materials, and some recent reviews also cover new understanding of these materials as well as potential applications. This review will focus on the uniqueness of woody materials for three critical applications: green electronics, biological devices, and energy storage and bioenergy. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Biomaterials; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cellulose; Chemical modification; Climate change; Fibers; Fighter aircraft; Flexible electronics; Forestry; Lignin; Natural fibers; Optical properties; Photonic devices; Product design; Structural properties; Application relationships; Critical applications; Emerging applications; Fundamental properties; Fundamental structures; Global climate changes; Hierarchical structures; Manufacturing products; Wood; Electronics; Energy; Furniture; Oxygen; artificial membrane; cellulose; hemicellulose; hydrogel; lignin; nanofiber; polysaccharide; artificial membrane; chemistry; devices; electrical equipment; electrochemical analysis; genetic procedures; green chemistry; hydrogel; lab on a chip; paper; porosity; renewable energy; wood; Biosensing Techniques; Cellulose; Electrical Equipment and Supplies; Electrochemical Techniques; Green Chemistry Technology; Hydrogels; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Lignin; Membranes, Artificial; Nanofibers; Paper; Polysaccharides; Porosity; Renewable Energy; Wood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983666599

To better accommodate 3D features and nearby off profile resistivity structures, the full MT impedance tensor data together with the tipper were inverted. As a model control, a detailed bathymetry is systematically incorporated in the inversion. Our results from testing different inversion settings emphasised that appropriately choosing and tuning the starting model, data error floor and the model regularization together are crucial to obtain optimum benefit from MT field data. Through the 3D inversion, we reproduced out of quadrant impedance components and obtained an overall satisfactory data fit (RMS = 1.05). The final 3D resistivity model displays a complex geology of the near surface region (< 1.5 km), which suggests fractures, localized and regional fault systems and igneous intrusions in the Mesozoic platform cover deposits. The Billefjorden fault zone is revealed as a consistent and deep rooted (> 2 km) conductive anomaly, confirming the regional nature of the fault. The fault zone is positioned between two uplifted basement blocks (> 1000 Ωm) of presumably pre-Devonian (Caledonian) metamorphic rocks, and the fault may have been responsible for deformation in the overlying Paleozoic-Mesozoic unit. Upper crustal conductive anomalies (< 10 Ωm) below the Paleozoic-Mesozoic succession in the western part of the 3D model are interpreted as part of a Devonian basin fill.

Since studies of energy coupling and transport kinetics are complicated in vivo, we purified the major lysine transporter (Lyp1) of yeast and reconstituted the protein into lipid vesicles. We show that the Michaelis constant (KM) of transport from out-to-in is well in the millimolar range and at least 3 to 4-orders of magnitude higher than that of transport in the opposite direction, disfavoring the efflux of solute via Lyp1. We also find that at low values of the proton motive force, the transport by Lyp1 is comparatively slow. We benchmarked the properties of eukaryotic Lyp1 to that of the prokaryotic homologue LysP and find that LysP has a similar KM for transport from in-to-out and out-to-in, consistent with rapid influx and efflux. We thus explain the previously described unidirectional nature of lysine transport in S. cerevisiae by the extraordinary kinetics of Lyp1 and provide a mechanism and rationale for previous observations. The high asymmetry in transport together with secondary storage in the vacuole allow the cell to accumulate basic amino acids to very high levels. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"amino acid transporter; LYP1 protein, S cerevisiae; lysine; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; active transport; biological model; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; physiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acid Transport Systems, Basic; Biological Transport, Active; Kinetics; Lysine; Models, Biological; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983490998

The structure and composition, cross-section morphology, thermal stability performances and phase change behaviors of ASO and UV-cured PCMs were examined by using Attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis system (TGA), scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicate that the UV-cured biobased PCMs possess perfect phase change properties and a suitable working temperature range. The heating process phase change enthalpy is measured between 30 and 68 J/g, and the freezing process phase change enthalpy is found between 18 and 70 J/g. The decomposition of UV-cured PCMs started at 260 °C and reached a maximum of 430 °C. All the biobased UV-cured PCMs improved latent heat storage capacity in comparison with the pristine ASO sample.

The knowledge of these parameters is essential since they serve as input data to the models of water radiolysis in the primary loop of light water reactors and super critical water reactors. Selected features of water radiolysis in heterogeneous systems, such as aqueous nanoparticle suspensions and slurries, ceramic oxides surfaces, nanoporous, and cement-based materials, are discussed.

Here, we discuss the properties of TiO2/Al2O3 nanolaminate structures constructed on silicon (1 0 0) and glass substrates using atomic layer deposition (ALD) by alternatively depositing a TiO2 sublayer and Al2O3 partial-monolayer using TTIP-H2O and TMA-H2O precursors, respectively. The Al2O3 is formed by a single TMA-H2O cycle, so it is a partial-monolayer because of steric hindrance of the precursors, while the TiO2 sublayer is formed by several TTIP-H2O cycles. Overall, each nanolaminate incorporates a certain number of Al2O3 partial-monolayers with this number varying from 10-90 in the TiO2/Al2O3 nanolaminate grown during 2700 total reaction cycles of TiO2 at a temperature of 250 °C. The fundamental properties of the TiO2/Al2O3 nanolaminates, namely film thickness, chemical composition, microstructure and morphology were examined in order to better understand the influence of the number of Al2O3 partial-monolayers on the crystallization mechanism of TiO2. In addition, some optical, electrical and mechanical properties were determined and correlated with fundamental characteristics. The results show clearly the effect of Al2O3 partial-monolayers as an internal barrier, which promotes structural inhomogeneity in the film and influences the fundamental properties of the nanolaminate. These properties are correlated with gas phase analysis that evidenced the poisoning effect of trimethylaluminum (TMA) pulse during the TiO2 layer growth, perturbing the growth per cycle and consequently the overall film thickness. It was shown that the changes in the fundamental properties of TiO2/Al2O3 nanolaminates had little influence on optical properties such as band gap and transmittance. However, in contrast, electrical properties as resistivity and mechanical properties as hardness and elastic modulus were shown to be very dependent. From these analyses, several applications could be suggested for different kinds of nanolaminates obtained in this work. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","aluminum oxide; atomic layer deposition; nanolaminate; titanium dioxide","Alumina; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum oxide; Atomic layer deposition; Crystal atomic structure; Energy gap; Film growth; Film thickness; Mechanical properties; Monolayers; Optical properties; Substrates; Titanium oxides; Crystallization mechanisms; Electrical and mechanical properties; Fundamental characteristics; Fundamental properties; Hardness and elastic modulus; Nanolaminate; Nanolaminate structures; Structural inhomogeneities; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989170509

This heterogeneous composite exhibits a conductivity as high as 0.116 S cm-1 at 600 °C with an activation energy of 0.50 eV at 400-600 °C. For the first time, a fuel cell using such a natural mineral-based composite demonstrates a maximum power density of 625 mW cm-2 at 600 °C and notable power output of 386 mW cm-2 at 450 °C. The extraordinary ionic conductivity and device performances are primarily attributed to the heterophasic interfacial conduction effect of the hematite-LCP composite.

An internal combustion engine in wide speed range drives a six phase permanent magnet generator producing variable frequency and amplitude voltage. The engine operates in high efficiency region. The generator's high frequency voltage is rectified. In the new developed generating system a boost rectifier draws sinusoidal current from the permanent magnet generator and stabilizes output DC voltages. The boost rectifier produces two symmetrical DC voltages-positive and negative referenced to a zero potential. The system topology provides stiff zero potential that is very advantageous in DC/AC conversion producing multiphase AC sinusoidal voltage. The boost rectifier is very robust and represents high short circuit current. Moreover, the generating set is equipped in balancer that in case of asymmetrical load keeps zero current in the neutral wire. It is also equipped in energy storage system, connected in parallel to the DC voltages to stabilize them in case of load change.

The size and shape of cavities, impurities and the metal ions define their usage. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a technique to determine paramagnetic species in host materials, and hence in the zeolites and clay type minerals. In this study natural clinoptilolite obtained from Bigadiç district in Western Anatolia, was studied using EPR spectroscopy in natural form and after some physical and chemical treatments, namely adsorbing CO2, H2S, and SO2 gases, [Cu(H2O)6]2+ ions and after exposing to gamma rays. The clinoptilolite including non-paramagnetic manganese ions as impurities in natural form reduced to paramagnetic Mn2+ ions after CO2 and H2S adsorption, and when SO2 gas is adsorbed an unstable paramagnetic center was induced which changed with time when stored at room temperature. When Cu(H2O)6 was adsorbed Cu2+ ion complex was adsorbed in the cavity in slightly distorted octahedral structure.

This bearing setup is part of a flywheel energy storage system. The advantage of using a passive bearing system is that it offers low friction without the need of a magnetic bearing controller, increasing the reliability and decreasing the energy consumption. The first set of tests were quasi-static radial and axial force measurements of the PMB operating alone and together with the SMB. As the PMB is intrinsically unstable in one degree of freedom, the operation of the SMB together with the PMB is necessary to stabilize the system. After that, dynamic measurements were made for the SMB operating alone and together with the PMB. The resonant speeds were identified and the bearing radial and axial forces were also measured for the SMB and SMB + PMB operation.

However, the lack of efficient storage materials has thus far critically limited the widespread adoption of hydrogen, and to overcome this limitation, a promising solid-state storage method is needed. Attractive lightweight metal-based materials for solid-state storage are characterized by the capability to reversibly store a large quantity of hydrogen and should meet or exceed the United States Department of Energy (DOE) on-board storage targets. However, the undesirable kinetic performances of metal hydrides as solid-state storage materials have hindered their practical use as hydrogen storage systems. The kinetic performances, which include the rate of hydrogen uptake or release, are among the most critical requirements of a storage system, and these performances can be determined using the hydrogen absorption and desorption rates. Thus, determining the relevant kinetics is required to supply sufficient amounts of hydrogen and to achieve fast refueling in the system.

However, due to their energy constraints and internal losses, the restoration of the state of charge (SoC) to a reference range is of vital importance to fulfil their tasks. In this paper, we propose SoC control schemes based on existing ones, and then we evaluate their behavior in predictable and stochastic power system applications. The modifications include parameter tuning based on the actual BESS state, as well as alternating the control scheme according to forecasts of the application signal. Furthermore, we extend a Lithium-Ion battery model in order to quantify capacity degradation and hence, investigate the impact of the various SoC restoration strategies. Results show that potentials to increase the lifetime are application-dependent, based on the degree of flexibility allowed by a service. Overall, the calendar aging dominates the cycling aging and thus, there is limited space for improvement with different SoC control schemes. On the other hand, by incorporating forecast information, we can reduce the amount of energy needed for the SoC restoration and hence, decrease additional energy costs. © 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.","battery energy storage system; capacity degradation; frequency control; lithium-ion battery; peak shaving; ramp rate control; state of charge control","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric frequency control; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Restoration; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Battery energy storage systems; Capacity degradation; Peak shaving; Ramp rates; State of charge; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986610742

The stochastic OPF, which uses multiple forecast scenarios, generally leads to a lower cost compared to the standard deterministic OPF, which uses a single forecast. However, the stochastic OPF is computationally more demanding than the deterministic OPF. Both cost savings and computation times further increase when storage units or ramp-constrained generators are included, as they require solving a multi-period OPF problem. Our contribution is a hybrid method approaching the cost performance of the stochastic OPF while maintaining a computational burden close to the deterministic OPF. The method combines elements from both the stochastic and the deterministic OPF, and relies on Benders Cuts to interface them. Using a receding horizon approach over one year, we find that, based on eleven test cases, one version of our hybrid method leads to at least 70% of the cost improvement of the stochastic OPF, while the computation time increase is at most 40% of the stochastic OPF time increase. Furthermore, the computational advantage of our method increases with the system size. Two different versions of the method allow favoring of either the computational improvement or the cost improvement. We also identify directions for further improvement. Finally, our method can be used for more general problems in which one wishes to combine two models with different levels of complexity. © 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.","Benders Cuts; Forecast Scenarios; Multi-Period; Optimal Power Flow; Stochastic; Storage","Acoustic generators; Costs; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Forecasting; Ramp generators; Renewable energy resources; Benders Cuts; Computational advantages; Dc optimal power flow; Multi-period; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Renewable energy source; Stochastic; Stochastic systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986592893

Such flexible operation of the PHS units ensures capability of the PHS to provide the frequency control reserves even during the pumping mode. It may lead to increased revenues in the electricity market conditions. It is important to quantify the benefits of PHS, especially variable-speed ones. This paper proposes a Stochastic Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SSCUC) model which takes into account different models of pumped hydro units. Different energy and reserve provision models are considered for fixed-speed and variable-speed units in the generating and pumping modes. The presented day-ahead SSCUC problem considers the optimization of energy and reserves costs. The problem is solved using Benders decomposition approach, for which the master problem solves the unit commitment and the sub-problems ensure the feasibility of the solution for the base operating point and for a set of dedicated scenarios. The set of scenarios includes the base operating point, contingencies (i.e. N-1 criterion), and stochasticity of demand and renewable injections.

The thermodynamically favoured path results in the reduction of CO2 to CO, whereas the other, kinetically preferred channel involves CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid under water-free conditions. Both paths are promoted by catalytic amounts of water confined inside the zeolite micropores with a stronger promotion effect for the reduction path.

In fact, in order to improve resilience and enable islanded mode, micro-grid energy management systems must dynamically manage controllable loads by considering not only matching energy generation and consumption, but also thermal comfort of the occupants. Thermal comfort, which is often neglected or oversimplified, plays a major role in dynamic demand response, especially in front of intermittent behavior of the renewable energy sources. This paper presents a novel control algorithm for joint demand response management and thermal comfort optimization in a microgrid composed of a block of buildings, a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, and an energy storage unit. In order to address the large-scale nature of the problem, the proposed control strategy adopt a two-level supervisory strategy: at the lower level, each building employs a local controller that processes only local measurements; at the upper level, a centralized unit supervises and updates the three controllers with the aim of minimizing the aggregate energy cost and thermal discomfort of the microgrid. Comparisons with alternative strategies reveal that the proposed supervisory strategy efficiently manages the demand response so as to sensibly improve independence of the microgrid with respect to the main grid, and guarantees at the same time thermal comfort of the occupants. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Climate control; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Thermal comfort; Wind turbines; Control strategies; Dynamic demand response; Energy generations; Energy storage unit; Intermittent behaviors; Photovoltaic arrays; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986222851

The hardware part consists of a link layer and a physical layer (analog radio), which is out of the scope of this work. Great emphasis was placed on minimizing hardware area and power consumption. Most of the complex and sequential functions were moved to the software Intermediate Layer introduced in this paper. Furthermore, Single Port RAM (SPRAM) was used to reduce the number of registers in the design. Flexibility was achieved by division of the hardware into two separate clock domains. Hardware part was designed using fully synthesizable Verilog HDL to simplify integration process into a System on Chip (SoC). In the proposed architecture the standard Bluetooth software stack may be used for the controller management.

Substantial research has been performed on the effect of electrical field strength on the inactivation kinetics of spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms and on the outgrowth of spoilage micro-organisms during shelf life. However, studies on the effect of electrical field strength on the inactivation and outgrowth of surviving populations during shelf life are missing. In this study, we assessed the influence of electrical field strength applied by PEF processing and storage temperature on the outgrowth of surviving yeast and mould populations naturally present in fresh fruit smoothie in time. Therefore, an apple-strawberry-banana smoothie was treated in a continuous-flow PEF system (130 L/h), using similar inlet and outlet conditions (preheating temperature 41 °C, maximum temperature 58 °C) to assure that the amount of energy across the different conditions was kept constant. Smoothies treated with variable electrical field strengths (13.5, 17.0, 20.0 and 24.0 kV/cm) were compared to smoothies without treatment for outgrowth of yeasts and moulds. Outgrowth of yeasts and moulds stored at 4 °C and 7 °C was analysed by plating and visual observation and yeast growth was modelled using the modified logistic growth model (Zwietering model). Results showed that the intensity of the electrical field strength had an influence on the degree of inactivation of yeast cells, resulting in a faster outgrowth over time at lower electrical field strength. Outgrowth of moulds over time was not affected by the intensity of the electrical field strength used.Application of PEF introduces a trade-off between type of spoilage: in untreated smoothie yeasts lead to spoilage after 8 days when stored at 4 or 7 °C, whereas in PEF treated smoothie yeasts were (partly) inactivated and provided outgrowth opportunities for moulds, which led to spoilage by moulds after 14 days (7 °C) or 18 days (4 °C). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Electrical field strength; Global modeling; Pulsed electric field (PEF); Shelf life; Visual spoilage; Yeast and moulds","apple; banana; controlled study; electric field; fruit; fungal cell culture; human; mould; statistical model; storage temperature; strawberry; yeast; yeast cell; electricity; food preservation; Fragaria; fruit; fruit and vegetable juice; growth, development and aging; Malus; microbiology; Musa; pasteurization; procedures; temperature; yeast; Electricity; Food Preservation; Fragaria; Fruit; Fruit and Vegetable Juices; Malus; Musa; Pasteurization; Temperature; Yeasts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963811266

In this paper, a new geodetic tool, i.e., Global Positioning System (GPS), is used for the first time to estimate monthly ET variations at a regional scale. Based on the water balance equation, the monthly ET variation is estimated using the GPS-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) from January 2006 to July 2015 in MRB. The annual amplitude of GPS-inferred TWS in MRB agrees well with the results of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The ET variations from the water balance approach agree well with the land surface modeling and remote sensing data. The correlation of GPS-inferred ET with other ET products is higher than 0.8, which indicates that the GPS-estimated ET well characterizes the ET variations in MRB. The annual amplitude of GPS-inferred ET variations is 47.9 mm/month, which is close to that from land surface modeling of North American Land Data Assimilation System, and a little larger than MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The mean monthly ET reaches its maximum in June-July and its minimum in December, which is consistent with the periodic pattern of radiative energy in a year. Furthermore, the ET variations are mainly dominated by the temperature change in MRB. © 2016 IEEE.","Evapotranspiration (ET); Global Positioning System (GPS); Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE); Mississippi River basin (MRB); Terrestrial water storage (TWS)","Digital storage; Evapotranspiration; Geodetic satellites; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Rivers; Surface measurement; Water supply; Watersheds; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Land surface modeling; Mississippi River Basin; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; North american land data assimilation systems; Remote sensing data; Terrestrial water storage; Water balance equation; Global positioning system; data assimilation; estimation method; evapotranspiration; GPS; GRACE; hydrological cycle; land surface; MODIS; observational method; remote sensing; river basin; water storage; Mississippi River; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992296702

In this research, a hydrodynamically based description of the flow between hydropower stations was implemented to study the relative importance of wave diffusion on the spectrum of hydrograph variance in a regulated watershed. Using spectral decomposition of the effluence hydrograph of a watershed, an exact expression of the variance in the outflow response was derived, as a function of the trends of hydraulic and geomorphologic dispersion and management of production and reservoirs. We show that the power spectra of involved time-series follow nearly fractal patterns, which facilitates examination of the relative importance of wave diffusion and possible changes in production demand on the outflow spectrum. The exact spectral solution can also identify statistical bounds of future demand patterns due to limitations in storage capacity. The impact of the hydraulic description of the stream flow on the reservoir discharge was examined for a given power demand in River Dalälven, Sweden, as function of a stream flow Peclet number. The regulation of hydropower production on the River Dalälven generally increased the short-term variance in the effluence hydrograph, whereas wave diffusion decreased the short-term variance over periods of <1 week, depending on the Peclet number (Pe) of the stream reach. This implies that flow variance becomes more erratic (closer to white noise) as a result of current production objectives. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Authenticated skip lists and rank-based authenticated skip lists (RBASL) have been used to provide support for provable data update operations in cloud storage. However, in a dynamic file scenario, an RBASL based on block indices falls short when updates are not proportional to a fixed block size; such an update to the file, even if small, may result in O(n) updates on the data structure for a file with n blocks. To overcome this problem, we introduce FlexList, a flexible length-based authenticated skip list. FlexList translates variable-size updates to O(⌈u/B⌉) insertions, removals, or modifications, where u is the size of the update and B is the (average) block size. We further present various optimizations on the four types of skip lists (regular, authenticated, rank-based authenticated, and FlexList). We build such a structure in O(n) time and parallelize this operation for the first time. We compute one single proof to answer multiple (non)membership queries and obtain efficiency gains of 35%, 35%, and 40% in terms of proof time, energy, and size, respectively. We propose a method of handling multiple updates at once, achieving efficiency gains of up to 60% at the server side and 90% at the client side. We also deployed our implementation of FlexDPDP (dynamic provable data possession (DPDP) with FlexList instead of RBASL) on PlanetLab, demonstrating that FlexDPDP performs comparable to the most efficient static storage scheme (provable data possession (PDP)) while providing dynamic data support. © 2016 ACM.","Authenticated dictionary; Cloud storage; Data integrity; Provable data possession; Skip list","Query processing; Security of data; Cloud storages; Data integrity; Efficiency gain; Membership query; Provable data possessions; Skip listes; Static storage; Untrusted server; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983775262

It is a well known fact that the solution to this problem corresponds to the generation settings that lead to equal marginal/incremental costs for all generators and for which the total generation output is equal to the total load. This provides a way to determine the solution to the economic dispatch problem by simply considering the marginal cost curves of the generators and the demand curve. In this paper, we integrate the effect of storage into this marginal cost analysis. This requires the consideration of conversion losses occurring in the storage converter, the extension to a multi-step optimization problem and the limitations imposed by the limited energy storage capacity. A method is provided by which the optimal generation and storage settings can be determined by only using marginal cost curves and the intersections thereof.

Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased levels of NPY in the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that the central release of NPY has coordinated and integrated effects on energy metabolism in different tissues, resulting in increased energy storage and decreased energy expenditure (EE). We first investigated the acute effects of an intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of NPY on gene expression in liver, brown adipose tissue, soleus muscle, and sc and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT). We found increased expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and triglyceride secretion in the liver already 2-hour after the start of the NPY administration. In brown adipose tissue, the expression of thermogenic genes was decreased. In sc WAT, the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis was increased, whereas in soleus muscle, the expression of lipolytic genes was decreased after ICV NPY. These findings indicate that the ICV infusion of NPY acutely and simultaneously increases lipogenesis and decreases lipolysis in different tissues. Subsequently, we investigated the acute effects of ICV NPY on locomotor activity, respiratory exchange ratio, EE, and body temperature. The ICV infusion of NPY increased locomotor activity, body temperature, and EE as well as respiratory exchange ratio. Together, these results show that an acutely increased central availability of NPY results in a shift of metabolism towards lipid storage and an increased use of carbohydrates, while at the same time increasing activity, EE, and body temperature.

Therefore the development of systems for efficient H2 production becomes important. The several conventional methods of mass-scale (or central) H2 production (methane, natural gas and higher hydrocarbons reforming, coal gasification reforming) are well developed and their costs of H2 production are acceptable. However, due to the H2 transport and storage problems the small-scale (distributed) technologies for H2 production are demanded. However, these new technologies have to meet the requirement of producing H2 at a production cost of $(1-2)/kg(H2) (or 60 g(H2)/kWh) by 2020 (the U.S. Department of Energy's target). Recently several plasma methods have been proposed for the small-scale H2 production. The most promising plasmas for this purpose seems to be those generated by gliding, plasmatron and nozzle arcs, and microwave discharges. In this paper plasma methods proposed for H2 production are briefly described and critically evaluated from the view point of H2 production efficiency. The paper is aiming at answering a question if any plasma method for the small-scale H2 production approaches such challenges as the production energy yield of 60 g(H2)/kWh, high production rate, high reliability and low investment cost. © 2016 EDP Sciences.",,"Costs; Economics; Electric discharges; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Hydrogen production; Investments; Conventional methods; High production rate; Higher hydrocarbons; Hydrogen-based economy; Microwave discharge; Production efficiency; Production energies; U.S. Department of Energy; Natural gas well production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981328183

Therefore, evidence-based recommendations regarding raw milk handling and storage are needed to safely promote supplying hospitalized infants with their mother's own milk. Objectives: To evaluate raw human milk storage methods according to Brazilian milk management regulations by investigating the effects of refrigeration (5°C) for 12 hours and freezing (-20°C) for 15 days on the acidity and energy content in a large number of raw milk samples. Methods: Expressed milk samples from 100 distinct donors were collected in glass bottles. Each sample was separated into 3 equal portions that were analyzed at room temperature and after either 12 hours of refrigeration or 15 days of freezing. Milk acidity and energy content were determined by Dornic titration and creamatocrit technique, respectively. Results: All samples showed Dornic acidity values within the established acceptable limit (≤ 8°D), as required by Brazilian regulations. In addition, energy content did not significantly differ among fresh, refrigerated and frozen milk samples (median of ∼50 kcal/100 mL for each). Conclusion: Most samples tested (> 80%) were considered top quality milk (< 4°D) based on acidity values, and milk energy content was preserved after storage. We conclude that the storage methods required by Brazilian regulations are suitable to ensure milk safety and energy content of stored milk when supplied to neonates. © 2016 The Author(s).","Brazil; breastfeeding; creamatocrit; Dornic acidity; energy content; human milk bank; milk quality","adult; Brazil; breast milk; breast milk expression; chemistry; cryopreservation; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; milk bank; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; procedures; refrigeration; specimen handling; standards; Adult; Brazil; Breast Milk Expression; Cryopreservation; Government Regulation; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Milk Banks; Milk, Human; Refrigeration; Specimen Handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978997661

This study investigates the potential to improve the efficiency through compensation of the density difference by increased salinity of the injected hot water for a single injection-recovery well scheme. The proposed method was tested through numerical modeling with SEAWATv4, considering seasonal HT-ATES with four consecutive injection-storage-recovery cycles. Recovery efficiencies for the consecutive cycles were investigated for six cases with three simulated scenarios: (a) regular HT-ATES, (b) HT-ATES with density difference compensation using saline water, and (c) theoretical regular HT-ATES without free thermal convection. For the reference case, in which 80 °C water was injected into a high-permeability aquifer, regular HT-ATES had an efficiency of 0.40 after four consecutive recovery cycles. The density difference compensation method resulted in an efficiency of 0.69, approximating the theoretical case (0.76). Sensitivity analysis showed that the net efficiency increase by using the density difference compensation method instead of regular HT-ATES is greater for higher aquifer hydraulic conductivity, larger temperature difference between injection water and ambient groundwater, smaller injection volume, and larger aquifer thickness. This means that density difference compensation allows the application of HT-ATES in thicker, more permeable aquifers and with larger temperatures than would be considered for regular HT-ATES systems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Density difference compensation; Groundwater density; Numerical modeling; Recovery efficiency","aquifer; geothermal energy; heating; high temperature; numerical model; salinity; thermal convection; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978871043

These techniques use a combination of periodic model filters and, possibly periodic, masking filters. Time-multiplexing is in general beneficial since only rarely does the technology bound maximum obtainable clock frequency and the application determined required sample rate correspond. Therefore, architectures for time-multiplexed FRM filters that benefit from the inherent sparsity of the periodic filters are introduced in this paper. We show that FRM filters not only reduce the number of multipliers needed, but also have benefits in terms of memory usage. Despite the total amount of samples to be stored is larger for FRM, it results in fewer memory resources needed in FPGAs and more energy efficient memory schemes in ASICs. In total, the power consumption is significantly reduced compared with a single-stage implementation. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the interpolation factor that gives the least complexity for the periodic model filter and subsequent masking filter(s) is a function of the time-multiplexing factor, meaning that the minimum number of multipliers not always corresponds to the minimum number of multiplications. Both single-port and dual-port memories are considered, and the involved tradeoff in number of multipliers and memory complexity is illustrated. The results show that, for FPGA implementation, the power reduction ranges from 23% to 68% for the considered examples. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Architecture; ASIC; FIR Filter; FPGA; Frequency-response masking; Memories; Time-multiplexing","Application specific integrated circuits; Architecture; Bandpass filters; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Frequency multiplying circuits; Frequency response; Memory architecture; Multiplexing; Random access storage; Reconfigurable hardware; Time division multiplexing; FPGA implementations; Frequency response masking; Frequency response masking techniques; Memory complexity; Periodic filters; Time multiplexed; Time multiplexing; Transition bands; FIR filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978289318

Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands","Soft, disordered, micro-structured materials are ubiquitous in nature and industry, and are different from ordinary fluids or solids, with unusual, interesting static and flow properties. The transition from fluid to solid—at the so-called jamming density—features a multitude of complex mechanisms, but there is no unified theoretical framework that explains them all. In this study, a simple yet quantitative and predictive model is presented, which allows for a changing jamming density, encompassing the memory of the deformation history and explaining a multitude of phenomena at and around jamming. The jamming density, now introduced as a new state-variable, changes due to the deformation history and relates the system’s macroscopic response to its micro-structure. The packing efficiency can increase logarithmically slow under gentle repeated (isotropic) compression, leading to an increase of the jamming density. In contrast, shear deformations cause anisotropy, changing the packing efficiency exponentially fast with either dilatancy or compactancy as result. The memory of the system near jamming can be explained by a micro-statistical model that involves a multiscale, fractal energy landscape and links the microscopic particle picture to the macroscopic continuum description, providing a unified explanation for the qualitatively different flow-behavior for different deformation modes. To complement our work, a recipe to extract the history-dependent jamming density from experimentally accessible data is proposed, and alternative state-variables are compared. The proposed simple macroscopic constitutive model is calibrated from particles simulation data, with the variable jamming density—resembling the memory of microstructure—as essential novel ingredient. This approach can help understanding predicting and mitigating failure of structures or geophysical hazards, and will bring forward industrial process design and optimization, and help solving scientific challenges in fundamental research. © 2016, The Author(s).","Anisotropy; Creep/relaxation; Critical state; Dilatancy; Jamming; Memory; Structure","Anisotropy; Creep; Critical current density (superconductivity); Data storage equipment; Deformation; Industrial research; Microstructure; Structure (composition); Continuum description; Critical state; Dilatancy; Fundamental research; Industrial process design; Macroscopic constitutive models; Structured materials; Theoretical framework; Jamming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977670080

This model effectively incorporates the concept of random close packing or jamming of repulsive spheres into a free energy F that depends on droplet volume fraction ϕ and shear strain γ both below and above the a critical jamming point ϕc ≈ 0.646. This free energy has three terms: entropic, electrostatic, and interfacial (EEI). By minimizing F with respect to an average droplet deformation parameter that links all three terms, we show that the entropic term is dominant for ϕ well below ϕc, the electrostatic term is dominant for ϕ near but below ϕc, and the interfacial term dominates for larger ϕ. This EEI model describes measurements of G′p(ϕ) for charge-stabilized uniform emulsions having a wide range of droplet sizes, ranging from nanoscale to microscale, and it also is consistent with measurements of Π(ϕ). Moreover, it describes G′p(ϕ) for similar nanoemulsions after adding non-amphiphilic salt, when changes in the interfacial tension and the Debye screening length are properly taken into account. By unifying existing approaches, the EEI model predicts constitutive properties of concentrated ionic emulsions that have disordered, out-of-equilibrium structures through near-equilibrium free energy minimization, consistent with random driving Brownian excitations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Constitutitve equation; Disorder; Droplet deformation; Emulsion; Storage modulus; Surfactant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973649015

This paper discusses the latest developments and advancement of a solar water heater based on the three basic components that may affect the thermal performance of the system. It also reviews the development of various types of solar collectors in solar water heater, including both the non-concentrating collectors (flat plate collector, evacuated tube collector) and the concentrating collectors (parabolic dish reflector, parabolic trough collector). All these are studied in terms of optical optimization, heat loss reduction, heat recuperation enhancement and different sun tracking mechanisms.

As an indispensible component in electronics, commercial micro-supercapacitors are disadvantageous in their clumsy cuboid geometry and limited capacity, and are not promising for future applications. In comparison, film-like micro-supercapacitors are superior in miniaturized system integration since they can be folded to fit in restricted spaces while maintaining a high level of volumetric energy density. Here, we carried out a benchmark study of a state-of-the-art well-packaged thin film micro-supercapacitor toward commercial micro-supercapacitor and aluminum electrolyte capacitor. The micro-planar supercapacitor not only exhibits 3.75 times of a commercial micro-supercapacitor and 8785 times of an aluminum electrolytic capacitor in volumetric energy density under 1000 mV s-1 scan rate, but can also be tailored into diversified shapes, rolled up, and plugged into tiny interstitial spaces inside a device. Such ultrathin (18 μm) micro-supercapacitor component with high volumetric energy density (0.98 mWh cm-3 in LiCl-PVA gel, 5.7 mWh cm-3 in ionic liquid), can be integrated into an electronic device system and shows a series of superior performance characteristics over current commercial benchmarks, which may find vast applications. © 2016 .","Aluminum electrolyte capacitor; Graphene; Laser; Micro-supercapacitor; Surface mountable supercapacitor","Aluminum alloys; Benchmarking; Capacitors; Electrolytes; Flexible electronics; Graphene; Ionic liquids; Lasers; Lithium compounds; Supercapacitor; Aluminum electrolytes; Aluminum electrolytic capacitors; Electronic component; Energy storage components; Micro supercapacitors; Miniaturized systems; Performance characteristics; Volumetric energy densities; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973478501

Energy balance measurements were made at the field site for two growing seasons (treated and untreated), including observations of net radiation, heat storage, and sensible heat flux, which was measured using a large-aperture scintillometer. Latent heat flux was calculated as a residual of the energy balance, and comparisons were made between the two growing seasons and with model simulations to examine the relative impacts of vegetation removal and climate variability. Observed ET rates dropped by roughly 32% between the two growing seasons, from a mean of 4.4 ± 0.7 mm day-1 in 2009 (with live vegetation) to 3.0 ± 0.8 mm day-1 in 2010 (with dead P. australis). These results are corroborated by the Agro-IBIS model simulations, and the reduction in ET implies a total ""water savings"" of 245 mm over the course of the growing season. The significant decreases in ET were accompanied by a more-than-doubling of sensible heat flux, as well as a ~60% increase in heat storage due to decreased LAI. Removal of P. australis was also found to cause measurable changes in the local micrometeorology at the wetland. Consistent with the observed increase in sensible heat flux during 2010, warmer, drier, windier conditions were observed in the dead, P. australis section of the wetland, compared to an undisturbed section of live, native vegetation. Modeling results suggest that the elimination of transpiration in 2010 was partially offset by an increase in surface evaporation, thereby reducing the subsequent water savings by roughly 60%. Thus, the impact of vegetation removal depends on the local climate, depth to groundwater, and management decisions related to regrowth of vegetation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-IBIS; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Phragmites australis; Water balance; Wetland","Climate models; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Heat storage; Herbicides; Transpiration; Vegetation; Water supply; Weed control; Wetlands; Agro-IBIS; Climate variability; Energy and water balance; Energy-balance measurements; Large aperture scintillometers; Management decisions; Phragmites australis; Water balance; Heat flux; energy balance; evaporation; grass; groundwater; growing season; herbicide; invasive species; latent heat flux; micrometeorology; numerical model; regrowth; restoration ecology; sensible heat flux; transpiration; water budget; water use; wetland; Nebraska; United States; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973333155

As a result, highly transient water pressures occur in pressure tunnels and shafts more frequently. Non-intrusive monitoring techniques are therefore of special interest for these critical infrastructures. The propagation of a pressure wave generated actively by a cavitation bubble was experimentally investigated in a steel test pipe divided in several reaches. A local wall stiffness drop was simulated by replacing steel pipe reaches with less stiff materials as aluminum and PVC. Through the analysis of the pressure wave reflections due to the cavitation bubble explosion, recorded by two hydrophones placed at the extremities of the test pipe, the location of the weak reaches could be detected. An underwater spark generator was developed to produce cavitation bubbles in the pipe resulting in very steep shock waves. This allowed identifying very precisely the wave front and correspondingly the wave speed and the weak reach location. Compared to the wave analysis from water-hammer signals, the active cavitation bubble generation in the pipe is an innovative method that significantly increased the effectiveness of the detection of wall stiffness drops. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cavitation bubble; Monitoring; Shock wave; Steel-lined pressure tunnels and shafts; Wave reflections; Wave speed","Drops; Monitoring; Polyvinyl chlorides; Shock waves; Signal detection; Stiffness; Wavefronts; Cavitation bubble; Increasing production; Non-intrusive monitoring; Pressure tunnels and shafts; Pressure wave reflections; Steel-lined pressure tunnels; Wave reflections; Wave speed; Cavitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971287304

Three dimensional high energy spex collider was selected for this mechanochemical reaction. Calcium borohydride is one of the most valuable metal borohydrides. In order to produce calcium borohydride economically, anhydrous colemanite mineral has been used as reactant. Calcium borohydride has been directly manufactured from anhydrous colemanite in spex-type ball milling without the need for any intermediate product. Thus, the advantages of this method over wet chemical procedure (such as having no intermediate product, no azeotropic limitations and no need of regaining product from solution after production by using evaporation, crystallization and drying processes) have made it possible to achieve the desired economical gains. Parametric experiments were conducted to determine the best conditions for the highest yield of solid phase reaction in the spex-type ball milling. Best results have been determined by using areas of related peaks in spectra of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). In order to use peaks area for determining Ca(BH4)2 concentration, a calibration graph of FT-IR absorbance peak areas has been created by using samples with known different concentrations of commercial Ca(BH4)2. Optimum amounts of calcium hydride and synthesis reaction time were found to be 2.1 times the stoichiometric ratio and 2500 min, respectively. As a result of these optimizations, the maximum yield of the solid phase reaction carried out by the spex-type ball milling has been determined as 93%. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","ball milling; Calcium borohydride; hydrogen storage; mechanochemical reaction; synthetic colemanite","Borate minerals; Calcium; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen storage; Milling (machining); Synthesis (chemical); Calcium borohydride; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Intermediate product; Mechanochemical reactions; Solid phase reaction; Stoichiometric ratio; synthetic colemanite; Wet-chemical procedure; Ball milling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966632819

Little is known about the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on pulmonary function in subjects with LOPD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of an 8-week IMT program on pulmonary function tests, quality of life, and sleep quality in eight patients with LOPD who were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Methods: Before and after the IMT program, spirometric measurements in sitting and supine positions, and measurements of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures, peak cough flow, quality of life (assessed using the Nottingham Health Profile), and sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index) were performed. Results: A significant increase in maximum inspiratory pressure (cmH2O and % predicted) (median [interquartile range]: 30.0 cmH2O [21.5–48] versus 39 cmH2O [31.2–56.5] and 38.3 % [28.1–48.4] versus 50.5 % [37.7–54.9]) was observed after training (p = 0.01). There were no significant changes in the other pulmonary function measurements. With the exception of the social isolation subscore (p = 0.02), quality of life subscores did not change after IMT (p &gt; 0.05). Sleep quality subscores and total scores were similar before and after IMT. Conclusion: These results suggest that IMT has a positive effect on maximum inspiratory pressure in subjects with LOPD who are under ERT. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Diaphragm weakness; Inspiratory muscle training; Pompe diseases; Pulmonary functions; Quality of life; Sleep quality","adult; Article; breathing muscle; clinical article; emotion; energy; enzyme replacement; female; forced vital capacity; glycogen storage disease type 2; human; late onset Pompe disease; lung function test; male; muscle training; Nottingham Health Profile; pain; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; quality of life; sitting; sleep quality; social isolation; spirometry; supine position; breathing exercise; coughing; glycogen storage disease type 2; inhalation; late onset disorder; maximal respiratory pressure; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; sleep; young adult; Adult; Breathing Exercises; Cough; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Humans; Inhalation; Late Onset Disorders; Male; Maximal Respiratory Pressures; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Sleep; Spirometry; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964252219

This paper presents some idea of creating energy efficient building envelopes. The focus is on reduction of heat transfer through it. Different structures of external walls are analyzed. In high latitude countries walls should be characterized by high thermal resistance and high thermal capacity (good storage ability). In the paper traditional multilayer wall structures with specific paints on external wall surfaces are analyzed. Paints are characterized by different solar absorptivity. Two extreme cases of solar absorptivity of external wall paints (0.9 for the black paint and 0.1 for the black paint) have been taken into account to give completely different ability of the external wall surface for photo-thermal conversion (of solar radiation). Results show that in moderate or cold climates, if thick thermal insulation is applied as external layer of a building envelope, then the effect of solar absorptivity of a cover paint of external wall surface is not meaningful. In July, when daily solar irradiation is the highest, in the case of the black paint all day long there are small heat gains (about 2 kJ m-2 in average) with maximum in the night (3.1 kJ m-2). In the case of the white paint all day long there are small heat losses (about 2.3 kJ m-2 in average), with maximum in the middle of a day (2.7 kJ m-2). The effect of the solar absorptivity of the paint, that covers the external surface of the wall, can be seen, but it is very small and perhaps cannot be noticed by inhabitants. However, in the extreme summer weather conditions, i.e. very high irradiance level and high ambient air temperature, what have happened quite often in high latitude countries recently, the considered effect is more strong. Therefore, it would be good to apply envelope of a building, that can change ""the skin"" from summer to winter. Also modern structures with the Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are analyzed. In simulation study it was assumed that PCMs are applied in the form of light thermal mass panels that are integrated with the external wall structure. A mathematical model of dynamics of a building has been developed. In the paper stress has been put on energy transfer through walls of different structures. The model takes into account the influence of solar radiation on energy balance, including the availability of solar radiation on walls of different location (inclination and orientation). On the basis of the model developed simulation studies have been performed. Selected results of thermal behavior of some multilayer structures of external walls of a building have been analyzed. Through comparative studies some recommendations for creating building wall structures have been formulated. Results (presented in figures) show, how the temperature of a wall surface can increase because of the high solar radiation absorptivity of the surface paint. The temperature is especially high when a thick insulation is used. Because of the insulation the heat transfer through the wall is reduced significantly. If there is no insulation than the heat gained can be conducted (relatively easily) through the wall to the interior of a building, in consequence there are high heat gains in summer, and the temperature of the external wall surface is not high. It is evident that external surface temperature is not the basic parameter that determines the real heat transfer through a wall. Results show that in high latitude countries a wall structure for a standard building (used all year around) must contain thermal insulation as external layer. This is also true when the PCMs are applied in the form of light thermal mass panels. For high latitude countries the recommended structure of an external wall is following: thermal insulation (e.g. mineral wool) at outside (external layer) of thickness of 25 cm and PCM thermal mass panel at inside (internal layer) of thickness of 1 cm. Such wall structure assures full reduction of the ambient surrounding influence. An external wall made of a brick and a PCM panel does not have high enough thermal resistance (even if thermal capacity is high) to keep the room temperature at the required level. However, such structure could be recommended for the summer season, e.g. for summer houses in a moderate climate or high latitude countries, or for warm climate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorptivity of envelope surface; Building envelope; Energy balance of a building; Energy efficiency; PCMs - Phase Change Materials; Solar energy","Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Energy balance; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Heat transfer; Heating; Historic preservation; Insulation; Mineral wool; Multilayers; Paint; Phase change materials; Solar buildings; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Thermal insulation; Ambient air temperature; Building envelopes; Daily solar irradiations; Energy efficient building; Envelope surface; Photo-thermal conversions; Solar radiation absorptivity; Thick thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); absorption; building; energy conservation; energy efficiency; heat transfer; phase transition; solar power; solar radiation; surface temperature; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963946911

The most vulnerable of these circuits are memory arrays that cover large areas of the silicon die and often store critical data. Radiation hardening of embedded memory blocks is commonly achieved by implementing extremely large bitcells or redundant arrays and maintaining a relatively high operating voltage; however, in addition to the resulting area overhead, this often limits the minimum operating voltage of the entire system leading to significant power consumption. In this paper, we propose the first radiation-hardened static random access memory (SRAM) bitcell targeted at low-voltage functionality, while maintaining high soft-error robustness. The proposed 13T employs a novel dual-driven separated-feedback mechanism to tolerate upsets with charge deposits as high as 500 fC at a scaled 500-mV supply voltage. A 32 × 32 bit memory macro was designed and fabricated in a standard 0.18-μm CMOS process, showing full read and write functionality down to the subthreshold voltage of 300 mV. This is achieved with a cell layout that is only 2× larger than a reference 6T SRAM cell drawn with standard design rules. © 2016 IEEE.","Critical charge; low voltage; radiation effects; radiation hardening; single-event upset (SEU); soft errors; space applications; static random access memory (SRAM); subthreshold; ultralow power (ULP)","Energy gap; Error correction; Hardening; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Random errors; Space applications; Critical charge; Low voltages; Single event upsets; Soft error; Static random access memory; Subthreshold; Ultra-low power; Static random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958597723

The new video coding standard high efficiency video coding (HEVC) has a significant superiority over its predecessor advanced video coding (AVC). HEVC is reported to halve the bit rate with the same visual quality, or a better quality with the same bit rate when compared with AVC. Beside other improvements, HEVC significantly gets its power from the use of dynamic hierarchical quad-tree structure by partitioning the frames into smaller regions called coding units (CU), by means of a rate–distortion optimization process. However, this improvement yields to a dramatic increase of high computational complexity and increased encoding time, which primarily restricts its adaptation in real-time applications.

The pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), available chlorine concentration (ACC) and rheological parameters were measured. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis were carried out. The results have shown that pH, ORP, EC and ACC values are changed upon applying DC and the magnitude of change depends on the concentration of the polymer and the addition of sodium chloride. After seven days of storage, the ACC of the samples exposed to DC decreased by 88%-96%. The FT-IR spectra demonstrated that the structure of gelatine, carrageenan and sodium alginate are not significantly affected by DC. Furthermore, the use of DC did not affect the flow and gelation temperature of the hydrosols. These results suggest that the use of DC did not cause undesirable changes in hydrosols layer and these innovative materials can be used, e.g., for food preservation. © 2016 by the authors.","Carrageenan; Direct current; FTIR; Gelatine; Hydrosol; Rheology; SEM; Sodium alginate; Storage","Alginate; Energy storage; Food preservation; Gelation; pH effects; Redox reactions; Rheology; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium; Sodium alginate; Sodium chloride; Carrageenans; Direct current; FTIR; Gelatine; Hydrosol; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983604731

Nevertheless, not all railway networks are electrified, which is due to high maintenance and setup cost of overhead lines. One solution to the problem is battery-driven trains, which can make the best use of the electric traction system while avoiding the high costs of the catenary system. Due to the high power consumption of electric trains, energy management of battery trains are crucial in order to get the best use of batteries. This paper suggests a general algorithm for speed profile optimization of an electric train with an on-board energy storage device, during catenary-free operation on a given line section. The approach is based on discrete dynamic programming, where the train model and the objective function are based on equations of motion rather than electrical equations. This makes the model compatible with all sorts of energy storage devices. Unlike previous approaches which consider trains with throttle levels for tractive effort, the new approach considers trains in which there are no throttles and tractive effort is controlled with a controller (smooth gliding handle with no discrete levels). Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, the control variable is the velocity change instead of the applied tractive effort. The accuracy and performance of the discretized approach is evaluated in comparison to the formal movement equations in a simulated experimented using train data from the Bombardier Electrostar series and track data from the UK. © 2016 IEEE.","Electric Trains; Speed Profile Optimization; Storage Device","Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Electric traction; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Equations of motion; Overhead lines; Power electronics; Railroads; Catenary free operation; Electric traction system; Electric trains; Electrical equations; High power consumption; Objective functions; On-board energy storage; Speed profile; Electric lines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994182006

Daily activities such as cooking, cleaning, working on the computer and commuting to work are more or less dependent on energy. The world's energy demand is continuously increasing over the years due to the ever-increasing growth in the human population as well as economic development. At present, approximately 90% of energy demands are fulfilled by fossil fuels. With the rising demands of energy throughout the globe, it can be expected that the availability of fossil fuels is depleting at an alarming rate since fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. In addition, fossil fuels are the main contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore, they have a detrimental impact on human health and environment in the long term. Hence, there is a critical need to develop alternative sources of energy in replacement of fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuels have gained much interest among researchers all over the world since they are clean, non-toxic and renewable, making them suitable for use as substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels in vehicular applications. However, the greatest challenge in using hydrogen fuels lies in the development of hydrogen storage systems, especially for on-board applications. Hydrogen fuels can be stored in gaseous, liquid or solid states, and much effort has been made to develop hydrogen storage systems that are safe, cost-effective, environmental-friendly and more importantly, with high energy densities. Current technologies used for hydrogen storage include high-pressure compression at about 70 MPa, liquefaction at cryogenic temperatures (20 K) and absorption into solid state compounds. Among the three types of hydrogen storage technologies, the storage of hydrogen in solid state compounds appears to be the most feasible solution since it is a safer and more convenient method compared to high-pressure compression and liquefaction technologies. In this regard, metal hydrides are potential chemical compounds for solid-state hydrogen storage, and a large number of studies have been carried out to synthesize low-cost metal hydrides with low absorption/desorption temperatures, high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage densities, good resistance to oxidation, good reversibility and cyclic ability, fast kinetics and reactivity, and moderate thermodynamic stability. In general, these studies have shown that the absorption/desorption properties of hydrogen can be improved by: (1) the addition of catalysts into the metal hydrides, (2) alloying the metal hydrides, or (3) nanostructuring. This review article is focused on the latest developments of metal hydrides for solid-state hydrogen storage applications, which will be of interest to scientists, researchers, and practitioners in this field. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Chemical hydrides; Complex hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallic compounds; Metal hydrides; Mg-based hydrides",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027918068

This is achieved by inverting the voltage potential across the piezoelectric element and thereby maintaining a higher voltage while extracting energy. The increased potential allows vibration harvesters to operate over a broader frequency range. For weakly coupled piezoelectric harvesters, the increased potential allows the electrical power output to be increased. In this paper, the circuit is simulated in SPICE using existing models of discrete components in conjunction with a model of a piezoelectric vibration harvester. The power output and mechanical behavior of the harvester using the presented circuit are compared to two existing technologies: Synchronous Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) and a full-wave rectifying bridge. The comparison demonstrates that the novel Interleaved Switch Harvesting on Inductor (ISHI) circuit outperforms state-of-the-art active harvesting solutions, e.g., SSHI, as a result of the decreased energy losses from diodes. In addition, the ISHI circuit requires fewer components than does the SSHI circuit and solves the floating transistor source issue that arises in SSHI implementations. To achieve the maximum power conversion efficiency, impedance matching is required, which can be achieved by controlling the voltage of the storage device. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric inductors; Energy dissipation; Harvesters; Harvesting; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectricity; Reconfigurable hardware; Virtual storage; Discrete components; Electrical power output; Mechanical behavior; Piezoelectric elements; Piezoelectric harvester; Piezoelectric vibration; Synchronous switches; Transfer efficiency; SPICE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980383531

So, the development and implementation of Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) improves the efficiency, reliability and security of the electric power system. This paper presents the development of an IED, based on TivaC platform for Smart Grid applications, with high capacity processing, communication features, portability/versatility, low cost, easy integration (interoperability) and maintenance. For the communication the proposed IED uses the Hybrid Network Architecture (HNA) concept and open source programming. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Electric load flow; Electric power measurement; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic equipment; Network architecture; Open source software; Power quality; Smart power grids; Thermoelectric equipment; Communication and control; Communications technology; Distributed generation and storage; Intelligent electronic device; Open-source programming; Reliability and safeties; Renewable and alternative energies; Smart grid applications; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980373854

Here, using quantum mechanical calculations, we carry out a systematic screening of crucial optical (solar spectrum match) and thermal (storage energy density) properties of 64 such compounds based on the norbornadiene-quadricyclane system. Whereas a substantial number of these molecules reach the theoretical maximum solar power conversion efficiency, this requires a strong red-shift of the absorption spectrum, which causes undesirable absorption by the photoisomer as well as reduced thermal stability. These compounds typically also have a large molecular mass, leading to low storage densities. By contrast, single-substituted systems achieve a good compromise between efficiency and storage density, while avoiding competing absorption by the photo-isomer. This establishes guiding principles for the future development of molecular solar thermal storage systems. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we report 3-D fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) tubular arrays fabricated by a cost-effective ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) channels with high uniformity. The large surface area of such a structure leads to remarkable surface area enhancement up to 51.8 times compared to a planar structure. Combining with electrochemically deposited manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoflakes on the inner side wall of the FTO nanotubes, the unique hierarchical tubular structured pseudocapacitor electrode demonstrated the highest areal capacitance of 193.8 mF cm-2 at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 184 mF cm-2 at the discharge current density of 0.6 mA cm-2, which is 18.5 times that of a planar electrode. And it also showed a volumetric capacitance of 112.6 F cm-3 at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 108.8 F cm-3 at the discharge current density of 0.6 mA cm-2. In addition, the cyclic stability test also indicated that a nanostructured pseudocapacitive electrode has a much larger capacitance retention after 3000 cycles of the charge-discharge process compared with a planar electrode, primarily due to the mechanical stability of the nanostructure. Moreover, pseudocapacitor device fabrication based on such electrodes shows the volumetric capacitance of 17.5 F cm-3, and the highest specific energy of 1.56 × 10-3 Wh cm-3.

In order to reduce the energy cost, achieving energy efficiency with renewable fuel has no alternative. However, when the industry operates under variable electricity pricing, only energy efficiency cannot help cost saving. An energy management strategy for energy usage is also required. Waste-to-energy (WtE) can be an attractive solution for renewable energy source. Current research on small scale WtE paves the way of using WtE for energy efficiency into industries. The objective of this work is to propose a strategy to reduce the electricity bill for the industry under variable electricity pricing. In order to reduce the electricity bill, a fuzzy Inference System (FIS) based energy management strategy to produce electricity in low pricing period and utilize it in peak period is proposed by integrating small scale WtE and storage into industry system. Though this model is built for energy management, it indirectly works as a tool for waste management as well. The performance of the proposed model is tested with the data collected from a plastic container manufacturing industry. The cost analysis is shown to justify the higher establishment cost of WtE. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management; Energy storage; Variable electricity pricing; Waste-to-energy (WtE)","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuzzy inference; Plastic containers; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Storage management; Waste management; Attractive solutions; Container manufacturing; Electricity pricing; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Fuzzy inference systems; Renewable energy source; Waste to energy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992304043

A general structure of such a network has been presented with distinction of three segments: local (based on ZigBee, Ethernet and ModBus techniques), core (base on cellular technologies) and the storage/application. The implementation of these techniques requires knowledge of their technical limitations and electromagnetic compatibility issues. The former refer to ZigBee performance degradation in multi-hop transmission, whereas the latter are associated with the common electromagnetic spectrum sharing with other existing technologies or with undesired radiated emissions generated by the radio modules of the sensor network. In many cases, it is also necessary to provide a measurement station with autonomous energy source, such as solar. As stems from measurements of the energetic efficiency of these sources, one should apply them with care and perform detailed power budget since their real performance may turn out to be far from expected. This, in turn, may negatively affect—in particular—the operation of chemical sensors implemented in the network as they often require additional heating. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Cellular; Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC); Power supply; Wireless; ZigBee","Budget control; Digital storage; Electromagnetic compatibility; Radio; Radio transmission; Sensor networks; Zigbee; Cellular; Cellular technologies; Electromagnetic spectra; Multihop transmission; Performance degradation; Power supply; Technical limitations; Wide area sensor networks; Wide area networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978653472

The material is characterized by X-ray and electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, gas adsorption studies, scanning and transmission electron microscopies for their crystal structure, surface and morphological properties. These studies show that colloidal synthesized Mo9Se11 has a hierarchical structure in the form of nanoneedles grown on its nanosheet. The nanoneedles are single crystalline with circular cross-section of diameter ∼10-20 nm at the root, ∼6-10 nm at the tip and length ∼5-10 μm. Electrochemical properties of the material are studied in detail in three moderately conductive alkaline electrolytes, viz. 3 M of LiOH, NaOH, and KOH employing cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Mo9Se11 electrodes showed superior specific capacitance (CS ∼510 F g-1) and larger voltage window (up to 0.7 V) in the LiOH electrolyte. We show that the excellent electrochemical properties of Mo9Se11 can be assigned to the hierarchical microstructure and its one-dimensional channel structure; those accommodate and facilitate fast redox reactions for electrons and ions.

A model predictive controller acts as a supervisory controller and provides set-points for a low level proportional integral controller. The low level controller applies its input to a higher order wind turbine model in real-time. As a result, the proposed control scheme substantially mitigates power gradients, while keeping energy losses and increased turbine loading to a minimum. For a battery power of 20% the rated wind turbine power, we showed that the maximum power gradient is reduced by 78.5% and the standard deviation by 88.7% compared with a conventional, gain-scheduled PI controller. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy storage; optimal control; predictive control; wind energy integration","Electric batteries; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Level control; Power control; Predictive control systems; Two term control systems; Wind power; Wind turbines; Low-level controllers; Model predictive controllers; Optimal controls; Predictive control; Proportional integral controllers; Supervisory controllers; Wind energy integration; Wind turbine modeling; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982845574

However, there is profound skepticism about the stability of power systems with high renewable penetration, especially due to their intermittent and non-dispatchable nature. One solution to this problem is the application of energy storage. Energy storage devices such as grid-connected batteries could work in tandem with renewable sources such as PV and Wind or in stand-alone mode to support the power system in the case frequency or voltage deviations exceed the desired limits. This paper presents the impact of grid-connected battery storage (through Electric Vehicles or fixed batteries) on the frequency stability improvement of island power systems with large amount of renewables infeed; the island of Bonaire is taken as a reference case. The results indicate a positive outcome from storage integration, with improved voltage and frequency response.

The modeled neighborhood consists of modern, well-insulated terraced houses in a typical Dutch climate, each equipped with roof-mounted photovoltaic (PV) panels. The panels are sized to cover the daily electric demand during sunnier parts of the year where the heat demand is low. The system also includes a centrally placed combined heat and power (CHP) with hot water and electric storage, and controllable devices within the houses such as washing and dishwashing machines. The daily domestic hot water demand is supplied entirely by the central CHP.

One renewable energy source that has undergone significant growth is photovoltaics (PV), and much of this has happened in low voltage networks. It has become popular as a result of different support schemes and a desire among customers to reduce their costs and reduce their environmental footprint. However some of the drawbacks of PV are that it cannot reduce the load of customers at night and it can cause the network voltage to rise to unacceptable levels during the day. This paper will show that collaborative use of storage designed for homes can provide benefits to customers by increasing their ability to use their PV energy (self-consumption) and to network operators by regulating the voltage. © 2016 IEEE.","Control; Distribution; Optimization; Storage; Voltage","Control; Electric potential; Energy storage; Multiobjective optimization; Natural resources; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Sales; Distribution; Environmental footprints; Low voltage network; Network operator; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; PV energy; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982795838

Varying shares of PV penetration and different PV distributions are simulated on a representative irradiance profile. Batteries are optimally dispatched on the basis of load and solar irradiance forecasts using a Model Predictive Control method. Our proposed centralized control scheme determines optimal active and reactive power trajectories that minimize total operation costs and comply with the grid and storage constraints. The simulation results show, that curtailment and storages can represent a viable alternative to grid expansions, when the PV penetration is moderate.

It is based on orthogonal power flow at different frequencies. The power exchange between different elements of the grid as well as the additional features are based on implementing power electronics (PE) interfaces and applying multiple frequencies (zero- DC is also a valid frequency). Thus, the micro-grids are decoupled into multiple systems which can then be controlled independently, paving the way for a more flexible and stable general system. By implementing multiple frequencies (MF) additional features can be achieved that would otherwise not be possible with conventional AC, newly- emerging DC systems or any of their hybrid forms.

In amorphous electrode materials, a detailed knowledge of Li-ion intercalation is hampered by limited information about the structure and transport properties of the materials. Amorphous tungsten oxide is the most studied electrochromic material and suffers from ion trapping-induced degradation of charge capacity and optical modulation span upon extensive electrochemical cycling. In this paper, we investigate trapping and detrapping processes in connection with performance degradation and specifically use real-time electro-optical monitoring to identify different trap energy ranges pertinent to the ion-intercalated system. Evidence of three kinds of traps that degrade electrochromic tungsten oxide during ion intercalation is presented: (i) shallow traps that Erode the colored state, (ii) deep traps that lower the bleached-state transmittance, and (iii) irreversible traps. Importantly, Li-ion detrapping from shallow and deep traps takes place by different processes: continuous Li-ion extraction is possible from shallow traps, whereas a certain release time must be exceeded for detrapping from deep traps. Our notions for ion trapping and detrapping, presented here, may serve as a starting point for discussing ion intercalation in various amorphous materials of interest for energy-related applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Amorphous films; Electrochromism; Electrodes; Energy conservation; Ion exchange; Ions; Lithium; Oxide films; Oxides; Tungsten; Tungsten compounds; Amorphous electrodes; Electrochemical cycling; Electrochromic materials; Induced degradation; Irreversible traps; Limited information; Performance degradation; Tungsten oxide thin films; Amorphous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978370332

It causes multiple systemic complications, some of which result in severe impairment of organs and tissues. These complications involve mechanical changes caused by the accumulation of adipose tissue and the numerous cytokines produced by adipocytes. Obesity also significantly interferes with respiratory function by decreasing lung volume, particularly the expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity. Because of the ineffectiveness of the respiratory muscles, strength and resistance may be reduced. All these factors lead to inspiratory overload, which increases respiratory effort, oxygen consumption, and respiratory energy expenditure. It is noteworthy that patterns of body fat distribution significantly influence the function of the respiratory system, likely via the direct mechanical effect of fat accumulation in the chest and abdominal regions. Weight loss caused by various types of treatment, including low-calorie diet, intragastric balloon, and bariatric surgery, significantly improves lung function and metabolic syndrome and reduces body mass index. Despite advances in the knowledge of pulmonary and systemic complications associated with obesity, longitudinal randomized studies are needed to assess the impact of weight loss on metabolic syndrome and lung function. © 2016 Mafort et al.","Lung function; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","adiponectin; apelin; C reactive protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; leptin; lipid; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; oxygen; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; resistin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; abdomen; adipocyte; adipose tissue; asthma; bariatric surgery; biochemistry; body fat distribution; body mass; breathing mechanics; breathing muscle; cerebrovascular accident; cholelithiasis; chronic obstructive lung disease; cytokine production; disease association; disease severity; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; energy expenditure; erectile dysfunction; expiratory reserve volume; fatty liver; female infertility; functional residual capacity; gastric balloon; gastroesophageal reflux; heart failure; human; hypertension; inspiratory capacity; insulin resistance; ischemic heart disease; lipid storage; low calory diet; lung disease; lung function; lung volume; malignant neoplastic disease; metabolic syndrome X; muscle weakness; obesity; osteoarthritis; ovary polycystic disease; oxygen consumption; respiratory function; Review; systemic disease; thorax; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978176207

Kinetically stable, it constitutes an excellent candidate for efficient storage of large amounts of energy. We employ ab initio and semiempirical quantum-chemical methods to investigate systematically the amounts of energy that can be stored in cubane and its two derivatives known synthetically, octanitrocubane (8-CUB) and heptanitrocubane (7-CUB). Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics, we establish the energy liberation pathways and molecular decomposition mechanisms. The reaction starts with spontaneous isomerizations of nitrocubanes into nitroannulenes and nitrosooxycubanes, subsequently producing NO and octaone C8O8. Unstable C8O8 decomposes within a picosecond, producing 8 CO molecules. All reactions are exothermic, giving rise to a sharp temperature increase. Ultimately, CO and NO recombine into CO2 and N2. According to the thermochemical calculations, 8-CUB stores 4145 kJmol-1 of free energy, while 7-CUB stores 4346 kJmol-1. The reported results foster consideration of cubanes for energy storage. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Computational chemistry; Energy storage; Free energy; Quantum chemistry; Reaction kinetics; Large amounts; Molecular decomposition; Nitrocubanes; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Quantum-chemical methods; Semi-empirical; Temperature increase; Thermochemical calculations; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025158929

This study deals with a preparation of a new type of powdered phase change composite material for thermal energy storage. The idea of a composite is based upon the impregnation of a natural silicate material by a reasonably priced commercially produced pure phase change material and forming the homogenous composite powdered structure. For the preparation of the composite, vacuum impregnation method is used. The particle size distribution accessed by the laser diffraction apparatus proves that incorporation of the organic phase change material into the structure of inorganic siliceous pozzolana does not lead to the clustering of the particles. The compatibility of the prepared composite is characterized by the Fourier transformation infrared analysis (FTIR). Performed DSC analysis shows potential of the developed composite for thermal energy storage that can be easily incorporated into the cement-based matrix of building materials. Based on the obtained results, application of the developed phase change composite can be considered with a great promise. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984578324

This paper reports that the capacitance of hexagonal-phase tungsten oxide (h-WO3)-based supercapacitors increases by ≈17% under solar light. Thorough analyses of the wavelength dependence of the enhancement, capacitive mechanism, energy storage dynamics, and impedance reveal that: i) photoexcited electrons are responsible for the enhancement; ii) the insertion of protons into the large hexagonal tunnels of h-WO3, instead of a surface capacitive process, is greatly facilitated by the photoexcited electrons; iii) the theoretical light-induced capacitance enhancement can reach up to 38% for a h-WO3-based supercapacitor. Moreover, as an application of this finding, a self-powered photodetector based on a h-WO3 supercapacitor is fabricated, wherein the photoexcited electrons serve as the signal for detecting solar light. The device works without an external power source and can be considered as an ultimately integrated power source–sensor system. This work sheds light on the interaction between solar light and a semiconductor-based supercapacitor as well as the concrete mechanisms behind the phenomenon. These efforts also open the door to the design of highly integrated, brand-new power source–sensor systems. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This race for performance is often focused on the search for new materials, whereas less effort has been dedicated to the electrode engineering. Enhancing the power density by increasing the amount of active material remains impractical since it impinges the transport of ions across the electrode during the charging and discharging processes. Here, we show that the electrochemical performance of a battery containing a thick (about 200 μm), highly loaded (about 10 mg cm '2) graphite electrode can be remarkably enhanced by fabricating anodes with an out-of-plane aligned architecture using a low external magnetic field. The lower tortuosity resulting from such a simple and scalable magnetic alignment approach leads to a specific charge up to three times higher than that of non-architectured electrodes at a rate of 1C. © Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The control strategy is layered in a two-stage procedure: day-ahead and intra-day operation. During day-ahead operation, the load leveled power consumption profile is determined by applying a scenario-based robust optimization using historical measurements of the aggregated feeder power consumption. In the intra-day phase, the operation of the group of prosumers is dispatched according to the profile defined during the day-ahead stage, which becomes the so-called dispatch plan. The dispatch plan is tracked in real-time by properly adjusting the injections of the BESS using model predictive control (MPC).

In addition, storage and demand response solutions have reached the market, which provides flexibility and thereby facilitates intelligent energy management. It has been suggested that this bottom-up flexibility should contribute to the balancing of the future smart grid, but financial incentives have so far been elusive. This article presents computations that assess the profitability of intelligent energy management for three different value propositions: increasing self-sufficiency under typical retail tariffs, or participating in ahead or balancing market price fluctuations, specifically in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. First, an upper bound valuation of flexibility is computed from 2013 market data. Second, a technology-neutral profit analysis is proposed and demonstrated on selected technologies. Our simulations indicate the highest value for flexibility in the Dutch and German imbalance markets (7.7 & 9.4 €c/kWh) and the Dutch reserve market (10.4 €c/kWh), and for small prosumers in the German and Italian retail markets (12 & 10 €c/kWh).

Clearly, the concept is the same whether it is multiple processors on a board or a chip multiprocessor with several cores on a chip. With the advent of HMPs, thread scheduling becomes much more challenging, while having to deal with thread to processor-Type mapping. In particular, it is important that the operating system is able to understand the workload behavior when a thread is to be migrated to a core of a different type. In this paper, we describe a thread characterization method that explores machine learning techniques to automate and improve the accuracy of predicting thread execution across different processor types. We use hardware performance counters and use machine learning to predict performance when moving a thread to another core type on heterogeneous processors. We show that our characterization scheme achieves higher structural similarity (SSIM) values when predicting performance indicators, such as instructions per cycle and last-level cache misses, commonly used to determine the mapping of threads to processor types at runtime. We also show that support vector regression achieves higher SSIM values when compared to linear regression, and has very low (1%) overhead. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Green computing; Mapping; Multiprocessing systems; Systems engineering; Characterization methods; Hardware performance counters; Heterogeneous multiprocessors; Heterogeneous processors; Instructions per cycles; Machine learning techniques; Performance indicators; Support vector regression (SVR); Machine learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016110161

We use the simulated annealing algorithm to minimize this probability under the variation of storage locations and capacities in the network, keeping the total storage capacity constant. In order to estimate the small probabilities of line current violations we use the splitting technique of rare-event simulation. We construct an appropriate importance function for splitting which enhances the efficiency of the probability estimator compared to the conventional Crude Monte Carlo estimator.

Samples of Pectoralis major muscle at 7 min, 4 h and 24 h postmortem were analyzed for pH, shear force, color, drip and cooking losses. Proteome profile of the 7 min samples was examined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Birds subjected to Halal slaughter had higher (P < 0.05) redness than those gas stunned at 4 and 24 h postmortem. Gas-stunned birds had lower (P < 0.05) muscle pH and shear force and higher (P < 0.05) drip and cooking losses compared with those subjected to Halal slaughter throughout postmortem storage. Gas stunning up-regulated (P < 0.05) the expression of beta-enolase, pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase compared with Halal slaughter.

The avian crop (ingluvies) present in most omnivorous and herbivorous bird species, plays a major role in feed storage and moistening, as well as functional barrier for pathogens through decreasing pH value by microbial fermentation. Moreover, recent data suggest that this gastrointestinal tract segment may play an important role in the regulation of the innate immune system of birds. In some avian species ingluvies secretes ""crop milk"" which provides high nutrients and energy content for nestlings growth. The crop has a crucial role in enhancing exogenous enzymes efficiency (for instance phytase and microbial amylase, β-glucanase), as well as the activity of bacteriocins. Thus, ingluvies may have a significant impact on bird performance and health status during all stages of rearing. Efficient use of the crop in case of digesta retention time is essential for birds' growth performance. Thus, a functionality of the crop is dependent on a number of factors, including age, dietary factors, infections as well as flock management. It is important to expand knowledge about the crop functions to use them effectively in poultry production.

Biodiesel is a non-polluting energy source that has the potential to promote prosperity by creating jobs in poor regions of Brazil. However, the infrastructure, logistics, and proper facilities are lacking. A variety of approaches to optimizing the biodiesel supply chain have been proposed. The goal is to minimize the grain storage and transportation costs. This paper presents a comparison between a two-stage model and a multistage (three-stage) stochastic model to optimize the biodiesel supply chain. The comparison between these formulations shows that the flexibility gain provided by the multistage model results in a lower total logistic cost. The optimum for the three-stage model was 7,700,019 (BRL), compared to 8,628,002 (BRL) for the two-stage model, representing a savings of 927,983 (BRL). We highlight that this model offers a real solution for castor supply chain design (considering uncertainty) in the Brazilian semiarid region, which is a poorer region of the country, thus making cost reduction mandatory.","Biodiesel; Integer Linear programming; Multistage program; Stochastic optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026450918

In this study, we investigate an evacuation model to avoid VMs from the effects of cyber attack by migrating them to quarantine and inspection centers. Our approach minimizes the size of the damage due to cyber attack by rapidly migrating VMs under the risk of malware infection to other locations by taking the warnings provided by intrusion detection mechanisms into consideration.

Under resting conditions, NKA in skeletal muscle operates at only a fraction of maximal pumping capacity, but it can be markedly activated when demands for ion transport increase, such as during exercise or following food intake. Given the size, capacity, and dynamic range of the NKA pool in skeletal muscle, its tight regulation is essential to maintain whole body homeostasis as well as muscle function. To reconcile functional needs of systemic homeostasis with those of skeletal muscle, NKA is regulated in a coordinated manner by extrinsic stimuli, such as hormones and nerve-derived factors, as well as by local stimuli arising in skeletal muscle fibers, such as contractions and muscle energy status. These stimuli regulate NKA acutely by controlling its enzymatic activity and/or its distribution between the plasma membrane and the intracellular storage compartment. They also regulate NKA chronically by controlling NKA gene expression, thus determining total NKA content in skeletal muscle and its maximal pumping capacity. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms that underlie regulation of NKA in skeletal muscle by major extrinsic and local stimuli. Special emphasis is given to stimuli and mechanisms linking regulation of NKA and energy metabolism in skeletal muscle, such as insulin and the energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase. Finally, the recently uncovered roles for glutathionylation, nitric oxide, and extracellular K + in the regulation of NKA in skeletal muscle are highlighted. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Intracellular signaling; K-ATPase; Na; Ouabain; Phospholemman; Skeletal muscle","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); hormone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; nitric oxide; potassium ion; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); aldosterone; amylin; C peptide; epinephrine; hormone; hydrocortisone; insulin; liothyronine; noradrenalin; thyroxine; cell compartmentalization; cell membrane; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; exercise; food intake; gene expression regulation; glutathionylation; homeostasis; human; ion transport; muscle fiber contraction; muscle function; nonhuman; priority journal; protein modification; regulatory mechanism; Review; skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle cell; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; muscle contraction; phosphorylation; protein transport; skeletal muscle; Aldosterone; C-Peptide; Cell Membrane; Energy Metabolism; Epinephrine; Gene Expression Regulation; Hormones; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Insulin; Islet Amyloid Polypeptide; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Muscle, Skeletal; Norepinephrine; Phosphorylation; Protein Transport; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983766471

By utilizing a redox material like ceria (CeO2) as reactive medium, STCs can produce the chemical fuels hydrogen and carbon monoxide from water and carbon dioxide. The produced syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, can be upgraded to hydrocarbon fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch process. Here, we explore a new concept of producing hydrocarbon fuels directly from water and carbon dioxide by incorporating a catalytic process into STCs. To achieve this, a starting material of ceria doped with a catalyst is used as reactive medium. The primary role of the catalyst is to catalyze the formation of hydrocarbon molecules during the reoxidation of ceria by water and carbon dioxide. In this study, nickel-doped ceria and rhodium-doped ceria were investigated for their methane formation activity after being activated by chemical or thermal reduction. Both materials, after being reduced by hydrogen at 600 °C, are active in producing methane during their reoxidation by water and carbon dioxide at 500 °C. After being thermally reduced at extreme temperatures of 1400 °C and 1500 °C, metallic rhodium is formed in rhodium-doped ceria. The activated rhodium-ceria produces methane directly from water and carbon dioxide during reoxidation. The long-term methane formation activity of rhodium-ceria for 59 cycles with thermal reduction is reported. With rhodium-ceria, this study demonstrates for the first time the concept of producing hydrocarbon fuels, i.e. methane, directly from water and carbon dioxide by realistic STCs. In contrast, nickel-doped ceria is not active in producing methane after thermal activation, owing to rapid sintering and loss of nickel at high temperatures. This underlines the importance of evaluating the effect of thermal reduction on the redox material used. The material's physicochemical properties could be rapidly and significantly altered at the extreme temperatures required for the thermal reduction of ceria. Such changes may render a material that is active and stable at low temperatures inactive when used under realistic conditions of STCs. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bond strength (chemical); Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Coal liquefaction; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Methanation; Methane; Molecules; Nickel; Rhodium; Sintering; Solar energy; Extreme temperatures; Fischer-Tropsch process; Hydrocarbon molecules; Physicochemical property; Realistic conditions; Thermal activation; Thermal reduction; Thermochemical cycles; Carbon dioxide; alternative fuel; carbon dioxide; catalyst; cerium; hydrocarbon; physicochemical property; reaction kinetics; redox potential; reduction; renewable resource; rhodium; solar power; storage; thermochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978431638

Specifically, the lifetime performance of the BESS is represented by its average lifetime, i.e., the average operational duration within which its capacity stays above a certain threshold, and the value performance of the BESS is defined as the total average arbitrage value within its entire lifetime. We propose a constrained stochastic shortest path (CSSP) model to characterize the optimal value-lifetime performance pair. By exploiting the hidden structure of this CSSP problem, an efficient parallel algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal policy. We further prove the condition under which the optimal policy is Pareto optimal. This implies that the achievable optimal value-lifetime performance pair is globally optimal as long as the system-wide utility is monotonically increasing in both the value performance and the lifetime performance. We validate our proposed model and algorithm via real battery specifications and electricity market data, and the results show promising insights for both infrastructure planning and operational management of BESSs in practice. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; energy arbitrage; pareto optimal operation; value and lifetime performances","Digital storage; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Financial markets; Optimal systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Battery energy storage systems; Energy arbitrages; Infrastructure planning; Lifetime performance; Model and algorithms; Operational management; Pareto-optimal; Stochastic shortest paths; Pareto principle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976358912

However, PCM/MLC PCM suffers from long write latency and large write energy. Recent work has proposed a compiler directed dual-write (CDDW) scheme to combat the drawbacks of PCM by adopting fast or slow mode for different write operations. For large-scale loops, we observe that write instances' lifetime is very long and can only be written by the expensive slow mode.

Depending on the magnitude of applied electric field strength (13.82-25.26 kV cm-1), energy (10.89-51.32 J), in comparison with heat treatment (90 °C for 10 and 20 s); significant changes in pH, titration acidity, total dry matter, and browning index were found during the storage period. With no significant change in shelf-life period, the PEF processing better preserved orange juice quality than did the heat processing. Ascorbic acid content peaked with PEF-treated orange juice under the electric field strength of 17 kV cm-1, the treatment time of 1034 μs, and the energy of 17.37 J through which no significant degradation occurred during the storage with the longest half-life (1112 days). Although ascorbic acid retention of the most of the PEF processed samples was higher than that of the heat processed ones; samples processed by 10.89, 12.70 and 29.57 J energies resulted in lower ascorbic acid content than did the heat processing (90 °C for 20 s).

The study was conducted in southern Piauí, between January and February (rainy season). Samples were collected containing branches and trunks of various species, and samples of branches and trunks separately in 5 sample units of 20x20m. Samples were evaluated in the general state freshly harvested and samples of branches and logs after 15 and 30 days of storage in piles in the field. The analyzes carried out were: moisture content on wet basis, ash content and calorific value. Moisture content of freshly harvested biomass ranged from 39% with two days after cutting to 79% in biomass cut and left distributed in the field for 10 days. After storage in piles for 15 days, branches showed moisture content of 18% and the logs 21%, and net calorific value of 3432kcal kg-1 and 3274kcal kg-1, respectively. After 30 days, moisture content for branches was 13% and the logs 21%, and net calorific value of 3672kcal kg-1 and 3240kcal kg-1, respectively. Ash content of the biomass was low. Cutting trees in the rainy season, with maintenance of biomass in the field for 10 days, resulted in an increment of moisture content. Branches had the best behaviour during the storage.

However, the synthesis of these materials often involves complicated processes that may lead to low yields and high costs. In this study, this issue is addressed through developing a facile, scalable, and cost-effective synthesis strategy. Nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon foam (HP-CF) is fabricated by annealing of soft-template-casted melamine foam, and its application for supercapacitors is highlighted. The HP-CF integrates a large number of macropores and micropores, thus providing sufficient space for ion transport while offering a large amount of surface sites for energy storage, thanks to which the HP-CF exhibits a high capacitance of 238 F g-1 (or 11.9 F cm-3). In addition, the HP-CF performs greatly when acting as the mechanical support for pseudocapacitive materials such as NiCo2S4 and Fe2O3, based on which an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, can also be described as aqueous battery) is assembled. The ASC exhibits a high energy density of 93.9 Wh kg-1 (or 3.55 mWh cm-3) and a high power density of 21.1 kW kg-1 (or 799 mW cm-3), among the highest reported values for ASCs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Asymmetric supercapacitors; Carbon foam; Hierarchically porous structure; Nickel cobalt sulfides; Nitrogen-doping","Capacitors; Cost effectiveness; Doping (additives); Electrolytic capacitors; Nitrogen; Porous materials; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Carbon foam; Carbonaceous materials; Free-standing electrode; Hierarchically porous; Hierarchically porous carbons; Nitrogen-doping; Pseudo-capacitive materials; Foams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964959907

Intermittency generates spikes in production, which need to be curtailed when exceeding consumption. Dispersion means electricity has to be transported over long distances between production and consumption sites. In the Directive 2009/28/EC, the European Commission recommends sustainable and effective measures to prevent curtailments and facilitate transportation of renewable electricity. This article explores the material constraints of storing and transporting surplus renewable electricity by conversion into synthetic methane. Europe is considered for its mix of energy technologies, data availability and multiple energy pathways to 2050. Results show that the requirements for key materials and land remain relatively low, respecting the recommendations of the EU Commission. By 2050, more than 6 million tons of carbon dioxide might be transformed into methane annually within the EU. The efficiency of renewable power methane production is also compared to the natural process of converting solar into chemical energy (i.e. photosynthesis), both capturing and reenergizing carbon dioxide. Overall, the production of renewable methane (including carbon dioxide capture) is more efficient and less material intensive than the production of biofuels derived from photosynthesis and biomass conversion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide utilization; Material constraints; Methanation; Renewable energy storage","Bioconversion; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide utilization; Energy technologies; European Commission; Growing production; Production and consumption; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy storages; Dispersions; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; electricity supply; energy policy; European Union; renewable resource; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964300297

It is a trigeneration system capable of producing electricity, heat, and hydrogen. It comprises three main zones: a hydrogen production zone, a parking zone, and a pump station zone. This study focuses mainly on the hydrogen production zone which assesses four different system designs in two different operation modes of the facility: Car as Power Plant (CaPP) mode, corresponding to the open period of the facility which uses fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as energy and water producers while parked; and Pump mode, corresponding to the closed period which compresses the hydrogen and pumps to the vehicle's fuel tank. These system designs differ by the reforming technology: the existing catalytic reformer (CR) and a solid oxide fuel cell operating as reformer (SOFCR); and the option of integrating a carbon capture and storage (CCS).Results reveal that the SOFCR unit significantly reduces the exergy destruction resulting in an improvement of efficiency over 20% in SOFCR-based system designs compared to CR-based system designs in both operation modes. It also mitigates the reduction in system efficiency by integration of a CCS unit, achieving a value of 2% whereas, in CR-based systems, is 7-8%.

Much of this increase has been achieved by replacing fossil fuels with different forms of bioenergy in district heating. Increased use of bioenergy is generally seen as key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.However, replacing fossil fuels with solid biomass fuels in stationary heat and power generation entails significantly more complicated fuel supply logistics, with geographically scattered material associated with storage difficulties and low energy density. Given these risks and challenges and the key role of biomass-based district heating in the Swedish energy system, disturbances in fuel supply to district heating could potentially be an energy security issue.Through literature studies and interviews with employees at 18 district heating plants, we mapped present and future risks and risk management strategies in district heating supply in the Mälardalen region, south-east Sweden. We found that although small disturbances to fuel supply are not uncommon, the likelihood of heat supply failures due to fuel supply problems is low. Risk awareness is generally high among fuel supply managers, with widespread use of multilevel redundancies and diversification as key risk management strategies. However, fuel supply to plants is highly dependent on functioning truck transport and, consequently, availability of diesel fuel for trucks. Risk management can be strengthened further by implementation of forward-looking risk assessments that are less reliant on past experiences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy; Climate change adaptation; District heating; Energy security; Logistics; Supply chain risk management","Biomass; Climate change; Diesel fuels; District heating; Employment; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Human resource management; Logistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Space heating; Supply chains; Truck transportation; Trucks; Bio-energy; Bio-energy utilization; Climate change adaptation; District-heating plants; Literature studies; Risk management strategies; Small disturbances; Supply chain risk management; Risk management; adaptive management; bioenergy; biomass power; climate change; diesel; emission control; energy use; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; heating; logistics; risk assessment; security threat; supply chain management; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962163287

The low thermal conductivity of the phase change materials remains a setback and reduces the performance of gaining and releasing of the thermal energy. In this study, 20 nm copper nanoparticles were dispersed into paraffin wax to synthesis Cu-PCM nanocomposites. Five samples have been prepared to investigate the thermal properties of the produced Cu-PCM nanocomposites (Copper-Paraffin wax nanocomposites). The results of the experimental characterization showed that the thermal conductivity of the Cu-PCM nanocomposites was increased by 14.0%, 23.9%, 42.5% and 46.3% when 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% weight of nano Cu was dispersed in the PCM, respectively. The shift in the melting and solidification temperature showed that nano Cu has acted as nucleation agent to reduce the supercooling effect during the phase change process. On the analysis of the thermal degradation, nano Cu has improved the thermal stability of Cu-PCM nanocomposites without changes in chemical structure. The qualitative analysis showed that 20 nm nano Cu has hexagon shape with particles distribution size range from 15 nm to 125 nm. Site test, using integrated solar-TES system, showed efficiency enhancement by 1.7% when 1.0% nano Cu has been added to the paraffin wax.

These could include flooding from melting snow and/or rain, coincident with fungal diseases. Therefore, we designed an experiment to identify potential common mechanisms of flooding tolerance and snow mold resistance, involving the regulation of photosynthetic efficiency and carbohydrate metabolism at low temperatures. Snow mold-resistant and susceptible winter rye (Secale cereale) plants were characterized by considerably different patterns of response to flooding. These differences were clearer at low temperature, thus confirming a possible role of the observed changes in snow mold tolerance. The resistant plants were characterized by lower PSII quantum yields at low temperature, combined with much higher energy flux for energy dissipation from the PSII reaction center. During flooding, the level of soluble carbohydrates increased in the resistant plants and decreased in the susceptible ones. Thus increase in resistant line was connected with a decrease in the energy dissipation rate in PSII/increased photosynthetic activity (energy flux for electron transport), a lower rate of starch degradation and higher rates of sucrose metabolism in leaves. The resistant lines accumulated larger amounts of total soluble carbohydrates in the crowns than in the leaves. Irrespective of flooding treatment, the resistant lines allocated more sugars for cell wall composition, both in the leaves and crowns. Our results clearly indicated that studies on carbohydrate changes at low temperatures or during anoxia should investigate not only the alterations in water-soluble and storage carbohydrates, but also cell wall carbohydrates.The patterns of changes observed after low and high-temperature flooding were different, indicating separate control mechanisms of these responses. These included changes in the photosynthetic apparatus, starch accumulation and cell wall carbohydrate accumulation. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Cell wall matrix composition; Flooding; Photosynthetic efficiency; Sucrose phosphate synthase; Sucrose synthase","photosystem II; starch; carbohydrate metabolism; cell wall; flooding; fungus; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; photosynthesis; photosystem II; physiology; plant disease; plant leaf; Secale; shoot; solubility; temperature; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cell Wall; Floods; Fungi; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Secale; Solubility; Starch; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961262890

Thus, coordination between distributed generators, energy storage systems and flexible loads is expected to add a great value to grid operations and facilitate further RES penetration. The increasing penetration of bus communication technologies into buildings and their control possibilities over electric energy consumption may also make valuable contributions to the grid operation. Thus, the control system of the future grid should be compatible to smart buildings and cities. This paper presents a control system of an experimental microgrid which is made compatible to bus communication technologies at the demand-side, by applying a simple technique. The proposed technique does not require additional interface or software tools, as other methods do and therefore is a cost-effective method and can be easily expanded and used for demand-side management in future smart grids. Experimental results prove that bus communication technologies could contribute to the voltage regulation as well as to the application of efficient energy management policies of microgrid-based smart grid topologies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Its fruits are highly suitable for biodiesel production owing to the high quantity and quality of its oil. However, commercial exploitation of this species remains insufficient. Forms of harvesting, the storage period, and the use of chemicals for the postharvest preservation of macauba fruits and their effects on the associated microbiota were investigated. Mature fruits were collected only once from the mother tree and separated in two groups, a group of fruits not exposed to the ground surface (0 days) and a larger group of fruits that was placed in contact with the soil surface for 7, 14, and 21 days, to allow infestation of soil-borne microorganisms. Then the fruits were treated with 3 doses of fungicide fungicide (0, 0.2, and 0.4% v/v) and storage at room temperature during 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days. Hence the experiment was set in a randomized block design with four replications in a factorial Scheme 4 × 3 × 5 (period of ground surface contact, doses of fungicide and period of storage). The mesocarp oil content (OC), free fatty acids, and oxidative stability of the oil were evaluated, and the presence of microorganisms in the mesocarp and epicarp of the macauba fruits was quantified. Fungicide was found to be effective in maintaining low oil acidity of fruits unexposed to the soil surface for up to 20 days of storage and for maintaining oil oxidative stability. Regardless of the fungicide dose applied, an increase in the OC was noted for all harvest times during the first 10 days of storage. Therefore, for biodiesel production, it is recommended that the fruits should be harvested when in pre-absciscion stage (directly from the mother tree) or collected from the ground after no more than 7 days after abscission. In both cases, the fruits must be pre-treated with fungicide if storage is intended. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Acrocomia aculeata; Biofuel; Energy crop; Macauba palm; Oil quality","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Crops; Design of experiments; Fatty acids; Forestry; Fruits; Fungicides; Harvesting; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Oxidation resistance; Soils; Acrocomia aculeata; Biodiesel production; Commercial exploitation; Energy crops; Free fatty acid; Macauba palm; Oil quality; Oxidative stability; Palm oil; biochemical composition; biofuel; energy crop; evergreen tree; fatty acid; fruit; fungicide; harvesting; microbial activity; oxidation; qualitative analysis; soil microorganism; vegetable oil; Acrocomia aculeata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959431844

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-B has been shown to regulate tissue uptake and accumulation of fatty acids and is thus involved in these metabolic diseases. However, the cell-type-specific expression pattern of Vegfb and its receptor (VEGFR1, gene Flt1) remains unclear. We explore the expression of Vegfb and Flt1 in the murine heart, lung and kidney by utilizing β-galactosidase knock-in mouse models and combining the analysis of reporter gene expression and immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, Flt1 heterozygous mice were analyzed with regard to muscular fatty acid accumulation and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Throughout the heart, Vegfb expression was found in cardiomyocytes with a postnatal ventricular shift corresponding to known changes in energy requirements. Vegfb expression was also found in the pulmonary myocardium of the lung and in renal epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb of Henle’s loop, the connecting tubule and the collecting duct. In all analyzed organs, VEGFR1 expression was restricted to endothelial cells. We also show that reduced expression of VEGFR1 resulted in decreased cardiac fatty acid accumulation and increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, possibly as a result of attenuated VEGF-B/VEGFR1 signaling. Our data therefore support a tightly controlled, paracrine signaling mechanism of VEGF-B to VEGFR1. The identified cell-specific expression pattern of Vegfb and Flt1 might form the basis for the development of cell-type-targeted research models and contributes to the understanding of the physiological and pathological role of VEGF-B/VEGFR1 signaling. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Endothelial cells; Gene expression pattern; Insulin sensitivity; VEGF-B; VEGFR1","beta galactosidase; fatty acid; insulin; vasculotropin B; vasculotropin receptor 1; adult; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cellular distribution; controlled study; endothelium cell; Flt1 gene; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene location; heart; Henle loop; heterozygosity; immunofluorescence; insulin sensitivity; kidney; kidney collecting tubule; kidney tubule cell; lipid storage; lung; male; mouse; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; pericyte; phenotype; priority journal; pulmonary vein; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; tissue distribution; VEGF B gene; VEGFR1 gene; animal; biological model; C57BL mouse; cytology; epithelium cell; heterozygote; metabolism; physiology; vascularization; Animals; Epithelial Cells; Heart; Heterozygote; Kidney; Lung; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological; Myocytes, Cardiac; Phenotype; Pulmonary Veins; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959353857

The influence of the storage time on the surface properties of plasma-treated polymer plate was also examined. The properties were determined by advancing and receding contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy supported by theoretical spectrum modelling, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical profilometry. Three theoretical approaches were used in the determination of the apparent surface free energy of the untreated and plasma-treated PEEK samples from the measured contact angles of probe liquids (water, formamide, diiodomethane): the contact angle hysteresis method, the Owens and Wendt approach and the Lifsthitz-van der Waals acid-base approach. It was found that air plasma treatment of PEEK causes significant chemical and morphological changes of the polymer surface, which are reflected in the decrease of contact angles from 83.4° to 11.7° for water after 180s plasma treatment. This is due to the formation of polar functional groups resulting in the increase of the surface hydrophilicity. After plasma treatment the apolar component of the surface free energy practically does not change, while the polar component increases significantly, especially for plates treated for 180s, from 0 to 19.6mJ m-2. In addition, the modified PEEK surface is not stable during storage and it acquires more hydrophobic character. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.","Contact angle; Plasma treatment; Polyether ether ketone (PEEK); Surface free energy","Contact angle; Ethers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free energy; Hydrophilicity; Ketones; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Plasma applications; Surface properties; Van der Waals forces; Water treatment; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Advancing and receding contact angles; Contact angle hysteresis; Plasma treatment; Polar functional groups; Polyether ether ketones (PEEK); Surface free energy; Surface hydrophilicity; Time-dependent changes; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958218135

Pioneering research in nuclear science, for example the development of generation IV nuclear reactors, cannot be pursued without chemical solutions. Present issues related to light water reactors concern radiolysis of water in the primary circuit; long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel; radiation effects on cables and wire insulation, and on ion exchangers used for water purification; as well as the procedures of radioactive waste reprocessing and storage. Radiation effects on materials and enhanced corrosion are crucial in current (II/III/III+) and future (IV) generation reactors, and in waste management, deep geological disposal and spent fuel reprocessing. The new generation of reactors (III+ and IV) impose new challenges for radiation chemists due to their new conditions of operation and the usage of new types of coolant. In the case of the supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR), water chemistry control may be the key factor in preventing corrosion of reactor structural materials.

Although these hubs appear to be liquid market places fostering gas-to-gas competition, the efficiency of the gas market remains a topic of interest as a fair share of gas is still traded through long-term contracts with prices linked to the oil price while the number of gas suppliers to the European market is limited. In order to assess the efficiency of the gas market, we analyse the day-ahead spot price at the Dutch gas hub over the period 2011–2014. We find that the oil price had a small positive impact on the gas price. Changes in the concentration on the supply side did not affect the movement in gas prices. The availability of gas in storages and the outside temperature negatively influenced the gas price. We also find that the gas price was related to the production of wind electricity. Overall, we conclude that the day-ahead gas prices are predominantly determined by gas-market fundamentals.

However, due its high viscoelasticity, dispensing of epoxy is extremely difficult, and a lower viscoelasticity epoxy is desired to improve the process. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to achieve a lowered viscoelastic epoxy by using ultrasound. The viscoelasticity and molecular structures of the epoxies were compared and analyzed before and after experimentation. Different factors of the ultrasonic process, including power, processing time and ultrasonic energy, were studied in this study. It is found that elasticity is more sensitive to ultrasonic processing while viscosity is little affected. Further, large power and long processing time can minimize the viscoelasticity to ideal values. Due to the reduced loss modulus and storage modulus after ultrasonic processing, smooth dispensing is demonstrated for the processed epoxy. The subsequently color temperature experiments show that ultrasonic processing will not affect LED's lighting. It is clear that the ultrasonic processing will have good potential to aide smooth dispensing for high viscoelastic epoxy in electronic industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The PVCSs provide a seamless integration of energy harvesting/storage device, automatic and wide color tunability, and enhanced photostability of PSCs. Compared with conventional PVCC, the counter electrodes of our PVCSs provide sufficient balancing charge, eliminate the necessity of reverse bias voltage for bleaching the device, and realize reasonable in situ energy storage. The color states of PVCSs not only indicate the amount of energy stored and energy consumed in real time, but also enhance the photostability of photovoltaic component by preventing its long-time photoexposure under fully charged state of PVCSs.

(MAC) personnel. The student internship efforts capitalizes on previous activities from 2012 through 2014 when Lawrence Technological University had undertaken a major energy audit and energy study with MAC, at their facilities in Marlette, Michigan. In the spring of 2015 the State of Michigan Energy Office offered a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to universities within the state for one fully-funded grant for an engineering undergraduate student summer internship. The grant RFP stipulated that the undergraduate engineering student intern work on a project focusing on energy usage and savings specifically in the agriculture industry in the State of Michigan. Fortunately, over the past three years Lawrence Technological University has been undertaking energy usage assessments and audits of a large grain elevator facility in Marlette, Michigan, that is owned and operated by the Michigan Agricultural Commodities (MAC) Corporation. The previous three-year's work undertaken by Lawrence Tech had resulted in significant data collection and had provided an excellent foundation for what to do next to obtain possible energy savings. The process options at the grain facility in Marlette are many, are complex, and each carries with it energy costs that are not always understood. But up to this 2015 State proposed RFP internship, no addition funding resources were available to MAC or Lawrence Tech to finally develop and implement an appropriate energy savings planning tool that could be used by the MAC personnel for accurate projected energy usages for the receiving, routing and storage of gain at their facility. Such applied engineering internships are of great value to the student and to industry, so a discussion of the lessons learned are provided by the undergraduate engineering student herself, along with a commentary of both the academic and applied engineering knowledge gained by such internships are also presented.

Since energy storage is becoming an integral part of data centers, one can maximize the benefit of the temporal and spatial uctuations of electricity rates by combining geographical load balancing and energy storage management. Previously, the problem of integrated geographical load balancing with energy storage has been studied based on Lyapunov stochastic optimization approach, which relies on asymptotic analysis by averaging over infinite time horizon and arbitrarily large energy storage. In this paper, we present a competitive online algorithmic approach, which can be applied to finite time horizon and small-to-medium energy storage with a worst-case guarantee from the offline optimal solutions. By simulations on real-world data, it is observed that our competitive online algorithms can significantly outperform Lyapunov optimization algorithm. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Competitive analysis; Data centers; Online algorithms","Algorithms; Asymptotic analysis; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Network management; Optimization; Storage management; Algorithmic approach; Competitive analysis; Data centers; Infinite time horizon; On-line algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Stochastic optimization approach; Temporal and spatial; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979697448

In parallel, power grid operators are struggling with reduction of peak energy demands. To cope with this problem automated demand response (ADR) techniques are developed. As data centers are precisely monitored and controlled they are well suited to the participation in ADR programmes. However, shapes of loads in data centres may be variable and not fitting the energy supply. We propose to apply ADR to data centers by adequate scheduling of workloads and the partial use of renewable energy sources (RES) especially during peak hours. As the energy produced by renewable sources may be very variable we investigate the use of energy storage. We present a model, heuristics that minimize overall energy cost and experimental results.

When the Fermi length lF=/(vFmeff) becomes much longer than the magnetic length lB=( c/eB)1/2, then the spatial coordinates X,Y of the electron cease to commute, [X,Y]=ilB2. As a consequence, localization of the electron becomes limited by Heisenberg uncertainty, and the linear bath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic energy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron has no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection between frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features make quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime lF lB, which is at the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum Brownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation derived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of characterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out to be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to tα and α=1, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality constant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime, friction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We also show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the noncommutative plane for suitably designed metastable potential wells, a feature that might be worth exploiting for storage and protection of quantum information. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976900076

The materials show excellent rate capability allowing 30 μm layers to be fully converted within seconds without the use of conductive additives. The high rate capability is traced to the open morphology of the materials that allows for fast ion transport, and to the mediation of electrons through the conducting polymer (CP) backbone. The requirements for the latter are i) that the redox chemistry of the pendant groups and the CP backbone overlaps and ii) that the CP conductivity is not compromised by the presence of the pendant groups. In the CRPs presented herein both these requirements are met and this is thus the first report on successful combination of the redox chemistry of organic redox molecules with the n-doping of conducting polymers. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","conducting redox polymers; n-doping; polythiophene; terephthalates","Anodes; Characterization; Conducting polymers; Electrodes; Organic polymers; Polymers; Conductive additives; Diethyl terephthalates; Electrical energy storages; High rate capability; N-Doping; Redox polymers; Synthesis and characterizations; Terephthalate; Conductive materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964514355

The enhanced pseudocapacitive characteristics of the renewable dopant in composite electrodes was achieved by combining the reversible redox charge transfer of surface-confined quinones and their interaction with an electron-conducting polymer backbone. Because of the different oxidation potentials of the three monomers and the parent lignosulfonate, it was found that methoxyphenol functional groups present in the biomacromolecule are converted to quinones during the electropolimeryzation of aniline and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. In contrast, in the case of pyrrole, lignosulfonate is incorporated into growing PPy in its reduced form and therefore the formed PPy/LS composite film needs a post-polymerization oxidation to induce the redox activity of LS. The observed redox activity of the PPy/LS, PANI/LS and PEDOT/LS composite films was strongly dependant on the preparation conditions including: density of the polymerization current, monomer-to-dopant mass ratio and the electropolymerization charge. The effect of these variables on redox activity of the three types of polymeric films was studied in detail and optimal preparation conditions were found. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 0.1 M HClO4 solution reveal that combining conducting polymers with LS dopant results in improved charge storage properties. Thus LS-containing conducting polymers are expected to work effectively as cathodes in energy storing devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd.

However, several strategies for training regimens have been proposed, like “live high, train high” (LH-TH), “live high, train low” (LH-TL) or “intermittent hypoxic training” (IHT). Each of them combines the effect of acclimatization and different training protocols that require specific nutrition. An appropriate nutrition strategy and adequate hydration can help athletes achieve their fitness and performance goals in this unfriendly environment. In this review, the physiological stress of altitude exposure and training will be discussed, with specific nutrition recommendations for athletes training under such conditions. However, there is little research about the nutrition demands of athletes who train at moderate altitude. Our review considers energetic demands and body mass or body composition changes due to altitude training, including respiratory and urinary water loss under these conditions.

The associated paradox related to β-cell efficiency is that excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue predisposes for type 2 diabetes. Insulin exocytosis is regulated by intracellular metabolic signal transduction, with glutamate dehydrogenase playing a key role in the amplification of the secretory response. Here, we used mice with β-cell-selective glutamate dehydrogenase deletion (βGlud1 β/β ), lacking an amplifying pathway of insulin secretion. As opposed to control mice, βGlud1 β/β animals fed a high calorie diet maintained glucose tolerance and did not develop diet-induced obesity. Islets of βGlud1 β/β mice did not increase their secretory response upon high calorie feeding, as did islets of control mice. Inhibited adipose tissue expansion observed in knock-out mice correlated with lower expression of genes responsible for adipogenesis. Rather than being efficiently stored, lipids were consumed at a higher rate in βGlud1 β/β mice compared with controls, in particular during food intake periods. These results show that reduced β-cell function prior to high calorie feeding prevented diet-induced obesity. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Cells; Cytology; Gene expression; Insulin; Mammals; Signal transduction; Tissue; Adipose tissue; Beta cell functions; Diet-induced obesity; Glucose tolerance; Glutamate dehydrogenase; Insulin secretion; Optimal function; Type-2 diabetes; Nutrition; glutamate dehydrogenase; glutamate dehydrogenase; adaptation; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; diet; energy expenditure; fat intake; food intake; gene expression; glucose tolerance; high caloric diet; insulin release; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell function; priority journal; signal transduction; tissue expansion; 129 mouse; adverse effects; animal; basal metabolic rate; C57BL mouse; cell culture; genetics; glucose intolerance; knockout mouse; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Cells, Cultured; Diet, High-Fat; Glucose Intolerance; Glutamate Dehydrogenase; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice, 129 Strain; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975089740

As an implementation of smart microgrid, a university load profile was chosen. Its location is assumed as Izmir, in Turkey for realistic approach. Different case scenarios were simulated by using Homer Software in terms of economic and environmental aspects. According to simulation results, it is seen that smart micro-grid implementation in Turkey is beneficial with regards to both economic and environmental view. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy storage; micro-grids; photovoltaic system; wind energy","Electric power systems; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Wind power; Efficient power; Electrical grids; Environmental aspects; Environmental evaluation; Homer softwares; Micro grid; Photovoltaic systems; Smart Micro Grids; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978715615

Small-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) with artificial air vessels can improve the supply capacity of power system and the utilization of renewable energy by storing excess power during off-peak time and releasing it for on-peak power supply and becomes more promising for distributed energy systems. For diabatic CAES, heat usually cannot be efficiently utilized and the low inlet temperature of turbine in an adiabatic-CAES (A-CAES) usually leads to low discharge efficiency. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel combined cooling, heating and power system (CCHP) based on small-scale CAES. The sensitivity analysis performed shows the effectiveness of heat exchanger, and the air temperature and pressure at the turbine inlet have great influence on the system's thermodynamic performance. Then, the trade-off between the thermodynamic and economic performances is investigated by an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm. The total investment cost per output power of the Pareto solutions does not increase significantly when increasing exergy efficiency below 51%, indicating the solutions with an exergy efficiency of around 51% are promising for practical designs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The carbons were obtained by a hard-template strategy using a mixture of furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl mercaptan. For the application as electrode material in lithium-sulfur batteries, the carbons were additionally loaded with sulfur following a traditional melt-diffusion approach. It was found that the sulfur interacts stronger with the sulfur-functionalized carbon matrix than with the non-functionalized material. Electrodes showed very high capacity in the second discharge-charge cycle amounting to approximately 1500, 1200 and 1400 mAh/g (sulfur) for carbon materials with no, medium and high degrees of sulfur functionalization, respectively. More importantly, the sulfur-functionalization of the carbon was found to increase the capacity retention after 50 discharge-charge cycles by 8 and 5% for the carbons with medium and high degrees of sulfur-functionalization, respectively, compared to carbon with no sulfur-functionalization. We attribute this significant improvement to the presence of covalently bound sulfur groups at the internal surface of the functionalized carbon providing efficient anchoring sites for catenation to the sulfur loaded into the pores of the carbons and provide experimental support for this in the form of results from cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A literature survey was conducted to review the impact of uncertainty in thermos-physical properties on the design and operation of components and processes involved in CO2 capture, conditioning, transport and storage. According to the existing studies on property impacts, liquid phase viscosity and diffusivity as well as gas phase diffusivity significantly impact the process simulation and absorber design for chemical absorption. Moreover, the phase equilibrium is important for regenerating energy estimation. For CO2 compression and pumping processes, thermos-physical properties have more obvious impacts on pumps than on compressors. Heat capacity, density, enthalpy and entropy are the most important properties in the pumping process, whereas the compression process is more sensitive to heat capacity and compressibility. In the condensation and liquefaction process, the impacts of density, enthalpy and entropy are low on heat exchangers. For the transport process, existing studies mainly focused on property impacts on the performance of pipeline steady flow processes. Among the properties, density and heat capacity are most important. In the storage process, density and viscosity have received the most attention in property impact studies and were regarded as the most important properties in terms of storage capacity and enhanced oil recovery rate. However, for physical absorption, physical adsorption and membrane separation, there has been a knowledge gap about the property impact. In addition, due to the lack of experimental data and process complexity, little information is available about the influence of liquid phase properties on the design of the absorber and desorber for chemical absorption process. In the CO2 conditioning process, knowledge of the impacts of properties beyond density and enthalpy is insufficient. In the transport process, greater attention should focus on property impacts on transient transport processes and ship transport systems. In the storage process, additional research is required on the dispersion process in enhanced oil recovery and the dissolution process in ocean and saline aquifer storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several existing nuclear and fossil fuel power plants are to be retired in the coming years. Meanwhile, ambitious carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions are envisaged, which could penalise fossil power plants and encourage investments in renewable-based electricity generation. Switzerland and a few other countries in Europe have decided to phase-out their nuclear capacity, thereby removing a low-carbon source of electricity in the medium- to long-term future. In order to understand possible electricity transition pathways for Switzerland, electricity supply options for Switzerland and its four neighbouring countries namely Austria, France, Germany and Italy are analysed to assess non-nuclear alternatives under a stringent climate mitigation policy. The cross border Swiss TIMES electricity model (CROSSTEM), a cost optimisation framework with a long time horizon and an hourly temporal resolution, is used for this analysis. In the absence of any CO2 emission reduction targets, gas-based generation supplemented by electricity imports is the cost-effective alternative to nuclear for Switzerland. For a low carbon electricity system, natural gas based generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), complemented by an accelerated investment in renewable generation is required. Traditional electricity trade patterns have to be revised, with significant increases in cross-border interconnector capacities necessary to transfer electricity to Switzerland from countries with abundant renewable resources such as Germany and Italy. The average cost of electricity in a decarbonised electricity sector would increase in the range of 30-120% by 2050 compared to today, depending on the scenario assumptions. The availability of CCS technology and the requirement for electricity storage are particularly important to achieve a complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector with a nuclear phase-out. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Decarbonisation of power sector; Electricity model; Nuclear phase-out; Switzerland; TIMES model","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric energy storage; Electric industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Electricity generation; Emission reduction targets; Low-carbon electricities; Nuclear phase-out; Power sector; Switzerland; TIMES modeling; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961954146

Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we tested different allocation procedures and system expansion through avoided burden to compare the environmental impact of milk from either specialised or mixed dairy production systems (product level). In a second approach, we compared the whole farming systems with additive system expansion, where the functional unit comprised milk, live animals sold for meat production and crops (farm level). On the product level, milk from the mixed farm had higher non-renewable cumulative energy demand, terrestrial ecotoxicity and phosphorus use, but lower aquatic eutrophication N, independently of the allocation method. For all other impact categories, differences were not significant. On the farm level, results were partially reversed. The mixed system had a lower energy demand and potassium use, while phosphorus use was higher. All other differences were not significant on farm level. The different rankings on product and on farm level were caused by the way manure was attributed to the farming activities. In order to avoid allocation, manure management was sub-divided into storage and application processes. Storage was attributed to dairy production, application to dairy production only if applied on grassland or feed crops, and to cash crops when applied to produce these crops. Manure applied on cash crop areas was thus out of the scope of the product approach, and mineral fertilisers that could be saved within the cash crop production were thus not attributed to milk production. We conclude that only system expansion was able to cope with the complexity of mixed farming systems in LCA. Based on our results with modelled farms, mixed farming showed the potential to reduce environmental impacts compared to specialised farming. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the system regarding farm management and interactions between cropping and livestock activities, only an assessment with real farm data could reveal the actual benefits of such systems. © 2016 The Authors.","Allocation; Crop; Life cycle assessment; Livestock; Multifunctionality; System expansion","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Dairies; Digital storage; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Farms; Fertilizers; Information management; Manures; Phosphorus; Allocation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Livestock; Multifunctionality; System expansion; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959535704

Following the promising, yet largely theoretical and simulation based, research of physics aspects of the DDA technique applied to SNF assay during the early stages of the NGSI-SF project, the most recent effort has been focused on the practical aspects of developing the first fully functional and deployable DDA prototype instrument for spent fuel. As a result of the collaboration among US research institutions and Sweden, the opportunity to test the newly proposed instrument's performance with commercial grade SNF at the Swedish Interim Storage Facility (Clab) emerged. Therefore the design of this instrument prototype has to accommodate the requirements of the Swedish regulator as well as specific engineering constrains given by the unique industrial environment.

Remarkable variation was observed for non-structural carbohydrates and structural polysaccharides during three key developmental stages both between and within hybrids developed for distinct end use in both species. At the onset of the reproductive phase (average 65 days after planting, DAP), a wide range for accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates (free glucose and sucrose combined), was observed in internodes of maize (11-24%) and sorghum (7-36%) indicating substantial variation for transient storage of excess photosynthate during periods of low grain or vegetative sink strength. Remobilization of these reserves for supporting grain fill or vegetative growth was evident from lower amounts in maize (8-19%) and sorghum (9-27%) near the end of the reproductive period (average 95 DAP). At physiological maturity of grain hybrids (average 120 DAP), amounts of these carbohydrates were generally unchanged in maize (9-21%) and sorghum (16-27%) suggesting a loss of photosynthetic assimilation due to weakening sink demand. Nonetheless, high amounts of non-structural carbohydrates at maturity even in grain maize and sorghum (15-18%) highlight the potential for developing dual-purpose (grain/stover) crops. For both species, the amounts of structural polysaccharides in the cell wall, measured as monomeric components (glucose and pentose), decreased during grain fill but remained unchanged thereafter with maize biomass possessing slightly higher amounts than sorghum. Availability of carbohydrates in maize and sorghum highlights the potential for developing energy-rich dedicated biofuel or dual-purpose (grain/stover) crops. © 2016 Sekhon, Breitzman, Silva, Santoro, Rooney, de Leon and Kaeppler.","Biofeedstocks; Biofuels; Maize; Non-structural carbohydrates; Sorghum; Structural carbohydrates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973911547

Todays allflash storage arrays exhibit excellent I/O throughput, latency, storage density, and energy efficiency. However, the advancements in NAND technology are driven mostly by the consumer market, which makes NAND flash manufacturers focus primarily on reducing cost ($/GiB) and increasing the storage density by technology node scaling, by increasing the number of bits stored per cell, and by stacking cells vertically (3D-NAND). This comes at the cost of reduced endurance of the raw NAND flash, larger variations across blocks, and longer latencies, especially with extremely high error rates (due to the use of read-retry operations). In this paper, we present Health Binning, a technique that facilitates bringing low-cost consumer-level flash to the quality required for enterprise-level storage systems. Health Binning determines the wear characteristics of each block in the background and uses this information in the dataplacement process to map hotter data to healthier blocks and colder data to less healthy blocks. Health Binning significantly improves the endurance and performance of the storage system: It actively narrows the block wear distribution and moves endurance from being dictated by the worst blocks towards to a value corresponding to the average endurance of all blocks, resulting in up to 80% enhanced endurance compared with other wear-leveling schemes.

The effects of GO nano-filler were investigated in terms of enhancement in ionic conductivity along with the electrochemical properties of its electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC). The GO-doped SPE shows improvement in ionic conductivity compared to the P(VdF-HFP)-[EMI-BTI] SPE system due to the existence of the abundant oxygen-containing functional group in GO that assists in the improvement of the ion mobility in the polymer matrix. The complexation of the materials in the SPE is confirmed in X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies. The electrochemical performance of EDLC fabricated with GO-doped SPE is examined using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge techniques. The maximum specific capacitance obtained is 29.6 F·g-1, which is observed at a scan rate of 3 mV/s in 6 wt % GO-doped, SPE-based EDLC. It also has excellent cyclic retention as it is able keep the performance of the EDLC at 94% even after 3000 cycles. These results suggest GO doped SPE plays a significant role in energy storage application.","Copolymer; Electrical double layer capacitor; Graphene oxide; Ionic liquid","Capacitors; Copolymers; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Electrolytic capacitors; Graphene; Ionic conductivity; Ionic liquids; Solid electrolytes; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Electrical double layer capacitor; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage applications; Graphene oxides; Oxygen-containing functional groups; Solid polymer electrolytes; Specific capacitance; Vinylidene fluoride; Polyelectrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975690903

In previous work, we have achieved this with liposomes containing gold nanoparticles in the aqueous core. Gold nanoparticles absorb near-infrared light and release the energy as heat that increases the permeability of the liposomal bilayer, thus releasing the contents of the liposome. In this work, we replaced the gold nanoparticles with the clinically approved imaging agent indocyanine green (ICG). The ICG liposomes were stable at storage conditions (4-22 °C) and at body temperature, and fast near-infrared (IR) light-triggered drug release was achieved with optimized phospholipid composition and a 1:50 ICG-to-lipid molar ratio. Encapsulated small molecular calcein and FITC-dextran (up to 20 kDa) were completely released from the liposomes after light exposure for 15 s. Location of ICG in the PEG layer of the liposomes was simulated with molecular dynamics. ICG has important benefits as a light-triggering agent in liposomes: fast content release, improved stability, improved possibility of liposomal size control, regulatory approval to use in humans, and the possibility of imaging the in vivo location of the liposomes based on the fluorescence of ICG. Near-infrared light used as a triggering mechanism has good tissue penetration and safety. Thus, ICG liposomes are an attractive option for light-controlled and efficient delivery of small and large drug molecules. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","indocyanine green; light activation; liposome; macromolecules; molecular dynamics; triggered release","calcein; fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran; gold nanoparticle; indocyanine green; liposome; phospholipid; gold; indocyanine green; liposome; macrogol derivative; metal nanoparticle; Article; body temperature; drug release; in vivo study; light exposure; lipid composition; molecular dynamics; priority journal; storage temperature; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug release; fluorescence; human; infrared radiation; procedures; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Fluorescence; Gold; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Infrared Rays; Liposomes; Metal Nanoparticles; Polyethylene Glycols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973635764

A promising method for long term heat storage is to use thermochemical materials, TCMs. In this research, a lab-scale test thermochemical heat storage system is tested experimentally and modeled numerically. Water-zeolite 13X is used as the working pair in an open packed bed reactor. The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of the kinetic parameters for the adsorption of water vapor on zeolite 13X (2 mm spherical beads), on the thermal performance of a sorption heat storage packed bed reactor. A mathematical model is developed incorporating the kinetics model and the isotherm curves and including the heat losses from the side wall of the reactor, and is validated by comparing the calculated temperature profiles with experimental ones from a lab-scale test setup. The numerical and experimental results are used to calculate the heat fluxes in the reactor and are compared to evaluate the thermal performance of the reactor. With the validated model, a parameter study is carried out into the effect of the reaction kinetics and the gas flow rate on thermal performance of a thermochemical heat storage reactor under full scale normal operating conditions. From this work, predictions of the thermal dynamics of an adsorption bed on reactor scale can be achieved, which can and will be used for further studies on the design and optimization of a thermochemical heat storage system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to develop a spatial optimization model for the planning of residential urban districts with special consideration of renewables and water harvesting integration. In particular, the paper analyses the optimal configuration of built environment area, PV area, wind turbines number and relative occupation area, battery and water harvester storage capacities, as a function of electricity and water prices. The optimization model is multi-objective which uses a genetic algorithm to minimize the system life cycle costs, and maximize renewables and water harvesting reliability. The developed model can be used for spatial optimization design of new urban districts. It can also be employed for analyzing the performances of existing urban districts under an energy-water-economic viewpoint. Assuming a built environment area equal to 75% of the total available area, the results show that the reliability of the renewables and water harvesting system cannot exceed the 6475 and 2500 hours/year, respectively. The life cycle costs of integrating renewables and water harvesting into residential districts are mainly sensitive to the battery system specific costs since most of the highest renewables reliabilities are guaranteed through the energy storage system. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Genetic algorithm; Hybrid power systems; Optimization; Renewable energy; Residential urban districts; Water harvesting","Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Harvesting; Housing; Life cycle; Optimization; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Runoff; Site selection; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Hybrid power systems; Optimization modeling; Renewable energies; Residential urban districts; Spatial optimization model; Urban sustainable development; Water harvesting; Zoning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007574574

In this study, the load profile of a multi apartment building in Gothenburg and the PV production profile under local weather conditions are compared and analyzed. Three different types of batteries, including lead acid, NaNiCl (Sodium-Nickel-Chloride) and Lithium ion, are studied in combination with the PV systems. It is found that Lithium ion battery system is superior in achieving higher Self-Sufficiency Ratio (SSR) with the same Life Cycle Cost (LCC). Achieving high SSR with the hybrid PV-battery system is unrealistic because of the seasonal mismatch between the load and electricity production profile. The capacity match between the PV and battery to maximize SSR was investigated, showing different trends under system LCC range of 0.1-40 Million SEK (1SEK≈0.12USD).

A peculiarity of the systems is that gas must be stored under a high pressure (p = 10-30 MPa). A lined rock cavern (LRC) in the form of a tunnel or shaft can be used within this pressure range. The rock mass surrounding the opening resists the internal pressure and the lining ensures gas tightness. The present paper investigates the key aspects of technical feasibility of shallow LRC tunnels or shafts under a wide range of geotechnical conditions. Results show that the safety with respect to uplift failure of the rock mass is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for assessing feasibility. The deformation of the rock mass should also be kept sufficiently small to preserve the integrity of the lining and, especially, its tightness. If the rock is not sufficiently stiff, buckling or fatigue failure of the steel lining becomes more decisive when evaluating the feasible operating air pressure. The design of the concrete plug that seals the compressed air stored in the container is another demanding task. Numerical analyses indicate that in most cases, the stability of the rock mass under the plug loading is not a decisive factor for plug design. © 2016 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Compressed air energy storage (CAES); Concrete plug; Feasibility assessment; Lining; Tunnels","buckling; cavern; cavity; design; high pressure; tunnel lining; uplift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006190075

Intake of a high-fat diet with a low protein/sucrose ratio precipitated obesity and reduced survival relative to mice fed a low-fat diet. By contrast, intake of a high-fat diet with a high protein/sucrose ratio attenuated lifelong weight gain and adipose tissue expansion, and survival was not significantly altered relative to low-fat-fed mice. Our findings support the notion that reduced survival in response to high-fat/high-sucrose feeding is linked to obesity development. Digital gene expression analyses, further validated by qPCR, demonstrated that the protein/sucrose ratio modulated global gene expression over time in liver and adipose tissue, affecting pathways related to metabolism and inflammation. Analysis of fecal bacterial DNA using the Mouse Intestinal Tract Chip revealed significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in relation to host age and dietary fat content, but not the protein/sucrose ratio. Accordingly, dietary fat rather than the protein/sucrose ratio or adiposity is a major driver shaping the gut microbiota, whereas the effect of a high-fat diet on survival is dependent on the protein/sucrose ratio. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Gut microbiota; High-fat diet; High-protein diet; Obesity; Survival","bacterial DNA; carbohydrate; protein; sucrose; protein intake; sugar intake; adipose tissue; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; energy; fat content; fat intake; feces microflora; feeding; female; gene; gene expression; glucose tolerance; inflammation; intestine flora; lifespan; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver; low fat diet; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein diet; survival; tissue expansion; weight gain; administration and dosage; adverse effects; animal; C57BL mouse; comparative study; intestine flora; longitudinal study; low fat diet; metabolism; obesity; pharmacokinetics; physiology; protein intake; sugar intake; survival rate; Animals; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Dietary Proteins; Dietary Sucrose; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Longitudinal Studies; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Survival Rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983631388

Trade-offs for area cost, leakage power, access time, and access energy are discussed and realized using different read logic styles, latch architecture designs, and process options. Furthermore, deployment of multiple threshold voltages (Vth) options in a single standard-cell/bitcell enables additional architectural choices. Silicon measurements from five memory designs, optimized at the transistor level in conjunction with gate-level optimizations, are considered to demonstrate the different trade-off corners. Measurements show that substituting the storage element in an SCM with a D-latch using transistor stacking and channel length stretching results in lowest leakage power. Alternatively, a pass-transistor based latch as storage element reduces the area footprint at a cost of reduced access speed, which can be compensated by using a lower- Vth pass-transistor. However, relatively high speed (tens of MHz) in the near- to subthreshold (Vth) region is achievable if general purpose transistors are used instead of low power transistors. A discussion is included to illustrate when to implement ULV memories using SCMs and when to choose sub- Vth SRAMs. The discussion shows that the border is between 4-6 kb, depending on the number of words and the wordlength configuration. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Low-power; SCM; SRAM; sub-threshold; ultra-low voltage","CMOS integrated circuits; Economic and social effects; Static random access storage; Transistors; Architecture designs; Design considerations; Gate level optimizations; Low Power; Low power transistors; Multiple-threshold voltage; Subthreshold; Ultra-low-voltage; Threshold voltage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979248391

Biodiesel as an alternative fuel for diesel engines has gained international attention. This study aimed to produce biodiesel using a dual-stage methodology from Jatropha curcas oil, a nonedible raw material, esterification followed by alkaline transesterification method. The physical and chemical determinations were carried out at such as acidity as high as 9.0 mg KOH g−1. Therefore, esterification was first conducted with decreasing acidity to a suitable value of 1.75 mg KOH g−1 which is liable to subsequent transesterification stage. The chromatographic data shows that the oil fatty acids present in greatest quantity are 47.85 % oleic (C18:1) and 33.28 % linoleic (C18:2), with suitable lipids for biodiesel production. From the results obtained through the characterization of J. curcas biodiesel, it was noted that this had to be a promising oilseed for biodiesel production, with a yield of 97.5 % in the esterification reaction and 84.4 % in transesterification reaction, and obtained an ester content of 98.5 % (w/w). The oxidative stability was raised to 6.17 h with the addition of 2000 ppm of antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT). During the storage period, the sample of J. curcas biodiesel showed a decrease in oxidative stability and an increase in water content with time. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Antioxidant additives; Jatropha curcas biodiesel; Production methodology; Shelf life; Storage stability","Additives; Alkalinity; Alternative fuels; Antioxidants; Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Digital storage; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Linoleic acid; Oxidation resistance; Stability; Storage (materials); Transesterification; Alkaline transesterification; Antioxidant additives; Esterification reactions; Increase in water content; Jatropha curcas; Shelf life; Storage stability; Transesterification reaction; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978023115

Using the central controller and distributed energy management systems, various mechanisms that harness the power profile of the energy community are developed for optimal, multi-objective energy management. The proposed mechanisms include resource-aware, multi-variable energy utility maximization objectives, namely: (1) maximizing the net green energy utilization, (2) maximizing the prosumers' level of comfortable, high quality power usage, and (3) maximizing the economic dispatch of energy storage units that minimize the net energy cost of the energy community. Moreover, an optimal energy management solution that combines the three objectives has been implemented by developing novel techniques of optimally flexible (un)certainty projection and appliance based pricing decomposition in an IBM ILOG CPLEX studio. A real-world, per-minute data from an energy community consisting of forty prosumers in Amsterdam, Netherlands is used. Results show that each of the proposed mechanisms yields significant increases in the aggregate energy resource utilization and welfare of prosumers as compared to traditional peak-power reduction methods. Furthermore, the multi-objective, resource-aware utility maximization approach leads to an optimal energy equilibrium and provides a sustainable energy management solution as verified by the Lagrangian method. The proposed resource-aware mechanisms could directly benefit emerging energy communities in the world to attain their energy resource utilization targets. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.","energy community; energy efficiency; energy management; energy welfare; prosumer; smart-grid","Aggregates; Digital storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Lagrange multipliers; Scheduling; Amsterdam , Netherlands; energy community; energy welfare; Prosumer; Resource utilizations; Smart grid; Sustainable energy management; Utility maximizations; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976631921

Therefore, a large amount of test driving is performed, which together with recordings of normal driving, results in large databases of recorded drives. A fundamental question is how to make best use of these data to devise driving cycles suitable in the development process of vehicles. One way is to generate driving cycles that are representative for the data or for a suitable subset of the data, e.g., regarding geographical location, driving distance, speed range, or many other possible selection variables. Further, to make a fair comparison on two such driving cycles possible, another fundamental requirement is that they should have similar excitation of the vehicle. A key contribution here is an algorithm that combines the two given objectives. A formulation with Markov processes is used to obtain a condensed and effective characterization of the database and to generate candidate driving cycles (CDCs). In addition to that is a method transforming a candidate to an equivalent driving cycle (EqDC) with desired excitation. The method is a general approach but is here based on the components of the mean tractive force (MTF), and this is motivated by a hardware-in-the-loop experiment showing the strong relevance of these MTF components regarding fuel consumption. The result is a new method that combines the generation of driving cycles using real-world driving cycles with the concept of EqDCs. © 2015 IEEE.","Drive cycle; equivalence measures; equivalent driving cycle (EqDC); mean tractive force (MTF); specific energy; test procedures; vehicle design; vehicle excitation; vehicle propulsion","Behavioral research; Catalytic converters; Database systems; Digital storage; Markov processes; Testing; Drive cycles; Driving cycle; equivalence measures; Specific energy; Test procedures; Tractive force; Vehicle design; Vehicle propulsion; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976484698

Its role in plant physiology is intensively explored, and its important function in plant stress defence frequently underlined. Melatonin is particularly effective when applied as an additional factor of seed priming. In the presented research, hydroconditioning was chosen experimentally as optimal for maize (Zea mays L.) seeds. The following seed variants were compared: controlled non-treated, hydroprimed with water and hydroprimed with melatonin solutions 50 and 500 μM. To identify modifications in proteome of maize seeds caused by the applied hydroconditioning techniques, protein extracts of germinated seed embryos (24 h, 25 °C) were separated by 2D-PAGE. Next, obtained maps of proteomes were compared (statistically and graphically) using PDQuest software, and characteristic spots of proteins were analysed qualitatively by mass-spectrometric techniques and identified in the Mascot protein databases. Research helped to identify hydropriming-associated proteins, and for the first time those which were expressed only in the presence of melatonin. Study confirmed that suitably selected pre-sowing treatment with melatonin, by embryo proteome modification, effectively prepares plants to adverse environmental conditions. In melatonin treated seeds during the initial state of embryos growth, even under optimal conditions, additional antioxidative, detoxifying, anti-stresses proteins were synthesized.

However, the wide band gap of this material limits applications to UV light, which also confines the use of solar irradiation as the energy source. Much research in the last years is showing the ability of N doping into TiO2 to promote light absorption in the visible range but, to date, it is still controversy if this doping is beneficial to the photocatalytic process, as well as the synthetic methods are not well stabilized yet. Then, this paper summarizes the recent advancement in the structural design perspective of N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst, in a critical analysis of its application for environmental purposes. We reported the dimensionality effect associated with modified N-doped TiO2 structure for its characteristics properties and photocatalytic performance; counting more specifically its charge transportation, surface area, adhesion, reflection and absorption properties. A concise view of the doping effect over morphology in 0, 1, 2 and 3-dimensional ranges was provided, in order to understand which effects are also occurring on the materials besides the photocatalytic response. Furthermore, selected recent and significant advances in the area of renewable energy applications for modified N-doped TiO2 were assessed with the particular importance given towards the electricity generation by dye-sensitized solar cells and lithium-ion batteries rechargeable for electric energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","0-D nanoshperes; 1-D nanofibers/nanotubes; 2-D nanosheets/thin films; 3-D interconnected architecture; Dimentionality; Dye-sesitized solar cells; Lithium-ion batteries; N-doping; Photocatalysis; Semiconductor; TiO2","Doping (additives); Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy gap; Light absorption; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Photocatalysis; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor doping; Semiconductor materials; Solar cells; Structural design; Titanium dioxide; Wide band gap semiconductors; 0-D nanoshperes; 1-D nanofibers/nanotubes; Dimentionality; Electricity generation; N-Doping; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic process; Renewable energy applications; Nanostructured materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973878632

Its large-scale application rests upon the availability of active, durable, low-cost electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the discharge process and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the charge process. Herein we developed a novel ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the codoping and hybridization strategies. The B/N-codoped mesoporous nanocarbon supported Co(II)1-xCo(0)x/3Mn(III)2x/3S nanoparticles exhibit a superior OER performance compared to that of IrO2 catalyst and comparable Zn-air battery performance to that of the Pt-based battery. The rechargeable Zn-air battery shows high discharge peak power density (over 250 mW cm-2) and current density (180 mA cm-2 at 1 V), specific capacity (∼550 mAh g-1), small charge-discharge voltage gap of ∼0.72 V at 20 mA cm-2 and even higher stability than the Pt-based battery.

Due to computational and storage complexity or physical constraints imposed by the problem, the measurement matrix A x Cn×p is often of the form A = PΩΨ for some orthonormal basis matrix Ψ Cp×p and subsampling operator PΩ : Cp → Cn that selects the rows indexed by Ω. This raises the fundamental question of how best to choose the index set Ω in order to optimize the recovery performance. Previous approaches to addressing this question rely on nonuniform random subsampling using application-specific knowledge of the structure of x. In this paper, we instead take a principled learning-based approach in which a fixed index set is chosen based on a set of training signals x1, xm. We formulate combinatorial optimization problems seeking to maximize the energy captured in these signals in an average-case or worst-case sense, and we show that these can be efficiently solved either exactly or approximately via the identification of modularity and submodularity structures. We provide both deterministic and statistical theoretical guarantees showing how the resultingmeasurement matrices perform on signals differing from the training signals, and we provide numerical examples showing our approach to be effective on a variety of data sets. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Compressive sensing; data-driven sensing design; learning-based measurement design; non-uniform subsampling; scientific and medical imaging; structured sparsity; submodular optimization","Combinatorial optimization; Compressed sensing; Computerized tomography; Digital storage; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Compressive sensing; Data driven; Measurement designs; Non-uniform; Structured sparsities; Submodular optimizations; Medical imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971011004

This methodology cannot provide longevity of hearts for more than 4–6 h and is thereby insufficient to expand the number of available organs. Albeit at lower rate, the breakdown of ATP still occurs during hypothermia. Furthermore, cold static preservation does not prevent the permanent damage that occurs upon reperfusion known as ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. This damage is caused by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in combination with mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, highlighting the importance of mitochondria in ischemic storage. There has recently been a major paradigm shift in the field, with emerging research supporting changes in traditional storage approaches. Novel research suggests achieving metabolic homeostasis instead of attempting to limit metabolic activity which reduces IR injury and improves graft preservation. Maintaining high ATP levels and circumventing cold organ storage would be a much more sophisticated standard for organ storage and should be the focus of future research in organ preservation. Given the link between mPTP, Ca2+, and ROS, managing Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria during conditioning might be the next critical step towards preventing irreversible IR injury. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bioenergetics; Mitochondria; Preservation; Reactive oxygen species; Transplant","adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; calcium ion; cytochrome c; glutathione; mitochondrial DNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; sodium calcium exchange protein; toll like receptor 9; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adenosine triphosphate; carrier protein; mitochondrial permeability transition pore; preservation solution; reactive oxygen metabolite; allograft; apoptosis; bioenergy; calcium transport; cell death; cell metabolism; cell migration; energy yield; enzyme activation; graft preservation; heart muscle blood flow; human; hypothermia; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial permeability; organ preservation; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein synthesis; reperfusion injury; Review; temperature; allograft; animal; calcium signaling; cardiac muscle; cold; cold ischemia; drug effects; energy metabolism; heart mitochondrion; heart transplantation; metabolism; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; pathology; procedures; time factor; tissue survival; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allografts; Animals; Calcium Signaling; Cold Ischemia; Cold Temperature; Energy Metabolism; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Mitochondria, Heart; Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Time Factors; Tissue Survival",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966650983

Moreover, the amount of CO2, which is trapped by capillary forces, depends on the wetting properties of the reservoir rock. In this work, contact angles of a water/shale system with CO2 were determined at high pressures and a constant temperature of 318 K and at a salinity of pure water and 1 M NaCl. To prevent neglecting the di-electrical and petrophysical properties of natural rocks, all experiments have been performed using natural shale surfaces without any chemical treatment. In addition, to describe the wetting properties of the shale at different temperatures, surface-free-energy analysis based on the modified equation of state (EOS) is used. The results show that the contact angle of a CO2/water/shale system increases with decreasing temperature.

This inevitably leads to an increased system cost and degraded energy efficiency. In this paper, a concept of active-filter integration for single-phase AC/DC converters is reported. The resultant converters can provide simultaneous functions of power factor correction, DC voltage regulation, and active power decoupling for mitigating the low-frequency DC voltage ripple, without an electrolytic capacitor and extra power switch. To complement the operation, two closed-loop voltage-ripple-based reference generation methods are developed for controlling the energy storage components to achieve active power decoupling. Both simulation and experiment have confirmed the eligibility of the proposed concept and control methods in a 210-W rectification system comprising an H-bridge converter with a half-bridge active filter. Interestingly, the end converters (Type I and Type II) can be readily available using a conventional H-bridge converter with minor hardware modification. A stable DC output with merely 1.1% ripple is realized with two 50-μF film capacitors. For the same ripple performance, a 900-μF capacitor is required in conventional converters without an active filter. Moreover, it is found out that the active-filter integration concept might even improve the efficiency performance of the end converters as compared with the original AC/DC converter without integration. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","active filter integration; capacitance reduction; Single-phase AC/DC converter","Bandpass filters; Bridge circuits; Capacitance; Capacitors; Electric rectifiers; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy efficiency; Power converters; Rectifying circuits; Voltage regulators; Ac/dc converters; Active power decoupling; Capacitance reduction; DC voltage regulation; Energy storage components; Hardware modifications; Power factor corrections; Reference Generation; Active filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962431692

Aqueous amine-based chemical absorption is the most mature technology for acid gases capture of gas streams. However, this process generates additional costs, mostly from the regeneration energy required to release the carbon dioxide from the solvent. Moreover, the deployment of this technology for CO2 capture from power sources causes amine degradation, equipment corrosion and generation of volatile degradation by-products. Therefore, an intensive work is demanded to screen solvents to overcome these challenges. Previous studies have demonstrated evidence that some relationships exist between the structure of amines and their capability for carbon dioxide absorption. In this work, quantum chemical based Quantitative Structure-Property/Activity Relationship (QSPR/QSAR) models were developed for prediction CO2 absorption and desorption capacities of some amines. The quantum chemical based descriptors were generated using COSMO-RS model. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used for the model development.

Active ac power balancing is often implemented to prevent the ac grid ripple power from injecting into the dc bus. A four-phase-leg sinusoidal pulsewidth-modulation (SPWM) converter can readily provide power factor correction and active ac power balancing. In this paper, the use of three-phase-leg SPWM converters for achieving these functions is analyzed. A family of bidirectional single-phase ac-dc three-phase-leg SPWM converters with an ac storage capacitor for use in a nanogrid system is designed with a general control structure and a modulation scheme for minimizing the ac storage capacitance. The general control structure is designed to achieve a decoupled system of a power-factor-correction converter cascaded with an active ac power load at the dc bus. The decoupled system is developed based on decomposition to differential-mode and common-mode voltages. The modulation method involves an extra zero-sequence voltage injection derived from the three-phase-leg SPWM voltages without introducing higher order harmonic distortions. A significant reduction of the ac storage capacitance and an improvement of converter efficiency are achieved. The design and analysis are verified by simulations and experimental measurements. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","AC storage capacitor; AC-DC bus converter; DC bus LED lighting; single-phase inverter; single-phase rectifier","Capacitance; Capacitors; Electric power factor correction; Electric rectifiers; Light emitting diodes; Modulation; Rectifying circuits; Bus converters; LED lighting; Single-phase inverters; Single-phase rectifiers; Storage capacitor; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962343970

The measurements are based on an induced magnetic field generated through the interaction between an external magnetic field and the microstructure under study. To validate this approach, the induced magnetic field values are compared with the values of the Charpy impact energy, and the sigma phase is assessed by optical microscopy. Moreover, surface fractures are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results from the 2205 duplex stainless steel used show that there is a direct relation among the impact energy, fracture mechanism and induced magnetic field. The method proved to be able to follow up the embrittlement of the DSS successfully.

The physical activation of chitosan chars with CO2 led to carbons with a very high nitrogen content (up to 5.4 wt%) and moderate surface areas (1000–1100 m2 g−1). Only chitosan-based activated carbons with a similar microporous structure were considered in this study to evaluate the effect of the nitrogen content and distribution on their electrochemical performance. The N-containing activated carbons were tested in two- and three-electrode supercapacitors using an aqueous electrolyte (1 M H2SO4), and they exhibited superior surface capacitance (19.5 µF cm−2) and pseudocapacitance compared to a commercial activated carbon with a negligible nitrogen content and similar microporosity. The low oxygen content and the presence of stable quaternary nitrogen improved the charge propagation on the chitosan-based carbons, which was confirmed by the high capacity retention of 83 %. The chitosan-based carbons exhibited excellent cyclic stability and maintained 100 % of their capacitance after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. These results demonstrate the suitability of chitosan-based carbons for application in energy storage systems.

The morphological characterization results obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the bentonite acted as good structural barrier for the organic PCMs homogenously dispersed onto its surface and interlayers. The chemical investigations made by using fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) technique revealed that the attractions between the components of the composites was physical in nature and thus the PCMs were hold by capillary forces. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that the prepared Bb-FSPCMs composites including 40 wt% CA, 43 wt% PEG600, 32 wt% DD and 18 wt% HD, respectively had suitable phase change temperature of 4-30°C and good latent heat capacity between 38 and 74 J/g, respectively for solar space heating and cooling applications of buildings envelopes depending on climatic conditions.

In the upper layer model, the maximum VPP operation income is taken as the optimization objective for building the scheduling model with the day-ahead prediction output of WPP and PV. In the lower layer model, the day-ahead scheduling scheme is revised with the actual output of the WPP and PV under the objectives of the minimum system net load and the minimum system operation cost. Finally, the independent micro-grid in a coastal island in eastern China is used for the simulation analysis. The results illustrate that the model can overcome the influence of uncertainty on VPP operations and reduce the system power shortage cost by connecting the day-ahead scheduling with the real-time scheduling. ROT could provide a flexible decision tool for decision makers, effectively addressing system uncertainties. ESSs could replace CGT to provide backup service for the WPP and PV, to smooth the VPP output curve and to improve the WPP and PV grid connection by its charging-discharging characteristics. Meanwhile, IBDR and PBDR could smooth the load curve to the maximum extent, link the generation side with the demand side to minimize abandoned power value and reach the optimum benefit of VPP operation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bi-level model; Demand response; Energy storage system; Uncertain; Virtual power plant","Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Gas turbines; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Site selection; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Bi-level models; Demand response; Energy storage systems; Uncertain; Virtual power plants; Stochastic models; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; energy planning; optimization; photovoltaic system; power plant; prediction; stochasticity; storage; turbine; uncertainty analysis; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961126984

However, this technique suffers from limitations such as large storage space and poor reliability. Combining seasonal storage with short-term storage might be a promising solution while it is not explored sufficiently. This paper presents a compound cold storage system that combines a heat pipe-based seasonal ice storage system with a chilled water storage system. The seasonal ice storage system automatically charges winter cold energy in the form of ice. In summer, the stored ice is extracted for cooling, and then the melting ice is used as a chilling medium for chilled water storage. Design optimization of the seasonal ice storage system and the compound storage system is addressed, including the sizes of heat pipes, the configuration and volume of the cold storage tank and the chiller capacity. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the design and the application of the proposed system in a real building in Beijing. Results show that the appropriate combination of the two types of cold storage can greatly improve the applicability of the seasonal cold storage and reduce the life-cycle cost of a building cooling system by 40%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Chilled water storage; Life-cycle assessment; Optimal design; Renewable energy; Seasonal thermal storage","Cold storage; Cooling; Cooling water; Design; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Chilled water; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Optimal design; Renewable energies; Thermal storage; Ice; building; cooling; design method; energy resource; life cycle analysis; optimization; pipe; renewable resource; seasonal variation; storage tank; water storage; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960357209

We develop a system dynamics model to analyse the impact of VRES on the investment decision process and to understand how SoS is affected. We focus on the Swiss electricity market, which is currently undergoing a liberalisation process, and simultaneously faces the encouragement of VRES and a nuclear phase out. Our results show that nuclear production is replaced mainly by PV and imports; the country becomes a net importer. This evolution points to a problem of capacity adequacy. The resulting price rise, together with the subsidies needed to support VRES, lead to a rise in tariffs. In the presence of a high share of hydro, the de-rated margin may give a misleading picture of the capacity adequacy. We thus propose a new metric, the annual energy margin, which considers the energy available from all sources, while acknowledging that hydro-storage can function as a battery.

The highest heat of phase transition and crystallinity were found for system modified with 0.3% of graphite nano-platelets in polyurethane without chain extender. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry results showed some changes in the phase transition behaviour and the crystallinity of the polyurethane matrix due to graphite nano-platelets confinement effect.

It is known that the arboreal vegetation in the Amazon basin is influenced by soil fertility and rainfall gradients, but would these gradients promote local differences in organic matter in headwater streams? To answer this question, 14 low-order streams were selected within these gradients along the Amazon basin, with extensions that varied between 4 and 8 km. The efficiency of the transformation of particulate into dissolved carbon fractions was assessed for each stream. The mean monthly benthic organic matter storage ranged between 1.58 and 9.40 t ha−1 month−1. In all locations, CPOC was the most abundant fraction in biomass, followed by FPOC and DOC. Rainfall and soil fertility influenced the distribution of the C fraction (p = 0.01), showing differentiated particulate organic carbon (POC) storage and DOC transportation along the basin. Furthermore, the results revealed that carbon quantification at the basin level could be underestimated, ultimately influencing the global carbon calculations for the region. This is especially due to the fact that the majority of studies consider only fine particulate organic matter and dissolved organic matter, which represent less than 50 % of the stored and transported carbon in streambeds. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Benthic organic matter; Coarse particulate organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; Fine particulate organic carbon; Global carbon cycle; Tropical streams","arboreal species; energy resource; headwater; organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; precipitation assessment; quantitative analysis; size distribution; soil fertility; transformation; Amazon Basin; carbon; humic substance; particulate matter; analysis; Brazil; chemistry; humic substance; particulate matter; Peru; river; South America; water quality; Brazil; Carbon; Humic Substances; Particulate Matter; Peru; Rivers; South America; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954319743

ESS is particularly preferred in enhancing low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability owing to its fast charging and efficiency for high power applications. In the present study, a supercapacitor type ESS is used in transient state analysis of a grid connected wind turbine. The ESS consisting of a supercapacitor and a voltage buck-boost converter circuit is mathematically modeled in the grid side converter circuit of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) used as a wind generator. Moreover, reduced order model (ROM) for the DFIG is used in simulating stator dynamics. All modeling study has been carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. Three phase faults and having static loads for a short period of time are considered as transient cases. The effectiveness of the ESS on LVRT are shown by observing the responses of several system parameters.

This is often explained in a stoichiometric framework of nutrient-based plant adaptations to herbivory. We hypothesize that such super-palatability can also arise as an evolutionary by-product of osmoregulatory adaptations of plants to stressful environmental conditions, as salinity, drought and cold. Here, we investigate in a coastal salt marsh why some plant species are highly preferred by migratory brent geese Branta bernicla bernicla in spring while others are avoided. This salt marsh is an important spring staging site for the geese. Sufficient energy storage in a short period is critical to enable their northward migration to Siberia and subsequent reproduction. We test if geese prefer plants that balance their internal osmotic potential with the saline environment through energy-rich soluble sugars over plant species that use (compartmentalized) salts for this. We find that plant nitrogen and acid detergent fiber content, classic predictors of herbivore preferences, poorly explain which plants the geese prefer. Instead, plant species that are highly preferred by the geese adapt to salinity by high soluble sugar concentrations while avoided species do this by high plant salt concentrations. Thus, the type of osmoregulatory adaptation to stress displayed by different plant species is a good predictor for the food preference of geese on this salt marsh. We suggest that variation in other types of osmoregulation-based stress adaptations, as plant cold adaptations in tundras and plant drought adaptations in savannas, have similar important consequences for trophic interactions. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.",,"adaptation; coastal zone; concentration (composition); environmental stress; food preference; migration; plant-herbivore interaction; salinity; saltmarsh; stoichiometry; trophic environment; trophic interaction; waterfowl; Siberia; Anser; Branta; Branta bernicla bernicla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950977191

Three important questions are addressed: (i) how much are households willing to pay to use only renewable energy? (ii) does willingness-to-pay (WTP) vary significantly across household groups and countries? and (iii) what drives the decision to enter the (hypothetical) market for green energy and, given entry, what drives the level of WTP? The analysis here differs from previous studies on green energy in two ways: first, data and analyses are comparable across countries and second, a comprehensive attempt is made to understand 0 WTP, and to accommodate—using a censored quantile regression (CQR) framework—unobserved heterogeneity. The survey data indicate a low WTP, at 11–12 % of current electric bill. This study also addresses a key question: how important is income for understanding WTP, relative to more “attitudinal” determinants? The effect of income overall appears ambiguous, with Tobit-like models indicating that income is not significant while the CQR indicates that income exerts a significant effect near the center of the distribution of WTP. Across all frameworks used, a key determinant of WTP appears to be environmental attitudes, particularly membership in an environmental organization. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Censoring; Green electricity; Quantile regression; Renewable energy; Willingness-to-pay","Digital storage; Surveys; Censoring; Green electricity; Quantile regression; Renewable energies; Willingness to pay; Energy policy; attitudinal survey; electricity; energy market; energy resource; household survey; OECD; price determination; public attitude; regression analysis; renewable resource; residential energy; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920531873

Hybridizing a CSP plant with a PV plant can increase the whole plant capacity factor by allowing thermal energy to be stored while the PV plant is in production and thus help to achieve a fully dispatchable solar electricity production system. A thermal and economic analysis of hybrid CSP+PV plants is conducted considering a range of plant capacities based on a parabolic trough plant with the addition of a PV plant for the environmental conditions of Crucero in Northern Chile, which is a hotspot for solar energy development in the country. The study considers a parametric analysis and optimization of the storage and power block sizes for the CSP plant in terms of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for varying PV plant nominal capacity. The annual production of the plants are calculated by using the Transient System Simulation program (TRNSYS), which uses a new component library developed for that purpose. The results show good agreement with other software packages as well as with actual data from currently operating CSP plants. The adopted approach helps the proper assessment of the integration of different technologies, since it uses the well-kwon modular structure of the TRNSYS. Regarding the potential for the hybrid solar-solar plants in the Atacama Desert, the high level of irradiation available in Chile can provide a competitive electricity cost, allowing to investors the access to PPA contracts with mining companies in northern Chile. Additionally, the optimization analysis shows that the northern regions of Chile present an outstanding potential for the deployment of such projects. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984586703

The configuration consists of a molten salt central receiver (MSCR) located atop an optimally located tower within a heliostat field with thousands of mirrors. The MSCR receives the concentrated energy from the heliostat field which heats a molten salt heat transfer fluid for thermal storage and utilization in producing steam as and when required for power generation. The MSCR heat transfer surface consists of banks of tangent tubes arranged in panels. The combined cost of the heliostat field and the receiver is 40%-50% of the total plant cost, which calls for optimization to maximize their utilization. Several previous studies have looked into the optimum solar power plant size based on various site conditions. However, the combined optimization of the receiver and the heliostat field has not been reported before. This study looks into the optimum configuration of the receiver for a given heliostat field. An in-house tool has been developed to select and rank a few receiver surface configurations (typically <50) from a list of hundreds of thousands of possible options. The operating limits which the heliostat field needs to obey are defined for the ranked surface configurations based on several different design considerations (e.g. mechanical integrity, corrosion limits). The thermal output of the receiver configurations for a given heliostat field is maximized. A combined rank indicating the optimum configurations in descending order of preference is presented based on the performance and various other practical considerations (e.g. total surface area, cost of material, ability of aiming strategies to distribute the flux). The methodology thus provided can be used as a guideline to arrive at an optimum receiver configuration for a given heliostat field. © 2016 Crown.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984562884

These systems eliminate the usage of heat transfer fluids allowing for the power block to be run at greater operating temperatures and therefore further increasing the thermal efficiency of the power cycle. On the other hand, the current state of the art of these systems does not comprise thermal energy storage as there are no currently available and techno-economically feasible storage integration options. This situation makes direct steam generation configurations even more susceptible to the already existing variability of operating conditions due to the fluctuation of the solar supply. In the interest of improving the annual performance and competitiveness of direct steam generation solar tower systems, the present study examines the influence of implementing two flexibility enhancing concepts which control the steam flow to the turbine as a function of the incoming solar irradiation. The proposed concepts were implemented in a reference plant model previously developed by the authors. Then, a multi-objective optimization was carried out in order to understand which configurations of the steam turbine concepts yield reductions of the levelized cost of electricity at a lower investment costs when compared to the reference model. Results show that the implementation of the proposed strategies can enhance the thermo-economic performance of direct steam generation systems by yielding a reduction of up to 9.2% on the levelized cost of electricity, mainly due to allowing 20% increase in the capacity factor, while increasing the investment costs by 7.8%. © 2016 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984538341

The main advantage of integrating energy conversion devices in a structural element is the reduction of costs compared to stand-alone devices. The construction could be used as a foundation, a mooring point and provide a dry environment for electrical devices. Easy access to the production site could also reduce the cost for installation, operation and maintenance. Two important challenges related to harvesting renewable energy by infrastructure elements, without concerning about the energy source, are to store it or feed the energy to the grid. In the second case, tailoring generation to demand is of critical importance. Tasks such as supply and demand management, for instance, peak hour management, what kind of storage should be used - electrical or thermal - need be solved. Furthermore, integrating energy production devices in a structure might cause negative environmental impacts and affect the life expectancy and maintenance costs of such structures. The potential environmental impacts associated with renewable technologies are the consequences for bird life or marine fauna at the fjord crossing locations, as well as noise and visual impact. Thus, a sustainability assessment should be performed in order to quantify the ecological, economical and societal impacts of the suggested alternatives. © ISTE Ltd 2016.

Predicting these properties based on rather simple thermodynamic grounds is of high importance for fundamental understanding, achieving the optimal performance of nanomaterials, as well as for the practical ability to manage battery systems. Here we report on the development of a new thermodynamic lattice gas model based on the equation of state of the energy carrier that is able to describe the impact of particle size on fundamental physical-chemical characteristics, such as the phase diagram and equilibrium potentials of energy storage materials that exhibit a first-order phase transition upon Li or H insertion. The model is based on the first-principles of chemical and statistical thermodynamics and takes into account complex structural changes taking place in energy storage materials and because of its general nature can be adapted to describe the influence of any state variable (particle size, temperature, etc.). The model is applied and validated using experimental data on different particle sizes of the LiFePO4 battery electrode material resulting in excellent agreement. The model can be used to simulate phase diagrams and predict equilibrium potential isotherms with respect to the electrode nanoparticle size.

We characterize the first solvation shell of vanadium cations in solution and estimate the free energy difference of all of the configurations. Our results suggest that chloride ions play an important role in stabilizing V(II), V(III), and V(V) species. In the specific case of V(V), we find that the most stable configuration exhibits a simultaneous complexation operated by chloride and sulfate ions, suggesting possible strategies to design novel agents to prevent the precipitation of the vanadium cation. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Chlorine compounds; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Electrolytes; Flow batteries; Free energy; Molecular dynamics; Positive ions; Solubility; Sulfur compounds; Ab initio molecular dynamics; All vanadium redox flow battery; Battery efficiencies; Crucial parameters; Electrical energy storage devices; Electrolyte solutions; Free-energy difference; Stable Configuration; Vanadium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971420394

These scenarios have been converted into power load time series with a 15 minute interval. Using these detailed load profiles various emergent energy management techniques, such as power storage and load control, have been assessed for their reducing the impact of peak loads. In the worst case scenario in 2030 only 6% of the total number of transformers is overloaded.

Especially for mobile applications, it is very important to store hydrogen in small spaces reversibly. Metal-organic framework (MOF) structured materials step forward with the ability of reversible hydrogen storage which meet the storage targets. The MOF structured compounds were synthesized using Cu(II) and Zn(II) metals, trimesic acid (benzene 1,3,5 tricarboxylic acid) (TMA) and 1,10 phenantroline (Phen) building blocks. The compounds were activated thermally at 398 K for 4 days under a vacuum for sorption experiments. Then, DTA/TGA, FT-IR, powder-XRD, BET surface area and elemental analysis techniques were used to determine the molecular structures of the synthesized compound. Finally, the hydrogen storage properties were measured at 77 K and 1 bar of hydrogen pressure. In addition to experimental investigations, hydrogen adsorption characteristics and performances of the compounds were also determined with the molecular simulation calculations. It is found that the Cu(II) and Zn(II) compounds could uptake 2.652 wt. % (sim. 2.434 wt. %) and 1.383 wt. % (1.187 wt. %) respectively, at 77 K and 1 bar pressure. Consequently, hydrogen adsorption mechanism and capacities of the compounds clarified. And it is found out that the compounds have good storage performance in comparison to the previously reported MOFs. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","Hydrogen storage; MOFs; Molecular simulation","Copper; Crystalline materials; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Java programming language; Molecular structure; Organometallics; Storage (materials); Zinc; Zinc compounds; Experimental investigations; Hydrogen energy systems; Hydrogen storage properties; Metal organic framework; MOFs; Molecular simulations; Structural characterization; Structured materials; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971601526

The primary motivation for combining sensible and latent heat storage is to reduce the drop in outflow temperature during discharging that can be observed for sensible heat storage. An unsteady one-dimensional heat-transfer model was verified using exact solutions and validated with experimental data from a 42 kWhth laboratory-scale combined storage. Simulations were then used to compare the performance of 23 MWhth and 1000 MWhth industrial-scale combined and sensible storages. The simulations showed that the combined storage can reduce the material costs for a given maximum outflow temperature drop during discharging.

We report here a systematic investigation of ion exchange in Ti3C2 MXene and its hydration/dehydration behavior. We have investigated the effects of the presence of LiCl during the chemical etching of the MAX phase Ti3AlC2 into MXene Ti3C2Tx (T stands for surface termination) and found that the resulting MXene has Li+ cations in the interlayer space. We successfully exchanged the Li+ cations with K+, Na+, Rb+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (supported by X-ray photoelectron and energy-dispersive spectroscopy) and found that the exchanged material expands on the unit-cell level in response to changes in humidity, with the nature of expansion dependent on the intercalated cation, similar to behavior of clay minerals; stepwise expansions of the basal spacing were observed, with changes consistent with the size of the H2O molecule. Thermogravimetric analysis of the dehydration behavior of these materials shows that the amounts of H2O contained at ambient humidity correlates simply with the hydration enthalpy of the intercalated cation, and that the diffusion of the exiting H2O proceeds with kinetics similar to clays. These results have implications for understanding, controlling, and exploiting structural changes and H2O sorption in MXene films and powders utilized in applications involving ions, such as electrochemical capacitors, sensors, reverse osmosis membranes, or contaminant sorbents. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Aluminum compounds; Carbides; Chlorine compounds; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hydration; Intercalation; Lithium compounds; Osmosis membranes; Positive ions; Reverse osmosis; Thermogravimetric analysis; Titanium compounds; Transition metals; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical energy storage; Hydration enthalpy; Hydration/dehydration; Interlayer spaces; Surface termination; Transition metal carbide; X-ray photoelectrons; Ion exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973165801

Among the different types of thermal energy storage, phase-change materials (PCM) thermal energy storage has gained significant attention recently because of its high energy density per unit mass/volume at nearly constant temperature. This study experimentally investigates the using of a triplex tube heat exchanger (TTHX) with PCM in the middle tube as the thermal energy storage to power a liquid desiccant air-conditioning system. Four longitudinal fins were welded to each of the inner and middle tubes as a heat transfer enhancement in the TTHX to improve the thermal performance of the thermal energy storage. The average temperature of the PCM during the melting process in the TTHX with and without fins was compared. The PCM temperature gradients in the angular direction were analyzed to study the effect of the natural convection in the melting process of the thermal storage. The energy storage efficiency of the TTHX was determined. Results indicated that there was a considerable enhancement in the melting rate by using fins in the TTHX thermal storage. The PCM melting time is reduced to 86% by increasing of the inlet heat transfer fluid. The average heat storage efficiency calculated from experimental data for all the PCMs is 71.8%, meaning that 28.2% of the heat actually was lost.

The results are used for the simulation of mass transport, and charge transfer processes at different active material loadings in various power sources, such as batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors. A general pore-scale model is developed by mimicking the layer fabrication process. Electrode structures are virtually generated taking into account the interaction between the deposited particles during layer formation and surface relaxation. The effective transport and kinetic coefficients of the layers are calculated by different homogenization approaches and used in macro homogeneous models to predict macroscopic behaviour of fuel cells, supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. The model predictions are compared with experimental kinetic and transport coefficients of fuel cells and supercapacitors and a good agreement was found. The results imply that porosity, tortuosity and specific surface area may follow a power law scaling with increasing deposited mass as a consequence of agglomeration during layer deposition. Consequently, effective transport and kinetic coefficients depend on the active material loading of the electrode. © 2016 The Authors.

However, little is known about how metabolic fluxes are coordinated with the cell division cycle. Here, we examine budding yeast to show that more than half of all measured metabolites change significantly through the cell division cycle. Cell cycle-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism are controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1), a major cell cycle regulator, and the metabolic regulator protein kinase A. At the G1/S transition, Cdk1 phosphorylates and activates the enzyme Nth1, which funnels the storage carbohydrate trehalose into central carbon metabolism. Trehalose utilization fuels anabolic processes required to reliably complete cell division. Thus, the cell cycle entrains carbon metabolism to fuel biosynthesis. Because the oscillation of Cdk activity is a conserved feature of the eukaryotic cell cycle, we anticipate its frequent use in dynamically regulating metabolism for efficient proliferation. Ewald et al. discovered that cell cycle progression triggers global changes in the yeast metabolome and identified one underlying mechanism. At the G1/S transition, Cdk1 phosphorylates and activates the trehalase Nth1 to funnel trehalose into glycolysis. Trehalose utilization supports cell cycle progression in poor nutrient environments. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"cyclin dependent kinase; trehalose; carbon; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 1; fungal DNA; NTH1 protein, S cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; trehalase; trehalose; Article; carbon metabolism; cell cycle progression; cell division; cell proliferation; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; oscillation; protein phosphorylation; yeast; biosynthesis; cell cycle; cell proliferation; DNA replication; energy metabolism; enzymology; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phosphorylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; time factor; Carbon; CDC2 Protein Kinase; CDC28 Protein Kinase, S cerevisiae; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; DNA Replication; DNA, Fungal; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Activation; G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Phosphorylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Trehalase; Trehalose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969264845

The considered smart grid is equipped with an energy storage device. The privacy leakage is modeled as optimal Bayesian detections on the behaviors of the consumer made by an authorized adversary. To evaluate the privacy risk, a Bayesian detection-operational privacy leakage metric is proposed. The design of an optimal privacy-preserving energy control strategy can be formulated as a belief state MDP problem. Therefore, standard methods and algorithms can be utilized to obtain or to approximate the optimal control strategy. A simplified problem to design an instantaneous optimal privacy-preserving control strategy is also considered.

The properties of these fillers and of composites obtained from them with phenolic resin were compared with those of systems with lignin or silica alone. The chemical structure of the materials was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Surface properties of lignin-SiO2 fillers were tested using inverse gas chromatography (IGC). IGC was used for determination of surface energy and surface heterogeneity of the studied fillers. IGC made it possible to assess the adhesion between the tested fillers and phenolic resins. Interactions of functional fillers with phenolic resins were also evaluated by IGC. The results indicated that lignin-SiO2 interacted strongly with the phenolic resin, more strongly than pure lignin. This was proved by SEM observations: thanks to the stronger interactions of lignin-SiO2 hybrid with phenolic resins, a more homogeneous composite was obtained. Thermo-mechanical properties of lignin-silica and resin systems were investigated by DMTA. DMTA results showed that phenolic binders with lignin-SiO2 fillers have better thermo-mechanical properties than systems with lignin or silica alone: higher glass transition temperature and a smaller decrease in storage modulus. Lignin fillers can thus provide new, promising properties for a phenolic binder combining the good properties of lignin as a plasticizer and of silica as a filler improving mechanical properties. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Lignin; Lignin silica hybrids; Phenolic binders; Thermomechanical and surface properties","Binders; Bins; Chromatography; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Glass transition; Lignin; Mechanical properties; Phenolic resins; Resins; Silica; Surface properties; Synthetic resins; Functional fillers; Inverse gas chromatography; Phenolic binders; SEM observation; Silica hybrids; Surface heterogeneities; Thermo-mechanical; Thermomechanical properties; Fillers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959569623

Net annual profits were positive for all biofuel cases for an annuity factor of 0.1 in the year 2030; however, the results are sensitive to biofuel selling prices and CO2,eq charge. Additionally, GHG emissions from grid electricity are highly influential on the results since all biofuel processes require external power. Credits for stored CO2 might be necessary for processes to be competitive, i.e. storage of separated CO2 from the syngas conditioning has an important role to play.

In this study, a novel cement composite incorporated with flaky graphite-doped microencapsulated phase-change materials (FGD-MPCMs) was developed. Various techniques, such as field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to analyse the composite structure and thermal performances. The results indicate that the spherical microcapsules are well dispersed in the cement matrix. When combined within the cement, the thermal stability of the microcapsules was highly improved, and the inclusion of greater amounts of FGD-MPCMs further increased the latent heat of the composite. The mechanical properties of the cement composites were affected with the increase of FGD-MPCMs dosage and the porosity of the composites. In spite of this, the compressive strength and flexural strength of the cement composite with 30% FGD-MPCM could still reach to as high as 14.2 MPa and 4.1 MPa, respectively. Results from the infrared thermography and the model room test suggested that the composite filled with FGD-MPCMs is capable of reducing indoor temperature fluctuation and exhibits good potential for application in buildings to enhance energy savings and thermal comfort. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cement composite; Energy storage; Microencapsulated phase-change materials; Thermal stability","Cements; Composite materials; Compressive strength; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enamels; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Field emission microscopes; Heat storage; Mechanical properties; Microencapsulation; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste vitrification; Scanning electron microscopy; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Building energy consumption; Cement composite; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Flaky graphite; Indoor temperature; Microencapsulated phase change material; Thermal and mechanical properties; Thermal Performance; Phase change materials; calorimetry; cement; composite; compressive strength; energy budget; mechanical property; phase equilibrium; porosity; scanning electron microscopy; thermal power; thermogravimetry; X-ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959332490

Different synthesis and delamination routes result in different flake morphologies. The resistivity of free-standing Mo2CT x films increases by an order of magnitude as the temperature is reduced from 300 to 10 K, suggesting semiconductor-like behavior of this MXene, in contrast to Ti3C2T x which exhibits metallic behavior. At 10 K, the magnetoresistance is positive. Additionally, changes in electronic transport are observed upon annealing of the films. When 2 μm thick films are tested as electrodes in supercapacitors, capacitances as high as 700 F cm-3 in a 1 m sulfuric acid electrolyte and high capacity retention for at least 10,000 cycles at 10 A g-1 are obtained. Free-standing Mo2CT x films, with ≈8 wt% carbon nanotubes, perform well when tested as an electrode material for Li-ions, especially at high rates.

Frozen core terms are also included. When applied to a set of alkanes, the DF-CCSD analytic gradients are significantly accelerated compared to conventional CCSD for larger molecules. The efficiency of our DF-CCSD algorithm arises from the acceleration of several different terms, which are designated as the ""gradient terms"": computation of particle density matrices (PDMs), generalized Fock-matrix (GFM), solution of the Z-vector equation, formation of the relaxed PDMs and GFM, back-transformation of PDMs and GFM to the atomic orbital (AO) basis, and evaluation of gradients in the AO basis. For the largest member of the alkane set (C10H22), the computational times for the gradient terms (with the cc-pVTZ basis set) are 2582.6 (CCSD) and 310.7 (DF-CCSD) min, respectively, a speed up of more than 8-folds. For gradient related terms, the DF approach avoids the usage of four-index electron repulsion integrals. Based on our previous study [U. Bozkaya, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 124108 (2014)], our formalism completely avoids construction or storage of the 4-index two-particle density matrix (TPDM), using instead 2- and 3-index TPDMs. The DF approach introduces negligible errors for equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Cluster analysis; Computational efficiency; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Paraffins; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Computational time; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles; Density fitting approximations; Efficient implementation; Electron repulsion integrals; Equilibrium bond length; Harmonic vibrational frequencies; Particle densities; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968764338

Attention was paid primarily to revealing the influence of fin height on melting heat transfer and TES performance of the PCM system. Visualized experiments were performed to observe the liquid-solid interface evolutions during melting, and to validate the numerical simulations that were conducted based on the enthalpy method. By means of measuring the instantaneous volume expansion upon melting, an indirect experimental method was proposed and implemented to acquire quantitatively the variations of melt fraction and heat transfer rate. Good consistency was observed between the experimental and numerical results. A combination of the two was able to offer an in-depth understanding on the fin effects by providing detailed knowledge on the interface evolutions and natural convective flow and heat transfer as well. It was shown that the TES performance is enhanced with increasing the fin height, and that the melting duration time is shortened up to nearly 30% at the highest fin height studied. The enhancement was attributed to the combined positive effects due to the presence of the fin, which are enhanced heat conduction by the extended heat transfer area and local natural convection induced in the vicinity of the fin. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Myristic acid/palmitic acid/sodium palmitate (MA/PA/SP) and myristic acid/palmitic acid/sodium stearate (MA/PA/SS) were used as base eutectic PCMs and Shorea javanica (SJ) was used as a porous material to improve the thermal conductivity and thermal performance of CPCM. Thermal properties, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of prepared CPCMs were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermal analysis, thermal conductivity analysis, and simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA). Furthermore, a chemical compatibility analysis has been done using Fourier transform infra-red spectrophotometer (FT-IR) and a fabricated test rig was used to determine thermal performance. It was seen that CPCMs with addition of 3 wt.% SJ presented a good improvement on thermal conductivity without any significant effect on thermal properties. No chemical reaction between initial eutectic fatty acids and SJ occurred as evidenced by FT-IR and CPCMs show a good thermal stability as well. Therefore, it is concluded that addition of Shorea javanica (SJ) into fatty acid eutectic CPCMs is appropriate to improve the thermal performance of CPCM and it can be acceptable for use as porous material for other PCMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently the security-focused debate about planned nuclear power plants still continues. The objective of this thesis is to prevent the radiation spread from nuclear reactors into the environment. In order to do this, we produced higher performanced of new shielding materials which are high radiation holders in reactors operation. Some additives used in new shielding materials; some of iron (Fe), rhenium (Re), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), boron (B), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), boron carbide (B4C). The results of this experiments indicated that these materials are good shields against gamma and neutrons. The powder metallurgy technique was used to produce new shielding materials. CERN - FLUKA Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation code and WinXCom were used for determination of the percentages of high temperature resistant and high-level fast neutron and gamma shielding materials participated components. Super alloys was produced and then the experimental fast neutron dose equivalent measurements and gamma radiation absorpsion of the new shielding materials were carried out. The produced products to be used safely reactors not only in nuclear medicine, in the treatment room, for the storage of nuclear waste, nuclear research laboratories, against cosmic radiation in space vehicles and has the qualities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Automobile manufacture; Boron carbide; Cosmology; Fossil fuels; Intelligent systems; Neutron irradiation; Neutrons; Nickel; Nuclear medicine; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Powder metallurgy; Radiation shielding; Radioactive wastes; Reactor shielding; Research laboratories; Shielding; Solid wastes; Tantalum carbide; Tungsten carbide; Waste treatment; Fast neutrons; Gamma shielding; High-temperature resistant; Powder metallurgy techniques; Rheniums (Re); Shielding materials; Space vehicles; Tantalum (Ta); Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977264404

In other words, the heat storage performance changes depending on the heating positions. In this study, the effects of the heating surface position and reinforcement of the open-cell metal foam on the phase change material melting fraction were experimentally investigated. For this purpose, a small-scale rectangular cube was made of plexiglass having a volume of 274 cm3. One of the surfaces of the cube was heated with a constant heat flux, whereas other surfaces were isolated from the room temperature in the environment. Three different constant heat fluxes were applied on the bottom, top, and side surfaces of the cube in the experiments. Paraffin (n-heptacosane), with a phase change point at 59°C-61°C and as phase change material with a rapid heat charge/discharge, was used in the thermal energy storage system. Depending on the heating position and surface heat flux, it was observed that the effect of natural convection significantly increased within the liquid phase change material. Additionally, the results indicate that the presence of metal foams can enhance the heat transfer rate of phase change materials. According to the sensitivity analysis, the effect of independent parameters on the melting ratio of the phase change material was listed in order of importance as time, surface heat flux, heating position, and metallic foam. 2016 © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","heating position; open-cell foam; phase change material","Geometry; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heating; Melting; Metal foams; Metals; Sensitivity analysis; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Constant heat flux; Heat transfer rate; Independent parameters; Open-cell foams; Open-cell metal foams; Storage performance; Surface heat fluxes; Thermal energy storage systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958742995

The textural and chemical properties of the materials were correlated with the electrochemical behaviour. The prepared E. grandis wood based biocarbon materials, have good qualities for use as PtSn catalyst support for DEFCs, and in supercapacitor electrode application. The micropore size and the content of oxygenated functional group have direct incidence on the distribution of the catalyst particles on the aBCs support surface. In consequently, the electrocatalytic behaviour of the PtSn/aBC is affected. The content of oxygenated functional groups also has a marked effect on the supercapacitors electrode behaviour. It was demonstrated that these functional groups are actively involved in the energy storage by the pseudocapacitive phenomenon.

In practice, the drying of fruits and vegetables increases product shelf-life and reduces the bulk and weight of the product, thus simplifying transport. Occasionally, drying may lead to a great decrease in the volume of the product, leading to a decrease in storage space requirements. Studies have shown that dependence purely on experimental drying practices, without mathematical considerations of the drying kinetics, can significantly affect the efficiency of dryers, increase the cost of production, and reduce the quality of the dried product. Thus, the use of mathematical models in estimating the drying kinetics, the behavior, and the energy needed in the drying of agricultural and food products becomes indispensable. This paper presents a comprehensive review of modeling thin-layer drying of fruits and vegetables with particular focus on thin-layer theories, models, and applications since the year 2005. The thin-layer drying behavior of fruits and vegetables is also highlighted. The most frequently used of the newly developed mathematical models for thin-layer drying of fruits and vegetables in the last 10 years are shown. Subsequently, the equations and various conditions used in the estimation of the effective moisture diffusivity, shrinkage effects, and minimum energy requirement are displayed. The authors hope that this review will be of use for future research in terms of modeling, analysis, design, and the optimization of the drying process of fruits and vegetables. © 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®.","Diffusion; Drying kinetics; Fruits and vegetables; Mathematical modeling; Thin-layer drying","Diffusion; Estimation; Food products; Fruits; Kinetics; Mathematical models; Plants (botany); Thermal processing (foods); Vegetables; Complex operations; Cost of productions; Drying kinetic; Effective moisture diffusivity; Fruits and vegetables; Product shelf life; Shrinkage effects; Thin layer drying; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032068967

In addition to sites with above-average potential for wind and solar power, the ""water towers"" of Europe provide flexible, low-carbon power generation as well as energy storage. In the future, hydropower systems are expected to become more than mere electricity generators, serving a key role as flexible complements to intermittent power generators and as providers of large-scale seasonal and daily energy storage. Energy transition on national and European scales can be facilitated by expanding the capacity of pumped storage hydropower (PSHP) plants. Yet the extension of hydropower production, in particular PSHP, remains controversial, primarily due to environmental concerns. Focusing on 2 Alpine countries, Austria and Switzerland, this paper provides a system view of hydropower production and energy storage in the Alps. It discusses advantages and drawbacks of various assessment tools and identifies gaps and needs for the integrated assessment of PSHP plants. It concludes that instruments that evaluate the impacts and sustainability of PSHP projects need to be developed, elaborated, and applied in a participatory manner, in order to promote public dialogue, increase social acceptance, and, ideally, encourage energy consumers to become advocates of a sustainable energy future. © 2016 Björnsen Gurung et al.","Alps; Austria; energy transition; environmental impacts; pumped storage hydropower; sustainability assessment; Switzerland","assessment method; electricity generation; energy balance; energy use; environmental impact; instrumentation; small scale hydropower; solar power; sustainability; wind power; Alps; Austria; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974559740

The aim of developing the MSRF analysis framework is twofold; deep understanding of the EAF characteristics, and fast and accurate generation of reference signals to the controllers of the advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters (APFs), synchronous static compensators (STATCOMs), and energy storage systems (ESS), which may successfully compensate interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker. Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics by MSRF analysis utilizes continuously measured line currents and line voltages on the medium-voltage side of the EAF transformer at a sampling rate of 25.6-kHz per data channel. It has been shown by offline computations that compensation of the sequence components of interharmonics and harmonics of the EAF currents obtained by the proposed framework, reduces the short-term flicker values at the point of common coupling by up to 10-fold. The proposed MSRF analysis framework has been successfully verified by comparing the frequency spectrums of the EAF currents with Fourier analysis results based on one-cycle sliding windows of 10-cycle duration. © 2016 IEEE.","Electric arc furnace (EAF); harmonics; interharmonics; multiple synchronous reference frame (MSRF); power quality (PQ)","Digital storage; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Fourier analysis; Furnaces; Harmonic analysis; Particulate emissions; Alternating current electric arc furnaces; Asymmetrical three phase; Electric arc furnace; harmonics; Inter-harmonics; Negative sequence components; Point of common coupling; Synchronous reference frame; Electric furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973375156

We herein report two cases of sporadic LD associated with the solar energy-heated hot water systems of the patients’ houses. Case Report: A 60-year-old woman with chronic bronchitis and diabetes mellitus presented with a high fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed rales, and her chest radiograph showed a homogeneous density in the left lung. The Legionella urinary antigen test was positive, and an indirect fluorescent antibody test revealed a serum antibody titer of 1/520 for L. pneumophila serogroup 1. In the second case, a 66-year-old man with diabetes mellitus was treated for pneumonia at another hospital. After the patient’s general condition worsened and he required mechanical ventilation, he was referred to our hospital. The Legionella urinary antigen test was positive. Neither of the patients had been hospitalized or travelled within the previous month. Both patients used hot water storage tanks heated by solar energy; both also used an electrical device in the bathroom to heat the water when solar energy alone was insufficient.

This paper presents an optimal power sharing and power control strategy combining a photovoltaic (PV) array, a fuel cell (FC) stack, an ultra-capacitor (UC) module, and a set of loads. The photovoltaic is the prior energy source while the fuel cell (FC) system is added as a backup source to meet the excess power demand. The ultra-capacitor (UC) is utilized as a buffer storage to compensate the slow dynamic response of the FC during transient and regulate the DC-bus voltage. The power control strategy is designed to work on a two-level arrangement. The top level controls the entire power management, which generates references to low level individual subsystems depending upon solar radiation, temperature, and load conditions. Based on the command signals, each local controller controls the PV, FC, electrolyzer, and UC. The top level also controls the load scheduling during low solar radiation in order to sustain the system operation for 24 h. The performance of the system is tested under real-world record of solar radiation, temperature, and load conditions for Bahria town at Islamabad, Pakistan. The effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of voltage regulation, power transfer, load tracking, and grid stability is verified by Matlab simulation results. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Buffer storage; Capacitors; Fuel cells; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Voltage regulators; Hybrid power systems; Islamabad , Pakistan; Local controllers; Matlab simulations; Photovoltaic arrays; Power control strategies; Renewable energy source; System operation; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969750008

However, the limited and intermittent solar energy supply seriously affects deadline miss rate (DMR) of tasks. Furthermore, traditional solar-powered sensor nodes also suffer from energy loss of battery charging and voltage conversion. Recently, a storage-less and converter-less power supply architecture has been proposed to achieve higher energy efficiency by removing the leaky energy storage and dc voltage conversion. Without energy storages, a node using inter-task scheduling is more sensitive to solar variations, which results in high DMRs. This paper proposes an intra-task scheduling scheme for the storage-less and converter-less solar-powered sensor nodes, whose features include power prediction based on classified solar profiles, a trigger mechanism to select scheduling points, an artificial neural network to calculate task priorities and a fine-grained task selection algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces DMR by up to 30% and improves energy utilization efficiency by 20% with trivial energy overheads. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Deadline Miss Rate; Energy Utilization Efficiency; Intra-task Scheduling; Storage-less and Converter-less Nonvolatile Sensor Nodes","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Multitasking; Neural networks; Nonvolatile storage; Scheduling algorithms; Secondary batteries; Sensor nodes; Solar energy; Energy overheads; Energy utilization efficiency; Miss-rate; Nonvolatile sensor nodes; Power predictions; Task-scheduling; Trigger mechanism; Voltage conversion; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968586309

The first step in overcoming the challenge for a sustainable future is to use energy more efficiently so that the demand for fossil fuels can be reduced drastically. The second step is a transition from the use of fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. In this sense, organic electrode materials are becoming increasingly attractive compared to inorganic electrode materials which have reached a plateau regarding performance and have severe drawbacks in terms of cost, safety and environmental friendliness. Using organic composites based on conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole, and abundant, cheap and naturally occurring biopolymers rich in quinones, such as lignin, has recently emerged as an interesting alternative. These materials, which exhibit electronic and ionic conductivity, provide challenging opportunities in the development of new charge storage materials.

The raw material and the energy required to dry it are the main production costs. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize energy consumption, production costs, and the environmental impact associated with wood pellets. However, these changes should not negatively affect the quality of the pellets. One way to achieve these goals is to use additives. This work investigates how different types of sugar additives affect both the energy needed by the pellet press and the durability and oxidation of the produced pellets. When sugar was used as an additive, the energy use was practically unaffected. When molasses and SSL were added, a small decrease in energy use was observed (6 to 8%) for admixtures up to 1 wt.%; however, when more molasses was added, the energy use increased. Using these additives increased the bulk density (7 to 15 %) and durability (10 to 20 %) of the pellets. The storage of the pellets also caused a small increase in durability (1 to 3 %). Volatile organic compounds were produced as oxidation peaks within the first two months of storage; thereafter, the peaks tapered off.","Additives; Durability; Energy efficiency; Molasses; Spent sulphite liquor; Storage; White sugar; Wood fuel pellet","Additives; Durability; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fuel storage; Fuels; Molasses; Storage (materials); Volatile organic compounds; Wood; Wood fuels; Bulk density; Global production; Oxidation peak; Pellet quality; Production cost; Spent sulphite liquors; White sugar; Wood pellet; Pelletizing; Additives; Costs; Durability; Production; Sugar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965142923

In this work, novel three-dimensional (3D) starfish-like Co3O4 nanowire bundles on nickel foam (Co3O4-oNF) were successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The phase/micro structure and morphology of the sample were identified by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively, and demonstrated a unique 1D–3D combined mesoporous nanostructure. Cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and impedance measurements were employed to characterize the electrochemical performance of the specimen in 3.0 M KOH solution, and show that the Co3O4-oNF not only has a superior specific capacitance of 1399.28 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 but also exhibits reliable capacitance retention of 92.26 % after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 12.5 A g−1. The Nyquist plot reveals that the internal resistance of the specimen is merely 0.9 Ω, indicating that the starfish-like Co3O4 has a solid mechanical bonding with the nickel substrate.

These switches produce either a voltage inversion on the piezoelements for damping or energy extraction purposes, or oscillating discharges between the piezoelements and the storage capacitances for energy transfer. This new method has an improvement in the modal damping technology SSDI-Max.

During the joint selection and successful implementation of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology with iron-making emerging technology in order to allow the continuous use of fossil fuel as a reliable source of energy on demand, decision-makers (DMs) face different uncertainties and barriers as trade-off conditions in a real world environment. This study aims to quantitatively prioritize and analyze the interactions between the complex factors and dimensions in respect of CCS implementation in the iron and steel industry. In addition, research evaluates the CCS systems with twenty-five influential success factors in terms of four prominent aspects of sustainability, namely, engineering, economic, environmental and social. To carry out the research, this study utilizes the modified 2-tuple DEMATEL technique, a Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool and the Delphi method by proposing a favorable framework to determine the cause-and-effect relationships among these criteria. The results show that the criteria of energy for capture and storage, and CO2 removal efficiency are the top two significant influencing factors in selecting CO2 capture technology with breakthrough iron-making technologies. In addition, an intelligent network relationship map among the dimensions and the overall DEMATEL prominence-effect relationship diagram between the cause group and effect group of criteria have been illustrated clearly.

However, the practical use of Li-S batteries is hindered by poor cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency, which are induced by shuttle effect. Modifying the properties of a separator is an effective way to inhibit the shuttle effect. However, only physical interactions of common carbon materials are not enough to confine lithium polysulfides. In this paper, a porous carbon nanowire (N-PCNW) is designed to modify the separator. The N-PCNW with high N-doped level (7.12 wt%) not only possesses excellent electron conductivity, but also traps the soluble polysulfides effectively with both physical and chemical interactions.

In the autumn, the intestinal mass (Mi) was 1.0% of body mass and the scaling exponent b = 0.92 indicated that Mi was larger in smaller neonates. During arousal from dormancy Mi was 23% smaller; later in spring, Mi increased 60% in relation to the autumn and the exponent b = 0.14 indicated that the recovery was disproportionate in smaller tegus. During the autumn, the intestinal villi were greatly elongated; by midwinter, the Hv, SvEp, and VvEp were smaller than during the autumn (59%, 54%, 29%) and were restored to autumn levels during spring. In the active tegus, the maximum activity (Vmax) of enzymes indicated that the enterocytes can obtain energy from different sources, and possess gluconeogenic capacity. During winter, the Vmax of CS, HOAD, GDH, PEPCK was 40-50% lower in relation to the autumn and spring, while the Vmax of HK, PK, LDH, AST was unchanged. The hypoglycemia and the mucosal atrophy/ischemia during winter would prevent the enterocytes from using glucose, whereas they could slowly oxidize fatty acids released from body stores and amino acids from the tissue proteolysis to satisfy their needs of energy. Contrastingly, starvation during spring caused severe mass loss (50%); the tissue protein and the VvEp and VvLP did not change while the thickness of the muscular layer increased 51%, which suggested different effects along the length of the organ. In addition, the Vmax of the glycolytic enzymes was lower, indicating that a regulatory mechanism would spare blood glucose for vital organs during unanticipated food restriction. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Fasting; Hibernation; Hypometabolism; Intestine; Metabolic enzymes; Scaling; Seasonal dormancy; Starvation; Tegu lizard; Tupinambis merianae","3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; amino acid; citrate synthase; hexokinase; lactate dehydrogenase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); pyruvate kinase; animal tissue; arousal; Article; atrophy; autumn; body mass; circannual rhythm; controlled study; energy; enzyme activity; hibernation; histology; hypoglycemia; intestine cell; ischemia; lizard; maximum reaction velocity; morphometrics; nonhuman; protein content; protein degradation; small intestine; spring; starvation; Tupinambis merianae; water content; winter dormancy; animal; body weight; diet restriction; growth, development and aging; lizard; metabolism; physiology; season; small intestine; Animals; Body Weight; Fasting; Hibernation; Intestine, Small; Lizards; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959234000

To understand why public support is lacking, it is crucial to establish what citizens think about the arguments that are used by proponents and opponents of CCS. We determined the persuasiveness, importance and novelty of 32 arguments for and against CCS using a discrete choice experiment in which respondents made consecutive choices between pairs of pro or con arguments. We used latent class models to identify population segments with different preferences. The results show that citizens find arguments about climate protection, which is the primary goal of CCS, less persuasive than other arguments, such as normative arguments (for example 'a waste product such as CO2 should be disposed of properly') or arguments about benefits of CCS for energy production and economic growth.

Understanding the molecular basis of cell wall metabolism in sugarcane may allow for rational changes in fiber quality and content when designing new energy crops. This work describes a comparative expression profiling of sugarcane ancestral genotypes: S. officinarum, S. spontaneum and S. robustum and a commercial hybrid: RB867515, linking gene expression to phenotypes to identify genes for sugarcane improvement. Oligoarray experiments of leaves, immature and intermediate internodes, detected 12,621 sense and 995 antisense transcripts. Amino acid metabolism was particularly evident among pathways showing natural antisense transcripts expression. For all tissues sampled, expression analysis revealed 831, 674 and 648 differentially expressed genes in S. officinarum, S. robustum and S. spontaneum, respectively, using RB867515 as reference. Expression of sugar transporters might explain sucrose differences among genotypes, but an unexpected differential expression of histones were also identified between high and low Brix° genotypes. Lignin biosynthetic genes and bioenergetics-related genes were up-regulated in the high lignin genotype, suggesting that these genes are important for S. spontaneum to allocate carbon to lignin, while S. officinarum allocates it to sucrose storage. Co-expression network analysis identified 18 transcription factors possibly related to cell wall biosynthesis while in silico analysis detected cis-elements involved in cell wall biosynthesis in their promoters. Our results provide information to elucidate regulatory networks underlying traits of interest that will allow the improvement of sugarcane for biofuel and chemicals production. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cell wall; Co-expression network; Expression profiling; Lignin; Sugarcane; Transcription factors","amino acid; carbon; lignan; nitrogen; plant protein; transcription factor; transcriptome; cell wall; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; promoter region; protein microarray; sugarcane; Amino Acids; Carbon; Cell Wall; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genotype; Lignans; Nitrogen; Phenotype; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Array Analysis; Saccharum; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955585650

The form-stable composites were prepared by absorbing paraffin into the network of powder-like styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene (SEBS) triblock copolymer and covering high-density polyethylene (HDPE) on pre-prepared SEBS/paraffin mixture. The composites were characterized by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Hot disk. Paraffin leakage was investigated by accelerated degradation test at 80 °C. The melting temperature and latent heat of the composites were determined as 50.56 °C and 151.6 J/g, respectively. FT-IR results revealed good chemical compatibility among paraffin, SEBS and HDPE. SEM images and XRD test results demonstrated that the paraffin had uniformly dispersed into SEBS. This composite was testified able to keep paraffin from seepage with only 2.39 wt% of paraffin loss after 50 thermal cycles test (150 h). In addition, the thermal conductivity of SEBS/paraffin/HDPE was 0.272 W/m K, which was increased up to 2.142 W/m K when copper foam was embedded in the composite. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, three novel types of FS-CPCMs were prepared as TES materials for building applications by absorption of capric (CA)-palmitic acid (PA) eutectic mixture, heptadecane (HEPD) and dodecanol (DD) as different kinds of organic PCMs into pumice (PUM) via vacuum impregnation. The maximum mass percentages of CA-PA, HEPD and DD into FS-CPCMs were determined as 34 wt%, 32 wt%, and 31 wt%, respectively. The chemical, morphological and thermal characterizations of the developed FS-CPCMs were performed by SEM, FT-IR, DSC, and TG analysis techniques. SEM and FT-IR results showed that the selected organic PCMs were well incorporated into the pores of the PUM particles and have good compatibility among the components of the composites. DSC analysis indicated that the phase change temperatures and TES capacities of the fabricated FS-CPCMs were in the range of 20.98-23.27 °C and 55.40-72.38 J/g, respectively. TG analysis results revealed that the prepared FS-CPCMs are thermally stable. The thermal cycling test also showed that they have excellent structural stability and good stability for TES characteristics after 3000 cycles. The FS-CPCMs were tested in the form of plasters firstly in this study, which is similar to large-scale building applications. Thermal performance tests showed that the gypsum plasters with the FS-CPCMs can be improved the thermal comfort keeping the indoor temperature at the comfortable range for a long time and reduced the energy consumption. Based on all results, it can be deduced that the newly developed PUM/CA-PA, PUM/HEPD and PUM/DD are potential FS-CPCMs for low temperature-HVAC applications in the construction of energy-efficient buildings. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An overview of the fundamentals of energy harvesting models using renewable sources and the advancements in the components used for this purpose is given. It also provides an analysis of the issues that are restricting the current harvesting models and indicates possible advances in technologies that may soon solve those problems. There are two main issues that plague these harvesting models. Firstly, the technology involved in the actual harvesting of renewable energy sources is not well developed and offer poor efficiency. In addition to that, most of the models need a permanent storage device, such as a battery or capacitor in order to operate. This is a serious drawback in applications involving wireless sensors as these devices have limited capacity, lifetime, and require a large area to work efficiently. This is most often not favorable as the attractions of using wireless sensors are in its portability and form. This paper looks into the studies dedicated to solving these problems. The latter part of the paper contains a discussion regarding the technologies that are best suited for applications in wireless sensors. The two most readily available and feasible options of a sustainable energy for these applications are found out to be RF (Radio Frequency) signal and solar radiation. Therefore, the final part of the paper concentrates on reviewing a model that may potentially be able to serve as a basis for a singular model for any kind of energy harvesting from renewable sources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the system efficiency is below 2%, but it is a promising technology to harness and convert the solar energy to electric power through three basic components; namely: solar collector, tower or chimney, and wind turbine-generator unit. The low efficiency, the bulk size and the high dependency on the solar irradiation are the major issues experienced in the solar chimney power plants. Since the implementation of the first prototype in Manzenares, numerous attempts have been reported to enhance the performance of the system. The present paper is compiling most of the reported attempts to enhance the performance of the solar chimney power plant. The conclusion drawn is that the system performance can be enhanced considerably via integration with another source of thermal energy, or by using efficient solar thermal energy storages.

Hydrogen as a promising energy carrier is a perfect candidate to supply the energy demand of the world and concomitantly reduce toxic emissions. This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art hydrogen production technologies using renewable and sustainable energy resources. Hydrogen from supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is the most cost effective thermochemical process. Highly moisturized biomass is utilized directly in SCWG without any high cost drying process. In SCWG, hydrogen is produced at high pressure and small amount of energy is required to pressurize hydrogen in the storage tank. Tar and char formation decreases drastically in biomass SCWG. The low efficiency of solar to hydrogen system as well as expensive photovoltaic cell are the most important barriers for the widespread commercial development of solar-based hydrogen production. Since electricity costs play a crucial role on the final hydrogen price, to generate carbon free hydrogen from solar and wind energy at a competitive price with fossil fuels, the electrical energy cost should be four times less than commercial electricity prices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An example is the chemical storage of electricity in the form of gas, also known as power-to-gas. This paper contributes to the field of electricity storage by showing how power-to-gas could be used in combination with the pumped hydro facilities in Switzerland to facilitate the integration of photovoltaic sources into the electricity grid.

We found that the considered metal atoms are strongly bound to the Mo2C monolayer. However, the adsorption energies of these alkali and earth alkali elements decrease as the coverage increases due to the enhanced repulsion between the metal ions. We predict a significant charge transfer from the ad-atoms to the Mo2C monolayer, which indicates clearly the cationic state of the metal atoms. The metallic character of both pristine and doped Mo2C ensures a good electronic conduction that is essential for an optimal anode material. Low migration energy barriers are predicted as small as 43 meV for Li, 19 meV for Na and 15 meV for K, which result in the very fast diffusion of these atoms on Mo2C. For Mo2C, we found a storage capacity larger than 400 mA h g-1 by the inclusion of multilayer adsorption. Mo2C expands slightly upon deposition of Li and Na even at high concentrations, which ensures the good cyclic stability of the atomic layer.

The results showed that for the MgH2 sample doped with 10 wt% Na3FeF6, the onset dehydrogenation temperature decreased to 255 °C, which was 100 °C and 162 °C lower than those of the as-milled and as-received MgH2 sample, respectively. The re/dehydrogenation kinetics were also significantly enhanced compared to the un-doped MgH2. The absorption kinetics showed that the as-milled MgH2 only absorbed 3.0 wt% of hydrogen at 320 °C in 2 min of rehydrogenation, but about 3.6 wt% of hydrogen was absorbed within the same period of time after 10 wt% Na3FeF6 was added to MgH2.

By carefully controlling the amount of ethanol added in the MnO2 droplet, we could significantly reduce the CRE and thus improve the film uniformity. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitor (SC) devices using semitransparent MnO2 film electrodes with or without CRE were measured and compared. The SC device without CRE shows a superior capacitance, high rate capability, and lower contact resistance. The CRE-free device could achieve a considerable volumetric capacitance of 112.2 F cm-3, resulting in a high volumetric energy density and power density of 10 mWh cm-3 and 8.6 W cm-3, respectively. For practical consideration, both flexible SC and large-area rigid SC devices were fabricated to demonstrate their potential for flexible transparent electronic application and capacitive energy-storage window application. Moreover, a solar-powered energy storage window which consists of a commercial solar cell and our studied semitransparent MnO2-film-based SCs was assembled.

However, checkpointing a VM is usually heavy-weight: the VM's entire memory needs to be dumped to storage, which induces a significant amount of (slow) I/O operations, degrading system performance and user experience. In this paper, we propose FLIC, a fast and lightweight checkpointing machinery for virtualized mobile devices by taking advantages of recent byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVRAM). Instead of saving the VM's entire memory to storage, we store its working set pages in NVRAM, avoiding accessing slow flash memory (compared to server-grade SSDs). To cope with the energy constraint of mobile systems, we further deduplicate VM snapshots, reducing the VM's image size and saving storage space. Experimental results based on an Exynos 5250 SoC show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of checkpointing in mobile virutalization and save energy. © 2016 EDAA.",,"Fault tolerance; Flash memory; Machinery; System-on-chip; Virtualization; Check pointing; Degrading system; Energy constraint; Live migrations; Mobile systems; Non-volatile memory; Storage spaces; User experience; Virtual machine",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973659545

Different access techniques to avoid activating all cache ways have been previously proposed in an effort to reduce energy usage. However, a problem that many of these access techniques have in common is that they need to access different cache memory portions in a sequential manner, which is difficult to support with standard synchronous SRAM memory.We propose the speculative halt-tag access (SHA) approach, which accesses low-order tag bits, i.e., the halt tag, in the address generation stage instead of the SRAM access stage to eliminate accesses to cache ways that cannot possibly contain the data. The key feature of our SHA approach is that it determines which tag and data arrays need to be accessed early enough for conventional SRAMs to be used. We evaluate the SHA approach using a 65-nm processor implementation running MiBench benchmarks and find that it on average reduces data access energy by 25.6%. © 2016 EDAA.",,"Cache memory; Access techniques; Address generation; Data caches; Energy usage; Key feature; Sequential manners; Set-associative; Waste energy; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973650102

However, as a side reaction to dehydration, hydrolysis (HCl formation) may occur in chloride based salt hydrates (specially in MgCl2 hydrates), affecting the durability of the storage system. The mixture of CaCl2 and MgCl2 hydrates has been shown experimentally to have exceptional cycle stability and improved kinetics. However, the optimal operating conditions for the mixture are unknown. To understand the appropriate balance between dehydration and hydrolysis kinetics in the mixtures, it is essential to gain in-depth insight into the mixture components. We present a GGA-DFT level study to investigate the various gaseous structures of CaCl2 hydrates and to understand the relative stability of their conformers. The hydration strength and relative stability of conformers are dominated by electrostatic interactions. A wide network of intramolecular homonuclear and heteronuclear hydrogen bonds is observed in CaCl2 hydrates. Equilibrium product concentrations are obtained during dehydration and hydrolysis reactions under various temperature and pressure conditions. The trend of the dehydration curve with temperature in CaCl2 hydrates is similar to the experiments. Comparing these results to those of MgCl2 hydrates, we find that CaCl2 hydrates are more resistant towards hydrolysis in the temperature range of 273-800 K. Specifically, the present study reveals that the onset temperatures of HCl formation, a crucial design parameter for MgCl2 hydrates, are lower than for CaCl2 hydrates except for the mono-hydrate. © the Owner Societies 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964864079

This technology is designed in order to reduce the diesel fuel consumption and cost of electricity supply in a resort island located in the South China Sea. The optimal hydropower generation for this system depends on the available stream flow at the potential sites. At low stream flow, both the micro-hydropower system and the currently installed diesel generators are required to feed the load. However, when the hydropower generation exceeds the load demand, the diesel generator is shut down. Meanwhile, the system frequency is controlled by a secondary load bank that absorbs the hydropower which exceeds the consumer demand. This paper also presents a discrete frequency control system using proportional-derivative (PD) controller. The controller is employed in order to manipulate the system frequency by controlling the secondary load system. The simulation results indicate that a variety of load conditions can be satisfactorily controlled by the PD controller.

For building owners, the economic benefits are assessed from the perspective of lower connection charges, lower monthly power charge, lower capital cost, and reduced system losses. The non-financial benefit of improved power quality and reliability is also considered. For the grid operator, it is assessed from the perspective of cheaper generation costs and deferment in system upgrading costs. These benefits are derived from reducing the electrical load variability as a result of load shifting. As the electrical loads are varying constantly, the output of power plants need to be varied to meet the changing load and this reduces the efficiency. Furthermore, the capacity of the electrical power system needs to cater for the peak load, which occurs only for a short duration. Hence, reducing load variability will improve the efficiency and reduce wastage. In this study, it is found that substantial saving is obtained by shifting the top 3% peak load while carbon emission is reduced. The maximum saving obtained by the building owners and grid operator is USD 0.47 and USD 3.59 per kWh. © 2015 IEEE.","demand response; energy storage; power demand; power system economics; sustainable development","Carbon; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric loads; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Sustainable development; Connection charges; Demand response; Economic benefits; Electrical power system; Financial benefits; Peak load shifting; Power demands; Power system economics; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966665298

During daytime when A/C is not provided, a large amount of thermal energy can be stored in the thermal mass in its envelope components, in particularly its external walls. The energy stored would be gradually released, contributing significantly to the total space cooling load in the bedroom at nighttime. Therefore, this paper reports a simulation study on the impacts of daytime external envelope heat gain/storage on the nighttime cooling load in a hypothetic west-facing bedroom and the related mitigation measures in the subtropical Hong Kong. The study results showed that, among all envelope components, the west-facing external wall contributed most significantly to the total nighttime cooling load, because of its direct exposure to solar radiation, thus the heat gain and storage in its thermal mass. In addition, adding an air gap in the west-facing external wall can reduce remarkably the hourly total nighttime cooling load for the first hour (21:00-22:00) and the total cooling load for the 10-h A/C period. However, while varying the width of either the air gap or inside/outside concrete layers would not reduce cooling load further, ventilating mechanically the air gap can further increase the cooling load reduction and improve the flatness of load variation profile at the expense of consuming additional electrical energy. Finally, adhering aluminum foil to both sides of the air gap can further remarkably reduce nighttime cooling load, and improve the flatness of the load variation profile. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With the rising penetration rate of renewable energy sources, ESS (energy storage systems) are widely researched on the ability to overcome the mismatch of generation and load profiles. This research develops a methodology to assess the financial benefits of ESS connected to conventional power systems in reducing the load variability. These include reduced network losses, increased plant factor, reduced system costs, deferment of network upgrade, improved power system stability and improved power quality. These factors are weighted against the additional cost of ESS. The methodology is applied in a case study based on the electrical load collected from a building, with a peak load of 736 kW and load factor of 0.371. From the results, ESS is found to be effective to reduce the overall cost of the system. A large portion of the saving is obtained by the power operator when ESS is installed by the customer. In order to incentivize the building owner to install ESS, these savings need to be shared with the building owner. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Power system; Sustainable development","Costs; Emission control; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; System stability; Conventional power; Emission reduction; Energy storage systems; Financial benefits; Penetration rates; Power system; Power system stability; Renewable energy source; Cost reduction; building; energy efficiency; evolutionarily stable strategy; methodology; power generation; power plant; sustainable development; systems analysis; viability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959334815

Operating mechanical resonators in liquid environment for the detection of mass presents a challenge at least for electrical characterization. In this paper, we demonstrate the full electrical characterization of a micromechanical resonator that is fully immersed in DI-water. The reported device uses piezoelectric transduction through an Aluminium Nitride (AlN) film sputtered on a low damping silicon substrate to provide strong electromechanical coupling. The effect of viscous damping in DI-water is lowered by exciting the resonator to vibrate in an in-plane contour mode. We believe that incorporating a 10 μm thicker silicon substrate layer stiffens the resonant system and thereby increases the energy storage capacity in relation to a resonator structured purely by a thin AlN film. The 14 MHz length extensional (LE) mode resonator presented in this paper shows a quality factor (Q) of 200 when fully immersed in DI-water, which is twice that of previously reported resonators structured purely in AlN. The associated motional resistance of the device in DI-water is 40 kΩ. We have also measured the values of Q for several other in-plane resonant modes with higher resonant frequencies (up to 141.69 MHz) when immersed in DI-water. Having found that the high dielectric constant of DI-water significant affects the characterization setup, we have also modeled the various sources of parasitics involved in the setup. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Feedthrough capacitance; MEMS resonator; Thin film piezoelectric-on-silicon; Viscous damping","Aluminum nitride; Characterization; Damping; Electromechanical coupling; Microelectromechanical devices; Micromechanical resonators; Natural frequencies; Piezoelectricity; Resonators; Silicon; Substrates; Thin films; Contour-mode resonators; Electrical characterization; Energy storage capacity; Feed through; High dielectric constants; MEMS resonators; Thin film piezoelectric; Viscous damping; Electromechanical devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959249424

Biomass based electricity generation, especially eucalyptus trees, can be used to replace the expensive liquefied natural gas infrastructure required to generate electricity during the dry seasons and emergency generation during dry years in Brazil. This article presents a new electricity generation scheme called ""Energy Crop Storage"". In this scheme, biomass is grown and stored in eucalyptus plantations in order to match the supply of energy to its demand. For example, during wet years in Brazil, when biomass plants operate at 50% capacity, the eucalyptus trees are allowed to continue growing. During dry years, the biomass stored is used more intensively as biomass generation raises to 90% of its capacity. It was concluded that natural gas is a high risk investment in Brazil because, if there are several consecutive wet years, the expensive infrastructure dedicated to natural gas based electricity generation will remain on standby. Biomass plantations, on the other hand, are a more reliable investment as the biomass is stored when the biomass demand is lower. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy crops; Energy storage; Eucalyptus","Agriculture; Biomass; Crops; Drought; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Forestry; Gas industry; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Natural gas; Thermoelectric power plants; Biomass generation; Electricity generation; Energy crops; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus plantations; Generate electricity; Hydro-power generation; Natural gas infrastructure; Investments; biomass power; electricity generation; energy crop; energy resource; evergreen tree; food storage; hydroelectric power; investment; plantation; Amazonia; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959162930

Data from the Dutch Meteorological Institute is used to determine the optimal orientation of PV panels for maximum energy yield in the Netherlands. The seasonal and diurnal variation in solar insolation is analyzed to determine the energy availability for EV charging and the necessity for grid connection. Due to relatively low solar insolation in Netherlands, it has been determined that the power rating of the PV array can be oversized by 30% with respect to power rating of the converter. Various dynamic EV charging profiles are compared with an aim to minimize the grid dependency and to maximize the usage of solar power to directly charge the EV. Two scenarios are considered - one where the EVs have to be charged only on weekdays and the second case where EV have to be charged all 7 days/week. A priority mechanism is proposed to facilitate the charging of multiple EV from a single EV-PV charger. The feasibility of integrating a local storage to the EV-PV charger to make it grid independent is evaluated.

Ideally, supply should match demand, leading to a balanced power grid, but this is challenging in practice: while some generation sources can be planned in advance (e.g. utility offers), others can be planned to a limited degree or cannot be planned altogether (e.g. storage and renewable energy sources respectively). In this context, we focus on how to address systematically this complex resource allocation problem in the presence of multiple actors. In this work, utilizing a proposed modeling of the energy dispatch problem as an online scheduling problem, we model supply-following demand in terms of the Adwords problem, in order to provide algorithmic solutions of measurable quality. Building on earlier work in the literature, we extend the Adwords problem to incorporate load credit (i.e. storage) and we present and analyze online algorithms that can schedule demand, given availability constraints on supply, with guaranteed competitive ratio. In systems where individual demands are small compared to supply, we prove a (1-1/e)-competitive ratio. We also extend the Adwords problem to utilize dynamic budgets, with application in cases where the above assumption does not hold, and present an algorithm with a 1 2-competitive ratio. We also provide examples of algorithmic performance in real world scenarios, by utilizing long term, fine-grained data from a pilot project in Sweden by a major utility company and in collaboration with the local government authority, while taking into account renewable generation on site.","Online scheduling; Resource allocation; Smart grid","Budget control; Deregulation; Digital storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Smart power grids; Algorithmic solutions; Availability constraints; Deregulated energy market; Local government authorities; Online scheduling; Renewable energy source; Resource allocation problem; Smart grid; Competition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975827978

A cost-savings analytical tool is developed to provide a quick rule-of-thumb for customers to choose an appropriate size of energy storage for various tariff schemes. Design/methodology/approach – A novel sizing method is proposed to obtain the optimum size of energy storage for commercial and industrial customers based on their historical load profile. An algorithm is developed to determine the threshold level for peak shaving. One of the buildings at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), Malaysia, is chosen for this study. A three-phase energy storage system rated at 15 kVA is developed and connected to the low-voltage electrical network in the building. An adaptive control algorithm is developed and implemented to optimize the peak shaving. Findings – The sizing analysis shows that the customer under the C2 tariff rate yields the highest saving, followed by E2, C1 and E1. The experimental results presented indicate that the proposed adaptive control algorithm has effectively optimized the peak demand to be shaved. Research limitations/implications – This study demonstrates the potential of energy storage in reducing the peak demand and cost of electricity. One of the main challenges of real-time peak shaving is to determine an appropriate threshold level such that the energy stored in the energy storage system is sufficient during the peak shaving process.

A two-circuit refrigerator-freezer cycle (RF) reveals a higher energy saving potential than a conventional cycle with a single loop of serial evaporators, owing to pressure drop in each evaporator during refrigeration operation and low compression ratio. Therefore, several industrial applications and fish storage systems have been utilized by using multipurpose refrigeration cycle. That is why a theoretical performance analysis based on the exergetic performance coefficient, coefficient of performance (COP), exergy efficiency and exergy destruction ratio criteria, has been carried out for a multipurpose refrigeration system by using different refrigerants in serial and parallel operation conditions. The exergetic performance coefficient criterion is defined as the ratio of exergy output to the total exergy destruction rate (or loss rate of availability). According to the results of the study, the refrigerant R32 shows the best performance in terms of exergetic performance coefficient, COP, exergy efficiency, and exergy destruction ratio from among the other refrigerants (R1234yf, R1234ze, R404A, R407C, R410A, R143A and R502).

The system comprises of solar collectors for production of thermal energy, single stage LiBr-H2O absorption chiller (VAC) for providing air conditioning to office cabins and membrane distillation (MD) modules for clean water production along with domestic hot water generation as by-product. The performance of STP is analyzed with three different solar collectors - flat plate collectors (FPC), evacuated tube collector (ETC) and compound parabolic collector (CPC). The system is modeled and dynamically simulated using TRNSYS software for optimization of various design parameters like slope of the collectors, mass flow rate through the collector loop, storage capacity and area of collectors. Combined and system efficiency of the STP system has been determined for optimum conditions. Economic benefits are analyzed for different collectors and fuel costs savings. A lowest payback period of 6.75 years is achieved by STP with evacuated tube collector field having gross area of 216 m2. STP system has cumulative savings of $520,000 over the life time of the project through roof top solar collector installation. In terms of environmental benefits, 109 metric tons/year of CO2 emissions would be avoided and hence the overall payback period would be reduced by 8% based on cost saving through carbon credits. Economic and environmental benefits were aided by steady system performances of absorption chiller (35 kW), membrane distiller (80 l/day) and heat recovery system (1.2 m3/h) throughout the year.

The theory of partial wave expansion related to this problem is revisited. A physical model based on the analogy between acoustic scattering and potential scattering in quantum mechanics is proposed to describe and interpret the acoustical natural oscillation modes of the bubble, namely, the resonances. In this context, a physical model is devised in order to describe the air water interface and the implications of the high density contrast on the various regimes of the scattering resonances. The main results are presented in terms of resonance lifetime periods and quality factors. The explicit numerical calculations are undertaken through an asymptotic analysis considering typical bubble dimensions and underwater sound wavelengths. It is shown that the resonance periods are scaled according to the Minnaert’s period, which is the short lived resonance mode, called breathing mode of the bubble. As expected, resonances with longer lifetimes lead to impressive cavity quality Q-factor ranging from 1010 to 105.

Furthermore, the water consumption pattern for 10 low-income households was empirically determined using smart meters; the rainwater supply was estimated by using the computer program Netuno 4.0; and the water supply and sewage reduction potentialofgray water systems were determined usinga theoretical method. On average, the gray water and rainwater supply capacities were equivalent to 24% and 43% of the total water consumption of households, respectively. In regard to energy savings, rainwater harvesting was the most energy intensive strategy (0.86 kWh/m3), followed by centralized systems (0.84 kWh/m3); whereas, gray water was the most energy efficient strategy (0.54 kWh/m3).

The ageing and muscle influenced significantly shear force and shear energy. However, significantly lower shear force and higher score of tenderness were observed on 7 vs. 2 days of ageing only for SM. The evaluated factors (ageing and muscle) affected slightly and not significantly the parameters of texture profile analysis. The muscle samples after the 7-day ageing showed higher hardness and chewiness. Significant correlation of sensory tenderness with instrumental shear and energy force and springiness was confirmed.

However, biomass presents some difficulties to overcome, such as its high moisture content, hygroscopic nature, low energy density, which causes high costs during transportation, handling, and storage. These difficulties could be overcome if the biomass is thermally treated. The solution is a torrefaction process, a thermal treatment to upgrade biomass to a higher quality and more attractive biofuel. The present work aimed to study the benefits of torrefaction process for the energetic properties of wood Eucalyptus chips. The raw and torrefied samples were characterized to compare the results. All analysis was performed according to the Standard Test Method (ASTM). The characteristics of the wood chips were determined by physic-chemical analysis as elemental analysis; determination of immediate analysis and Higher Heating Value (HHV). Temperatures degradation of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose were determined by TGA/DTG (Thermogravimetric Analysis). According to the results, it was found that the roasting process has improved significantly the energy properties of biomass studied. The HHV has increased (around 30%) and the moisture (70%) and volatiles (around 60%) contents decreased. This demonstrates that torrefaction process is a viable procedure for energy conditioning of Eucalyptus biomass. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to show the dynamic weight of the eucalyptus biomass to understand the effects of temperature on torrefaction process. The trends of the TGA curves for the raw sample and torrefied sample at 250 °C are similar, were the samples that decreased a major biomass weight percent. This is due to the high amount of hemicelluloses was lost in these samples. In the stage from 260 to 300 °C, cellulose and lignin are the main energy components. TGA experiments have indicated that the torrefied samples presented different volatile release and burning profiles. This treatment causes significant changes in their properties and benefits for its transportation. Viable logistics and favorable changes of the torrefied biomass properties have different purposes for its application in the generation of thermal or electric energy. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Biomass; Calorific value; Cellulose; Chemical analysis; Lignin; Moisture; Testing; Wood products; Cellulose and hemicellulose; Effects of temperature; Energetic properties; Eucalyptus grandis; High moisture contents; Higher heating value; Hygroscopic nature; Standard test method; Thermogravimetric analysis; Biomass; Eucalyptus Grandis; Fuels; Moisture Content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969579982

In this work, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called Charge Cache, that enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Dynamic random access storage; Memory architecture; Supercomputers; Access locality; DRAM chips; Energy benefits; Low costs; Memory controller; Multi-core systems; Timing parameters; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965013529

For ions, this leads to a thermovoltage that is determined by the thermal gradient ΔT across the electrolyte, together with the ionic Seebeck coefficient αi. So far, redox-free electrolytes have been poorly explored in thermoelectric applications due to a lack of strategies to harvest the energy from the Soret effect. Here, we report the conversion of heat into stored charge via a remarkably strong ionic Soret effect in a polymeric electrolyte (Seebeck coefficients as high as αi = 10 mV K-1). The ionic thermoelectric supercapacitor (ITESC) is charged under a temperature gradient. After the temperature gradient is removed, the stored electrical energy can be delivered to an external circuit. This new means to harvest energy is particularly suitable for intermittent heat sources like the sun. We show that the stored electrical energy of the ITESC is proportional to (ΔTαi)2. The resulting ITESC can convert and store several thousand times more energy compared with a traditional thermoelectric generator connected in series with a supercapacitor. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitors; Electrolytes; Seebeck coefficient; Temperature; Thermal gradients; Thermoelectric equipment; External circuits; Free electrolytes; Molecular concentration; Polymeric electrolytes; Stored electrical energies; Thermodiffusion; Thermoelectric application; Thermoelectric generators; Polyelectrolytes; electricity generation; electrokinesis; electrolyte; equipment; polymer; solar power; storage; temperature gradient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964756608

Then, we study how a memory term creates damping mechanism and how the memory causes energy decay even in the cases when the original memoryless system is unstable. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","Damping; Energy estimate; Exponential decay; High-frequency ultrasound waves; Memory; Moore–Gibson–Thompson (MGT) equation; Multipliers","Data storage equipment; Frequency multiplying circuits; Thermodynamics; Ultrasonic relaxation; Damping mechanisms; Energy estimates; Exponential decays; Extended irreversible thermodynamics; High frequency ultrasounds; Memory less systems; Molecular relaxation; Thompson; Damping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962468873

However, the processes occurring on the NiOOH surface during charge accumulation and OER are not well understood. This work presents an in situ Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) study of the pH dependent interfacial changes of the NiOOH catalyst under the working conditions used for OER. We demonstrate the important effect of the electrolyte pH on the degree of surface deprotonation of NiOOH, which crucially affects its OER activity. Our results show that the deprotonation of NiOOH produces negatively charged (or proton-deficient) surface species, which are responsible for the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH in highly alkaline pH. Moreover, we provide spectroscopic evidence obtained in an 18O-labeled electrolyte that allows us to assign this surface species to a superoxo-type species (Ni-OO-). Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the OER on NiOOH which is consistent with the observed pH-sensitivity, and that also explains why NiOOH is not a suitable catalyst for applications in neutral or moderately alkaline pH (in the range 7-11), apart from the lower stability of the catalyst under these conditions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Catalysts; Deprotonation; Electrolytes; Nickel; Raman spectroscopy; Charge accumulation; Negatively charged; Nickel oxyhydroxides; Oxygen evolution reaction; Spectroscopic evidence; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Surface species; Water oxidation; Alkalinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962246813

This paper introduces a modular LCA approach that is capable of reducing the effort involved in performing scenario analyses and optimization when several key choices along a product’s value chain lead to many alternative life cycles. Methods: The main idea is that the value chain of a product can be divided into interconnected but exchangeable modules, which together represent a full life cycle. A module is comprised of unit processes from the practitioner’s LCI database. The inputs, outputs, and system boundaries of each module can be tailored to the context of the studied system. Alternatives arise whenever multiple modules produce substitutable products. Unlike in conventional LCI databases, no copies are necessary to represent the same process with different inputs. A module-product matrix is used to store this information. It can be used as a basis for an automated scenario analysis of all alternatives or as an input to an optimization model. Results and discussion: Our approach is illustrated in two case studies: (1) Passenger car fuel choices are modeled by 15 modules representing 33 alternative value chains for diesel, petrol, natural gas and electric cars. The automated comparison of LCA results indicates that electric mobility is often the preferable option from a climate perspective, but impacts depend strongly on the electricity source. (2) A dynamic optimization model including stocks is built from eight modules to analyze the optimal use of wood for material and energy applications. Results indicate that although direct substitution benefits are higher for energy applications, cascading use of wood can maximize environmental performance over the entire life cycle. Conclusions: The modular LCA approach permits an efficient modeling and comparison of alternative product life cycles, enabling practitioners to focus on key decisions. It can be applied to exploit a potential that is hidden in LCI databases, which is that they contain many specific inventories but not all useful combinations in the context of scenario analyses. The user-defined level of abstraction that is introduced through modules can be helpful in the communication of LCA results. The modular approach also facilitates the integration of LCA and optimization as well as other industrial ecology methods. An open source software is provided to enable others to apply and further develop our implementation of a modular LCA approach. © 2016, The Author(s).","Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory (LCI); Linear programming; Optimization; Scenario modeling; Transport; Wood","access to information; Article; automation; data analysis software; environmental impact; environmental management; information storage; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; priority journal; process optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961057887

Here, we used RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of in vitro-produced early- and late-dividing bovine embryos and their respective blastocysts, and compared these profiles to in vivo-produced blastocysts to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis revealed that fast- and slow-dividing embryos possess similar transcript abundance over the first cleavages. By the blastocyst stage, however, more DEGs were observed between the fast- and slow-dividing embryo groups, whereas blastocysts from the slow-dividing group were more similar to in vivo-produced blastocysts. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the slow-dividing and in vivo-produced blastocysts shared biological processes related to groups of up- or down-regulated genes when compared to the fast-dividing blastocysts. Based on these DEG results, we characterized the relationship between developmental kinetics and energy metabolism of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. Embryos from fast- and slow-dividing groups exhibited different pyruvate and lactate metabolism at 22hr post-in vitro culture (hpc), glucose consumption at 96hpc, and glutamate metabolism at 168hpc. Glycogen storage was similar between cleavage-stage and morulae groups, but was higher in the blastocysts of the slow-dividing group. On the other hand, blastocysts of the fast-dividing group had a higher concentration of lipids. Taken together, these data identify transcriptomic and metabolic differences between embryos with different morphokinetics, suggesting that sorting embryos based on cleavage speed may select for different metabolic patterns. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"glucose; glutamic acid; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; culture medium; messenger RNA; transcriptome; animal cell; Article; blastocyst; bovine; cell culture; cell division; cell metabolism; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA sequence; upregulation; animal; blastocyst; bovine; cell division; culture medium; cytokinesis; cytology; embryo development; female; gene expression; in vitro fertilization; metabolism; oocyte cleavage; pregnancy; principal component analysis; time factor; tissue culture technique; veterinary; Animals; Blastocyst; Cattle; Cell Division; Cleavage Stage, Ovum; Culture Media; Cytokinesis; Embryonic Development; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Gene Expression; Pregnancy; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Messenger; Time Factors; Tissue Culture Techniques; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960366913

In material engineering, ionic liquids are applied to synthesize mainly metal nanoparticles and 3D semiconductor microparticles. They could generally serve as a structuring agent or as a reaction medium (solvent). This review deals with the resent progress in general understanding of the ILs role in particle growth and stabilization and the application of ionic liquids for nano- and microparticles synthesis. The first part of the paper is focused on the interactions between ionic liquids and growing particles. The stabilization of growing particles by steric hindrance, electrostatic interaction, solvation forces, viscous stabilization, and ability of ILs to serve as a soft template is detailed discussed. For the first time, the miscellaneous role of the ILs in nano- and microparticle preparation composed of metals as well as semiconductors is collected, and the formation mechanisms are graphically presented and discussed based on their structure and selected properties. The second part of the paper gives a comprehensive overview of recent experimental studies dealing with the applications of ionic liquids for preparation of metal and semiconductor-based nano- and microparticles. A wide spectrum of preparation routes using ionic liquids are presented, including precipitation, sol-gel technique, hydrothermal method, nanocasting, and microwave or ultrasound-mediated methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These developments raise concerns about the physical, psychosocial and cognitive consequences of obesity. It was shown that early dietary intake of arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can reduce the detrimental effects of later obesogenic feeding on lipid metabolism and adipogenesis in an animal model of mild obesity. In the present study, the effects of early dietary ARA and DHA on cognition and brain structure were examined in mildly obesogenic ApoE*3Leiden mouse model. We used cognitive tests and neuroimaging during early and later life. During their early development after weaning (4-13 weeks of age), mice were fed a chow diet or ARA and DHA diet for 8 weeks and then switched to a high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet for 12 weeks (14-26 weeks of age). An HFHC-diet led to increased energy storage in white adipose tissue, increased cholesterol levels, decreased triglycerides levels, increased cerebral blood flow and decreased functional connectivity between brain regions as well as cerebrovascular and gray matter integrity. ARA and DHA intake reduced the HFHC-diet-induced increase in body weight, attenuated plasma triglycerides levels and improved cerebrovasculature, gray matter integrity and functional connectivity in later life. In conclusion, an HFHC diet causes adverse structural brain and metabolic adaptations, most of which can be averted by dietary ARA and DHA intake early in life supporting metabolic flexibility and cerebral integrity later in life. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Brain structure; High-fat and high-carbohydrate diets; Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; Neuroimaging; Obesity","arachidonic acid; cholesterol; docosahexaenoic acid; glucose transporter 1; polyunsaturated fatty acid; triacylglycerol; unsaturated fatty acid; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain; brain blood flow; brain function; brain region; brain structure; brain tissue; carbohydrate diet; cholesterol blood level; cognition; controlled study; diet induced obesity; fat intake; gray matter; lipid diet; male; metabolism; mouse model; neuroimaging; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; triacylglycerol blood level; weaning; white adipose tissue; animal; brain; diet; metabolism; mouse; obesity; Animals; Brain; Diet; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Mice; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958968977

A comprehensive analysis of storage feasibility needs to include the issue of social acceptance. The knowledge of CCS is low in Sweden however and there are no Swedish CCS projects to learn from. This paper therefore draws on lessons from other large-scale energy projects that are embedded in similar Baltic Sea contexts to complement lessons on CCS acceptance provided in the literature. The aim of this study is to facilitate an understanding of acceptance of potential future CO2 storage initiatives in the Swedish Baltic Sea region and to analyze what contextual factors are likely to be determinative of the outcome of these and similar projects. The study identifies climate change as one such key contextual factor, which can often be used both to support and oppose a large-scale energy project. Furthermore, the study finds that there are perceptions of uncertainties regarding the regulatory framework that need to be adressed in order to facilitate the planning of CCS projects in the region. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","acceptance; Baltic Sea; CCS; communication; policy; storage","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Communication; Energy storage; Public policy; Acceptance; Baltic sea; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon dioxide storage; Comprehensive analysis; Contextual factors; Regulatory frameworks; Social acceptance; acceptance; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956637009

To this end, data retention in these devices should be characterized, understood and controlled. First, it is shown that the measurement protocol can strongly affect the 'apparent' retention time and a suitable protocol is identified. Second, it is shown by experimental and theoretical methods that partial depolarization of the ferroelectric is the major mechanism responsible for imperfect data retention. This depolarization occurs in close vicinity to the semiconductor-ferroelectric interface, is driven by energy minimization and is inherently present in this type of phase-separated polymer blends. Third, a direct relation between data retention and the charge injection barrier height of the resistive switch is demonstrated experimentally and numerically. Tuning the injection barrier height allows to improve retention by many orders of magnitude in time, albeit at the cost of a reduced on/off ratio. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Distributed Generation (DG) as a solution to these issues is affected by source intermittency, grid-side limited storage capabilities and supply/demand mismatch. In order to achieve more benefits and profits for both customers and the utility, integrated demand management techniques can be used. This paper reviews the issues caused by high penetration of renewables in power production, depending on utility characteristics. In addition, several methods in the literature were reviewed and their both single and combined use was investigated with a comparison study in Turkey. In field data based simulations, consumption of refrigerators were scheduled according to the output of a small scale PV system and changes in consumption in a year were calculated. The results were analyzed and compared with each other from the standpoint of change in amount of power taken from grid, number of active operation hours shifted to solar periods, change in annual consumption and achievable savings in electricity bills. In addition to the analysis and comparison of several management methods, the paper also proposes a number of terms that widens applicability and can be used in decision-making processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, contamination of groundwater, especially with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), is often being encountered. This is commonly seen as an impediment to ATES implementation, although more recently, combining ATES and enhanced bioremediation of CVOCs has been proposed. Issues to be addressed are the high water flow velocities and potential periodic redox fluctuation that accompany ATES. A column study was performed, at a high water flow velocity of 2 m/h, simulating possible changes in subsurface redox conditions due to ATES operation by serial additions of lactate and nitrate. The impacts of redox changes on reductive dechlorination as well as the microbial response of Dehalococcoides (DHC) were evaluated. The results showed that, upon lactate addition, reductive dechlorination proceeded well and complete dechlorination from cis-DCE to ethene was achieved. Upon subsequent nitrate addition, reductive dechlorination immediately ceased. Disruption of microorganisms’ retention was also immediate and possibly detached DHC which preferred attaching to the soil matrix under biostimulation conditions. Initially, recovery of dechlorination was possible but required bioaugmentation and nutrient amendment in addition to lactate dosing. Repeated interruption of dechlorination and DHC activity by nitrate dosing appeared to be less easily reversible requiring more efforts for regenerating dechlorination. Overall, our results indicate that the microbial resilience of DHC in biosimulated ATES conditions is sensitive to redox fluctuations. Hence, combining ATES with bioremediation requires dedicated operation and monitoring on the aquifer geochemical conditions. © 2015, The Author(s).","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE); Dehalococcoides; Microbial resilience; Redox potential (EAg/AgCl); Reductive dechlorination","Aquifers; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Energy storage; Ethylene; Flow of water; Flow velocity; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Hydraulics; Nitrates; Pollution; Redox reactions; Thermal energy; Volatile organic compounds; Ag/AgCl; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Dehalococcoides; Dichloroethenes; Microbial resilience; Reductive dechlorination; Dechlorination; ground water; volatile organic compound; water pollutant; aquifer; bacterium; bioremediation; dechlorination; energy conservation; ethane; flow velocity; groundwater pollution; microbial community; redox potential; sustainability; thermal power; urban area; volatile organic compound; water flow; aquifer; aquifer thermal energy storage; Article; bioprocess; bioremediation; dechlorination; dehalogenation; energy resource; energy yield; fermentation; flow rate; methanogenesis; microbial community; oxidation reduction potential; oxygen diffusion; urban area; water contamination; water flow; bioremediation; chemistry; Chloroflexi; halogenation; metabolism; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Dehalococcoides; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chloroflexi; Groundwater; Halogenation; Oxidation-Reduction; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951926183

A scenario-based robust approach is used to tackle both sources of uncertainty in a tractable way. The interdependency between the day-ahead market prices and the aggregator's bidding decisions is addressed using complementarity models.

However, lack of data sources hinders the effort to deliberately assess this resource. This paper presents an assessment of wave energy resources in the South China Sea (Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone) using satellite altimeter. Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS) provides data of significant wave height and wind speed from several satellite altimeters. The data were extracted for a space resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, and within the time range from January 2001 to December 2010 and space range of 1.5°N - 10.0°N, 95.0°E - 116.0°E. For this study, fifteen 2° × 2° zones were considered around the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the coast of East Malaysia. The 10-year-data were validated with buoy measurements and presented as the probability distribution of wave height and wave period. The results indicate that bulk of the waves had peak period between 5s and 7s and significant wave height between 0.5 m and 1.5 m. The data were then used to calculate the theoretical available wave energy and power in the study areas. The results show that the average wave energy density of Malaysian seas facing the South China Sea is in the range of 1.41 kW/m to 7.92 kW/m, while the energy storage varies from 7.10 MW h/m to 69.41 MW h/m. This study also demonstrates the ability of satellite altimeter to provide an accurate and reliable data for more comprehensive and realistic estimate of the energy potential. The ability of satellite altimeter to provide wave data for all sea zones will enable more accurate identification of potential locations for wave energy development in Malaysia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Malaysia; Ocean; Satellite altimeter; Wave energy resources","Aneroid altimeters; Digital storage; Energy resources; Meteorological instruments; Probability distributions; Radio altimeters; Satellites; Water waves; Wave power; Wind; Exclusive economic zones; Malaysia; Ocean; Satellite altimeter; Significant wave height; Wave energy development; Wave energy resource assessment; Wave energy resources; Wave energy conversion; energy resource; resource assessment; resource development; satellite altimetry; satellite data; significant wave height; spatial resolution; wave power; wind velocity; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951098135

It is to reduce burden of centralized power plant and global emissions, increase usage of renewable energy, and diverse energy supply market. However, solar photovoltaic which is a type of renewable energy resource, is found to generate peak capacity for a short duration only. Next, its output is intermittent and randomness. In addition, it changes behavior of power distribution system from unidirectional to bidirectional. As a result, it causes different types of power quality events to the power networks. Therefore, these power quality events are urged to be mitigated to further explore the potential of solar photovoltaic system. This paper aims to investigate negative impacts of photovoltaic (PV) grid-tied system to the power networks, and study on performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional methods in mitigating power quality event. According to the surveys, power system monitoring, inverter, dynamic voltage regulator, static synchronous compensator, unified power quality conditioner and energy storage system are able to compensate power quality events which are caused by PV grid-tied system. From the studies, AI methods usually outperform conventional methods in terms of response time and controllability. They also show talent in multi-mode operation, which is to switch to different operation modes according to the environment. However, they require memory to achieve abovementioned tasks. It is believed that unsupervised learning AI is the future trend as it can adapt to the environment without the need of collecting large amount of data before the AI is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Allrightsreserved.","Artificial intelligence; High penetration; Mitigation; Power quality; PV Grid Tied System","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Electric network analysis; Energy resources; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Static synchronous compensators; Static Var compensators; Voltage regulators; Dynamic voltage regulators; High penetration; Integration of renewable energies; Mitigation; Power distribution system; PV Grid Tied System; Solar photovoltaic system; Unified power quality conditioners; Electric power transmission networks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949843864

The water saved can be stored for energy generation and other purposes. This work addresses the possibility of complementing the hydro system with offshore wind power. To do so, monthly precipitation data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU-TS 3.1) [1] is compared with satellite winds from NOAA [2,3], to assess their variability on seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show high wind magnitudes in the North, Northeast, Southeast and Southern regions of Brazil. There is strong seasonal complementarity between the wind regimes of the Northeast and Northern regions. North and especially Northeast offshore winds were shown to be highly complementary with the hydrological regimes of São Francisco, Eastern Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Paraná, Paraguai, Uruguai and South Atlantic basins. In addition, the southern hydrographic basin variability was found uncorrelated with other hydrological basins and wind regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, Hybrid Memory Cubes (HMCs) can provide substantial energy and bandwidth improvements compared to traditional memory organizations. However, it is not clear how this reduced average memory access latency will impact the LLC. For applications with high cache miss ratios, the latency to search for the data inside the cache memory will impact negatively on the performance. The importance of this overhead depends on the memory access latency. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the L3 cache importance on a high performance processor using HMC also exploring chip area tradeoffs between the cache size and number of processor cores. We show that the high bandwidth provided by HMC memories can eliminate the need for L3 caches, removing hardware and making room for more processing power. Our evaluations show that performance increased 37% and the EDP improved 12% while maintaining the same original chip area in a wide range of parallel applications, when compared to DDR3 memories. © 2016 IEEE.","Cache memories; chip area tradeoff; HMC","Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Memory architecture; Parallel processing systems; Chip areas; Computer architects; High performance processors; Memory access latency; Memory organizations; Parallel application; Processing power; Substantial energy; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968884285

Measurements upon heating show that there is a large change in the dynamics on going through the phase transition, whereas measurements upon cooling reveal a strong hysteresis due to undercooling of the disordered phase. The results show that the dynamics is associated with rotational diffusion of SiH3- anions, adequately modeled by H-jumps among 24 different jump locations radially distributed around the Si atom. The average relaxation time between successive jumps is of the order of subpicoseconds and exhibits a weak temperature dependence with a small difference in activation energy between the two materials, 39(1) meV for KSiH3 and 33(1) meV for RbSiH3. The pronounced SiH3- dynamics explains the high entropy observed in the disordered phase resulting in the low entropy variation for hydrogen absorption/desorption and hence the origin of these materials' favorable hydrogen storage properties.

With such proliferated data processing, there are legitimate concerns that call for sound privacy measures to ensure proper safekeeping. A significant portion of the potential benefits of the SG initiative, thus, relies on devising convincing mechanisms to strengthen the privacy. As a new distribution subsystem, microgrids are expected to play a crucial role in the SG. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware microgrid power scheduling formulation with renewable sources and energy storage where five different classes of appliances are prioritized by smart meters. Our analysis shows that there is a tradeoff between maximizing the power usage and privacy levels. Hence, it is not possible to find a solution that maximizes both objectives simultaneously. However, it is possible to achieve significantly higher levels of privacy preservation with moderate sacrifice from the power usage, especially when the number of users is high. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data handling; Data privacy; Scheduling; Different class; Potential benefits; Power Scheduling; Privacy aware; Privacy Levels; Privacy measures; Privacy preservation; Renewable sources; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966495169

The overall plastic deformation includes local plastic slip events taken with an appropriate weight assigned to each angle of the plane misorientation from the direction of maximum shear stress. As deformation progresses, the material experiences successive reorganizations of the slip systems. The microstructural evolution causes that a portion of energy expended on plastic deformation is dissipated and the rest is stored in the defect structures. We show that the reorganizations are stable in a homogeneously deformed material. The concept is tested for steel 304L, where we reproduce experimentally obtained stress-strain responses, we construct the Frost-Ashby deformation map and predict the rate of the energy storage.

Generally, UPC removes the need of multiple optimized source specific converters. But, the proposed UPC architecture will be Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) with maximized efficiency to support the low energy levels generated by harvesting sources. This UPC uses a universal source detection block consisting of source converter block, boost converter, storage unit and buck regulation. A voltage threshold block reduces the energy processing stage. A kick-start circuit enables self-starting operation. A power management block achieves efficiency in energy storage and charge cycles. The UPC will be modeled, designed and simulated in PSPICE. A behavioral model will be designed and simulated on Modelsim. The UPC will be realized on FPGA board, validated and analyzed in layout using 0.13 μm CMOS process technology.

By combining the emission-free EV with the low carbon PV power generation, the problems related to the greenhouse gases due to the internal combustion engines can be reduced. Over the years, numerous papers, including several review work, have been published on EV charging using the grid electricity. However, there seems to be an absence of a review paper on EV charging using the PV as one of the energy sources. With growing interest in this topic, this review summarizes and updates some of the important aspects of the PV-EV charging. For the benefit of a wider audience, it provides the background on the EV fundamentals, batteries and a brief overview on the PV systems. Two types of PV-EV charging, namely the PV-grid and the PV-standalone, are comprehensively covered. Moreover, a case study is carried out in comparison to the grid-only charging to critically analyse the technical and the economical feasibilities of both types using Matlab simulation.

With few other regular meteorological observations available in this extreme environment, measurements from automatic weather stations (AWS) are the primary data source for studying surface energy budgets, and for validating satellite observations and model simulations. Station tilt, due to irregular surface melt, compaction and glacier dynamics, causes considerable biases in the AWS shortwave radiation measurements. In this study, we identify tilt-induced biases in the climatology of surface shortwave radiative flux and albedo, and retrospectively correct these by iterative application of solar geometric principles. We found, over all the AWS from the Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net), the Kangerlussuaq transect (K-transect) and the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) networks, insolation on fewer than 40% of clear days peaks within &pm;0.5h of solar noon time, with the largest shift exceeding 3h due to tilt. Hourly absolute biases in the magnitude of surface insolation can reach up to 200W m-2, with respect to the well-understood clear-day insolation. We estimate the tilt angles and their directions based on the solar geometric relationship between the simulated insolation at a horizontal surface and the observed insolation by these tilted AWS under clear-sky conditions. Our adjustment reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) against references from both satellite observation and reanalysis by 16W m-2 (24%), and raises the correlation coefficients with them to above 0.95. Averaged over the whole Greenland Ice Sheet in the melt season, the adjustment in insolation to compensate station tilt is ∼ 11W m-2, enough to melt 0.24m of snow water equivalent.

However, the fate of the CO2 and the ecological influences in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CDCS) facilities is not understood clearly. In the current study, the fate of CO2 (in bicarbonate form; 0~90 mM) with 10 mM of formate as electron donor and carbon source was investigated with high-temperature production water from oilfield in China. The isotope data showed that bicarbonate could be reduced to methane by methanogens and major pathway of methanogenesis could be syntrophic formate oxidation coupled with CO2 reduction and formate methanogenesis under the anaerobic conditions. The bicarbonate addition induced the shift of microbial community. Addition of bicarbonate and formate was associated with a decrease of Methanosarcinales, but promotion of Methanobacteriales in all treatments. Thermodesulfovibrio was the major group in all the samples and Thermacetogenium dominated in the high bicarbonate treatments. The results indicated that CO2 from CDCS could be transformed to methane and the possibility of microbial CO2 conversion for enhanced microbial energy recovery in oil reservoirs. © 2016 Yang, Zhou, Mbadinga, Liu, Yang, Gu and Mu.","Bicarbonate; CDCS; CO2 conversion; Methanogenesis; Oil reservoirs; Stable isotope technique","bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; formic acid; RNA 16S; Article; biomass conversion; carbon sequestration; carbon source; chemical analysis; controlled study; gene sequence; isotope analysis; Methanobacteriales; methanogenesis; Methanosarcinales; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oil field; pH; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Thermoanaerobacteriaceae; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964403982

It was determined that both crystals are stabilized by electrostatically dominated intra- and intermolecular M···H-B interactions (M = Li, K). For LiN(CH3)2BH3 the intramolecular charge transfer appeared (B-H→Li) to be more pronounced compared with the corresponding intermolecular contribution. We clarified for the first time, based on the ETS-NOCV and IQA methods, that homopolar BH···HB interactions in LiN(CH3)2BH3 can be considered as destabilizing (due to the dominance of repulsion caused by negatively charged borane units), despite the fact that some charge delocalization within BH···HB contacts is enforced (which explains H···H bond critical points found from the QTAIM method). Interestingly, quite similar (to BH···HB) intermolecular homopolar dihydrogen bonds CH···HC appared to significantly stabilize both crystals—the ETS-NOCV scheme allowed us to conclude that CH···HC interactions are dispersion dominated, however, the electrostatic and σ/σ*(C-H) charge transfer contributions are also important.

Battery energy storage has been considered as an effective mechanism to minimize the fluctuation of power flow exchanged with the main grid in a system with renewable energy sources. In this paper, we consider the optimal control of battery energy storage system (BESS) in a microgrid with renewable energy sources. In particular, we aim to minimize a cost function, which is a general convex increasing function of instantaneous power flow from the grid. The increasing convexity of the cost function makes sure that the power flow from the main grid is as flat over time as possible, and thus minimizes the negative impact of renewable energy integration. Through rigorous analysis, we show that the optimal BESS operation policy exhibits a threshold structure, which can potential lead to a simplified control policy. The threshold structure is validated through extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate that the BESS can significantly reduce the fluctuation of power flow exchanged with the main grid. Besides, we also discuss the effect of BESS capacity on the total cost. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Cost functions; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Effective mechanisms; Extensive simulations; Increasing functions; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy integrations; Renewable energy source; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964950058

To reduce the sensing, storage, transmission, and processing costs, the natural choice for the sampler is the sparsest one that results in a desired global error probability. Since the numerical optimization of the error probabilities is difficult, we adopt simpler costs related to distance measures between the conditional distributions of the sensor observations. We design sparse samplers for the Bayesian as well as the Neyman-Pearson setting. The developed theory can be applied to sensor placement/selection, sample selection, and fully decentralized data compression. For conditionally independent observations, we give an explicit solution, which is optimal in terms of the error exponents. More specifically, the best subset of sensors is the one with the smallest local average root-likelihood ratio and largest local average log-likelihood ratio in the Bayesian and Neyman-Pearson setting, respectively. We supplement the proposed framework with a thorough analysis for Gaussian observations, including the case when the sensors are conditionally dependent, and also provide examples for other observation distributions. One of the results shows that, for nonidentical Gaussian sensor observations with uncommon means and common covariances under both hypotheses, the number of sensors required to achieve a desired detection performance reduces significantly as the sensors become more coherent. © 2015 IEEE.","Bhattacharyya distance; convex optimization; distributed detection; energy-efficiency; J-divergence; Kullback-Leibler distance; sensor placement; sensor selection; sparse sensing","Convex optimization; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Errors; Optimization; Probability; Probability distributions; Bhattacharyya distance; Distributed detection; J-divergence; Kullback-Leibler distance; Sensor placement; Sensor selection; sparse sensing; Data compression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962026700

The negative electrode consisted of phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS), and polyallylamine (PAH), whereas the positive electrode comprised electrosynthesized PEDOT. The ability of these electrodes to harvest energy resulted from the partial change in entropy associated with alterations in the proton concentration after neutralization reactions. Investigation of the potentiodynamic profile of the current density and conduction of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy helped to evaluate the practical reversibility of the proton electroinsertion process and to maximize the energy storage efficiency. The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance data allowed for proposal of a charge compensation mechanism and for assessment of the proton selectivity of the modified electrodes. On the basis of the charge/discharge curves recorded from pH = 1 to pH = 6, the neutralization pseudocapacitor harvested 30.7 kJ per mol of electroinserted proton during H2SO4 solution neutralization, which corresponded to 54.6% of the neutralization enthalpy.

In this paper, a novel principle for Energy Storage in PFC by EV motor/generator is proposed. A digital controller is used to regulate the converter by using PWM, resulting in small volume, low noise and high power density.

Thanks to such models, key parameters such as activation energies can be found. However, it is noteworthy that the parameters thus obtained often show great disparities even for the same material. In addition to experimental inaccuracies, these disparities may also be attributed to the improper processing of the data and to suboptimal experimental design. In this paper, we present some theoretical tools based on optimal experimental design (OED) to analyze and optimize the uncertainty on the estimated parameters. The uncertainty is derived from asymptotic statistics and it is shown to be closely linked to the sensitivity of the experiment to the parameters. We found that by applying a new OED-based procedure, the estimate of the kinetic parameters can be effectively improved.

Unfortunately, the slow dynamics and gas starvation problems are the demerits of SOFC. Due to which the SOFC fails in providing fast response and also face load following problems. However, an integration of SOFC with complementary device such as an Ultra-capacitor (UC) can solve these problems. This paper presents an integration and power control of hybrid power system combining a SOFC stack, an Electrolyzer (ELZ) and an energy storage system in the form of hydrogen tanks and an UC module. A dynamic power flow controller is designed which supervised and managed all the energy sources and power converters to maximize the use of SOFC/ELZ/UC and reduce burden on the grid. According to the strategy, the SOFC is the used as the prior energy source. The UC is utilized as a complement and/or backup device to cover the slow dynamics of the SOFC during transient, while the ELZ is used as a dump load to generate hydrogen for SOFC during surplus power. The proposed system is synchronized to the grid through power electronic converters to enhance the reliability and continuity of power. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under real-world record of load conditions.

However, the high write power consumption has become a main challenge in adopting PCM as main memory. In addition to the fact that writing to PCM cells requires high write current and voltage, current loss in the charge pumps (CPs) also contributes a large percentage of the high power consumption. The pumping efficiency of a PCM chip is a concave function of the write current. Based on the characteristics of the concave function, the overall pumping efficiency can be improved if the write current is uniform. In this paper, we propose the peak-to-average (PTA) write scheme, which smooths the write current fluctuation by regrouping write units. An off-line optimal Integer Programming (IP) formulation and an efficient online algorithm are proposed to achieve this goal. Experimental results show that PTA can improve the charge pump efficiency to ∼40% with little overhead. Meanwhile, PTA can achieve 17.0% energy reduction on average. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Charge pump circuits; Computer aided design; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power utilization; Integer programming; Molecular physics; Concave function; Energy reduction; High power consumption; On-line algorithms; Peak to averages; Phase change memory (pcm); Pumping efficiency; Write currents; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996848832

The model of TEG was designed for the use of solar radiation as a heat source. An important feature of the design under study is the method of cooling of thermoelectric modules. Phase change material (PCM) absorbs heat during its melting, thus stabilizing temperature of the cool side of TEG. Basic performance characteristics, i.e. voltage and current generated vs. time, were measured during tests conducted for different electrical configurations of the unit, and for different heat fluxes on hot side of TEG. Temperature distributions in PCM container during the operation of TEG were also recorded. The reverse operation of TEG, i.e. when heat earlier accumulated in PCM is utilized, was tested as well.

The heterogeneity among different anatomical depots stems from their intrinsic differences in cellular and physiological properties, including developmental origin, adipogenic and proliferative capacity, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, hormonal control, thermogenic ability and vascularization. Additional factors that influence adipose tissue heterogeneity are genetic predisposition, environment, gender and age. Under obese condition, these depot-specific differences translate into specific fat distribution patterns, which are closely associated with differential cardiometabolic risks.

Various lead chalcogenides (binary, ternary, and quaternary alloys) in the form of quantum dots (QDs) or quantum wells provide narrow bandgap energies that cover the broad infrared region corresponding to wavelengths of 1-30 μm. Here, we report an inexpensive, all-solution-based synthesis strategy to thin-film solids consisting of 5-16 nm PbTe QDs encapsulated by CdTe shells. Colloidally synthesized PbTe QDs were first converted into core-shell PbTe/CdTe QDs, and then deposited as thin films. The subsequent fusion of the CdTe shells is achieved by ligand removal and annealing in the presence of CdCl2. Contrary to highly unstable bare PbTe QDs, PbTe/CdTe QD solids exhibit bright and stable near- to mid-infrared emission at wavelengths of 1-3 μm, which is also retained upon prolonged storage at ambient conditions for one year.

The effects on energy use of behavioural (stochastic profiles of occupancy and end uses) and physical variations (size, orientation, insulation and air tightness) amongst many buildings is examined. Rather than investigating just the variability of these factors, the aim is to identify subsequent impacts on building energy use. To achieve this, dynamic building energy simulations in EnergyPlus are performed. Results include total demands and their distributions, and temporal and probabilistic profiles. Very large variations in total heating demand are noted. Temporal profiles show changes in peak loads, load durations and periods of zero load. Probabilistic profiles and cumulative distributions show that a few buildings are responsible for the majority of total loads.

The PPy-NF serves as the conducting medium to absorb microwave energy to heat the chemicals that provide the metal and the chalcogenide constituents separately. The MCs are formed as nanoparticles that eventually undergo a size-dependent, multi-stage aggregation process to yield different kinds of MC nanostructures.

To date, a considerable series of achievements have been made. However, the presence of fast quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in most SMMs, especially in single-ion magnets (SIMs), provides a rapid relaxation route and often sets up a limit for the relaxation time. Here, we pursue the pentagonal bipyramidal symmetry to suppress the QTM and present pentagonal bipyramidal Dy(III) SIMs [Dy(Cy3PO)2(H2O)5]Cl3·(Cy3PO)·H2O·EtOH (1) and [Dy(Cy3PO)2(H2O)5]Br3·2(Cy3PO)·2H2O·2EtOH (2), (Cy3PO = tricyclohexyl phosphine oxide).

We answer this question by applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to a variety of scenarios for future power generation in the UAE. LCA is the methodology for quantification of environmental burdens and impacts related to the life cycle of a product or service. It allows unbiased comparison of the environmental performance of a set of potential power sources in the UAE (natural gas, oil, nuclear, solar, wind) including complete power generation chains from resource extraction to waste disposal and supports understanding of the environmental implications of a shift in electricity supply options over time in the UAE. Future scenarios are built under consideration of ongoing political activities, technical and geographical constraints, and projected future power demand. We show that all future electricity mixes (per unit of electricity generated) perform better than today's in most environmental impact categories, but no scenario performs clearly best. However, due to the expected substantial increase in absolute power demand, the overall environmental impacts of the electricity sector in the UAE will grow further. Continued use of domestic and cheap natural gas and oil resources for power generation and at the same time substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be realized by implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the electricity sector. Nuclear power and concentrated solar power show positive environmental effects in most impact categories; however, their contribution to electricity supply faces technical, economic and social limitations. In conclusion, a diversification of the electricity production, i.e. introducing new clean technologies, together with efforts to cut down electricity consumption per capita seem most promising for the future of the UAE from the environmental perspective. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity generation; Environmental impacts and burdens; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Power supply; Sustainability; United Arab Emirates","Carbon capture; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Oil shale; Petroleum deposits; Radioactive waste disposal; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Carbon capture and storage; Electricity generation; Environmental footprints; Environmental implications; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Power supply; United Arab Emirates; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027930855

This study focused on understanding how land management and climate change have together influenced terrestrial N storage and watershed inorganic N export across boreal and sub-arctic landscapes in northern Sweden. Using long-term discharge and nutrient concentration data that have been collected continuously for over three decades, we calculated the hydrologic inorganic N export from nine watersheds in this region. We found a consistent decline in inorganic N export from 1985 to 2011 over the entire region from both small and large watersheds, despite the absence of any long-term trend in river discharge during this period. The steepest declines in inorganic N export were observed during the growing season, consistent with the hypothesis that observed changes are biologically mediated and are not the result of changes in long-term hydrology. Concurrent with the decrease in inorganic N export, we report sustained increases in terrestrial N accumulation in forest biomass and soils across northern Sweden. Given the close communication of nutrient and energy stores between plants, soils, and waters, our results indicate a regional tightening of the N cycle in an already N-limited environment as a result of changes in forest management and climate-mediated growth increases. Our results are consistent with declining inorganic N efflux previously reported from small headwater streams in other ecosystems and shed new light on the mechanisms controlling these patterns by identifying corresponding shifts in the terrestrial N balance, which have been altered by a combination of management activities and climate change. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Boreal forest; Climate-mediated growth increases; Forest management; Soil N storage; Sweden; Terrestrial biogeochemistry; Terrestrial N retention","biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; biomass; boreal forest; climate change; forest management; growing season; growth rate; headwater; human activity; inorganic nitrogen; land management; landscape; river basin; river discharge; soil nitrogen; stream; subarctic region; watershed; Sweden; nitrogen; water pollutant; chemistry; forest; river; Sweden; time factor; water flow; water pollutant; Forests; Nitrogen; Rivers; Sweden; Time Factors; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969753397

Their unique physicochemical properties have been highly utilized in electrochemistry, commonly in the form of IL-carbon nanomaterial (IL-CNM) hybrids. The synergistic combination of both components results in significant improvement for numerous electrochemical applications, including energy storage devices and sensor electrodes. The need for high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, high sensitivity, and catalytic activity was the key behind the extent of ILs usefulness and numerous applications. This review aims to provide an overview of the synthetic routes for electrochemical sensor fabrication based on IL-CNM hybrids. The differences in sensing performance between the electrode designs are also discussed. ILs can affect the structure and surface chemistry of CNMs, including carbon nanotube, graphene, and fullerene. IL-CNM-modified solid electrode was the most common and effective design used in academic research. However, the inclusion of biological components and metallic nanoparticles significantly affects electrode performance. The electrochemical techniques used for detection have varied based on several considerations related to electrode design and targeted analyte. They also play an important role in determining the sensor sensitivity and detection limit. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As it is a more recent abstraction, little is known about energy consumption of Software Transactional Memories (STM). In this context, this work presents an analysis and characterization of energy consumption and performance of four Transactional Memory libraries: TL2, Tiny STM, Swiss TM, and Adapt STM, using the STAMP benchmarks. Although most works in the state-of-the-art chose to evaluate Transactional Memories through simulation, in this work the benchmarks are run in actual computers, avoiding the known issues with modeling power consumption in simulators. Our results show that Swiss TM is the most efficient library of the four in terms of energy consumption and performance for the default configurations, followed by Adapt STM, Tiny STM, and TL2, for most of the execution scenarios and 8 threads at most. STM's scalability is directly tied to the strategies for detection and resolution of conflicts. In this perspective, Adapt STM is the best STM for applications with short transactions, Swiss TM presents the best results for medium transactions, and long transactions with medium/high contention are best handled by TL2. On the other hand, Tiny STM shows the worst scalability for most scenarios, but with good results for applications with very small abort rates. © 2015 IEEE.","Green computing; Software transactional memory; transactional memory","Abstracting; Benchmarking; Computer programming; Computer software; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Scalability; Storage allocation (computer); Analysis and characterization; Computing environments; Concurrent programming; Execution scenario; Scalability evaluation; Software transactional memory; Synchronization mechanisms; Transactional memory; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964049077

Moreover, braking safety must be maintained under complex conditions. As the actuator, the electric traction motor has much better features than the internal combustion engine, e.g., faster torque response and capability for energy feedback. From the perspective of energy efficiency and safety, highlighting regenerative braking is a meaningful but challenging problem. In this paper, a braking system using only electric motors/generators as the actuators is investigated, in which the energy may be potentially fed back to the onboard energy storage system (ESS) as much as possible. The energy that may be recovered to the ESS is analyzed. To maintain the stability and to improve the performance of the regenerative braking in unknown tire-road conditions, a knowledge-based methodology in a hierarchical control structure is proposed, where the maximum adhesion force and the motor reference torque (MRT) are determined online. The proposed methodology avoids the complex determination of the optimum slip ratio, while acquiring nearly the optimum antiskid braking performance. Simulation and experiment were carried out to validate the effectiveness. © 2015 IEEE.","antilock braking; electric vehicle; regenerative braking; slip control","Actuators; Electric traction; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Knowledge based systems; Regenerative braking; Traction motors; Adhesion forces; Anti-lock braking; Complex condition; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy feedbacks; Hierarchical control structure; On-board energy storage; Slip control; Braking performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963818134

The circuit configuration and operation principle are provided in this paper. The model of the proposed voltage equalizer is also derived.

Together, this can form the basis for truly sustainable electrochemical energy storage. We explore the efforts made on electrode materials of organic salts, primarily carbonyl compounds but also Schiff bases, unsaturated compounds, nitroxides and polymers. Moreover, sodiated carbonaceous materials derived from biomasses and waste products are surveyed.

Previously, we showed that a gluten-free diet reduces weight gain without changing food intake in mice fed high-fat diets. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gluten intake on fat metabolism, thermogenesis and energy expenditure in mice fed a standard or high-fat diet.Methods:Mice were fed four different experimental diets during 8 weeks: a control-standard diet (CD), a CD added with 4.5% of wheat gluten (CD-G), a high-fat diet (HFD) and a HFD added with 4.5% of wheat gluten (HFD-G). After 8 weeks, the mice received 99m Tc-radiolabeled gluten orally to study gluten absorption and biodistribution or they underwent indirect calorimetry. After killing, subcutaneous and brown adipose tissues (SAT and BAT) were collected to assess thermogenesis-related protein expression. Lipid metabolism was studied in adipocyte cultures from the four groups.Results:Despite having had the same energy intake, CD-G and HFD-G mice exhibited increased body weight and fat deposits compared with their respective controls. 99m Tc-GLU or its peptides were detected in the blood, liver and visceral adipose tissue, suggesting that gluten can even reach extraintestinal organs. Uncoupling protein-1 expression was reduced in the BAT of HFD-G and in the SAT of CD-G and HFD-G mice. Indirect calorimetry showed lower oxygen volume consumption in CD-G and HFD-G groups compared with their controls. In HFD mice, daily energy expenditure was reduced with gluten intake. Gluten also reduced adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPARγ and hormone-sensitive lipase in cultures of isolated adipocytes from HFD mice, whereas in the CD-G group, gluten intake increased interleukin-6 expression and tended to increase that of tumor necrosis factor.Conclusions:Wheat gluten promotes weight gain in animals on both HFD and CD, partly by reducing the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissues. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"adiponectin; gluten; gluten tc 99m; hormone sensitive lipase; interleukin 6; osteogenic protein 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; radiopharmaceutical agent; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal model; Article; basal metabolic rate; body composition; body weight; brown adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; calorimetry; controlled study; drug distribution; energy expenditure; food intake; intestine absorption; intraabdominal fat; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; priority journal; protein expression; radioactivity; subcutaneous fat; supplementation; thermogenesis; weight gain; white adipose tissue; adipogenesis; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; gene expression regulation; metabolism; obesity; physiology; thermogenesis; weight gain; Adipogenesis; Adiposity; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Gene Expression Regulation; Glutens; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960801354

We have previously shown decreased expression and activity of these lipases in adipose tissue of obese insulin resistant individuals. Here we hypothesized that lipase deficiency might impact on insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis in adipocytes not just by enhancing lipid accumulation, but also by altering lipid and carbohydrate catabolism in a peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor (PPAR)-dependent manner.Methods:To address our hypothesis, we performed a series of in vitro experiments in a human white adipocyte model, the human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells, using genetic (siRNA) and pharmacological knockdown of ATGL and/or HSL.Results:We show that ATGL and HSL knockdown in hMADS adipocytes disrupted mitochondrial respiration, which was accompanied by a decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) protein content. This lead to a reduced exogenous and endogenous palmitate oxidation following ATGL knockdown, but not in HSL deficient adipocytes. ATGL deficiency was followed by excessive triacylglycerol accumulation, and HSL deficiency further increased diacylglycerol accumulation. Both single and double lipase knockdown reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was attributable to impaired insulin signaling.

Usually, these happen with little fluctuation. However, they tend to fluctuate seriously because of the low clear sky index in Malaysia and they become more severe when the installation and distribution of single-phase renewable energy sources are rather arbitrary and not monitored by utility companies. To ensure effective operation of distribution networks with PV systems, an improved version of a three-phase fuzzy control algorithm for distributed energy storage (ES) systems is proposed. With this algorithm, distributed energy storage systems can control individual phase voltage to mitigate the voltage unbalance factor effectively, maintaining voltage magnitude without cutting any excess renewable energy. An experimental low-voltage distribution network with two 3.6-kWp PV systems was set up. A number of case studies under various generation and demand conditions were carried out to evaluate the performance of the three single-phase energy storage systems with the novel fuzzy control algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively coordinate the systems to mitigate voltage unbalance and maintain the voltage level of low-voltage distribution networks with PV systems. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Fuzzy control algorithm; Low-voltage distribution networks; Photovoltaic; Three-phase; Voltage unbalance factor","Algorithms; Data storage equipment; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Fuzzy control; Renewable energy resources; Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed energy storages; Energy storage systems; Low voltage distribution network; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy source; Three phase; Voltage unbalance factors; Voltage distribution measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958811891

Due to its high density and low standby power, phase change memory (PCM), an emerging non-volatile memory device, is becoming a promising dynamic random access memory (DRAM) alternative. Recent studies have proposed the hybrid main memory architecture integrating both PCM and DRAM to fully take advantage of the properties of both memories. However, the low power performance of PCM in the hybrid main memory architecture has not been fully explored. Therefore, it becomes an interesting problem to utilize PCM and DRAM as hybrid main memory for energy optimization in embedded systems. In this paper, we present an energy optimization technique for hybrid main memory architecture. The objective is to fully utilize PCM to reduce the energy consumption while ensuring that the real-time performance of applications are guaranteed. We propose a two-phase approach to solve hybrid main memory address mapping problem. In the first phase, we calculate energy and time cost for each address based on the task models. Then the applications can be modeled as data-flow graph nodes, and different access times will associate with different energy consumption. In the second phase, for different memory types and the given timing constraint, we formulate the scheduling problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model and obtain an optimal solution. The ILP model can map a proper memory type for each address such that the total energy consumption can be minimized while the timing constraint is satisfied. In addition, we propose a heuristic approach to efficiently obtain a near-optimal solution. We conduct experiments on an ARM-based simulator. The experimental results show that our method can effectively reduce the energy consumption with the least system cost compared with the previous work. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Embedded systems; Energy consumption; Hybrid memory architecture; PCM (phase change memory)","ARM processors; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Memory architecture; Mobile devices; Optimal systems; Optimization; Phase change memory; Power management; Random access storage; Scheduling; Dynamic random access memory; Emerging non-volatile memory; Integer linear programming models; Low power performance; Near-optimal solutions; Phase change memory (pcm); Real time performance; Total energy consumption; Dynamic random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958779009

Composite boards were prepared by mixing 1-30% by weight nano-encapsulated n-octadecane phase change material (PCM) with gypsum to develop gypsum-based building materials with thermal energy storage (TES) capability. The nanocapsules were prepared by encapsulating n-octadecane in nano-sized styrene-methyl-methacrylate copolymer shells using one-step mini-emulsion in situ polymerization. A thermal performance testing device was designed to evaluate the heat storage effect of the resulting gypsum composite. The results indicated that composite boards containing n-octadecane nanocapsules effectively decreased the temperature peak of the experimental test room compared with gypsum board without n-octadecane nanocapsules. This suggested that the composite boards had good thermal energy storage properties.

These mutations result in cholesterol and glycosphingolipid accumulation in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Complications in the storage of cholesterol in NPC1 mutant cells are associated with other anomalies, such as altered distribution of intracellular organelles and properties of the plasma membrane. The pathomechanism of NPC disease is largely unknown. Interestingly, other storage diseases such as Gaucher and Farber diseases are accompanied by severe mitochondrial dysfunction. This prompted us to investigate the effect of absence or dysfunction of the NPC1 protein on mitochondrial properties to confirm or deny a putative relationship between NPC1 mutations and mitochondrial function. This study was performed on primary skin fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of two NPC patients, carrying mutations in the NPC1 gene. We observed altered organization of mitochondria in NPC1 mutant cells, significant enrichment in mitochondrial cholesterol content, increased respiration, altered composition of the respiratory chain complex, and substantial reduction in cellular ATP level. Thus, a primary lysosomal defect in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts is accompanied by deregulation of the organization and function of the mitochondrial network. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.All rights reserved..","Accumulation; Cholesterol; Human Niemann-Pick type C1 mutant fibroblasts; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Organization of mitochondrial network","adenosine triphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; carrier protein; cholesterol; membrane protein; multienzyme complex; NPC1 protein, human; reactive oxygen metabolite; adult; Article; cell mutant; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; gene; gene mutation; human; human cell; human tissue; male; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; Niemann Pick disease; normal human; NPC1 gene; priority journal; reduction; respiratory chain; skin biopsy; skin fibroblast; biosynthesis; case control study; energy metabolism; fibroblast; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane potential; mutation; Niemann Pick disease; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; pathology; physiology; skin; ultrastructure; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adult; Carrier Proteins; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol; Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Fibroblasts; Humans; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; Mutation; Niemann-Pick Diseases; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen Consumption; Reactive Oxygen Species; Skin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958092486

Net power, net electrical efficiency, and economic analysis were carried out for the selected HTFs for different collector outlet temperature cases. In the case of condenser type selection four different systems were considered; water cooled, air cooled (dry air) and air cooled with water spraying (spraying before fan and spraying before and after fan). Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and specific investment cost were calculated. According to the results, specific investment cost and LCOE were found to be 4000 USD/kWel and 0.207 USD/kW h, respectively. Carbon tax/credit was also included to the calculations of LCOE and a comparison study was carried out for gas turbine, combined cycle and solar thermal power plant with thermal storage.

The method is based on the insertion of a second output-voltage feedback loop as can be inferred from the Mason's gain formula. Three basic modes of virtual-output-impedance shaping (proportional, derivative, integral) are discussed and the closed-loop output-impedance characteristics due to each of them are analyzed in detail and with their The'venin equivalent circuits derived. Despite the suitability of integral feedback for minimizing converter's output impedance, it can give rise to an unwanted resonance peak near the converter's crossover frequency, thus potentially destabilizing the system. The solution to the problem using combination of basic virtual-outputimpedance shaping modes and its practical implementation are discussed. When implemented on a fuel-cell-battery-powered dualactive-bridge dc-dc converter, the second-harmonic distortion of dc bus voltage is shown to have been reduced by 85.5% compared to a conventionally PI-compensated system. © 2015 IEEE.","Bidirectional converters; DC-DC converters; Dual active bridge; Energy storages; Fuel cells; Outputimpedance shaping","Electric batteries; Electric impedance; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Equivalent circuits; Fuel cells; Power converters; Renewable energy resources; Two term control systems; Voltage regulators; Bidirectional converter (BDC); Dc-bus voltage regulations; Design and implementations; Dual active bridges; Outputimpedance shaping; Renewable energy systems; Second harmonic distortion; Virtual output impedances; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949595750

Moreover, the present analysis scrutinize the extent to which the various economic operators within specific segments of the power supply chain invest in a portfolio of research and development activities, among which the electricity grids and storage technologies. The intensity of these research investments was mapped across the European countries for the year of 2011. Their geographic distribution confirms the rationale of an analysis based on canonical correlation testing the associations between RES market diffusion and power network indicators. The analysis provides useful insights for specific technology, such as the one revealing PV market sensitivity to research investments in storage technologies, confirming a potential business model coupling the two technologies.

Under the European Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) program, several breakthrough technologies for the drastic reduction of CO2 emissions from iron and steelmaking industry have been investigated, including (1) blast furnace with top-gas recycling (TGR-BF),(2) a new smelting reduction process (HIsarna), (3) advanced direct reduction (ULCORED) and (4) electrolysis of iron ore (ULCOWIN and ULCOLYSIS). Besides, hydrogen-based steel making and the use of biomass as reducing agent have been evaluated as supporting technology to decrease CO2 emissions. The aim of the present article is to analyze the technological developments in iron and steel industry and the progress of present experimental works developed inside the ULCOS I and II projects by collating updated information from a wide range of sources. In addition, the breakthrough technologies expected to develop or are currently being demonstrated at pilot/industrial scale for significant reduction of CO2 emissions in Europe have been identified in this paper. Economic and environmental performance of the ULCOS cutting edge technologies shows that the implementation of CCS technology in coal-based integrated steel plants might reduce 80% of CO2 emissions. However, hydrogen and biomass-based steelmaking also offers very attractive perspectives, while raising lots of major challenges.

In this context, substituted norbornadiene-quadricyclane systems have received renewed interest due to recent advances in their synthesis. The optical, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these systems can vary dramatically depending on the chosen substituents. The molecular design of optimal compounds therefore requires a detailed understanding of the effect of individual substituents as well as their interplay. Here, we model absorption spectra, potential energy storage, and thermal barriers for back-conversion of several substituted systems using both single-reference (density functional theory using PBE, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M06, M06-2x, and M06-L functionals as well as MP2 calculations) and multireference methods (complete active space techniques). Already the diaryl substituted compound displays a strong red-shift compared to the unsubstituted system, which is shown to result from the extension of the conjugated π-system upon substitution. Using specific donor/acceptor groups gives rise to a further albeit relatively smaller red-shift. The calculated storage energy is found to be rather insensitive to the specific substituents, although solvent effects are likely to be important and require further study. The barrier for thermal back-conversion exhibits strong multireference character and as a result is noticeably correlated with the red-shift. Two possible reaction paths for the thermal back-conversion of diaryl substituted quadricyclane are identified and it is shown that among the compounds considered the path via the acceptor side is systematically favored. Finally, the present study establishes the basis for high-throughput screening of norbornadiene-quadricyclane compounds as it provides guidelines for the level of accuracy that can be expected for key properties from several different techniques. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Associative storage; Calculations; Density functional theory; Doppler effect; Heat storage; Potential energy; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solvents; Complete active space; Conjugated pi-systems; High throughput screening; Molecular photoswitches; Multireference methods; Renewable energy applications; Solar thermal storages; Substituted compounds; Organic polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959267600

However, its application is limited partly because it cannot be synthesized easily. In this work, we successfully synthesized phase-pure layered LiMnO2 in a one-step low-temperature process using electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) as the manganese precursor at 450 °C in Ar atmosphere by a carbothermal reduction method. The initial carbon to manganese ratio has to be optimized to remove impurities. The particle size of the material is between 40 and 60 nm. The synthesized sample shows an initial reversible capacity of about 180 mAh g-1. The synthesis method is further applied to make boron-doped samples, which significantly enhanced the stability of the material, especially at high temperature. The boron-doped samples maintain a capacity of 150 mAh g-1 for 100 cycles and give a capacity of about 100 mAh g-1 at a current of 1000 mA g-1 (equivalent to 10C rate).

Coffee classification for trading is related to several factors, including grain size. Larger grains have higher market value then smaller ones. Coffee grain size is determined by the development of the perisperm, a transient tissue with a higly active metabolism, which is replaced by the endosperm during seed development. In this study, a proteomics approach was used to identify differentially accumulated proteins during perisperm development in two genotypes with regular (IPR59) and large grain sizes (IPR59-Graudo) in three developmental stages. Twenty-four spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS, corresponding to 15 proteins. We grouped them into categories as follows: storage (11S), methionine metabolism, cell division and elongation, metabolic processes (mainly redox), and energy. Our data enabled us to show that perisperm metabolism in IPR59 occurs at a higher rate than in IPR59-Graudo, which is supported by the accumulation of energy and detoxification-related proteins. We hypothesized that grain and fruit size divergences between the two coffee genotypes may be due to the comparatively earlier triggering of seed development processes in IPR59. We also demonstrated for the first time that the 11S protein is accumulated in the coffee perisperm. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","grain size; perisperm metabolism; proteomics; quality; seed development","Amino acids; Cell proliferation; Coffee; Commerce; Detoxification; Developing countries; Digital storage; Grain size and shape; Image quality; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Physiology; Tissue; Developmental stage; Grain size; Large grain sizes; Metabolic process; Perisperm; Proteomics; Seed development; Tissue development; Proteins; coffee; plant protein; chemistry; Coffea; coffee; growth, development and aging; mass spectrometry; metabolism; plant seed; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Coffea; Coffee; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Mass Spectrometry; Plant Proteins; Proteomics; Seeds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959205136

To estimate the small probability of large power spills, we used the splitting technique for rare-event simulations and to do so, we formulated an appropriate Importance Function such that the workload of the probability estimator is reduced compared to the conventional Crude Monte Carlo estimator. We find that the ramp constraint imposed on the charging/discharging rate of the storage device plays a major role in minimizing large power spills. A new charging strategy for the battery is applied to reduce the large power spills further which results in a trade-off between reductions in large and average power spills, respectively. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Charging (batteries); Economic and social effects; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Wind power; Charging strategies; Charging/discharging; Efficient estimator; Importance functions; Monte Carlo Estimators; Probability estimator; Rare event simulation; Splitting techniques; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962869332

The 10 wt.% CeCl3-added MgH2 sample showed an improvement in hydrogenation sorption properties compared to that of undoped MgH2, with the onset dehydrogenation temperature reduced from 350 °C to 300 °C. Kinetic desorption results showed that CeCl3-added MgH2 released about 5.5 wt.% hydrogen within 10 min at 350 °C, while the as-milled MgH2 released below 3.1wt.% hydrogen within the same time period and temperature. Meanwhile, hydrogen absorption capacity of 5.2 wt.% was reached at 280 °C in 5 min for the CeCl3-doped MgH2 sample. In contrast, the ball-milled MgH2 only absorbed 4.0 wt.% hydrogen at 280 °C in 5 min. From the Kissinger plot of differential scanning calorimetry, the apparent activation energy was 167.0 kJ/mol for as-milled MgH2 and 149.0 kJ/mol for 10 wt.% CeCl3-added MgH2, indicating that CeCl3 addition decreased the activation energy for hydrogen desorption of MgH2.

ROT cooling uses large quantities of water to cool the steel plate. Optimizing heat transfer in the ROT would reduce the amount of water used, which will lower the amount of energy needed for pumping, filtering, storage and use of water. Optimization will therefore result in a direct energy saving as well as increasing the product quality. This study investigates heat transfer by turbulent water jets impinging on a hot flat steel plate at temperatures below the boiling point in order to understand convection heat transfer phenomena. This is an important stage that precedes the boiling and addresses the applicability of the heat transfer correlations available in the literature. A single axisymmetric jet and a pair of interacting jets are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model under steady and transient conditions and the k- e turbulence model are used in both 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations. We investigate the influence of the water flow rate on the jet cooling characteristics and develop a correlation for the radial position of the maximum Nusselt number based on numerical results. Two sets of boundary conditions - constant temperature and constant heat flux - are applied at the surface of the steel plate and evaluated. The single jet numerical results compare favourably with published data based on measurements and analytical models. The thermal performance of a two-jet system was found to be no better than a single jet because the jets were too far from each other to generate any additional thermal interaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CFD; Flat surface; Heat transfer; Impingement; Interaction; Liquid jets","Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Fighter aircraft; Flow of water; Gas dynamics; Heat convection; Heat flux; Jets; Liquids; Navier Stokes equations; Quality control; Turbulence models; Constant temperature; Flat surfaces; Heat transfer correlation; Impingement; Interaction; K-E turbulence model; Liquid jets; Reynolds averaged navier-stokes models; Heat transfer; boundary condition; computational fluid dynamics; heat transfer; jet; Navier-Stokes equations; numerical model; thermal convection; turbulent flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954368825

Since PV system cost is decreasing and the electricity market is constantly evolving there is marked interest in understanding the performance and economic benefits of adding battery systems to PV generation under different retail tariffs. The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i.e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for every day of the year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28% higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the flat rate tariff, the levelised cost increases by 94% for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability. The main reason for this is the reduction of equivalent full cycles performed with by battery systems with the dynamic tariff. Economic benefits also depend on the regulatory context and Li-ion battery systems were able to achieve internal rate of return (IRR) up to 0.8% and 4.3% in the region of Jura (Switzerland) and Germany due to higher retail electricity prices (0.25.

In the context of the multilevel governance paradigm, this article examines the governance of climate change and energy policy in Shanghai, a rapidly growing Chinese megacity highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although the energy and carbon intensity of Shanghai's economy have fallen significantly since China launched its economic reforms, overall carbon emissions in the municipality continue to rise. Through examining the Shanghai case, this article argues that Chinese subnational climate mitigation policy is dominated by hierarchical governance arrangements. Nevertheless, shifts in national climate and energy policy since 2007 have mandated provincial-level governments, including Shanghai, to develop their own climate and energy policies while offering greater local autonomy for incorporating climate and energy issues into development goals: is this attributable to a decentred form of multilevel governance? The article concludes that Shanghai's climate mitigation and energy policy is dominated by hierarchical governance whereby policies are 'downloaded' from the central government.

To make a step aside from pure applications, we studied earlier a multi-scale percolation, employing any k×k basic cluster for non-interacting particles. Here, with interactions included, we examine in what way they alter the percolation threshold for any cluster case. We found that at a fixed length scale k, the interaction reduces the range of shifts of the percolation threshold. To determine the critical concentrations, the simplified EMA-model is used. It diminishes the number of local conductivities into two main ones. In the presence of a dominance of the repulsive interaction over the thermal energy, the exact percolation thresholds at two small scales can be revealed from analytical formulas. Furthermore, at large scales, the highest possible value of the estimated threshold can be obtained. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Usually, a biogas-driven CHP is used for both electricity generation and digester heating. However, a huge amount of heat has to be released during the summer in subtropical areas when the heating demand is low. So the tri-generation system, created by enhancing the CHP scheme with an absorption chiller, was proposed to address the defect. In summer, the huge amount of waste heat drives the chiller and produces chilled water for space cooling. Four possible tri-generation retrofitting schemes were proposed with different types of absorption chiller. The hourly dynamic energy performances of the four systems were simulated by the established mathematic models under Hong Kong weather data. Then detailed economic analysis was conducted to the four systems. The results show that the double effect absorption chiller driven by bypass of 450°C flue gas is the optimal retrofitting scheme for its highest thermal efficiency, shortest payback period, better stability and easier control.

A conceptual formulation of the interoperability requirements, as well as a comparative study of their fulfillment by state-of-the-art communication techniques, is presented. VPP requirements are then mapped against services and information models of IEC 61850 and common information model (CIM) power utility automation standards. Proposals are given for extensions of the IEC 61850 standard to enhance the interaction between the VPP controller and the distributed energy resources. Finally, the methodology and concepts are applied to a specific VPP consisting of hydro and wind plants, solar photovoltaic (PV) power, and storage facilities. Several applications to provide grid services from the proposed VPP in an existing 50-kV grid are covered.

The major drawbacks of GC-eDRAMs are their limited data retention times (RTs) and the large spread of RT across an array, which degrade energy-efficiency due to refresh cycles. While the array refresh rate can be determined according to circuit simulation or post-manufacturing calibration, there is a lack of analytical and statistical RT models for GC-eDRAM that could unveil the limiters and circuit parameters that lead to the large observed RT spreads. In this work, we derive the first comprehensive analytical model for the statistical distribution of the per-cell retention time of 2T-bitcell GC-eDRAMs, which is found to follow a log-normal distribution. The accuracy of the proposed retention time model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo and worst case distance circuit simulations and silicon measurements of an 0.18 μm test chip. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis unveils the circuit parameters that have the highest impact on the RT spread. Interestingly, the variability of the threshold voltage of the write access transistor has a much higher impact on the RT spread than the variability of any other circuit parameter, including the storage node capacitor. This holds true under process scaling, for nodes as advanced as 28 nm, as shown through simulation. The insights gained from the retention time model help circuit designers achieve better GC-eDRAMs with longer RTs and sharper RT distributions. In addition, the herein presented model can be used as a basis to study the reliability/energy trade-off for GC-eDRAM usage in fault-tolerant VLSI systems. © 2016 IEEE.","Embedded DRAM; gain cells; integrated circuit modeling; leakage currents; model validation; MOS integrated circuits; parasitic capacitance; retention time; semiconductor memory; sensitivity analysis; statistical analysis","Capacitance; Computer circuits; Dynamic random access storage; Economic and social effects; Electric network parameters; Energy efficiency; Leakage currents; Monte Carlo methods; Normal distribution; Semiconductor storage; Sensitivity analysis; Silicon; Static random access storage; Statistical methods; Threshold voltage; Embedded DRAM; Gain cell; Integrated circuit modeling; Model validation; MOS integrated circuit; Parasitic capacitance; Retention time; Semiconductor memory; Circuit simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960532754

While regular physical activity postpones these age-related derangements, this is not always possible in the elderly because of disabilities or risk of injury. Whole-body vibration (WBV) training may be considered as an alternative to physical activity particularly in the frail population. To explore this possibility, we characterized whole-body and organ-specific metabolic processes in 6-month and 25-month old mice, over a period of 14 weeks of WBV versus sham training. WBV training tended to increase blood glucose turnover rates and stimulated hepatic glycogen utilization during fasting irrespective of age. WBV was effective in reducing white fat mass and hepatic triglyceride content only in old but not in young mice and these reductions were related to upregulation of hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling of metabolism (assessed by high-resolution respirometry) and increased expression of uncoupling protein 2. Because these changes occurred independent of changes in food intake and whole-body metabolic rate (assessed by indirect calorimetry), the liver-specific effects of WBV may be a primary mechanism to improve metabolic health during aging, rather than that it is a consequence of alterations in energy balance. © 2016 Reijne et al.

Cell ageing is however markedly pronounced at elevated voltages and results in accelerated overall performance fade and increased safety concerns. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry, combined with cell pressure analysis, is for the first time shown to provide a powerful means for in situ investigation of degradation mechanisms in aqueous electrolyte/carbon based supercapacitors. The activated carbon electrodes possess high specific surface area and oxygen-based surface functionalities (mainly phenol, lactone and anhydride groups), which are oxidized already at a cell voltage of 0.6 V to provoke the evolution of minor amounts of CO and CO2. Noticeable water decomposition starts at a high voltage of 1.6 V with the evolution of H2 on the negative electrode and carbon corrosion on the positive electrode with the generation of predominantly CO. In this paper we also report that short-term cycling leads to partly reversible gas evolution/consumption side-reactions giving negligible capacitance. On the other hand, long-term cycling causes irreversible side-reactions, deteriorates the electrochemical performance, and increases the internal pressure of the cell. Repeated cycling (U &lt; 2 V) is confirmed as a more harmful technique for the electrode integrity compared to the voltage holding in a floating test. In situ gas analysis is shown to provide valuable insights into the electrochemical cell ageing aspects, such as the nature and potential onsets of side-reactions, hence paving the way for fundamental understanding and mitigating the performance and safety loss of high-energy aqueous supercapacitors. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activated carbon; Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon dioxide; Degradation; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Mass spectrometry; Activated carbon electrode; Degradation mechanism; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage applications; High specific surface area; In-situ investigations; Online electrochemical mass spectrometries; Surface functionalities; Electrolytic capacitors; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; corrosion; decomposition; electrical power; electrochemistry; electrolyte; safety; surface area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958093356

In islanded operation, BES system is transferred to single master operation during which the frequency and voltage of the islanded microgrid are regulated at the desired level.

This region is extremely fragile with endemic species like those that compose the upper mountain cloud forest (UMCF), and the dominant soils are typical Inceptisols. These forest environments are rapidly disappearing in Brazil. The changing land use combined with shallow Inceptisols lead to important effects on hydrology. Therefore, studies addressing streamflow behavior in these landscapes are urgently needed for understanding the groundwater recharge process. The objectives of this study were to investigate the role of shallow Inceptisols linked to the land use changes in the streamflow behavior of the Mantiqueira Range region and to understand the mechanisms of water flow into the saturated zone. To validate the study, a comparative analysis was developed for a representative watershed of Mantiqueira Range, whose land use is divided into pasture and Atlantic Forest, known as Lavrinha Creek Watershed (LCW) and a typical UMCF located inside of LCW. The results showed that in general, UMCF has greater potential for water percolation beginning from the surface layer towards the saturated zone. Micromorphological soil images provided useful information about the soil pore system associated with the physical properties of Inceptisols, and this background helped to understand the water recharge process and streamflow behavior. In addition, the water balance for two years (2009-2011) in the UMCF showed that the flow stored in the saturated zone occurs rapidly, increasing its potential for storage, characterized by the process of refilling water in the Inceptisols soil profile under forests in this region. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Atlantic forest; Hydropedology; Mantiqueira range; Micromorphology; Streamflow; Water recharge","Catchments; Flow of water; Forestry; Groundwater; Hydrology; Land use; Solvents; Stream flow; Watersheds; Atlantic forest; Hydropedology; Mantiqueira range; Micromorphologies; Water recharges; Soils; catchment; hydrological response; Inceptisol; land use change; micromorphology; phreatic zone; recharge; soil profile; streamflow; water budget; watershed; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Serra da Mantiqueira",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957012302

The need to adapt to international agreements, expected increase of CO2 emissions, limited technological capabilities to reduce emissions, the energy intensity of industry and geological conditions allowing underground storage make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a viable option to reduce CO2 emissions. The implementation of CCS on a commercial scale depends on many factors, including the development of capture technology, transport options, and the geological structure. Its applicability is highly dependent on the regulations and economic, energy, and environmental policy. At the current stage of work, the biggest problems in the implementation of CCS include legal regulations, social acceptance, and cost reduction. The numerous political and economic benefits may balance the costs of CCS technology implementation. The captured CO2 can be used in the exploitation of oil fields and in large-scale industrial processes.

Similarly to conventional power plants, there is a possibility of biomass co-firing, thus an additional reduction of CO2 emission is possible. Including the biomass in the fuel mixture of an integrated OFC power plant allows to obtain the so called ""neutral"" CO2 status as biomass combustion does not contribute to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In OFC power plants without biomass co-firing, even if 100% of CO2 is captured, there are still additional CO2 emissions in processes like fossil fuel extraction, transportation and preparation. The same assumption applies also to biomass and other materials (e.g. limestone or raw water). A higher share of biomass in the fuel mixture can lead to ""negative"" CO2 emissions with may be helpful to compensate the unfulfilled goals in other sectors where reduction is required. The paper presents the system approach to the environmental analysis based on the ""input-output"" method and both the index of the thermoecological cost and cumulative CO2 emissions. Thermoecological cost includes, the cumulative exergy consumption of non-renewable energy sources and additional exergy consumption due to harmful emissions to the atmosphere. In order to investigate the impact of bio-CCS (both biomass co-firing and dedicated biomass boilers) on the net thermoecological cost of electricity production and cumulative CO2 emissions five cases have been analyzed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Cumulative CO2 emission; Oxy-fuel combustion; Thermoecological cost","Biomass; Boiler firing; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Exergy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Lime; Mixtures; Clean coal technologies; CO2 emissions; Conventional power plants; Cost of electricity productions; Cumulative exergy consumption; Environmental analysis; Non-renewable energy sources; Oxyfuel combustion; Coal combustion; alternative energy; biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; combustion; electricity generation; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; gas transport; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956704900

For this purpose different building standards, different heating and cooling appliances and a cold storage concept are compared using annual building simulations. These simulations are carried out for central and northern locations in the US. The focus of this paper is the applicability of cold climate heat pumps in these climates. A coupled building and appliance model has been established to allow a fair comparison based on first energy usage and CO2 emissions. Altogether seven different building configurations in six different locations have been investigated. Simulation results show the most significant energy savings (up to 90%) can be achieved by improving building insulation and heat recovery of the ventilation system. Second major improvement is the usage of two-stage heat pump systems, which drastically reduces the need for backup heating systems and lead to seasonal efficiencies (SCOPs) in the area of 3.0, or in other words an energy saving of 20-35%. Thermal storage and control concepts such as night setback in comparison show little effect. The simulation results also showed that primary energy demand or greenhouse gas emissions are better measures for the comparison of environmental impact than COP and SCOP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and International Institute of Refrigeration.

Shallow donor defects self-doping and MnOx deposition are adopted to fulfill the two desired roles, respectively. Our results clearly demonstrated that the enhanced charge transfer resulted from vacuum induced defect self-doping could dramatically improve the water splitting performance and areal capacitance of the pristine TNAs, whilst the deposited manganese oxide species, serving as electrochemically active sites, can further substantially boost their energy conversion and storage efficiencies. As a result, the MnOx/TNAs anode exhibited a photoconversion efficiency of 0.56% in neutral Na2SO4, which is the highest value of TiO2 anode in the same electrolyte under AM 1.5G illumination. Also, the composite electrode presented an areal capacitance of 12.51mFcm-2 at 5mVs-1, nearly three orders of magnitude lager than that of the pristine TNAs counter electrode. Moreover, a specific capacitance of 1117Fg-1 (at 5mVs-1) was achieved based on the mass of deposited MnO2, which also ranks in the top performance level of MnO2 based supercapacitor devices.

Here, we introduce a facile modular approach to fabricate HSMs with tailored functional conducting polypyrrole microparticles (PPyMP). The PPyMPs were fabricated with a calcium carbonate (CaCO3) template-assisted polymerization technique in aqueous media at room temperature, thus providing a new green chemistry for producing water-processable functional polymers. The sacrificial CaCO3 template guided the polymerization process to yield homogenous PPyMPs with a narrow size distribution. The porous nature of the CaCO3 further allows the incorporation of various organic and inorganic dopants such as an electrocatalyst and redox mediator for the fabrication of functional PPyMPs. Dawson-type polyoxometalate (POM) and methylene blue (MB) were chosen as the model electrocatalyst and electron mediator dopant, respectively. Hierarchically structured electrochemical interfaces were created simply by self-assembly of the functional PPyMPs. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique by creating two different hierarchical structured electrochemical interfaces: POM-PPyMPs for hydrogen peroxide electrocatalysis and MB-PPyMPs for mediated bioelectrocatalysis. We envision that the presented design concept could be extended to different conducting polymers doped with other functional organic and inorganic dopants to develop advanced electrochemical interfaces and to create high surface area electrodes for energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","bioelectrocatalysis; electrocatalysis; hierarchical interfaces; microparticles; polyoxometalate; Polypyrrole; redox mediator","Aromatic compounds; Calcium carbonate; Catalysis; Conducting polymers; Design; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Fabrication; Organic polymers; Oxides; Polymerization; Polypyrroles; Self assembly; Bioelectro-catalysis; Hierarchical interface; Micro-particles; Polyoxometalates; Redox mediators; Phase interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954406412

The horizontal shell-and-finned tube comprises 24 and 48 radial fins for investigation in the laminar regime. The effect of external fin surface area on the heat transfer between the PCM and heat transfer fluid (HTF), distilled water, was studied. To realize this issue, the PCM charging and discharging times at different Reynolds number of HTF were investigated in the presence of both series of fins (24 and 48 fins).

The Brazilian steel industry is investing in research and slag reprocessing practices, aiming to reuse most of its metallic fraction and properly allocate the non-metallic fraction, saving energy and reducing mining impacts. Research results demonstrate the technical and environmental feasibility of steel slag aggregates for civil construction. However, it is essential to evaluate whether the processing of the slag is economically feasible for this purpose. Economic analysis of the processing of steel slag was conducted through simulation - Monte Carlo method - in which it is possible to determine the risks and uncertainties inherent to the project. The costs that comprise the proposed project, from design through construction and operation itself, were estimated at US$2.8 million.

The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50% to 80% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45% to 60% in emissions and from 25% to 50% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14% and 44% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23% in emissions, 36% in primary energy and 11% in costs. We identified close to 15% in emissions and 20% in primary energy savings with variable costs between -2% and 23% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The ice storage was designed with heat exchangers that can be de-iced and it was developed for heating applications using a combined solar thermal and heat pump system. Because of the inherent coupling between the ice storage and the ground, a ground model was developed and coupled with the ice storage for the validation. The ice storage model is based on a transient one dimensional energy equation derived along the height of the storage with equally distributed control volumes. The ground is solved with a transient heat conduction equation with a heat source term from the ice storage. The physical ground domain is discretized in an axial-symmetrical mesh concentrated in high density gradient regions close to the ice storage. The models are solved in sequence until global convergence is achieved. The model was found to be in good agreement in terms of ice storage temperature and energy exchanged by the heat exchangers. Extracted energy from the storage was very well predicted. However, differences were found in the energy delivered by the wall heat exchangers.

Since expired best-before date is a frequently cited cause of food waste in supermarkets, prolonging shelf life could reduce food waste. Longer shelf life could be achieved in different ways, e.g. reduced storage temperature. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the extent to which longer shelf life actually leads to reduced food waste, and whether the benefits of reduced waste exceed the increased energy costs of maintaining reduced storage temperature. Therefore this study calculated the net effect of reducing food waste in supermarkets by reducing the storage temperature through simulating the relationships between food waste reduction, longer shelf life, reduced storage temperature and increased energy costs. A case study was performed using three years of data on cheese, dairy, deli and meat product waste in six Swedish supermarkets, together with published data on microbiological growth at different temperatures and on the energy requirement for cold storage at different temperatures. Food waste was found to be reduced with lower storage temperature for all food products tested. This measure gave increasing net savings in terms of money and greenhouse gas emissions for meat products with decreasing storage temperature. Deli products had net savings close to zero, while for dairy and cheese products there were net losses, since the costs of reducing storage temperature exceeded the potential savings. Therefore, reducing storage temperature has the potential to reduce waste, but at a total net cost. However, a net benefit can be achieved if the measure is only introduced for products with high relative waste, low turnover and high value per unit mass. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results measured after the storage time indicated little pH change on the anode side of the gelatine samples with 0.5 and 2% NaCl; however, the pH was considerably reduced near the cathode side where the sodium ion concentration decreased by 34-39%. Furthermore, the application of DC inhibited bacterial growth, and this effect was strengthened by the addition of sodium chloride.

This technology couples the structural role of pile foundations with an energy supply using the principle of shallow geothermal energy. The exploitation of geothermal energy represents an additional thermal load that is imposed to the foundation and the surrounding soil. Because the primary role of energy piles is the stability of the overlying structure, this aspect must be ensured even in the presence of the additional thermal load. This study summarises the results of 3-D thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element analyses that investigated the behaviour of a group of energy piles for which field data were available. This allowed the nearly unique validation of the numerical approach with experimental data and a confirmation of the reliability of the results. The work provides a summary of the foundation behaviour under both conventional and extreme thermal loading conditions with reference to a geothermal operation of the piles for cooling and/or thermal energy storage applications within one season. The interaction between the piles is studied and the thermally induced group effects analysed. Attention is dedicated to the vertical stress and displacement developments in the piles.

This is done through a thought experiment that imagines a purely renewable based energy system, keeping all else equal. We start by noting that all countries have access to some form of renewable energy, though some are better endowed than others. We find two major implications for renewable energy based markets: a) countries face a make or buy decision, i.e. they have a choice to produce or import energy; b) electricity is the dominant energy carrier, implying a more physically integrated infrastructure with stringent managerial requirements. Two scenarios illustrate the strategic concerns arising from these implications: Continental, following a buy decision and more centralized network, and National, following a make decision and more decentralized network. Three observations stand out compared to the geopolitics of an energy system based on fossil fuels. First, a shift in considerations from getting access to resources to strategic positioning in infrastructure management.

In addition, the techno-economic feasibility of utilizing hybrid photovoltaic/wind/diesel with battery storage systems to meet the load of a typical rural healthcare facility at the selected sites were assessed. The optimum dimensions of the system are defined for the locations. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) was employed to conduct the study. Findings from the study showed that Sokoto and Jos exist in the high wind potential regions, while the remain sites are only suitable for small wind applications. Values obtained for global, beam and diffuse radiation as well as clearness index, show that all the sites enjoy considerable solar energy potential suitable for varying degree of solar energy applications. Monthly optimum tilt angle for Iseyin, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos, Enugu and Port-Harcourt lies in the range of 0-39.8°, 0-44.5°, 0-44.1°, 0-43.2°, 0-38.5° and 0-36.3° respectively thereby having the optimum angle to be equal to 0° in all sites in April, May, June, July and August. The simulation results from HOMER indicate that the hybrid system is the best option for all the sites considered in this study. The PV/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system configuration is considered optimum for RHC applications at Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos and Enugu, while hybrid systems involving PV/diesel/battery is considered ideal for RHC at remote locations within Iseyin and Port-Harcourt, due to the quality of renewable energy potential. The diesel-only system provides the highest COE ($0.911/kWh), and emits 9211kg of CO2 per year in all the site considered. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","HOMER; Hybrid power system; Nigeria; Rural health clinic; Solar energy; Wind energy","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric power systems; Hybrid systems; Location; Meteorology; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; HOMER; Hybrid power systems; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Nigeria; Renewable energy potentials; Rural health; Solar energy applications; Techno-economic feasibility; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; health care; renewable resource; rural area; solar power; wind power; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949239072

On the other side, seeds with high lipid content could be more sensitive to degradation that non-oil seeds. The objective of this project was to evaluate the stability of three genotypes of sunflower seeds, kept in two different raffia packages under two storage conditions: a constant temperature and humidity reference condition set at 25. °C/75% RH (Ref) and a cyclic, accelerated aging test (CW), built to reproduce the variation of temperature and humidity of a Center West production region, which was in average of 24. °C/71% RH, but with extreme temperatures of 17-32. °C and humidity of 24-96% RH. As all samples evaluated had almost the same fatty acid composition up to the end of ten monthśstorage, it was concluded that seed can be kept without significant loss of quality in the packaging materials and storage conditions evaluated. Cyclic accelerated aging generated different evolution profiles of the peroxide values and moisture levels when compared to the reference condition, with constant temperature and humidity. All seeds showed dehydration when undergoing the (CW) condition during the winter simulation period, the driest season among the evaluated. During fall, winter and spring simulation, the (Ref) condition generated higher peroxide values than the accelerated aging test. However, in the summer period simulation of the cyclic aging, the peroxide values of seeds packed in uncoated raffia increased by 32% (OL5), 9% (He250) and 90% (He 253). Laminated raffia showed a slightly higher performance than uncoated for seed preservation. The results found in this study show that storage at constant temperature and humidity conditions does not reproduce the sequence of degradation reactions which occurs due to the daily cyclic variation in temperature and humidity. This highlights, the importance of carrying out studies in laboratory conditions closer to reality for studying seed aging. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel; Cyclic accelerated aging; Helianthus annuus L; Packaging; Storage","Biodiesel; Energy storage; Fatty acids; Fuel storage; Oxidation; Packaging; Packaging materials; Peroxides; Quality control; Storage (materials); Sunflower oil; Testing; Accelerated aging; Accelerated aging test; Biodiesel production; Different evolutions; Fatty acid composition; Helianthus annuus L; Laboratory conditions; Temperature and humidities; Oilseeds; biofuel; concentration (composition); dicotyledon; fatty acid; genotype; humidity; laboratory method; preservation; seed; temperature; vegetable oil; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947774461

This paper presents a novel control algorithm for joint demand response management and thermal comfort optimization in microgrids equipped with renewable energy sources and energy storage units. The proposed work aims at covering two main gaps in current state-of-the-art demand response programs. The first gap is integrating the objective of matching energy generation and consumption with the occupant behavior and with the objective of guaranteeing thermal comfort of the occupants. The second gap is developing a scalable and robust demand response program. Large-scale nature of the optimization problem and robustness are achieved via a two-level supervisory closed-loop feedback strategy: at the lower level, each building of the microgrid employs a local closed-loop feedback controller that processes only local measurements; at the upper level, a centralized unit supervises and updates the local controllers with the aim of minimizing the aggregate energy cost and thermal discomfort of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a microgrid composed of three buildings, a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, and an energy storage unit. Comparisons with alternative demand response strategies reveal that the proposed strategy efficiently integrates the renewable sources; energy costs are reduced and at the same time thermal comfort of the occupants is guaranteed. Furthermore, robustness is proved via consistent improvements achieved under heterogeneous conditions (different occupancy schedules and different weather conditions). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand response; Microgrid; Occupancy information; Thermal comfort optimization","Algorithms; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Feedback control; Natural resources; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Thermal comfort; Wind turbines; Demand response; Demand response programs; Heterogeneous conditions; Integration of renewable energies; Micro grid; Occupancy information; Optimization problems; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources; cost analysis; demand analysis; energy efficiency; energy resource; optimization; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947093003

On the other hand, there is a rapid increase in the cost of fossil fuels coupled with the inability of utility companies to expand their generation capacity in line with the rising electricity demand, without modernizing the grid. For these reasons, it is needed to modernize the existing power grids and consequently smart power grids have emerged. Unlike the benefits and features ensured by smart grids, this paper provides a detailed survey of the critical challenges in smart grids in terms of information and communication technologies, sensing, measurement, control and automation technologies, power electronics and energy storage technologies.

Calculations based on full-potential method within several exchange correlation potentials are performed to gain a reliable results. It has been found that α-CsMgH3 exhibits indirect band gap of about 2.3 eV (local density approximation -LDA), 2.6 eV (generalized gradient approximation -PBE-GGA), 2.9 eV (Engel-Vosko generalized gradient approximation - EVGGA) and 3.2 eV (recently modified Becke-Johnson potential -mBJ). The electronic band structure and the density of states reveal that at the energy regions around -5.0 eV and from -3.5 eV up to -2.0 eV the H-1s state hybridized with Mg-3s state to form a peak at around -5.0 eV and three peaks between -3.5 eV and -2.0 eV. The energy region from -2.0 eV up to Fermi level is originated by the interactions between H-1s and Mg-2p states. Thus, the interactions between the orbitals of H and Mg atoms leads to form strong covalent bonding between H and Mg atoms. The conduction bands are mainly originated from the empty states of Cs and partially from Mg-3s/2p states, while H-1s has insignificant contribution to the empty states. The chemical bonding were analyzed in term of charge density and charge transfer, we found that a charge transfer towards H atom occur. To gain further insight for deeply understanding the electronic structure, the optical dielectric functions are calculated based on the calculated band structure. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","DFT; Electronic charge density; Hydrogen storage; α-CsMgH3","Alkaline earth metals; Alkalinity; Atoms; Band structure; Charge density; Charge transfer; Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Hydrides; Orbits; Storage (materials); Alkaline-earth elements; DFT; Dielectric functions; Electronic band structure; Electronic charge density; Exchange-correlation potential; Generalized gradient approximations; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957840601

During practical application, these delicate devices unavoidably experience all kinds of deformations. These deformations would become irreversible under the long-term concentration of local stresses, leading to structure and functional fatigue. To solve this problem, a shape memory supercapacitor (SMSC) is successfully fabricated for the first time. The SMSC is flexible and easily deformed below its activation temperature. Once it is heated over a trigger temperature, it would automatically recover its original shape, meanwhile restoring all deformations. By embedding with shape memory functions, all potential damage to the supercapacitor would be nipped in the bud, while simultaneously prolonging the life span of the device. Furthermore, an energy storage shape memory textile woven with these SMSCs and traditional fabrics can work as a smart sleeve. It can ""remember"" its pre-designed shape and realize automatic cooling when it is over-heated, demonstrating a diversity of potential applications other than energy storage. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Deformation; Energy storage; Flexible electronics; Textiles; Weaving; Activation temperatures; Functional fatigue; ITS applications; Life span; Local stress; Shape memory; Shape memory functions; Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955287545

Unfortunately, if a customer considers that personal discomfort outweighs money savings after DLC shutting down of home appliances, DLC solution can be rejected. This paper proposes the way to remediate customer comfort concerns by pre-storing additional energy in electric loads before their disconnection from the grid. We take electric tank water heaters as an illustrative example of residential loads with storage. To illuminate our approach we first show how to balance electric consumption for pre-storing with user thermal discomfort for a single water heater. Then, we illustrate how the approach can be scaled-up to a multiple-boiler scenario, when ten remotely controlled boilers act next to fifty non-controlled boilers. The simulations for the latter case show that the expected user thermal discomfort can be significantly reduced at the cost of a reasonable increase of electricity demand preceding DLC event. © 2015 IEEE.","Control systems; Optimal control; Power demand; Power system management; Power system stability","Boilers; Control systems; Domestic appliances; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Smart power grids; System stability; Water heaters; Direct load control; Domestic water heaters; Electric consumption; Electricity demands; Optimal controls; Power demands; Power system management; Power system stability; Electric load management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964989304

Muscle cells contain a variety of lipid droplets, which are fundamentally smaller than those found in adipocytes. This translates into a greater lipid droplet surface area serving as the interface for intracellular lipid metabolism. The skeletal muscle has a high plasticity, it is subjected to major remodeling following training and detraining. This coincides with adaptations in lipid droplet characteristics and dynamics. The majority of lipid droplets in skeletal muscle are located in the subsarcolemmal region or in-between the myofibrils, in close vicinity to mitochondria. The vastly organized nature of skeletal muscle fibers limits organelle mobility. The high metabolic rate and substrate turnover in skeletal muscle demands a strict coordination of intramyocellular lipid metabolism and LD dynamics, in which lipid droplet coat proteins play an important role.

The benefits of cloud computing, however, come at a high cost in terms of energy consumption, mainly because of one of the cloud's core enablers, the data center. There are a number of proposals that seek to enhance the energy efficiency of data centers. Still, most of them focus on the energy consumed by CPU and ignore other important hardware components, e.g., RAM. In this paper, we show the considerable impact that RAM can have on the total energy consumption, particularly in servers with large amounts of this memory. We then propose two new approaches for dynamic consolidation of virtual machines in cloud data centers that take into account both CPU and RAM usage. We have implemented and evaluated our proposals in the CloudSim simulator using real-world traces and compared the results with other state-of-the-art solutions. By adopting a wider view of the system, our proposals can reduce not only energy consumption but also service level agreement (SLA) violations, thus providing a better service at a lower cost. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Dynamic consolidation; Energy efficiency; Resource management; Virtualization","Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Random access storage; Cloud data centers; Computing resource; Dynamic consolidation; Hardware components; Resource management; Service Level Agreements; Total energy consumption; Virtualizations; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954143207

FTIR-ATR, DSC, TGA, SEM, OM and ultrasonic techniques were used for characterization of the obtained composites containing up to 4. wt.% of graphene. FTIR-ATR analysis confirmed PU structure and proved that there was no chemical reaction between polyurethane and graphene. The highest heat of phase transition and crystallinity were found for PU system synthesized without the chain extender and modified with 1.0. wt.% of graphene. Microscopic observation results indicated spherulite structures typical for poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) which was used to form soft segments, with regions of lamellar crystal bundles radiating from the center of a spherulite. Thermal cycling tests were done by 50 and 100 heating/cooling cyclings in air and nitrogen atmosphere for verification of the thermal reliability and chemical stability - it has been found the heat of phase transition was generally not diminished.

Complementary to carbon capture activities, significant effort is devoted to the development of technologies for methanol synthesis by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. While CO2 is available from plenty of sources, cheap sources of H2 are less frequently found. An additional source of hydrogen at industrial scale is the wet hydrogen by-product of chlorine production.This study is the first to propose an efficient process for methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation using wet hydrogen by-product from chlor-alkali production. A key feature of this novel process is the use of a stripping unit where the wet hydrogen flows in counter-current mode with the condensed methanol-water mixture resulting from the high-pressure low-temperature separator after the reaction. This operation has a double positive effect, as it removes the CO/CO2 from the methanol-water mixture thus allowing a complete recycle of CO2 and avoiding its presence in the product, while also removing the water from the wet hydrogen thus avoiding the negative impact of adding water on the equilibrium conversion - with consumption figures of 550kWh electricity and 0.48-1.16ton steam per ton methanol. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","CO2 hydrogenation; Cu/Zn catalyst; Energy efficiency; H2 stripping; Low-pressure process","Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Fuel storage; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Mixtures; Separators; Synthesis gas manufacture; Temperature; Counter current; Efficient process; Equilibrium conversion; Industrial scale; Low pressure process; Low temperature separators; Methanol synthesis; Methanol-water mixtures; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941702756

Polyols; of some also known as sugar alcohols, are an emerging PCM category for thermal energy storage (TES). A review on polyols as PCM for TES shows that polyols have phase change temperatures in the range of -15 to 245 °C, and considerable phase change enthalpies of 100-413 kJ/kg. However, the knowledge on the thermo-physical properties of polyols as desirable PCM for TES design is presently sparse and rather inconsistent. Moreover, the phase change and state change behaviors of polyols need to be better-understood in order to use these as PCM; e.g. the state change glass transition which many polyols at pure state are found to undergo. In this work preliminary material property characterization with the use of Temperature-History method of some selected polyols, Erythritol, Xylitol and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 10,000 were done. Complex behaviors were observed for some of the polyols. These are: two different melting temperatures, 118.5-120 °C and 106-108 °C at different cycles and an average subcooling 18.5 °C of for Erythritol, probable glass-transition between 0 and 113 °C for Xylitol, as well as a thermally activated change that is likely an oxidation, after three to five heating/cooling cycles for Xylitol and Erythritol. PEG 10,000 had negligible subcooling, no glass-transition nor thermally activated oxidation. However a hysteresis of around 10 °C was observed for PEG 10,000. Therefore these materials require detailed studies to further evaluate their PCM-suitability. This study is expected to be an initiation of an upcoming extensive polyol-blends phase equilibrium evaluation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Glass transition; Material properties; Phase change materials (PCM); Polyols; T-history method; Thermally activated change","Alcohols; Characterization; Energy storage; Glass; Glass transition; Heat storage; Materials properties; Polyols; Sugar substitutes; Temperature; Thermal energy; Low temperatures; Material property characterization; Phase change enthalpy; Phase change temperature; T-history method; Temperature history; Thermally activated; Thermo-physical property; Phase change materials; alcohol; design method; electric field; energy conservation; fossil; low temperature; phase equilibrium; polymer; temperature gradient; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927930291

Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as potential liquid absorbents for CO2 separation. The CO2 absorption capacity and selectivity of ILs have also been investigated extensively. Although ILs have been screened for CO2 separation, only specific ILs have been examined in terms of energy consumption. In this study, 76 conventional ILs were collected and screened in terms of energy consumption to establish potential ILs for CO2 separation. Seventeen ILs were screened according to the CO2 dissolution enthalpy and CO2 working capacity criteria obtained from the Henry's law constant in the preliminary screening. Seven ILs were then screened from the 17 ILs according to the CO2 working capacity from the measured CO2 solubility in the final screening. The energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs (i.e., [Emim][NTf2], [Bmim][BF4], [Bmim][PF6], [Bmim][NTf2], [Hmim][NTf2], [Bmpy][NTf2], and [Hmpy][NTf2]) were calculated, and the corresponding gas solubility selectivities were discussed. The energy consumptions and properties of the seven screened ILs were compared with those of the commercial CO2 absorbents of 30 wt% MEA, 30 wt% MDEA, and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (SelexolTM or Coastal AGR®). The results showed that the energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs were lower than those of the commercial CO2 absorbents. [Hmpy][NTf2] showed the lowest energy consumption among the seven screened ILs under the operating conditions set in this study. © 2015.","CO2 capture; CO2 separation; Energy consumption; Ionic liquids; Screening","Absorption; Energy utilization; Fuels; Ionic liquids; Liquids; Screening; Separation; Solubility; Absorption capacity; Carbon dioxide capture; Dimethyl ethers; Dissolution enthalpies; Henry's Law constant; Ionic liquid (ils); Operating condition; Working capacity; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; energy use; enthalpy; ionic composition; liquid; polymer; separation; solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926215618

The growth of micro-organisms was monitored in accordance with the ASTM standard test. The observations of damage to St3S steel were made using a scanning microscope, and the composition of the formed corrosion products was determined using an energy dispersive spectroscopy analyser. Micro-organisms causing microbiological corrosion (sulphate-reducing bacteria, iron bacteria, fungi) were found to develop in the water and on the steel discs. The growth of micro-organisms was the most intense on the discs placed at the water–fuel interphase. Microscopic studies revealed that the disc fragment exposed to the organic phase (fuel) practically did not undergo any corrosion. In the water phase, corrosion was uniform, and its intensity increased with the proximity to the interphase. The highest degree of corrosion was observed on the surface of the steel in the area in which the water was in contact with the fuel. In this area, discs were subject to strong corrosion and formation of rather deep corrosion pits was observed. Gravimetric studies revealed that the corrosion weight calculated in Vm and Vp units is much higher at the water–fuel interphase than in the aqueous phase. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Protein microbubbles are commonly used in medical diagnostic and therapeutic research. They have also recently gained interest in the research area of food as they can be used as structural elements to control texture, allowing for the manufacture of healthier foods with increased consumer perception. For the application of microbubbles in the food industry, it is important to gain insights into their stability under food processing conditions. In this study, we tested the stability of protein microbubbles against heating and pressurization. Microbubbles could be heated to 50 °C for 2 min or pressurized to 100 kPa overpressure for 15 s without significantly affecting their stability. At higher pressures and temperatures, the microbubbles became unstable and buckled. Buckling was observed above a critical pressure and was influenced by the shell modulus. The addition of cross-linkers like glutaraldehyde and tannic acid resulted in microbubbles that were stable against all tested temperatures and overpressures, more specifically, up to 120 °C and 470 kPa, respectively. We found a relation between the storage temperatures of microbubble dispersions (4, 10, 15, and 21 °C) and a decrease in the number of microbubbles with the highest decrease at the highest storage temperature. The average rupture time of microbubbles stored at different storage temperatures followed an Arrhenius relation with an activation energy for rupture of the shell of approximately 27 kT. This strength ensures applicability of microbubbles in food processes only at moderate temperatures and storage for a moderate period of time. After the proteins in the shell are cross-linked, the microbubbles can withstand pressures and temperatures that are representative of food processes. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","buckling; heating; microbubble; pressure; stability; storage temperature","Activation energy; Air; Buckling; Convergence of numerical methods; Diagnosis; Food processing; Heating; Phase interfaces; Pressure; Proteins; Stability; Thermal processing (foods); Air water interfaces; Effect of temperature; Micro-bubble; Microbubble dispersion; Moderate temperature; Processing condition; Storage temperatures; Therapeutic research; Food storage; bovine serum albumin; glutaraldehyde; tannin derivative; animal; bovine; chemistry; fluorescence microscopy; microbubble; pressure; scanning electron microscopy; temperature; time factor; Animals; Cattle; Glutaral; Microbubbles; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Pressure; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Tannins; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954442483

We define an agent for the control of supercapacitor arrays within the context of the novel control framework Commelec, proposed by the Authors as a composable method for real-time control of active distribution networks with explicit power setpoints. An important function of such an agent is to advertise the real-time power capabilities and operational preferences of the supercapacitor array based on local information. Given the small energy capacity of such a device, its internal state can largely vary from one setpoint implementation to the next one. For this reason, the use of an accurate model is crucial in the agent definition. We show that it is possible to infer the real-time power capabilities of the device by using simple measurements on the supercapacitor array suitably coupled with an accurate representation of the cells composing the array. Results show that the agent is able to speak for the resource, thus allowing its use from an external controller. © 2015 IEEE.","Agent-based Control; Explicit Power Control; Storage System; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; Electric power transmission networks; Real time control; Smart power grids; Accurate modeling; Active distribution networks; Agent-based control; Control framework; External controller; Local information; Storage systems; Super capacitor; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966550792

Food intake is driven in part by energy balance, which is sensed by specific brain structures through signaling molecules such as nutrients and hormones. Both circulating glucose and fatty acids decrease food intake via a central mechanism involving the hypothalamus and brain stem. Besides playing a role in signaling energy status, glucose and fatty acids serve as fuel for neurons. This review focuses on the effects of glucose and fatty acids on hypothalamic pathways involved in regulation of energy metabolism as well as on the role of the family of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) which are implicated in regulation of central energy homeostasis.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is metabolically active in human adults. Although positron emission tomography-computed tomography using a glucose tracer is the golden standard to visualize and quantify the volume and activity of BAT, it has become clear that activated BAT combusts fatty acids rather than glucose. Here, we review the role of brown and beige adipocytes in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, with evidence derived from both animal and human studies. On the basis of mainly data from animal models, we propose a model in which activated brown adipocytes use their intracellular triglyceride stores to generate fatty acids for combustion. BAT rapidly replenishes these stores by internalizing primarily lipoprotein triglyceride-derived fatty acids, generated by lipoprotein lipase-mediated hydrolysis of triglycerides, rather than by holoparticle uptake. As a consequence, BAT activation leads to the generation of lipoprotein remnants that are subsequently cleared via the liver provided that an intact apoE-low-density lipoprotein receptor pathway is present. Through these mechanisms, BAT activation reduces plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels and attenuates diet-induced atherosclerosis development. Initial studies suggest that BAT activation in humans may also reduce triglyceride and cholesterol levels, but potential antiatherogenic effects should be assessed in future studies. © 2016 Nature America, Inc.","adipose tissue, brown; atherosclerosis; cholesterol; energy metabolism; fatty acids; lipoproteinlipase","apolipoprotein E; cholesterol; fatty acid; glucose; lipoprotein; lipoprotein lipase; low density lipoprotein receptor; triacylglycerol; lipoprotein; lipoprotein lipase; lipoprotein triglyceride; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; atherosclerosis; beige adipocyte; brown adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; cardiovascular mortality; cholesterol blood level; computer assisted emission tomography; fatty acid transport; glucose transport; gold standard; human; hydrolysis; hypercholesterolemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertriglyceridemia; lipid storage; lipoprotein metabolism; morbidity; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; risk factor; triacylglycerol blood level; animal; atherosclerosis; brown adipose tissue; hypercholesterolemia; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoprotein Lipase; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, LDL; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954564100

To further improve the performance of SRAM-based TCAMs, this paper presents UE-TCAM, which reduces memory requirement, latency, power consumption, and improves speed.

Therefore, PM6-DH2 was employed to determine endohedral hydrogen storage capability of BmNm nanocages. It predicted that B24N24, B36N36, B48N48, and B96N96 nanocages have rather significant hydrogen storage percentages of 4.40, 6.67, 8.12 and 12.01%, respectively and B96N96 can endohedrally store up to 142H2 molecules. Analysis of destabilization energies of the complexes encapsulating maximum number of H2 molecules indicated that B24N24 and B48N48 are more durable than B36N36 and B96N96 against hydrogen doping because they can both highly inflate and quite compress hydrogen molecules. In addition, the B-N bond breaking energy for B96N96 is much smaller than the passage barrier of a hydrogen molecule through hexagonal holes, so nanocage breaks instead of hydrogen molecules escaping through the hole. According to all these findings, BN nanocages and larger structures built from them might be considered as good candidates for hydrogen storage. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Boron nitride nanocages; Density functional theory; Endohedral doping; Hydrogen storage; PM7 and PM6-DH2; Semi-empirical methods","Boron nitride; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Dispersions; Hydrogen; Molecules; Nitrides; Structures (built objects); Bond breaking energy; Destabilization energy; Endohedral doping; Hydrogen storage capacities; Nanocages; Non-covalent interaction; PM7 and PM6-DH2; Semi-empirical methods; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954305566

Previously, the algorithm was used to optimise single parameter (such as distance, time and fuel) for movement between two places. The path computed using the classic Dijkstra's algorithm is the shortest; however, it may not be the most feasible. The algorithm needs to optimise other factors such as energy consumption and the degree of turns a robot need to take.

In a developing country like Malaysia, the development of islands is mostly related to the availability of electric power. As an island surrounded by sea, power generated by wave energy source will become one of the most promising solutions for the electrification of island areas. But, the unpredictable nature of the wave energy source is the main drawback. This paper presents a novel stand-alone wave energy supply system modeling with maximum power tracking and an energy storage-based power management algorithm in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The main contributions of this research work are eliminating the intermittent power generation nature of wave energy and efficiently extract the maximum wave power. In the proposed stand-alone system, a DC–DC bidirectional buck-boost converter controller is used to maintain the constant dc-link voltage. It also accumulates the surplus wave power in the battery bank and supplies this power to the load during the wave power shortage. A three-phase complex vector control scheme voltage source inverter is used to control the load-side voltage in terms of the frequency and voltage amplitude. Based on the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink, it has been found that the overall system is capable of working under variable weather and load conditions, and it can also able to extract the maximum wave power. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

FESSs can be used for industrial applications ranging from aerospace stations and railway trains to electric vehicles (EVs). They have their own individual advantages and disadvantages, leading them to have their own unique roles for energy storage applications. Compared to the limitation of an electrochemical battery imposed by its inherent features, such as low power density, short duration of service, limited charge-discharge cycles and being environmentally unfriendly, FESSs exhibit some distinctive merits, such as high energy density, low cost, high reliability, high dynamics, long lifetime, high efficiency, environmental friendliness and easy monitoring of the state of charge. In this chapter, FESSs applied in EVs are discussed, with an emphasis on those operating at speeds over 10, 000 rpm. The organization of this chapter is as follows. In section 3.1, a brief introduction of FESSs is presented. In section 3.2, the configuration of an FESS, including a flywheel, a motor/generator, a bearing, a power converter and an enclosure, is described.

CBM reservoirs are distinguished from conventional reservoirs due to the major difference in the mechanism of gas storage and production of water. In CBM reservoirs, pores act as the major storage mechanism as gas is trapped and stored there and produced by means of dewatering and thus lowering the reservoir pressure. Free gas forms as the pressure is lowered leading to increased gas permeability of coal and thus increasing recovery. Microbial activity and thermal maturation of organic compounds are the main mechanisms of methane generation in lower-and-higher rank coals, respectively. Even though methane is an abundant and clean energy source, there are certain operational, technical and economic challenges involved in its production due its unique nature outlined above. Thus, a strong understanding of the parameters and uncertainties that influence the recovery is crucial. Methods, Procedures, Process: Due to the fact that the organic materials that make up coals generally have a stronger affinity for CO2 than for methane, CO2 is used as an enhanced recovery method to displace methane as an enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBM) method. While there is no current comprehensive optimization study on the effects of such factors, ECBM has a very significant role in the future of energy as it means more energy out of natural gas while eliminating the adverse effects of greenhouse gases. Results, Observations, Conclusions: In this study, a standard SPE reservoir simulation model is used to study the factors influencing the recovery in coal bed methane reservoirs by investigating the significance of parameters including but not limited to porosity, adsorption capacity, fracture permeability along with coal density and irreducible water saturation. Novel/Additive Information: The optimization results obtained by means of coupling a full-physics commercial numerical reservoir simulator with an optimization/uncertainty tool are presented outlining the different degrees of significance of these factors on production and ultimate recovery for better understanding of the phenomenon that will lead to more robust reservoir management decisions.

To help accelerate the journey to Goal Zero, a set of standard safety rules and a roadmap of activities that can help to deliver strong safety leadership have been implemented across all construction sites and installation vessels. This paper will describe the development of this initiative, which is known as Construction Site Safety Standardisation (CSSS), outline its key components and their purpose, and demonstrate how CSSS is impacting the global projects construction sites that are essential to the continued growth of Shell as an energy provider and petrochemical company. CSSS grew out of an analysis of how workers were getting hurt, mainly based on Shell's own data, but also using some wider industry information. A hot spot analysis was made of incident types, including near misses with serious injury potential. The following activities were identified as the most hazardous: 1. Confined Spaces 2. Excavations 3. Heavy Equipment and Vehicle Operations 4. Hot Works 5. Lifting and Hoisting 6. Safe Isolation of Energy 7. Scaffolding and other forms of access 8. Simultaneous Operations 9. Working at Height Requirements that were specific to construction/installation activities were then developed to reinforce and complement already existing cross-Shell HSSE requirements. Standards were also developed for the following safe practices that were regarded as further construction-wide contributory factors in safety performance: y Barricades and Open Holes y Housekeeping y Line of Fire y Personal Protective Equipment y Routine Life Tasks The new, extended requirements, supported by visual materials and toolbox talks, are designed to promote safer work among both employees and contractor staff as well as cross-pollinate lessons learned and best practices across the global projects portfolio. The requirement to use a 'roadmap' of enabling activities, supported by a structured set of consistent materials and job aids, reduces waste and streamlines approaches to building worksite safety cultures. This, in turn, improves experience transfer and learning and avoids the potential of continual reinvention of initiatives across projects. Roadmap activities are clustered into five areas: Safety Leadership; Care for People; Staffing, Training, Competency; Communications; and Worksite Set-up. CSSS was initially back-integrated into existing projects and is now an integral part of the start-up of new projects. Consistent uptake across projects is helping to establish a single, global approach to construction site safety management. This paper will include some project examples to show how CSSS is helping to drive positive change and promote consistency in different environments-including greenfield and brownfield sites and vessels-and across projects with varying governance models.

They have gained interest because they are more flexible than conventional plants and can be used for producing oil and gas in deep-water fields. In general, gas export is challenging because of the lack of infrastructure in remote locations. The present work investigates the possibility of integrating liquefaction processes on such facilities, considering two mixed-refrigerant and two expansion-based processes suitable for offshore applications. Two FPSO configurations are considered in this work, and they were suggested by Brazilian operators for fields processing natural gas with moderate to high content of carbon dioxide. The performance of the combined systems is analysed by conducting energy and exergy analyses.

In Switzerland, for example, the consumption represents approximately 20% of which more than half is used for process heat. To determine how to optimize the use of industrial thermal energy, process integration and pinch analysis methods are used. However, a particular challenge exists in energy optimization of batch and semi-continuous processes commonly found in industry. For such processes direct heat recovery is limited and dependent on the schedule limiting its broad industrial application. Development in recent years in this field has focused on indirect heat recovery using thermal energy storage integration to provide a practical solution to the heat integration of non-continuous processes.

The associated gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons, water and inert gases that requires robust gas treatment and compression systems. Once treated, the streams of hydrocarbon gas and CO2-rich stream need to be exported by pipelines and/or reinjected into reservoirs. The electric motors of the hydrocarbon gas compressors are the largest energy consumers and are attached to the main power generation system. In turn, the CO2 compressors are driven mechanically by independent gas turbines.

The chimney efficiency is difficult to improve, and thus enhancing the collector or turbine performance can considerably improve the total plant efficiency. This work focused on enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of the collector and also extending the operation time using a heat storage medium. The solar to thermal conversion and thermal storage capabilities of six ground materials that are potentially available in Malaysia were studied experimentally and numerically. The experimental model was designed such that the six materials were exposed to the same operation boundary conditions. The numerical studies were conducted using ANSYS software, where the geometrical models were developed and simulated using FLUENT for the fluid flow and energy/thermal field studies. The selected ground materials were ceramic, black stones, sawdust, dark-green painted wood, sand, and pebbles. The simulation and experimental results are in good agreement in terms of air stream velocity and energy conversion efficiency. The results showed that the different materials have different heat storage capacities, and that ceramics extend the operation with improved efficiency until nighttime. The results also showed that ceramic and black stones have better performance than the other materials.

We present a solar energy harvesting strategy which allows for the generation of fuel for housing and mobility in a decentralised form. A city or a part of a city cannot be shut down from energy supply by a terrorist attack on this energy generation and storage infrastructure, because it is virtually fully decentralised and independent (no electric grid). This system is based on photo-electrochemical cell technology and takes advantage of the solar energy arriving at small landscapes in local neighbourhoods in the range of few 100 sqm area per operation unit. The fuel is hydrogen, or hydrocarbons such as methane or methanol, when carbon dioxide greenhouse gas is included in the chemical process cycle. The necessary water for the process may come from the local sewage waste-water system. The problem of energy storage after finish of sunshine during the day is also solved by this technology, because a storable fuel is produced. The pronounced safety feature of this approach is that many small units are built, which are impossible to demolish in a terror strike, as opposed to single large industrial complexes which are very attractive for terrorists to attack because of the high destructive ""efficiency"" by a single plot, but also by the commensurate public attention and ""terror"", literally, which comes with the attack on a landmark scale facility. The negative part in this calculation comes from the loss of efficiency by moving from few large units to many small units. This is likely the price which society has to pay for the gain in safety from terrorism. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

Coal is one of the leading sources of energy globally; commensurately, Coal Combustion Residue (CCR) is the largest industrial waste stream. Typically, CCR collects as it is produced at the coal plant and stored in heaps or large impoundments until final disposal or ""closure"" of the disposal facility. The storage of this waste, prior to closure, lasts decades and can threaten human health and the environment should, for example, contaminants seep out of impoundments, or worse, should an accident occur (e.g. coal ash dam breach at TVA Kingston Fossil Plant in Tennessee, USA). The management practices of CCR facilities are similar to those of other mine tailings facilities. And, due to a lack in CCR disposal facility data, we draw additional information from tailings facility experience. Like similarly designed tailings disposal units, the closure of CCR impoundments retrofits the storage facility into a final disposal site. In both the CCR and tailings case, the impoundments are expected to remain for 100s to 1000s of years. But, how does the transition from storage to closure mitigate risks associated with CCR storage facilities? Unfortunately, the hazards and uncertainties of neither active nor closed impoundments are entirely understood, and therefore, how well the closure process reduces long-term risks is unclear. Our research characterizes the risks - hazards and the related uncertainties - of CCR disposal using data from U.S. tailings and CCR incidents. In the context of current CCR waste policy debates, we consider the potential hazards to human health and the environment posed both prior to and after closure to understand how different policy options can sustainably manage and regulate waste from producing energy to further enduring resilience. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

Food processing is a complex and demanding process because raw materials are supplied on a seasonal basis, they spoil easily and may be a source of microbiological contamination during production. Apple pomace is a by-product of fruit and vegetable processing, and it constitutes biodegradable waste. Small quantities of pomace are not harmful to the environment, but large amounts of waste could pose a problem for processing plants. Pressed pomace can be used in in-dustrial processing and power generation. This is one of the easiest pomace management methods, in particular in regions where large amounts of waste cannot be quickly processed into animal feed or where transport is not an option due to considerable distance. This paper presents the methodology and the results of analyses investigating the properties of apple pomace and its management scenarios. A review of published sources discussing the achievements in pomace management precedes the experimental part of this study. Samples of ground and unground apple pomace were analyzed to determine: granulometric composition – the size distribution of apple pomace fractions, pressure agglomeration, compaction energy and expansion of samples immediately after pressing and after 24 hours, the heat of combustion of the analyzed apple pomace, which was compared with the heat of combustion of other fruit and vegetable processing waste. The compaction energy of samples was determined with the use of a BLUEHILL-2 application for controlling the INSTRON 8802 machine. Material was subjected to compressive strength tests, and the expansion of samples was determined after 24 hours of storage. The total compaction energy of unground pomace ranged from 66.60 to 150.00 J·g-1, and of ground pomace from 34.79 to 149.95 J·g-1 at a temperature of 20°C and relative air humidity of 31.7%. The density of the resulting apple pomace pellets was determined in the range of 1114.0-1166.3 and 1114.0-1168.1 g·dm-3. The heat of combustion of pressed pomace samples, measured in a calorimeter, was 19 MJ·kg-1. The results of the study indicate that if apple pomace has net calorific value of 17.3 MJ·kg-1 and the effectiveness of a steam boiler reaches 70%, the amount of energy generated by the combustion of apple pellets is 80 to 340 times higher than the amount of energy consumed during processing under the load of 50 kN and 10 kN, respectively. The management of apple pomace in the production plant can serve as an example of a ""waste-free"" technology. The use of processed apple pomace for energy generation purposes may contribute to improving energy efficiency in production processes in fruit and vegetable processing plants. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

According to these directives the greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 20% and the share of energy produced from renewable sources should simultaneously be increased by the same percentage. The use of solar collectors can both improve energy security and reduce the environmental impact caused by the thermal energy industry. An ability to reduce the pollutants, which can be achieved using devices for converting solar radiation into the heat, was determined in this paper. The environmental effect, discussed in the present work, is caused by reducing the demand for domestic water heating. This effect results from the application of thermal solar collectors. The amount of pollutants that are released into the air, emitted from combustion of fuels, was estimated on the basis of the annual energy gain from the solar radiation and emission factors of the selected pollutants recommended by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Net gain of energy from solar panels was determined on the basis of experimental data. The object of the study was the solar domestic hot water (SDHW) system located on the roof of the Hotel for the staff of Bialystok University of Technology (Poland). Experimental studies were carried out under the project financed by the Regional Operational Program of Podlasie Province – stage 1.1 named “Study of the effectiveness of active and passive methods to improve the energy efficiency of infrastructure supported by renewable energy sources”. The construction of the research object was the target of the stage – 5.2 named “Im-proving the energy efficiency of Bialystok University of Technology infrastructure by use of renewable energy sources” (V. Development of environmental protection infrastructure”). The system consists of two parallel-connected installations. The first includes 21 tube collectors with a total gross area of more than 74 m2 . The second unit consists of 35 flat plate collectors with a total gross area of about 72 m2 . Eight storage tanks with the capacity of 1000 liters each were placed in the basement of the Hotel. The monitoring system was used to record the installation parameters during its operation. It consists of 17 heat meters, 4 electricity recorders, and 42 platinum resistance temperature sensors. The weather station that captures the basic parameters of outside air and insolation is located near the solar collectors. As a result of studies, it was found that the solar system produced 230.61 GJ heat energy throughout the year. The equation necessary to determine an equivalent amount of energy that is produced in a power plant was presented in this paper. Subsequently, the value of a possible reduction of selected pollutant emissions, which are released into the air, was calculated. Moreover, ΔPj coefficients were proposed for determination of the emissions reduction related to 1 m2 gross area of a solar panel. The main conclusions from the assessment of the impact of applying SDHW system to reduce the air pollution in the urban area were presented at the end of the paper. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

The NPBP - National Program for Biodiesel Production and Use, set up by Law 11097/2005, encourages the production of biofuels from various oil sources. Biodiesel production from sunflower seeds has proved to be a form of aggregate income mainly for small farmers. As the meal originating from pressing accounts for about 60% of the original seeds, its subsequent use is of great importance for the economic viability of the process. Due to the seasonality of any biomass, the aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of meals originating from three sunflower genotypes (OL5, He 250 and He 253) placed into two types of packaging: PET/PE - polyethylene terephthalate laminated with white pigmented polyethylene and raffia/PE - raffia laminated with stored low density polyethylene. The meal was stored at constant temperature and humidity condition (25°C/75%RH) for 300 days. During this period, moisture content and the peroxide value of the meal were monitored. The study revealed that the three types of meal did not suffer significant loss of quality in the conditions evaluated after 10 months of storage, although all of them had different characteristics. OL5 meal was the most stable, and its peroxide value remained around 1mEq/kg throughout the storage. The He 250 press meal reached the range of 6-8 mEq/kg and the He 253 as high as 8-9 mEq/kg. The results obtained during storage showed that different packaging materials affected both the moisture and peroxide values. The peroxide levels achieved in meal packed in PET/PE packaging, were on average half of the other, showing therefore that this material provides better preservation of press meal than the laminated raffia. © 2016 CETEA - Packaging Technology Center.

This study presents thermal insulation and mechanical properties of high volume fly ash fiber reinforced cement composite (HVFA-FRCC) manufacture by extrusion. The objective of this study is to improve thermal insulation properties of high volume fly ash fiber reinforced cement composite with acceptable mechanical properties to be used for building façade. Paraffin (PA) as an organic phase change material(PCM) was directly incorporated into porous structure of expanded perlite (EP) as light weight aggregate and formed PCM composite .TGA (thermo gravimetric analysis) results revealed the PCM composite is stable in the outdoor environment temperature. Steady thermal test showed that incorporation of PCM composite in the extruded panels enhances temperature differences between inner and outer surfaces of panel indicating that PCM is effective for thermal energy storage purpose. Moreover, extrusion technique improves flexural toughness of panels in spite of reduction of flexural strength in PCM incorporated specimens due to dilution of matrix by phase change materials.

PD online monitoring (during normal operation of equipments) can be carried out continuously or by periodic measurements. In both cases, its initial cost involves permanent installation of PD sensors in the monitored machines, besides the measurement system itself. The permanent installation of coupling capacitors and measurement circuits in rotating machines is performed during a scheduled maintenance period, and such investment can be amortized in a short time, since the additional cost per subsequent measurement falls practically to zero. However, experience shows that PD monitoring in hydroelectric plants in Brazil is not yet a widely disseminated practice. In part, this is due to the fact that the PD assessment technique (in contrast to other predictive assessment techniques already well established, such as vibration monitoring) is significantly more complex and requires analysis from a qualified specialist. Moreover, the high cost of measurement instruments and continuous monitoring systems represents a significant barrier to the spread of PD monitoring. To make continuous monitoring of PD a more affordable reality for hydroelectric plants, Cepel Electrical Energy Research Center and Eletronorte (a subsidiary of the Brazilian power utility Eletrobras, responsible for the power generation, transmission and distribution in the states of the Amazon region) have applied a solution that originated from the development of a modular system for the measurement of PD based entirely on virtual instrumentation. In this article we present the design features of this system as well as the experience of Eletronorte with its use monitoring hydro generators. The earliest PD measurement systems were traditionally comprised of analogical signal processing circuits and an oscilloscope or a galvanometer where the results were presented in real time. The measurement results were stored in the form of handwriting notes or photographs taken from the visual indicators. Evolving from the analogical systems, the latest PD measurement instruments adopted digital technology. The analogical signal processing circuits were reduced to a minimum and replaced by digital processing in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAS). Such systems also benefited from the contribution of computational systems, enabling new forms of visualization, processing and storage of information. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the measurement systems has been expanded, enabling new types of signal processing such as source discrimination based on the detected waveform parameters of the PD pulses. More recently, with the improvement and dissemination of the acquisition and data processing technologies, virtual instrumentation systems are occupying a growing space both in the academy and in the various sectors of industry. Such systems are characterized by the use of general modular hardware and specific software developed by the user. As a result, virtual instrumentation systems have lower costs and greater flexibility, allowing greater adherence to the specific needs of each measurement. The proposed solution for PD measurement using virtual instrumentation involved defining architecture for the measurement system, the specification of suitable hardware modules and the development of signal processing algorithms and control software for the measurement of PD. The functional requirements originally proposed for a virtual instrumentation based PD measurement system were: Measurement in the HF band, i.e., from 1 to 30 MHz. Sequential measurement of all monitored channels, with a synchronized three-phase measurement option. Flexible number of channels, expandable by the addition of new modules. Standardization of measurement results and availability of data in the company's maintenance network. Centralized analysis of all monitored machines and measurement points, indicating those that require more detailed tracking. Connection and correlation with other systems, including operating parameters of the equipment and other monitoring systems. In this article we present the architecture of the developed system and the main results obtained so far. The system presents significant advances in monitoring technology and predictive diagnosis of rotating machines, with complete flexibility and significant cost savings. © 2016 CIGRE.

This study aims to identify the optimum size of rainwater storage tanks for different roof materials which results in high water and energy savings and carbon dioxide emissions reduction with a reasonable payback period in hospital and hotel buildings. Analysis conducted showed that metal roof with a 0.95 run-off coefficient grossed the highest water and energy savings as well as carbon dioxide reduction when paired with a 30m3 tank in all three commercial buildings. Gravel in contrast yielded the least amount of water savings resulting in a low amount of energy savings and carbon dioxide reduction due to a small run-off coefficient of 0.25. The metal roof portrayed significant difference at an average of 11.6 percent rise in water savings as the tank size is increased, whereas gravel could barely show noticeable difference. Consecutively, a 25 years payback period analysis of the rainwater tanks revealed that larger tanks are apparently more expensive hence giving a higher payback period. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The frequency of the power systems is maintained by keeping the balance between the demand and generation at all times. However, frequency changes are inevitable due to the power mismatch during peak hours particularly. With the increasing penetration of renewable energy (RE) especially solar photovoltaic (PV) in the grid, such phenomenon does not only decrease the grid inertia, the fluctuating power production contributes to the increased occurrence of significant power mismatches. Under the existing practice, any frequency changes are corrected by the governors of the power plants. Despite that, traditional power plants are limited in their ramp rate and duration. Therefore, energy storage system (ESS) is proposed to control the frequency of the power grid without having the grid service operator (GSO) to make significant structural changes to the network. The mechanism of the energy storage for regulating the frequency is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that ESS is able to carry out frequency regulation (FR) effectively while maintaining the stored energy continuously with the proposed offset heuristics. Case studies including high PV penetration and loss of largest generating unit (LGU) also highlight the potential of ESS to take over from spinning reserves. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

This reduces the predictability of electricity generation and increases the need for flexibility in electricity demand. Data on demand response (DR) capacities of large electricity consumers is limited for most countries. Steel production processes are among the industrial processes with the highest DR potentials. In this study, we focus on DR options provided by changing the electricity generation rate at Tata Steel in IJmuiden (which produces 3 % of total electricity consumption in the Netherlands). For evaluating the technical DR potential we have developed a linear programming model in MATLAB. The model calculates the optimal allocation of works arising gases of Tata Steel in IJmuiden in case of a call for emergency balancing power. The optimization is done subject to the technical constraints of the distribution system and storage potential of the works arising gases, the demand of the Tata Steel plants for these gases, and the ramp-up rate of the power plant that runs on these gases. Results show that Tata Steel in IJmuiden can supply 10 MW for two Programme Time Units (i.e. PTU is defined as a 15 minute period in the Netherlands by TenneT) of positive DR capacity with an availability rate of 97 %. This is not enough for participating in the current emergency capacity programs in the Netherlands, which require at least 20 MW for longer than 1 PTU. Tata Steel can provide 20 MW DR capacity with an availability rate of 65 %. Therefore, if the availability rate requirements for emergency balancing programs in the Netherlands do not drop, Tata Steel would need to pool with other suppliers in order to participate in such programs. The negative demand response potential of Tata Steel in IJmuiden is found to be 20 MW supplied for 3 PTUs and 4 PTU with doubling of blast furnace gas storage capacities. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

We have investigated a system of conductive coatings, containing nano-graphite, graphene and a conductive carbon black to make ""paper"" electrodes. Cellulose nano-fibrils were used as a binder in the coatings. Rheological measurements of the system show strong interactions, giving coating colours at low solids content processable viscosities and resulting in coatings with high porosities. This was confirmed from SEM images. Conductive carbon black is the standard solution to get high conductivity in graphitic battery electrodes. Our intention was to fill the graphene/nano-graphite coatings with small conductive carbon black particles to produce denser coatings with higher conductivity. However, there was a decrease in electrical conductivity rather than the desired increase.

Lead Acid (LA) batteries have been the mainstream energy storage solution in residential energy systems. To mitigate the impact of fluctuating power exchange on battery lifetime, battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) of different topologies have been proposed to address the short life expectancy issue of LA battery. This paper presents a comprehensive cost analysis and performance evaluation of different HESS configurations in standalone PV based residential energy systems. A standalone PV-based microgrid model with HESS is developed in MATLAB Simulink to evaluate the effectiveness of different HESS configurations in mitigating battery's stress. A battery health cost function is formulated to analyze the impact of dynamic power exchange on battery's health. The results show that the actively controlled HESS significantly mitigates the battery's stress and reduces the health cost, thus improves the life expectancy of LA battery. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Such a drastic expansion rate of PV and the resulting excess energy thereof can lead to so-called reverse power flow in the low voltage (LV) grid as demonstrated in previous studies. Power-to-Gas (PtG) represents a suitable storage solution to resolve the situation by absorbing the excess PV energy. This paper presents a qualitative and quantitative feasibility analysis of the PtG technology in the future Swiss LV grid. For this purpose, PtG is integrated in simulation into the grid for absorbing the excess PV energy while producing hydrogen. This hydrogen is assumed to be sold in the mobility sector. Three different operational scenarios are established with respect to the input energy source to the PtG plant, including the excess PV energy, curtailed PV excess energy and PV excess energy plus the energy from the grid. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that the PtG plant is still far from economically viable even though significant improvement can be accomplished to the hydrogen production costs by adopting the active PV curtailment and by purchasing additional energy from the grid. The future study to be undertaken by the authors, with respect to economical viability of the PtG, will include other sources of value, including production of methane as main product, production of oxygen and heat as by-products, and provision of services such as biogas upgrading, frequency regulation and voltage. © 2016 The Authors.

These can be equipped with a local energy source (e.g., photovoltaic panels or combined heat-power units), energy storage devices (batteries, electric hot water boilers, heating, and ventilation systems including air conditioning), a building energy management system with sensors (e.g., providing the room temperatures), and household appliances acting as actuators (in general, split into groups of schedulable and non-schedulable ones). The idea behind this work has been to develop an automatic control system which would optimally decide for the end customer when to buy, sell, or store electric energy with the objective to minimize his total costs. At the same time, it fulfills all constraints in terms of the limits on power allowed to be taken from the grid. For the user, besides the optimal scheduling of household appliances and selling energy to the grid whenever it becomes profitable, the developed prototype gives also the opportunity to monitor the local generation, storage, and consumption in real time. On the other side, the electric utility can produce a real-time pricing signal which reflects daily peaks in consumption. Making such a price signal available for this building energy management system will lead to a decrease of power consumption from the grid. In this project, a model predictive control approach to the energy optimization problem in a building has been proposed.

At the beginning of 2015, the global population was around 7.2 billion people (USCB 2015). In 2050, the human population will be probably more than 9 billion and 10.9 billion by the turn of the next century (United Nations 2013), 75 % of whom will be living in cities (Hargrave 2013). Tall buildings can address many of the environmental issues facing cities by providing high-density, efficient buildings that link to public transportation systems and offer the type of amenities demanded by tenants (Wood 2013). As city living takes center stage, urban building of the future have to foster sustainable qualities, essentially functioning as a living organism and engaging with the users within. Cities throughout the world are growing rapidly, creating unprecedented pressure on material and energy resources. Cities with their financial and administrative centers are a key asset to the countries’ national economy and to the cities itself. The local authorities want to assure the city’s continues dynamism given that its business requires ideal conditions in which to operate (Plank et al. 2002). To do so, the local authorities need to assure that the demand for office space can be met within the center of economical activities. In this context, tall office buildings are becoming increasingly necessary as a result of the efficient use that they make of the limited land available. Besides the focus on offices, more and more focus is also on mixed use of the tall buildings, where the offices are combined hotels, shops, and apartments. Some of the new tall buildings become almost a city on their own. The buildings need to help to optimize city-wide production, storage, and consumption of everything from food and energy to water (Hargrave 2013). As in large cities, almost three quarters of their energy consumption is in buildings; this will be one of the main concerns (Plank et al. 2002). The most intensive use of energy of state-of-the-art high-rise buildings usually results from the cooling (40 %) or heating (30 %) of space, while lifts use about 5 % of a tall building’s energy and lighting and electrical appliance can make up about 25 % (Plank et al. 2002). Careful building services design can minimize the need for heating and cooling throughout the year for example by applying seasonal thermal energy storage. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,"Biology; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Food storage; Heat storage; Office buildings; Population dynamics; Building services; Efficient buildings; Electrical appliances; Environmental issues; Heating and cooling; High rise building; Public transportation systems; Tall office buildings; Tall buildings",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028812260

Intensive use of the tracking information at the trigger level will be important to keep high efficiency for interesting events despite the increase in collisions per bunch crossing. In order to facilitate the use of tracks in the High Level Trigger, the ATLAS experiment planned the installation of a hardware processor dedicated to tracking: the Fast TracKer processor. The Fast Tracker is designed to perform full detector track reconstruction of every event accepted by the ATLAS first level hardware trigger. To achieve this goal the system uses a parallel architecture, with algorithms designed to exploit the computing power of custom Associative Memory chips, and modern field programmable gate arrays. The processor will provide computing power to reconstruct tracks with transverse momentum greater than 1 GeV in the entire tracking volume. The tracks will be available at the begin of the trigger selections, allowing to develop new more pileup resilient triggering strategies as well as allow for entirely new ones. The Fast Tracker system will be massive, with about 8000 Associative Memory chips and 2000 field programmable gate arrays, providing full tracking with a rate up to 100 KHz and an average latency below 100 microseconds. The system began commissioning in 2016, with a full barrel coverage reached by the end of the year.

The optimal sets of RE technologies, mix of capacities, operation modes and least cost energy supply were calculated and the role of storage technologies was analysed. The RE generated was not only able to fulfil the electricity demand of the power sector but also able to cover the 25% increase in total electricity demand due to water desalination and synthesis of natural gas for industrial use. The results for the power sector show that the total installed capacity is formed of 165 GW of solar photovoltaics (PV), 85 GW of hydro dams, 12 GW of hydro run-of-river, 8 GW of biogas, 12 GW of biomass and 8 GW of wind power. For solar PV and wind electricity storage, 243 GWhel of battery capacity is needed. According to the simulations the existing hydro dams will function similarly to batteries, being an essential electricity storage. 1 GWh of pumped hydro storage, 23 GWh of adiabatic compressed air storage and 1 GWh of heat storage are used as well. The small storage capacities can be explained by a high availability of RE sources with low seasonal variability and an existing electricity sector mainly based on hydro dams. Therefore, only 0.05 GW of PtG technologies are needed for seasonal storage in the electricity sector. When water desalination and industrial gas sectors' electricity demand are integrated to the power sector, a reduction of 11% in both total cost and electric energy generation was achieved.

But it is not the cleanest way of storing energy due to the necessity of an external heat source (typically the combustion of natural gas) to heat the air at the turbine inlet. This problem can be overcome with Thermal Energy Storage by storing the thermal energy of air at the compressor exhaust in order to be used for heating air before turbine. In this study, a numerical transient heat transfer model of Thermal Energy Storage is developed and the performance of Thermal Energy Storage is investigated based on heat storage capacity, required time to store unit amount of energy and air temperature profiles at the outlet of Thermal Energy Storage during discharge for the system. High heat storage per volume is necessary for more compact systems. Required time to store unit amount of energy is desired to be short for a fixed volume Thermal Energy Storage in order to maintain continuous operation; on the other hand, air at the outlet (turbine inlet) should be at a high temperature for the longest time possible to supply hot air to turbine. In order to investigate the effects of operating parameters, different volumes of Thermal Energy Storage tank filled with different storage mediums of various sizes are explored. Latent Heat and Sensible Heat Thermal Energy Storage systems are compared using magnesium chloride hexahydrate, paraffin, myristic acid and naphthalene as phase change materials and rock as sensible storage medium. Results show that Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage gives a better performance than Sensible Heat Thermal Energy Storage. Among phase change materials, magnesium chloride hexahydrate provides the highest heat storage per volume. Required time to store unit amount of energy are comparable among the phase change materials. Magnesium chloride hexahydrate seems promising considering the discharge temperature profile at the Thermal Energy Storage outlet. Capsule size should be kept as small as possible which can be challenging in terms of manufacturing.

Offshore electrification has been limited by distance costs. Now extended reach for AC systems, improved HVDC systems, and emerging availability of offshore gridded systems that can include multiple power sources and consumers are providing improved economics. Methods, Procedures, Process: The full economic and technical analysis is complex. We will examine how technical factors such as power requirements, distance, losses, and maintenance and operating costs combine with key economic criteria such as capital, operations and energy costs, and depreciation. We will then discuss models for how overall availability and operational stability are affected by the energy mix and the quality of the power management of the microgrid. Other factors such as HSE and environmental impact can also affect the investment decision. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Earlier models we presented, such as those in SPE-162504, considered mainly point to point connections. We here demonstrate how gridded systems, including long distance HVDC connections, combine with local AC grids that can integrate multiple offshore facilities and power sources. The paper is based on experience and ongoing projects in the North Sea and current studies in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea, where integration across multiple facilities and consumers and network dynamics of multiple sources such as Power from Shore, Local Generation and Offshore wind in microgrids have been studied.

Therefore, pre-treatment is required to break the algae cell wall. There are several types of algae cell wall pre-treatment before degradation process. Among of these methods, freeze drying method is able to breakdown algae cell walls and preserve algae cell constituents simultaneously. Freeze dried (non-thermal pre-treatment) Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass was used as microbial substrate consumption in double chamber Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) to generate bioelectricity. As a result, the treatment efficiency obtained in terms of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiency is 63.5%. Based on the power curve obtained, the maximum power density is 8.94 mW/m2 using 2.5 g/L of substrate concentration. At substrate concentration of 5.0 g/L, the MFC has COD removal efficiency of 52.38% and maximum power density of 2.87 mW/m2. At the substrate concentration of 1.0 g/L, the MFC has COD removal efficiency is 86.8%, and maximum power density of 0.11 mW/m2. MFC with different freeze dried algae substrate of 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L and 5.0 g/L has Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 1.56 %, 18.6% and 13.1%, respectively. These results reveal that the use of freeze dried microalgae biomass could be a promising candidate in the application of MFC.","Biomaterials; Energy storage and conversion; Freeze dry algae; Microbial fuel cell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020128791

Human body requires foods consumed externally in order to function properly. If we take more than enough calorie or the body doesn’t burn enough calorie, body starts to store the extra energy. Today, fast-food products which are consumed largely by children or young people can cause lack of nutrition or malnutrition and therefore, they increase the risk of obesity. Obesity defined as the excessive fat tissue in the body, which affects over 300 million people according to the data of World Health Organization (WHO). Obesity spreads like an epidemic and it also becomes an economical burden by increasing health expenses of the countries. Nearly a billion people are obese. Obesity is a serious health problem which causes various disorders through effecting mainly cardiovascular and endocrine system and it can even cause death. There are many factors effecting the development of obesity. Demographic factors, genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, behavioral factors, diet, eating habits and psychological factors are the most significant reasons of obesity. In the present study, these causes of obesity will be handled and behavioral factors, diet and eating habits will be examined in detail. In obesity disorder developed by wrong or unbalanced eating habits fat cell formation is very fast especially in the first few years of the life. The number of fat cells increases when fat storage becomes faster in the body. The number of fat cells for the obese children is three times more than normal weight children. Obese children diet indicates that they take extra energy from the fat. Eating style in babyhood determines the eating habits of a child later in life. Eating fast and chewing less are among the factors easing the development of obesity. Efforts to avoid obesity are the essence of fighting against this disease. In this respect, what is important is not to cure obesity well but to avoid it. Thus, starting from the fetal period, proper eating habits should be developed. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Eating habits; Nutrition; Obesity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019997988

An emerging technology for climate change mitigation is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which can reduce CO2 emissions from energy conversion facilities, but at a cost of additional fuel needed for process energy requirements. The use of forest residues that otherwise would decay on the forest floor, in an energy plant equipped with CCS, could result in a net reduction of CO2 emission to the atmosphere, while producing usable electricity. In this study, we analyse the climate change effects of using either coal or forest residues to produce electricity in large-scale conversion plants. We estimate the primary energy use, annual CO2 emission, annual change in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) of different energy systems that all produce the same quantity of electricity. We also consider the potential effects of future technology developments including gasification and integrated carbon capture processes. The results show that using forest residues to replace coal with current conversion technologies slightly increase the combustion CO2 emission, but in the long term give much lower net CO2 emission and mitigate climate change. The application of emerging gasification technology reduces primary energy use and CO2 emission compared to current technology, and hence increases the climate benefits. The use of CCS requires larger quantities of fuel, but could strongly reduce the CO2 emissions from conversion facilities, thus increasing the carbon benefits per unit of forest biomass used. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Carbon capture and storage; Forest residues; Fuel substitution; Primary energy use; Radiative forcing",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019689438

Solar energy resources are also addressed in the most harmless effect when environmental impacts are taking into account. The most advantages of using solar energy compared to other types of energy are having inexhaustible source of energy, having clean energy, the lack of sophisticated technology, the lack of external dependency, to the low operating costs and can be considered to be suitable for local applications. In addition to these benefits, it has some disadvantages. It is known that sunlight is not continuous, so it requires storage facility. Solar power plant needs large spaces for installation and high initial installation costs. Electric production amount changes in winter-summer, even day and night. Considering all these cases, it's seen that site selection of Solar Power Plant is an important phase. The sun is an inexhaustible source of energy, but it does not come to a constant value everywhere. In this case, certain conditions must be provided for the installation of solar power plant. Solar Energy Potential Atlas gives a certain idea for places according to solar plant installation in Turkey. This atlas use the values based on the solar radiation and sunshine duration. The more realistic and detailed studies for the site determination slope of the land, land properties, geology and soil conditions, adjacency to the electricity distribution network is required. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) should be used for this type of spatial analysis.

Tools are needed to observe and quantify this activity which involves a change in the cerium oxidation state and to understand the involvement of cerium in catalytic processes. To prove that cerium changes its oxidation state in the catalytic cycle the transient rates of Ce3+ formation and decay should be compared to the overall reaction rate. For such mechanistic studies the time resolution is essential as the quantification of the Ce3+ species should be faster than the reaction rate. However, it is challenging to follow the dynamic changes of the cerium oxidation state under reaction conditions, especially when the concentration of cerium atoms involved in the reaction cycle is low. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray emission-based methods for the in situ time-resolved quantification of small concentrations of Ce3+ in ceria-based materials. We demonstrate that resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) at optimal excitation energy is more sensitive than high energy resolution off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) and non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (non-resonant XES) and that it can track the reactivity of less than 0.3% of cerium atoms in a 1% Pt/CeO2 catalyst in a plug-flow reactor with sub-second time resolution. These results demonstrate that X-ray emission-based methods can be used as very sensitive tools and provide new insights into dynamic changes of the oxidation state in reducible oxides in a variety of applications. © the Owner Societies 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018519685

Because power generation from renewable energy resources is tied to environmental factors, supply is often fluctuating and decentralised. Minimising the imbalance between supply and demand is important for grid stability, as well as for economic considerations. Flexible appliances propose a means to achieve supply-demand matching by shifting their production or consumption in time. We take a distributed optimal control point of view: we formulate the problem as an optimal control problem and suggest solutions based on distributed model predictive control (MPC) methods. In particular, we aim to minimise the imbalance using demand response regulation and via Power-to-Gas facilities that offer energy storage. Furthermore, we discuss how demand response regulation can be embedded in the market structure of the Universal Smart Energy Framework. We present example simulations to demonstrate the viability of our approaches. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018441882

In particular we draw on ‘social practice theory’ to understand the dynamics of domestic energy consumption and production in emerging smart energy configurations. There are two focal points in the analysis. First, we will concentrate on a specific type of social practices, so called ‘e-practices’. This is a term that we coin to refer to all those practices in and around the home that involve the consumption, conservation, monitoring, generation and storage of energy. Second, we incorporate ‘information flows’ as a key element in our understanding of the emergence of new e-practices. Although the term “smart” has been defined in various ways, a common denominator is that the generation, handling and use of data, information and knowledge is part of what makes a system smart. After introducing both concepts, we outline a conceptual framework around e-practices and information flows that can guide social scientific research on smart energy systems. We also illustrate how this framework can be put to use empirically, based on data that have been gathered in the Netherlands. The chapter is concluded with a research agenda that outlines theoretical and methodological challenges for future smart grid research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018372667

In this chapter, we will discuss basic theoretical aspects of QENS, instrumentation, types of motion in liquids and solids, understanding these motions from the QENS data, and recent studies using QENS. Overview The QENS is a versatile technique to study the relaxation processes in the condensed materials, particularly in liquids. This technique typically uses cold neutrons as the energy of the cold neutrons is in a similar range with relaxation process in liquids and the wavelength is of the order of the interatomic distance in condensed materials. The QENS techniques can provide much more information on the relaxation process (motions) as compared to other techniques, e.g., dielectric spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and tracer diffusion measurements. The QENS technique is particularly helpful for understanding the microscopic dynamics of soft and biomaterials since these materials contain a large number of hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atom is very sensitive to neutron scattering due to a large scattering cross section. Neutron scattering offers not only QENS but also other scattering techniques like diffraction, inelastic, reflectometry, triple axis, small-angle scattering, and neutron imaging. However, facilities available for neutron scattering research are very few in the world. The production of neutrons is very expensive and typically requires either a nuclear reactor or a target-based source and also detection of neutrons need materials like3He, which is rare on earth, are the reason for it. Over the last few decades, few neutron scattering facilities like Spallation Neutron Source, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Australian Neutron Scattering Facility, Forschungsreaktor Munchen (FRM)-II Germany, ISIS-UK, and JAPARK at Japan have been built. Also, there has been tremendous improvement in neutron scattering instrumentations, particularly building of new backscattering and spin echo spectrometers in the abovementioned facilities. At present relaxation process in a time scale of 0.1 ps-350 ns can be measured using neutron scattering. In the beginning, QENS was mainly used to study the diffusion in simple liquids and hydrogen diffusion, in metals, etc. At present the QENS technique has been used in many fields of science ranging from colloids, polymers, ionic liquids, hydrogen storage, food processing, biotechnology, and environments. In this chapter we will provide an overview of basic theoretical understanding of QENS, concepts of instrumentation, data analysis, identification of transport mechanism from QENS data, and recent research results using QENS. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Atoms; Biomaterials; Condensed matter physics; Diffusion; Digital storage; Food processing; Food storage; Hydrogen storage; Ionic liquids; Neutron sources; Neutrons; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Nuclear reactors; Polymers; Relaxation processes; Spalling; Spectrometers; Inter-atomic distances; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Neutron scattering instrumentation; Quasielastic neutron scattering; Scattering cross section; Small angle scattering; Spallation neutron sources; Spin-echo spectrometers; Neutron scattering",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018083236

The participating TSOs are currently discussing the harmonisation of prequalification rules for units with limited storage capacity. The exact terms of these prequalification rules will eventually determine how cost-effective the provision of ancillary services by energy-constrained units is. The paper presents the technical, operational and regulatory suitability of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) to bid into this largest European ancillary service cooperation, and gives results from the operation of the Zurich 1 MW BESS in this market. The main challenge for batteries when providing control reserves is the State of Charge (SoC) management: the frequency error signal might be biased over prolonged periods of time, leading to the battery running either full or empty. Since the required investment for BESS largely depends on the storage capacity, the development of the new ENTSO-E Operational Guidelines and the prequalification requirements have a profound impact on the business case of BESS for PCR provision. The recharging strategy used by the Zurich 1 MW BESS is presented and compared to other recharging methods. Possible new capacity requirements for batteries arising from the new Operational Guidelines and new prequalification rules are evaluated by means of simulations and compared to the measurements and operational experience from the Zurich 1 MW BESS. Simulations suggest that a battery capacity of around 220 kWh per offered MW of PCR would be sufficient to withstand even a worst-case frequency excursion, a fact which is supported by the accumulated operational experience and SoC measurements during more than one year of operation. However, depending on the development of the new Operational Guidelines and the recharging strategies allowed under the framework of the new prequalification requirements up to 1’220 kWh of capacity per MW of PCR could be necessary. Such an up to six-fold increase in required energy storage capacity would severely put into question the economic viability of BESS projects for providing PCR services to grid operators. © 2016 CIGRE.

This is especially important since energy mixes with high renewable penetration have become a worldwide priority. One solution to facilitate such goals is to harvest the latent untapped energy of the ocean waves and convert it into electrical energy. A device performing such a task is known as a Wave Energy Converter (WEC). In the present work, we focus on a specific type of WEC, which has the advantages of both significant energy storage capabilities, and adaptability to extract energy from the whole spectrum of ocean waves.

This process, counting as a mild pyrolysis, takes place between 200°C and 300°C. The densified torrefied product is usable as a biofuel for heat and energy production. Over the past years, research on the torrefaction process itself has been intensified and has led to a further understanding of the main chemical mechanisms and their effects. However, the logistics and handling aspects for the supply chain have hardly been covered yet in research. Similar to the use of wood pellets, factors such as dust generation and the risk of dust explosions could pose a serious issue for transport and storage of densified torrefied products and should therefore be examined. The aim of this paper is to present the state of the art on torrefied biomass and biomass logistics as a basis for the research into the handling characteristics of the supply chain. Firstly, densification and torrefaction are introduced. Following, an overview on literature of the handling aspects of torrefied material is presented.

Space environment as well as the uniqueness of space missions impose very specific requirements for these subsystems, and mission goal and profile often account for yet additional restrictions. Currently most power subsystems are based around the harvesting and storage of solar energy, a field of technology which is well known and has a proven track record, especially for near-Earth missions. Interplanetary missions, however, have been better supplied by nuclear power systems, such as RTGs (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators). Nuclear energy have application potential in the fields of power and propulsion, however the use of nuclear material for space applications is a subject of space agency politics where several key institutions have signalled that they consider further use to be out of the question. The radioisotopes in question are also subject to strict regulations in addition to being a scarce and expensive resource. But aside from RTGs, is it still possible to use thermoelectric devices to power the spacecraft? This paper investigates the possible use of thermoelectric generators on board small satellites without the use of radioisotopes, with intent to discover a potential area of use for these low power devices. Measurement results and tests of thermoelectric generators from the Low Earth Orbit Environment Chamber at La SEINE (Laboratory of Spacecraft Environment Interaction Engineering) laboratory at Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan, will be presented and discussed. During the presentation the author would like to propose a design of an integrated system which allows the harvesting of energy from a small thermoelectric generator on board a 3U CubeSat satellite as an example. Similar systems can be designed depending on the satellite mission and the size of the spacecraft. Various types of thermoelectric generators will be considered for use in such a subsystem. During the summary a potential use of such a subsystem will be discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the subsystem will be presented, and the changes and improvements proposed by the author will be shown.",,"Electronic equipment; Energy storage; Interplanetary flight; Nuclear batteries; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Orbits; Radioisotopes; Small satellites; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Space applications; Spacecraft power supplies; Thermoelectric equipment; Integrated systems; Interplanetary mission; Kyushu Institute of Technology; Low-power devices; Radioisotope thermoelectric generators; Space environment; Thermoelectric devices; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016471001

Strong interest in renewable energy sources makes the technologies used to generate energy from the renewable sources become more common and thus they continuously improve. The principal advantage of photovoltaic cells is that they process energy without producing secondary pollution, noise and other factors that cause adverse effects in the environment. Photovoltaic panels (PV panels) rank amongst the fastest growing renewable energy technologies in the world. Thanks to photovoltaics and energy storage technology new possibilities for a low-carbon economy open up. The combination of these technologies allows not only for the storage of unstable “green energy” but it also contributes to the development of low-carbon transport (energy cars). The automotive sector is a large consumer of energy. In this paper, we present a technique for the reduction in CO2 emissions of a battery charging solar roof in M1 cars, which is approved by the European Commission as an innovative solution (eco-innovation code 7).

However, according to latest reports, intestinal flora plays a significant part in aetiology of these medical conditions. The fact that intestinal microflora may affect body weight, sensitivity to insulin, metabolism of sugars and lipids leads to a conclusion that any change within intestinal microflora may be the reason for pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Moreover, any attempt to modify it may cause decrease or limitation of the intensity of the medical conditions mentioned above. Intestinal microbiota is now one of the most developing subjects for research.

However, H2 and CO are both produced in the cathode and the electricity consumption is large. In this paper, direct carbon-assisted SOEC for H2O electrolysis (DC-SOFEC) is proposed for cogenerating electricity power and syngas with easy control of H2/CO ratio. A 2D numerical model is developed to study the effects of operating and design parameters on the DC-SOFEC performance. The model is validated with experimental data for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell. One important finding is that the carbon assisting is effective in lowering the equilibrium potential of SOEC, thus greatly reduces the electrical power consumption for H2O electrolysis. The DC-SOFEC can generate electrical power, CO and H2 simultaneously at a low current density and sufficiently high temperature. Compared with conventional SOEC for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis, DC-SOFEC is advantageous as CO and H2 are produced in the anode and cathode, respectively. This enables easy control of H2/CO ratio, which is helpful for subsequent processes to synthesize other chemicals or fuels from syngas. Besides, DC-SOFEC can actually produce electricity rather than consuming it. The model can be used for subsequent design optimization of SOFEC for effective energy storage and conversion. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

The control objective is to make the system behave like a passive mechanical tool that interacts with the human and the environment passively with a specified power scaling factor. In our previous work, a virtual velocity coordination approach recasts the single degree-of-freedom human power amplifier control problem into a velocity coordination with a fictitious reference mechanical system. Force amplification becomes a natural consequence of the velocity coordination. In this paper, this control approach is extended for fully coupled multi- DoF systems. A passivity based control approach that uses the natural energy storage of the hydraulic actuator to take full account of the nonlinear pressure dynamics is used to define the flow requirement. Additional passive assistance dynamics are designed and implemented to enable the user to perform specific tasks more easily. Guidance is achieved using a passive velocity field controller (PVFC), and obstacle avoidance is achieved using a potential field.

These models have demonstrated that there are two types of instabilities - a leaning instability and an instability leading to excessive oscillation. While these models provide insight into the stability of upright bipedal stance, they are not sufficient for individuals that require the aid of assistive technologies, such as a passive-cane or a walker. Without a valid model one is unable to understand the control parameters required for maintain upright posture or if similar instabilities even exist when assistive technologies are used. Therefore in this study, we developed a mathematical model of human posture while using a passive-cane to examine the nonlinear dynamics of stance. First, we developed a simple mathematical model of cane assisted human stance by adapting the inverted pendulum model of Chagdes et al., [1]. We modeled the human body, upper arm, forearm, cane, and ground as a two-degree-offreedom, five-bar-linkage with pin joints representing the ankle, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. Second, we investigate upright stability in the parameter space of feedback gain and time-delay. We hypothesize that the analysis will show similar instabilities compared to that of a human standing without assistive technology. We also hypothesize that the space of control parameters which stabilize upright equilibrium posture will increase when a cane is incorporated. This study has two potential applications. First, the developed mathematical model could allow clinicians to better assess technology assisted balance and if needed help clinicians to customize a treatment plan for an individual that allows them to avoid unstable postural dynamics. Second, the mathematical model can be used to design customized assistive technology for people of difference physical properties and impairments.

Natural variability among wood species in terms of chances in induced water stress in stem moisture content is large. Under severe water deficit, plants have to face the dilemma of dying by drying or being starved of carbon. Changes in the water content of extensible tissues of the stem are readily reversible, causing diurnal variation driven by changing water potential in the xylem.

The IFE approach connects series resonant isolation stages operating in the half-cycle discontinuous-conduction-mode (HC-DCM) directly to the MV AC grid in an input-series, output-parallel (ISOP) configuration, but the entire control, i.e., the shaping of the grid current for unity power factor and output voltage regulation, is carried out by a second, non-isolated conversion stage on the LV side. However, since the isolation stages do not operate with a DC but with an AC or AC input voltage, the transformer magnetizing current available for ZVS as well as the voltage to be switched vary over the grid period. Taking into account also component tolerances among the cascaded converter cells, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the ZVS behavior under these conditions, and of the associated losses and EMI considerations, presenting a loss-optimal choice of the magnetizing inductance value and of the dead time (interlock time) of the isolation stages' bridge legs.

By applying a newly modified efficient particle swarm optimization algorithm, the voltage and current data are used to estimate the intrinsic parameters of a high-order electrical battery model. A prototype has been implemented for extracting the intrinsic parameters of four different types of 12V lead-acid battery, and with evaluation current evaluated up to 150A.

ES are especially desired in systems where rising penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) with its variable nature has become a challenge for distribution grid operators to maintain voltage quality inside the permissible range. Increasingly, it requires the involvement of new distributed resources, such as energy storage devices to smooth power fluctuations of RES and to avoid long-term voltage rises. To achieve the best results such devices should be located as close to the micro source as possible - very often in residential areas. This in turn requires meeting many restrictions such as limited space, high level of safety and low energy storage costs.

The energy recovery within the urban water supply networks is a type of micro-hydro that may be useful for the control of excessive pressures. On the other hand, local decentralized production of electricity may have multiple uses, considering self-consumption at local grid level or storage. However, there is still a lack of technologies and specific solutions for such applications, since the flows are highly variable and the available heads are small and limited to service pressures. A scheme specially conceived for water supply networks making use of a micro turbine is proposed.Adequate positioning conditions are identified using a search algorithm which considers both the assessment of the energy production and sizing of the main equipment and works. Typical schemes are proposed where the installation of up to four turbines is possible within the same buried chamber created around an existing pipe. Preliminary results obtained for a network case study show that the implementation of the proposed energy recovery solution is feasible. The installation of a by-pass revealed to have a key role in the feasibility of each solution, demanding customized engineering judgment.

Electric vehicles, including plug-in EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), have a huge potential to play an important role in future energy systems. EVs and FCEVs can be used to discharge electricity to the grid, and when aggregating the power of a large number of vehicles, they can function as dispatchable power plants. Plug-in EVs can adapt their charging behaviour to the needs of the power system operator, and similarly they can act as storage by charging their batteries for example, when there is a surplus of renewable energy. Fuel cell cars (FCEVs), while parked, can produce electricity more efficiently than the present electricity system and with useful ‘waste’ products, heat and fresh water. In terms of technology, the energy production system “Car as Power Plant” can be envisaged as a fleet of fuel cell vehicles, where cars, while parked (over 90% of the time), can produce with the fuel cell electricity, heat and fresh water that can be feed into the respective grids. The Car as Power Plant system with FCEVs has the potential to replace all electricity production power plants, creating a flexible detachable decentralized multi-modal energy system. This chapter will address the role of electric mobility in the future energy systems in general and its role in demand response and in flexible generation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014706304

The similarity of modular converters is the unlimited capability of combining identical lowor medium-power subsystems to achieve a system with higher power ratings. Mainly due to the high degree of modularity, modular topologies provide high output energy quality, high reliability, high efficiency, easy maintenance, and cost-weight-volume reduction. All these features are due to the series connection of submodules (SMs), whereas they are identical with the same rated power and can be seen as power cells with similar circuit topology and controlled by the same control and modulation schemes. Thus, for high-power large-scale modular structures, in which the number of power cells per arm (m) are usually more than ten, designing the SMs with standard lowor medium-voltage technology devices has a significant impact on converter efficiency, since it is possible to obtain a high number of voltage levels, allowing an expressive reduction in average switching frequency without compromising the power quality. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.","Average switching frequency reduction; High output energy quality; Identical low-power subsystem; Identical medium-power subsystem; Modular converter structure reliability; Power supply quality; Power system reliability; Switching convertors; Voltage source topologies","DC power transmission; HVDC power transmission; Power converters; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Structure (composition); Topology; Variable speed drives; Converter structure; High output; Low Power; Medium power; Power supply quality; Power system reliability; Voltage source; Reliability",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014269381

Conventionally, energy harvesting systems are optimized to operate in a single worst-case scenario. However, it is often the case that the available input power varies in different situations, which creates a need for energy converters that operates efficiently over a broader input power range. In this paper, a versatile buck-boost converter suitable for wireless energy harvesting and transfer is proposed. The converter maximizes the system's efficiency by maintaining its input resistance fixed during harvesting. Harvested energy is stored in a storage capacitor. The converter can be dynamically adjusted for different available input power and voltage levels. This is accomplished by employing pulse frequency modulation and reconfigurable power switches. A novel adaptively biased zero-current-detection comparator is employed to increase the converter's efficiency, its input having an offset that depends on the output voltage. The converter was simulated for input power levels from 1μW to 1 mW and input voltage level from 0.38 to 1.3 V. Its peak efficiency is 76.3% at an input power of 1μW and 86.3% at 1 mW. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Electric current regulators; Energy harvesting; Medical applications; Biomedical applications; Buck boost converter; Continuous improvements; Energy converters; Energy harvesting systems; RF energy harvesting; Wireless Energy Harvesting; Worst case scenario; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014150508

The composite matrix was the GTR that had been separated from its metals and yarns. Meanwhile, the fillers were fabricated from magnetic cores of the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) monitor waste through high energy ball milling in wet condition. Some physicochemical characterizations of the powders were initially conducted to collect the physical and chemical properties. Based on the examination, the ground powders were identified as pure magnetite (Fe3O4) having low remnant and high magnetization. The MREs samples were prepared by high-temperature high-pressure sintering. The mixed of crumb rubber and magnetite powder was vulcanized under simultaneous pressure and temperature in the absence of magnetic fields, which resulted in an isotropic MREs type. The abilities of specimens were examined in relation to the external magnetic field through static and dynamic compression tests. The experimental investigation showed that the static and dynamic stresses of the stiffness increased by the increment of magnetic fields up to a particular point of ux density. The tunability of the stiffness indicated that the elastomers could provide wide ranges of storage and loss modulus. © 2016 Sharif University of Technology.","Compression mode; Electronic waste; Ground tire rubber; Magnetite powders; Magnetorheological elastomers","Ball milling; Cathode ray tubes; Cathodes; Compression testing; Elastomers; Electronic Waste; Iron oxides; Magnetic fields; Magnetite; Metallic matrix composites; Plastics; Powder metals; Sintering; Stiffness; Tires; Wastes; Compression mode; Experimental investigations; Ground tire rubbers; High temperature high pressure; Magnetite powder; Magneto-rheological elastomers; Physical and chemical properties; Physico-chemical characterization; Physicochemical properties; commodity; composite; compression; electronic waste; equipment; high temperature; magnetic field; magnetite; magnetization; metal; physicochemical property; polymer; pressure effect; stress-strain relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014057224

In this paper, Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA) method is applied to assess the different RE generation and load profiles from two seasonal climates namely winter and summer. The minimum electricity targets established from PoPA allows the designer to visualise the feasible limits for the sizing of HPS. Results show that HPS operation during winter demands a substantial amount of outsourced electricity, while summer operation requires higher investment on the PV generator and storage. © 2016 The Authors.","Hybrid power systems; Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA); Renewable energy; Seasonal variations","Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Investments; Process engineering; Stochastic systems; Climate variation; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid power systems (HPS); Pinch analysis; Renewable energies; Seasonal variation; Solar and winds; Stochastic nature; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013924706

The expansible feature allows a reduced up-front investment and permits the site owner to add more charge points when the demand for fast charge increases. In addition, the proposed off board has an energy storage system which allows shaping the power demanded from the grid, reducing power peaks and possibly the total energy cost, since battery bank is used to store energy when few vehicles are connected. The proposed off board fast charge station is comprised of the following blocks: i) transformer operating from a medium voltage grid followed by a twelve pulse non-controlled rectifier with a small active filter; ii) energy storage system; iii) a 600V DC distribution bus; iv) charging end-points composed of buck interleaved converters. Each end-point, which has potentially low cost, complexity and footprint, gives up to 60 kW charge to an electric vehicle. Simulations results are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed off board fast charging. Also, results from current harmonics at the grid side and analysis of converters responses are presented.

Hybrid photon-counting (HPC) pixel detectors proved to be a disruptive technology for almost all X-ray diffraction applications in the energy range from 2 to 30 keV. Themain reason for this success is the accurate determination of scattering and diffraction patterns at the level of individual photons over an extremely high dynamic range. The technology of photon-counting detectors is based on segmented semiconductor sensors, predominantly silicon arrays, which allow direct detection of X-rays and guarantee very high stability and simple operation at room temperature. The sensors are coupled to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which process the electrical signal pulses from the sensor and are designed using modern CMOS processes. The implementation of energy thresholds gives counting detectors the unique capability to determine the number of photons in a specific energy range for very high local and global count rates. The digital detection and storage avoids any readout noise and permits very high frame rates. Combining these features in one device led to a transition from CCD-based detector systems to HPC detectors for applications like protein crystallography, small-angle scattering, and surface and powder diffraction and offers new opportunities in time-resolved experiments.

Over the past 60 years, important advance in carbon dynamics and ecosystem energy flow have been made mainly through the Budget and Metabolism approaches. However, much less focus has been given to the quantification of longitudinal movement of organic matter. The concept “Organic Carbon Spiraling” (SOC) was formulated in the early 80s, and represented a substantial advance in the understanding of the longitudinal flow of elements in lotic systems. Methods: In this review, we summarize the history behind the SOC concept, cover the major advances at the time of its creation, describe the operational variables and the equation for SOC calculation, and discuss future directions and current applications of this approach. Results/Conclusions: We emphasize the need for integrating the C spiraling approach in other regions of the globe, given that measurements are almost exclusive of North America. Such comparative studies can elucidate important drivers of C export, storage and oxidation. Advance in dissolved organic carbon characterization, and improvements in heterotrophic respiration measurements are required to improve SOC accuracy, as well as realistic estimates of benthic stock. With the current interest in examining how lotic systems contribute to regional and global C budgets, we argue that SOC is an effective way to achieve this goal and answer classical questions in stream ecology. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Limnologia.

The simplified model for simulation of building's behavior can be used in global operational optimization of DH systems, and the methodology demonstrated in this article can help DH operators in assessing, what kind of power limitation can be used under certain conditions for a group of buildings with certain properties, in order not to affect the comfort of the customers nor make significant errors in simulation. The results can prove useful for DH system operators in the near future.","District Heating; Load Shifting; Optimization; Smart District Heating; Thermal Energy Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012866920

As a result, the flexbattery pack does not have a positive or negative terminal, but terminals that can operate at arbitrary voltage levels, both positive or negative. Since each connection terminal can generate a variable voltage within a certain range, the system can also supply ac voltage. Therefore, with appropriate control this innovative flexbattery could be directly applied to an electrical motor. Also, the flexbattery pack can be charged from any voltage level within the nominal output range of the pack, both dc or ac. The elementary flexbattery unit is introduced and analyzed together with the operation of a pack.

Currently, utilization of biomass residue as a source of energy is becoming very promising as it not only reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and the related environmental impact but also assist in solving the long-term problems related to the disposal of these materials. The problem with as-received biomass residue is, however, the difficulty of use as a source of energy due to its high moisture content, low density and issues related with handling, storage and transportation. One of the ideal solution to dispose the sludge is by converting it into useful energy in form of solid fuel such as pallet and briquette. This solution not only solve the sludge disposal problem but also generate energy to mankind. However, the main problem faced in order to convert this sludge into energy is it contains high moisture content which is more than 90% of moisture content. In order to convert it into useful energy, the moisture content of the sludge need to reduce into acceptable level which is below 20%. One of the method to remove the moisture content is by using thermal dryer. This paper discussing about the moisture content of the sewage sludge dried using the thermal dryer. The preliminary result obtain from the research found that the moisture content of the sewage sludge can be reduce up to 10.82% depending on the speed and the temperature of the dryer. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

It allows to cool grain, independent of ambient conditions, to ""safe"" temperatures where insect, fungi, and spoilage development is reduced to the minimum, and at the same time can potentially reduce chemical control use. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of chilling aeration to preserve grain quality and control insect-pests. The research trial was developed from August to November 2015 in Central Kansas in two 1, 270 metric tons (MT) steel bins with low-moisture wheat from the 2015 summer harvest. One bin was chilled and the other was used as a control (ambient aeration). Variables evaluated were: moisture content (MC), grain and flour quality, insect-pest development and reproduction rate, insect fragments per kg, and fungi presence. Chilling aeration cooled the grain in 135 hours to an average of 17 °C, with minimum variation through the four months. Ambient aeration in the control bin cooled the grain to an average of 22 °C after 308 hours, with variation over 16C through the four months. Lower temperatures significantly diminished insect development and reproduction rate. Flour quality was better preserved in the chilled than in the control bin. There was no significant effect on MC, grain quality or fungi presence. The energy cost of running the grain chiller was 0.22 $/MT more than the cost of ambient aeration in the control bin.","Ambient aeration; Chilling aeration; End-product quality; Fungi; Grain quality; Grain temperature; Insect-pests","Fungi; Grain (agricultural product); Insect control; Moisture; Ambient air conditions; Ambient conditions; Chemical controls; End-products; Grain quality; Grain temperature; Insect pest; Lower temperatures; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009121686

Furthermore, concern about global warming has led to rapid growth in renewable energy and energy storage technologies. This trend is encouraging power utilities to effectively exploit the use of renewable energy resources (RESs) and energy storage facilities (ESFs) for power supply systems. In this regards, trigeneration in the presence of RESs and ESFs can play an important role for efficient and clean power dispatch. This paper discusses the optimum power dispatch using a hybrid power plant consisting of trigeneration-based thermal plants, RES-based plants, and energy storage facilities. Mathematical modeling of such a dispatch problem is formulated and the analysis is carried out using MATLAB simulations. Results show that considerable reduction in fuel utilization and pollutants emission can be achieved using such hybrid plants by using the optimum power dispatch proposed here. © TÜBITAK.","Energy Storage; Optimization; Pollutants Emission; Power Dispatch; Renewable Energy; Renewable Penetration Level; Trigeneration","Electric power systems; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; MATLAB; Optimization; Pollution; Proven reserves; Renewable energy resources; Penetration level; Pollutants emissions; Power dispatch; Renewable energies; Tri-generation; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008474116

Virtual power plants (VPPs) using these strategies have been tested in living lab environments on a scale of up to hundreds of households. So far, the coordination configuration of a VPP is fixed in these settings. The DREAM [2] framework architecture uses heterarchies to make parts of a VPP flexible in coordination strategy depending on the current operational grid status. In this way, a sub-VPP, serving one coordination objective, can decouple from and couple to an overarching VPP with another coordination objective dynamically. In this paper a grid congestion simulation with an overarching VPP coordinating demand and supply for electricity market optimization [3] and a sub-VPP reacting to a heat-pump congestion event in winter and a PV overproduction event in summer is described. The simulation was run in a static simulator [4]. The LVsegment consisted of 'flameless' residential areas with well-insulated homes with primarily heat pumps for heating and some renovated homes with local gas-fired co-generators of heat and electricity. Households additionally had solar cells, batteries and EV charging units. The goal of the additional coordination sub-VPP was to solve grid stability issues like congestion due to heat pump loads in winter and overproduction by PV in summer in this physical part locally, while the rest of the cluster remained unaffected and still optimizing for the commercial goal. The results were analyzed in terms of infringement of comfort parameters and performance in adapting the flexible load and generation. It appeared, substantial load shedding and load shifting of devices is possible to show the synergy in solving the grid stability issues evenly sharing the discomfort to the individual heating devices. By changing their charging strategy, the new algorithm also showed heat storage and electricity storage devices providing additional support.",,"Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric energy storage; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Pumps; Software agents; Solar cells; Virtual storage; Charging strategies; Congestion management; Coordination strategy; Electricity storages; Framework architecture; Heat and electricity; Micro-economic theory; Virtual power plants; Electric load shedding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007564447

Methods: Twenty normozoospermic semen samples were cryopreserved and divided into five groups. The samples in Group 1 were immersed in liquid nitrogen throughout the experiment in cryogenic storage tanks; the cryopreserved straws in Group 2 were placed in a Styrofoam box containing dry ice and kept under these conditions for 48 hours; the samples in Group 3 were kept for 48 hours on dry ice under the same conditions as the Group 2 samples, and were then moved to a storage tank filled with liquid nitrogen; Group 4 samples were also kept for 48 hours in dry ice storage, and the Styrofoam box containing the samples was shipped by plane to assess the effects of shipping; the samples in Group 5 were shipped together with the Group 4 samples and were placed in a storage tank with liquid nitrogen after spending 48 hours stored on dry ice. After thawing, sperm parameters were analyzed for viability, vitality, and motility; spermatozoa were also tested for mitochondrial activity. Results: Significant decreases in motility recovery rates (P=0.01) and vitality (P=0.001) were observed in all groups when compared to the control group. Mitochondrial activity was significantly decreased only in Group 5 (P=0.04), as evidenced by greater numbers of sperm cells not stained by reagent 3,3’-diaminobenzidine. Conclusions: Transportation did not affect the quality of cryopreserved semen samples, but dry ice as a means to preserve the samples during transportation had detrimental effects upon the sperm parameters assessed in this study. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Reproducao Assistida.

This technology is mainly being used for electricity generation by steam power cycles, but there is huge potential for this technology to be used in industrial heating applications. Though this technology is already developed and successfully been used in many developed countries, but there is barely any development in Malaysia. The performance of parabolic trough collector system is highly dependent on geographic location and meteorological conditions. A parabolic trough solar heating system has been designed and simulated using meteorological data of Ipoh, Malaysia. Thermal performance of the designed system was evaluated for fixed load and without thermal energy storage. A unique set of conditions is required for designing the PTC system but the solar radiation and incident angle changes throughout the year. So, setting appropriate design point conditions is crucial in designing of PTC system. The effect of field size on capacity factor and dumped energy is also explained, using the concept of solar multiple. It was noted that increase in field size have very little impact on capacity factor for solar multiple values higher than 2. This study was conducted for solar-only system without thermal energy storage which resulted low annual capacity factor. So, it is not worth depending solely on solar energy, combination of solar with conventional fuel system can significantly contribute in reduction of fuel usage also the addition of thermal energy storage can add to its value even more. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Design point conditions; Malaysian climate; Parabolic trough collectors; Process heating; Solar multiple",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007198821

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and x-ray diffraction analysis were performed. Results: The initial bond strengths did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.053). However, after aging procedures, airborne-particle abrasion with feldspathic ceramic powder (FP) resulted in higher values of bond strength (p = 0.0001). SEM and EDS indicated that all the treatments promoted silica deposition on the Y-TZP surface ceramic. Airborne-particle abrasion with FP and LP induced a lower percentage of the monoclinic phase. Conclusion: Airborne abrasion with fine feldspathic ceramic particles is a novel tribochemical technique and appears to be suitable for improving the bond strength between zirconia and resin cements. © 2016 copyright by Quintessenz.

In this chapter, we investigate the circumstances under which this new CloudC infrastructure is likely to reduce energy use of our new digital lifestyle, or when it simply catalyses a rebound effect that could hamper ICT-related energy savings. We classify CloudC rebound effects as either direct or indirect rebound effects, and we discuss the differences and overlap between rebound effects, enabling effects, and transformational effects.

The study used one experimental light-curing composite material (ECM) and one commercially available flowable light-curing composite material (FA) that were modified with 0.5-5.0 wt% anhydrous calcium fluoride. Morphology of the samples and uniformity of CaF2 distribution were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Mechanical properties were tested after 24-hour storage of specimens in dry or wet conditions. Stored dry ECM enriched with 0.5-1.0 wt% CaF2 showed higher tensile strength values, while water storage of all modified ECM specimens decreased their tensile strength. The highest Vickers hardness tested after dry storage was observed for 2.5 wt% CaF2 content in ECM. The addition of 2.0-5.0 wt% CaF2 to FA caused significant decrease in tensile strength after dry storage and overall tensile strength decrease of modified FA specimens after water storage. The content of 2.0 wt% CaF2 in FA resulted in the highest Vickers hardness tested after wet storage.

For this, thermochemical materials provide a promising solution. The compactness of a long-term storage system is determined by the thermochemical reaction, operating conditions, and system implementation with the necessary additional system components. Within the MERITS project a thermochemical storage (TCS) system is being demonstrated using evacuated, closed TCS modules containing Na2S as active material. The present modules are expected to reach a heat storage density of 0.18GJ/m3.

Situated in Yverdon-les-Bains (Switzerland), the solar installation aims to provide up to 60% of the thermal energy demand of the site. Coupled with a gas boiler, the solar collectors were designed to meet the energy needs of an onsite building, and to ensure constant temperature of a bitumen tank and two emulsions tanks (mixture of bitumen and water). In order to analyse and optimise the thermo-economic and environmental efficiency of this installation, a R&D project funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy was launched in 2014. This article gives an overview of the project objectives and describes the solar thermal installation and its operating modes. It also presents the numerical model and the first experimental results. First observations have revealed a thermal installation operating well behind its expected targets. Typically, the solar collector efficiency at temperatures above 200°C is 50% lower than expected since it is operating under non-optimal conditions. Some technical dysfunctions have also been detected in the control system of one of the storage tanks. Consequently, a thorough evaluation of the operation of the installation was conducted to identify any other anomalies. In parallel to this work, the numerical model of the installation was developed and is currently under validation against the ongoing experimental measurements. Preliminary simulations of the installation in its current state have showed a solar yield nearly 2 times lower than expected, confirming the existence of anomalies in the running of the installation. © 2016 The Authors.","measurements; medium temperature industrial applications; numerical simulation; solar thermal collectors; thermal storage","Bituminous materials; Computer simulation; Heat storage; Measurements; Numerical models; Planning; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Constant temperature; Environmental efficiency; Medium temperature; Optimal conditions; Project objectives; Solar thermal collector; Swiss Federal Office; Thermal storage; Collector efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005965441

MgH2 co-catalyzed with K2NiF6 and CNTs exhibited an improvement in the onset dehydrogenation temperature and isothermal de/rehydrogenation kinetics compared with the MgH2-K2NiF6 composite. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 doped with 10 wt% K2NiF6 and 5 wt% CNTs is 245 °C, which demonstrated a reduction of 25 °C compared with the MgH2 + 10 wt% K2NiF6 composite. In terms of rehydrogenation kinetics, MgH2 doped with 10 wt% K2NiF6 and 5 wt% CNTs samples absorbed 3.4 wt% of hydrogen in 1 min at 320 °C, whereas the MgH2 + 10 wt% K2NiF6 sample absorbed 2.6 wt% of hydrogen under the same conditions. For dehydrogenation kinetics at 320 °C, the MgH2 + 10 wt% K2NiF6 + 5 wt% CNTs sample released 3.3 wt% hydrogen after 5 min of dehydrogenation.

The core element of a P2G plant is the electrolyser which transforms low cost and/or renewable electricity into hydrogen. A thorough analysis of the implications of selecting an electrolyser technology (namely alkaline or PEM) and scale is key for understanding the performance and economic benefits of P2G plants generating hydrogen or methane. In this study, a dynamic P2G model accounting for electrolyser ageing is presented following a bottom-up approach in which the electrolyser cell is modelled by means of its polarisation curve. This model allows to determine the performance, levelised cost and value of P2G plants purchasing electricity and selling gas in the wholesale market, depending on the system configuration under the Swiss regulatory context. The results indicate that technical and economic benefits increase with the electrolyser rating but those improvements are more marked for systems on the kW scale while levelling off for the MW scale. Higher capacity factors (by approximately 11%) are needed for PEM electrolysers compared to alkaline electrolysers in order to minimise the levelised cost. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Alkaline electrolyser; Energy storage; PEM electrolyser; Power to gas; Techno-economic analysis; Value proposition","Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Gas plants; Hydrogen; Electrolysers; PEM electrolyser; Power to gas; Techno- economic analysis; Value proposition; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002788225

Two main conversion technologies of SGE are membrane-based processes; pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and reverse electrodialysis (RED). In PRO, semipermeable membranes placed between the two streams of solutions allow the transport of water from lowpressure diluted solution to high-pressure concentrated solution. RED requires two alternating semipermeable membranes that allow the diffusion of the ions but not the flow of H2O. Lifetime and power density of the semipermeable membrane are two main factors affecting on deployment of PRO and RED. Semipermeable membranes with lifetime greater than 10 years and power density higher than 5 W/m2 would lead to faster development of this conversion technology. An exergy analysis of an SGE system of sea-river can be applied to calculate the maximum potential power for electricity generation. Seawater is taken as reference environment (global dead state) for calculating the exergy of water since the seawater is the final reservoir. Once the fresh water is mixed with water of the sea or lake it becomes unuseful for human, agricultural or industrial uses loses all its exergy. Aqueous sodium chloride solution model is used in this study to calculate the thermodynamic properties of seawater. This model does not consider seawater as an ideal model and provides accurate thermodynamics properties of sodium chloride solution.

Hence, electrical hubs (EH) and virtual power plants that combine non-dispatchable energy sources, energy storage and dispatchable energy sources such as internal combustion generators and micro gas turbines are getting popular. However, designing such energy systems considering the electricity demand of a neighborhood, curtailments for grid interactions and real time pricing (RTP) of the main utility grid (MUG) is a difficult exercise. Seasonal and hourly variation of electricity demand, potential for each nondispatchable energy source and RTP of MUG needs to be considered when designing the energy system. Representation of dispatch strategy plays a major role in this process where simultaneous optimization of system design and dispatch strategy is required. This study presents a bi-level dispatch strategy based on reinforced learning for simultaneous optimization of system design and operation strategy of an EH.

Such a drastic expansion rate of PV and the resulting excess energy thereof, however, can lead to technical challenges for the infrastructure of the power system. In this paper, the impact of the future PV penetration on a real urban low voltage (LV) area is presented. To this end, two PV scenarios are devised and implemented, and quasi dynamic load flow simulations are conducted for every fifteen minutes interval of a whole year. To generate the input data, a load profile generator is developed based on smart meter measurement data. It is concluded that the examined urban area appears to be prepared for a certain amount of further PV integration as there were no violations detected for the medium PV production scenario (43% of the total consumption in the area). However, for the maximum PV penetration scenario to be implemented, violations such as over voltage and transformer overloading are detected. To resolve these issues, different mitigation measures such as battery energy storage system, active power curtailment and short-term overloading of the transformer are implemented and examined with the aid of appropriate mathematical models. As a result, at least 20% of the PV energy needs to be stored, curtailed or used by demand side management, in order to run the low voltage grid as it is. In a further work, an intelligent combination of different measures could be examined to fully utilize the excess energy. © 2016","active power curtailment; battery energy storage system; demand side management; PV penetration; short term transformer overloading","Demand side management; Digital storage; Dynamic loads; Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Expansion; Active power; Battery energy storage systems; Electrical energy; Federal governments; Mitigation measures; Pv penetrations; Technical challenges; Transformer overloading; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997327890

The results indicated that 10 wt% SrFe12O19 showed the best performance, compared with un-doped MgH2, in terms of the onset dehydrogenation temperature. The desorption temperature of MgH2 + 10 wt% SrFe12O19 decreased to about 270 °C compared to the 350 °C and 420 °C for as-milled and as-received MgH2, respectively. The de/rehydrogenation kinetics of MgH2 also improved after doping with SrFe12O19. Increasing the doping amount of SrFe12O19 to 15, 20 and 50 wt% brought about negative effects, such as lower capacity and slower sorption rates. From Kissinger plot differential scanning calorimetry, the apparent activation energy was 133.31 kJ mol-1 for as-milled MgH2 and 114.22 kJ mol-1 for MgH2 + 10 wt% SrFe12O19, indicating that SrFe12O19 addition decreased the activation energy for hydrogen desorption of MgH2.

Dept., University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","In recent years, considerable effort has been made in order to validate different methods that aim at estimating the wave spectra from the motions recorded on a ship or on an offshore platform. For more than ten years now, the University of São Paulo has been working on a wave inference method for moored oceanic systems, such as Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels. This paper brings the first results from an ongoing field campaign, started in December 2014, for the estimation of wave statistics by means of this system, which is based on a Bayesian inference approach. The performance of the motionbased method is checked against the wave estimations provided by a commercial marine radar system. The radar is installed in a fixed platform close to the FPSO that is being monitored, which is moored in a turret configuration. Comparison between both systems allows one not only to evaluate the performance of the method but also to evaluate the inherent limitations that exist when the estimations are based on a very large vessel, especially one whose heading may be subjected to fast variations. In this work, a new algorithm for the partition of the wave spectrum is used, differing from the previous works. This technique allows the identification and combination of energy peaks of the directional spectrum into wave systems, providing better modal wave statistics and less noise in the final spectrum. Previously validation of the wave inference method was made through numerical and small-scale experimental analysis. Also, in previous studies, a 9-month field campaign was also used to validate the Bayesian method using a spread-moored FPSO, but no comparison to other measurement technique was made, instead, numerical forecasts were adopted. In this work this objective is achieved: so far, 10 months of estimates from the Bayesian inference algorithm have already been compared to data supplied by a radar system. Comparisons with the marine radar readings attest an adequate identification of mean wave directions, with the Bayesian model estimating mean wave directions that are in close agreement to those provided by the radar system most of the time. There are, however, a few cases when the discrepancy is large and the reasons for this are still under investigation. The comparison between both sources of data provides some insightful results, which are discussed in this paper. First, they confirm and quantify the main biases of the applied method, which are related to the filtering of the energy from high-frequency waves. On the other hand, they attest that the performance of the method for more severe sea states is good overall, showing that the method is able to provide good estimates of wave height and direction and also to capture situations when wave conditions are changing fast, such as the ones that occur with the incoming of cold fronts from South.

Currently the flows from different areas are usually determined by needs local to that area. During dry weather this may result in large variations in the flow into the WWTP. There are two reasons why this may be undesirable. Due to design peculiarities of some WWTP's this may disrupt the treatment process and necessitate the use of additional energy and chemicals. In other cases areas are connected to the same pressurized transport pipe line, so energy costs may be higher when multiple stations use the line at the same time. Due to the daily variation in the sewage flow from domestic and light industrial sources, limits on temporary in system storage and due to limitations on the range of discharges the pumps can deliver, minimizing the flow variations can be a complex problem. Under the assumption of a periodic inflow sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are given. The conditions imply the existence of a repeatable pattern of a length less than a day. © 2016","Environmental engineering; Scheduling algorithms; Waste treatment","Environmental engineering; Scheduling algorithms; Sewage; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Complex problems; Daily variations; Existence of a solutions; Industrial sources; Multiple source; Treatment plants; Treatment process; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995618039

Many alternative hydrogen storage media have been investigated in the last decade to solve efficient hydrogen storage problems. Storing hydrogen in adsorbents physically is a significant solution. Carbon based materials and framework structured metal-organic compounds also have intense attention for hydrogen storage by physical adsorption. In this work, the effect of surface area and dopant percentage on hydrogen storage have been emphasized. Different amounts of platinum loaded with activated carbon as the dopant is milled with the activated carbon and Cu-BTC as matrix materials. It was found that the increased amount of dopant caused more adsorption on the adsorbent surfaces. Thus, the hydrogen storage properties increased. But, the excess amount of additives decreases the micro-porosity by way of the hydrogen storage. At 4 wt. % of the additive, platinum loaded activated carbon, increases the hydrogen uptake approx. 10 and 15% in activated carbon and Cu-BTC respectively. On the contrary, 10 wt. % of the additive decreases the hydrogen uptake approx. 2 and 25% of adsorbents in the same order.","Composites; Hydrogen storage; MOF; Pore size distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995587905

Chia seeds were acquired with initial moisture content of 9.0% (d.b.) and submitted to drying until average moisture content of 2.3% (d.b.). Methodology: Experimental data were fitted to six mathematical models usually used to represent drying of agricultural products. Diffusion Approach and Verma models were the ones that best fitted. Results: Thermodynamic properties presented a high correlation with drying temperature, in which higher temperature resulted in lower values of entropy and enthalpy values, whilst this increment increased values of Gibbs free energy. Activation energy of drying process was 10.67 kJ mol-1. Conclusion: Diffusion approach and Verma models are suitable to represent drying curves of chia seeds. © 2016 G.H.H.

Maize and sorghum were harvested at dough (363 g/kg) and milk stages (275 g/kg), respectively. Herbages were chopped approximately 1.5 cm after harvest and then ensiled in mini silos at high and low-bulk densities for 8.5 weeks. Different bulk densities were achieved by ensiling different weights of herbage in the fixed-volume mini silos (1.5-L anaerobic jars, Weck, Germany). The obtained dry matter (DM) densities were 168 and 216 kg of DM/m3 for maize forage and 132 and 178 kg of DM/m3 for sorghum forage. Fermentation kinetics, the rate of aerobic deterioration upon aerobic exposure, and nutrient digestibility were followed during the periods of ensiling (on days 2, 4, 8, 15, and 60). In all cases, increased packing density resulted in silages with lower acetate content, ammonium N levels, and fermentation losses, but lactate content did not differ. Butyrate was detected in appreciable amounts only in sorghum silage. Propionate was not detected in any silage. Tightly packed silages remained stable upon exposure to air. Tight packing increases the digestibly of nutrients and improves the energy content of silages. These data show that high density limits air infiltration and reduces the oxidation loss during storage and feed-out. As a consequence, more dry matter is recovered and more energy is preserved. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.","Cereals; Nutritional profile; Packing density; Silage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994410091

However, the development of high-performance fuel cells requires new AEMs tailored for high conductivity and chemical stability. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of AEMs with polycationic side chains attached to poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) via flexible alkyl spacer units. Three series of PPOs were functionalized with side chains to study the influence of the number (n = 2-6) of -CH2- groups in between the quaternary ammonium (QA) cations, the ion exchange capacity (IECs), and the number (q = 1-4) of QA cations per side chain. The polymers were prepared by successively reacting bromoalkylated PPO with different tertiary diaminoalkanes and 1,6-dibromohexane. Evaluation of the alkaline stability by 1H NMR spectroscopy and thermogravimetry demonstrated that solvent cast AEMs with n = 2 and 3 quickly degraded via Hofmann β-elimination in 1 M NaOH at 60 °C. In sharp contrast, no degradation was detected for AEMs with n = 4 and 6 after storage in 1 M NaOH at 90 °C over at least 8 days. At similar IECs, the OH- conductivity of the AEMs increased with n up to n = 4, whereafter a plateau was reached. This may be explained by a polyelectrolyte effect leading to counter ion condensation and incomplete ion dissociation when the QA cations were closer than the Bjerrum length (approx. 7 Å). The conductivity of AEMs with n = 6 and IEC = 1.9 meq. g-1 increased only slightly with the number of QA cations per side chain up to q = 3 but then increased sharply with q = 4 to reach 160 mS cm-1 at 80 °C. The present work demonstrated that a molecular architecture with poly-QA side chains attached via flexible spacer units affords AEMs that combine efficient phase separation, high alkaline stability and OH- conductivity at moderate water uptake, provided that the side chains are properly designed to avoid Hofmann elimination and counter ion condensation. © 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alkaline fuel cells; Alkalinity; Chains; Chemical stability; Condensation; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Ion exchange membranes; Ions; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phase separation; Polyelectrolytes; Polyphenylene oxides; Positive ions; Thermogravimetric analysis; Anion exchange membrane; Anion exchange membranes (AEM); Electrochemical systems; Environmentally benign; High performance fuel cells; Molecular architecture; Polyelectrolyte effect; Synthesis and characterizations; Ion exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994292966

These stringent conditions may however not always be necessary for specific cases of carbon capture and utilization (CCU). In this manuscript, we investigate how much the parasitic energy of an adsorbent-based carbon capture process may be lowered by utilizing CO2 at 1 bar and adapting the final purity requirement for CO2 from 99% to 70% or 50%. We compare different CO2 sources: the flue gases of coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plants and ambient air. We evaluate the carbon capture performance of over 60 nanoporous materials and determine the influence of the initial and final CO2 purity on the parasitic energy of the carbon capture process. Moreover, we demonstrate the underlying principles of the parasitic energy minimization in more detail using the commercially available NaX zeolite. Finally, the calculated utilization cost of CO2 is compared with the reported prices for CO2 and published costs for CCS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994225747

Our investigation leads to new interpretation/analysis methodologies of sandface and wellbore transient temperature data based on temperature-derivative and straight line methods for estimating near wellbore and far field formation parameters. Slightly compressible, single-phase, and homogeneous infinite-acting reservoir system with skin effect is considered. The analytical solutions accounts for JouleThomson heating/cooling, adiabatic fluid expansion, conduction and convection effects both in the wellbore and reservoir. The development of the analytical and semi-analytical solutions is based on the fact that the effects of temperature changes on wellbore and reservoir pressure transient data can be neglected so that the wellbore mass and momentum and reservoir pressure diffusivity equations and thermal energy balance equations in the wellbore and reservoir can be decoupled. The semi-analytical solution for predicting sandface temperatures is verified by use of a general purpose thermal simulator. Wellbore temperatures at a certain gauge depth are evaluated through analytical steady-state and transient wellbore temperature equations which couple the semi-analytical reservoir temperature model based on the conventional wellbore storage model or the more general model accounting for momentum effects in the wellbore. Results show that drawdown sandface temperatures are totally dominated by advection, whereas buildup sandface temperature data are dominated by conduction. Drawdown and buildup sandface temperature data exhibit two semilog straight lines; one at early-times reflecting the effects of adiabatic fluid expansion in the in the skin zone near the wellbore, whereas the late-time semilog straight line reflecting the Joule-Thomson effects and exhibiting the non-skin zone properties. For temperature measurements made at locations above the producing horizon, the wellbore temperature is strongle dependent upon distance above the producing horizon, geothermal gradient, and radial heat losses from the wellbore fluid to the formation on the way to gauge. Our results indicate that skin-zone properties seems very difficult to estimate from the drawdown and buildup wellbore temperatures unless the gauge location is not far from the producing zone. Buildup wellbore temperature seems mostly dominated by wellbore heat losses as compared to drawdown wellbore temperature data and hence cannot reflect the formation properties.

A hybrid of a solar, a wind and an energy storage device was examined. The integrated model uses statistical indices of solar irradiation and wind speed data to simulate power flow in the system. As the microgrid load demand is variable, power interchange with the bulk power system is managed by a power system supervisor. The control strategy and the load profile of the microgrid must be used to estimate the correct size of the hybrid system storage system.

The optimization goal is to determine the number of threads, thread affinities, and workload partitioning, such that the overall execution time is minimized. For combinatorial optimization we use the Simulated Annealing. We evaluate our approach with a DNA sequence analysis application on a heterogeneous platform that comprises two Intel Xeon E5 processors and an Intel Xeon Phi 7120P co-processor.

The all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) has experienced increasing attention in this context. Its electrolyte membrane is a key component, yet currently perfluorinated materials (e.g., Nafion) are mainly used in VRBs, which have neither been designed for this particular application, nor are they cost-effective. The cross-over of redox active vanadium species impairs cell efficiency, in particular in case of thin Nafion membranes with low ohmic resistance. Here, we present a potentially generic concept of a bifunctional ion-conducting membrane prepared by radiation grafting with sulfonic acid proton exchange sites and amidoxime moieties. The crossover of vanadium-ions is reduced four-fold in the presence of amidoxime groups without markedly impairing the conductivity of the membrane. A VRB cell containing such membrane shows increased energy efficiency and negligible capacity fading over 122 charge / discharge cycles compared to cells with Nafion membrane, which showed a loss of discharge capacity of around 35% after 35 cycles and considerable electrolyte imbalance. ï¿½ The Author(s) 2016.

During this project, with a CAPEX of more than 800 million Euro (excluding cushion gas and transportation commitments), a tight planning schedule was followed. The schedule required full integration of technical, commercial and economic disciplines and had to follow an operational plan to ensure that the project would be realised on time.

The tool is based on nodal analysis and uses the key parameters that would determine the performance of the storage elements. After running multiple realisations an optimum design of the gas storage was selected. During the define, execution and operation stages of the Bergermeer storage, GRIP was also used for further optimisation, forecasting and monitoring of the actual performance.

This work paves the road towards all-printable supercapacitor energy-storage systems with integrated chargers, which enable direct charging from a power outlet. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Field effect transistors; Supercapacitor; Thin film circuits; Thin films; Current supplies; Direct charging; Electric grids; Half-wave rectifiers; Organic thin film transistors; Polymeric semiconductors; Solution-processed; Supercapacitor energy storages; Thin film transistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991735395

Energy planning case studies for decentralized generation of renewable energy are conducted in highways 2 renewable systems energy planning software for hourly energy balances. The results indicate that building integrated photovoltaic and photovoltaic in the case study communities can cover about 17% of the recorded electrical demand of both areas. On a yearly basis, there will be a 0.025 GWh surplus of photovoltaic production with a maximum value of 1.25 MWh in one hour of operation unless grid storage is used. This amounts to a total investment cost of 13.36 million EUR.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with obesity considering most of T2DM patients are overweight and insulin resistant. Overt T2DM occurs when insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cell does not adequately compensate for the peripheral insulin resistance and commonly parallels with dysregulation of pancreatic β- cell function. Insulin resistance is a consequence of impaired insulin transduction pathway caused by several molecules released from expanded adipose tissue that include the (adipo)cytokines and fatty acids. However, not all fatty acids have a negative impact on insulin sensitivity. It has been suggested that palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) has hormone-like properties and improves some metabolic parameters that are impaired in obesity and T2DM. In vitro approaches reveal that cis- 16:1n-7 can influence pancreatic β-cell survival, insulin secretion, and skeletal muscle insulin response and adipocyte metabolism. In vivo experiments using animal models show that the ingestion of cis-16:1n-7 or sources of it (e.g., macadamia oil) can partially prevent the metabolic alterations caused by high-fat/carbohydrate diets. In general, studies in humans found to have positive associations between higher trans-16:1n-7 proportion in plasma phospholipids and improved insulin sensitivity or decreased onset of T2DM. However, plasma cis-16:1n-7 data are still controversial. In this brief review, we discuss the main studies on 16:1n-7 effects on obesity and T2DM and its potential for clinical application. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Diabetes; Glucose homeostasis; Insulin sensitivity; Obesity; Omega-7; Palmitoleic acid","acyl coenzyme A desaturase; cholecystokinin; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; devazepide; epinephrine; glucagon; glucose transporter 1; growth hormone; hydrocortisone; insulin; insulin receptor; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; palmitoleic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; phospholipid; protein kinase C; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; stress activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; cell function; disease association; endoplasmic reticulum stress; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose transport; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulinemia; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; protein expression; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; upregulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991510584

Based on the results of chromatographic studies, changes in the kinetic mechanism and rate of degradation of the crystalline form of cefuroxime axetil in binary systems with excipients were also evaluated. The findings suggest that the mechanism of degradation of cefuroxime axetil in such systems depends on two factors: the applied excipient and storage conditions. Cefuroxime axetil in combination with magnesium stearate, croscarmellose sodium and crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, aerosil is decomposed according to the first-order reaction model in dry air as well as at an increased relative air humidity, which may be associated with non-catalytic interactions between the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the excipients. However, in the presence of mannitol, under elevated humidity conditions (RH ∼ 76%), the degradation of cefuroxime axetil follows the autocatalytic model. According to ESP maps, computed binding energies and HOMO - LUMO gaps, differences of degradation curves between cefuroxime axetil - mannitol and other investigated systems were explained.

To achieve high performance with low-energy budgets, this proposal aims to deliver out-of-order processing by software (SWOOP) on in-order architectures. Problem: A primary cause for slowdown in in-order processors is last-level cache misses (caused by difficult to predict data-dependent loads), resulting in cores stalling. Solution: As loads are non-blocking operations, independent instructions are scheduled to run before the loads return. We execute critical load instructions earlier in the program for a three-fold benefit: increasing memory and instruction level parallelism, and hiding memory latency. Related work: Some instruction scheduling policies attempt to hide memory latency, but scheduling is confined by basic block limits and register pressure. Software pipelining is restricted by dependencies between instructions and decoupled access-execute (DAE) suffers from address re-computation. Unlike EPIC (evolved from VLIW), SWOOP does not require hardware support for predicated execution, speculative loads and their verification, delayed exception handling, memory disambiguation etc. © 2016 Author.","compiler; energy; software out-of-order execution","Budget control; Buffer storage; Embedded systems; Parallel architectures; Program compilers; Scheduling; compiler; energy; Hiding memory latency; Instruction level parallelism; Instruction scheduling; Memory disambiguation; Out-of-order execution; Out-of-order processors; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989327792

Thus, this paper presents a new authentication protocol model that utilizes Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as biometric as well as cryptographic key to ensure that the transmitted data are originated from the required WBAN. Due to the uniqueness and the permanence property of ECG signal, the proposed model is developed to achieve optimal security performance and required lightweight manners of to the resource-limited biomedical sensors. The simulation system is implemented based on the process of an improved fuzzy vault scheme with a new error correction algorithm, which results in reducing computational complexity, communication load and storage overhead when compared to several previous work. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Data authentication; Electrocardiogram (ECG); Key agreement; WBAN",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989323048

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architectures and applications, where main memory bandwidth is a critical bottleneck, can benefit from the use of PIM. To this end, an application should be properly partitioned and scheduled to execute on either the main, powerful GPU cores that are far away from memory or the auxiliary, simple GPU cores that are close to memory (e.g., in the logic layer of 3D-stacked DRAM). This paper investigates two key code scheduling issues in such a GPU architecture that has PIM capabilities, to maximize performance and energy-efficiency: (1) how to automatically identify the code segments, or kernels, to be offloaded to the cores in memory, and (2) how to concurrently schedule multiple kernels on the main GPU cores and the auxiliary GPU cores in memory. We develop two new runtime techniques: (1) a regression-based affinity prediction model and mechanism that accurately identifies which kernels would benefit from PIM and offloads them to GPU cores in memory, and (2) a concurrent kernel management mechanism that uses the affinity prediction model, a new kernel execution time prediction model, and kernel dependency information to decide which kernels to schedule concurrently on main GPU cores and the GPU cores in memory. Our experimental evaluations across 25 GPU applications demonstrate that these two techniques can significantly improve both application performance (by 25% and 42%, respectively, on average) and energy efficiency (by 28% and 27%). © 2016 ACM.","GPU; kernel scheduling; near data computing; processing-in-memory","Computation theory; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Data handling; Data transfer; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Memory architecture; Parallel architectures; Program processors; Scheduling; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Application performance; Dependency informations; Execution time predictions; Experimental evaluation; Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); Management mechanisms; near data computing; Processing in memory; Graphics processing unit",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989315064

Sinterability of the powders precipitated from a water solution was found to be much better than that previously reported for hydrothermally made precursors. The mechanism of the TL process was tracked by means of TL and EPR techniques. It was shown that TL efficacy was greatly dependent upon the processing temperature becoming most potent for pellets sintered at 1700 °C. The most potent TL was obtained for materials containing 2% Eu and sintered in vacuum. The high-temperature treatment appeared to be needed to generate defect states able to participate in energy storage by immobilization of excited carriers. With increasing concentration of the activator ions from 0.1% to 5%, the mechanism of TL in LuPO4:Eu had a continuously more localized character.

Densification is one of the favourable techniques to improve the storage and transportation of biomass fuels in order to prevent dumped areas adjacent to palm mills and to prevent from becoming another waste product. This article reviews comprehensively on how type of palm biomass, compaction pressure and temperature, binder, pre-and post-treatments affect the physical and combustion properties of the palm biomass briquettes produced. Based on the previous researches, generally it can be said that the type of palm biomass, the compaction pressure and temperature, and type of binder affect both the physical and combustion performance of densified palm biomass. However, the effect of particle size could be observed only on the physical characteristics of densified products, whereas the effect on the combustion properties remains unclear. In addition, treatments such as pyrolysis, dry and wet torrefaction (hydrothermal treatment), and steam explosion have potential to be applied during briquette production in order to improve the combustion properties. In this review article, it is also suggested that the combination of densification and followed by wet torrefaction will enhance the combustion properties of palm biomass briquettes. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Although excessive lipid accumulation during in vitro production (IVP) of bovine embryos has been linked with impaired cryotolerance, lipid oxidation is essential for adequate energy supply. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) are supplements used during IVP, containing high and low lipid content, respectively. This study aimed to understand how these supplements influence oocyte mitochondrial and lipid behaviour during in vitro maturation (IVM) in comparison to in vivo maturation, as well as their influence on development rates and embryo lipid accumulation during IVP. We demonstrate that only in vivo-matured oocytes maintained correlation between lipid content and active mitochondria. IVM media containing FBS increased total lipid content 18-fold and resulted in higher lipid accumulation in oocytes when compared with media with BSA. IVM using a lower FBS concentration combined with BSA resulted in satisfactory maturation and embryo development and also reduced lipid accumulation in blastocysts. In conclusion, IVM causes changes in mitochondrial and lipid dynamics, which may have negative effects on oocyte development rates and embryo lipid accumulation. Moreover, decreasing FBS concentrations during IVM may reduce embryo lipid accumulation without affecting production rates. © CSIRO 2016.","in vitro production (IVP); lipid droplet; mitochondria; reproduction","bovine serum albumin; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fat droplet; pirilipin 2; structural protein; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blastocyst; bovine; clinical evaluation; controlled study; embryo; embryo development; female; hormonal therapy; in vitro oocyte maturation; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid storage; mitochondrion; nonhuman; oocyte; oocyte development; oocyte maturation; protein expression; supplementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987923261

In the designed structure of the positive electrode, a three dimensional network of stacked thin film based on paper fibers (PFs), chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and the electro-polymerization of polyaniline (PANI) nanorods was prepared via an extended filtration assisted method. The fabricated PF-RGO-PANI electrodes exhibit large specific capacitance of 587 F g-1 at the current density of 0.8 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability (99.6% retention of initials specific capacitance even after 5000 cycles). PF-RGO film was introduced as the negative electrode for the designed asymmetric supercapacitor. During the preparation process of FAAS, a glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linked PVA-H2SO4 hydrogel was not only used as the electrolyte but also explored as a separator and external packaging material prepared by a fast layer-by-layer assembly technique within one minute. The resulted FAAS exhibits a maximum energy density and power density of 175 W h kg-1 and 9200 W kg-1.

The compression process is the most critical part of these systems and different designs must be developed to improve efficiency such as liquid piston. In this study, a liquid piston is analyzed with CFD tools to look into the effect of piston speed, compression ratio and cylinder geometry on compression efficiency and required work. It is found that, increasing piston speeds do not affect the piston work but efficiency decreases. Piston work remains constant at higher than 0.05 m/s piston speeds but the efficiency decreases from 90.9 % to 74.6 %. Using variable piston speeds has not a significant improvement on the system performance. It is seen that, the effect of compression ratio is increasing with high piston speeds.

During bio-interaction process and the generation of electrons, it produces electrochemical signals which can be measured using an electrochemical detector. A formaldehyde biosensor was successfully developed by depositing an ionic liquid (IL) (e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIM][Otf])), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and chitosan (CHIT), onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The developed formaldehyde biosensor was analyzed for sensitivity, reproducibility, storage stability, and detection limits. Methylene blue was used as a redox indicator for increasing the electron transfer in the electrochemical cell. The developed biosensor measured the NADH electron from the NAD+ reduction at a potential of 0.4 V. Under optimal conditions, the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method detected a wider linear range of formaldehyde concentrations from 0.01 to 10 ppm within 5 s, with a detection limit of 0.1 ppm. The proposed method was successfully detected with the presence of formalin in fish samples, Lutjanus malabaricus and Thunnus Tonggol.

Excellent dielectric properties were observed in the materials, including a CP of up to 104-105 and a low dielectric loss (tanδ) down to 0.03, which are lower than that of the previously reported co-doped TiO2 CP materials when measured at 1 kHz. Stabilities of frequency and temperature were also accomplished via doping Er and Nb. Valence states of the elements in the material were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The charging and discharging signal of the batteries is represented in time-frequency representation (TFR) and then, from the TFR, parameters of the battery such as instantaneous of means square voltage (Vrms), instantaneous of direct current voltage (Vdc) and instantaneous of alternating current voltage (Vac) are estimated. The experiments are conducted with three different Ni-MH battery with fixed nominal voltage of 12V and storage capacities of 1.3Ah, 1.8Ah and 2.7Ah respectively. The results are compared with the battery model implemented in MATLAB Simulink. The results show that there are similarities between the battery model and experimental data.

In order to make full use of the flexibility and controllability of energy storage to improve the schedulability of wind farms, this paper presents a rolling and dispatching control strategy with a battery energy storage system (BESS) based on model predictive control (MPC). The proposed control scheme firstly plans expected output, i.e., dispatching order, of a wind/battery energy storage hybrid system based on the predicted output of the wind farm, then calculates the order in the predictive horizon with the receding horizon optimization and the limitations of energy storage such as state of charge and depth of charge/discharge to maintain the combination of active output of the wind farm and the BESS to track dispatching order at the extreme. The paper shows and analyses the effectiveness of the proposed strategy with different sizes of capacity of the BESS based on the actual output of a certain actual wind farm in the northeast of China. The results show that the proposed strategy that controls the BESS could improve the schedulability of the wind farm and maintain smooth output of wind/battery energy storage hybrid system while tracking the dispatching orders.

WSN-based industrial applications often cost much less than wired networks in both the short and long terms; automation engineers are empowering existing solutions with the new capabilities of WSNs. On the other hand, since industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) consist of thousands of nodes, the problem of powering the nodes is critical. Power to the nodes is usually provided through primary batteries and this necessitates replacement when the batteries are depleted. However, the replacement may not be cost-effective or even feasible in most industrial applications.Though advancements in integrated circuit technologies help in saving more energy by leading to lower energy consumption levels, they do not eliminate the use of battery power. In this regard, energy harvesting technologies play a key role in extending the battery lifetime of the nodes. Wireless sensor nodes within industrial plants can operate from energy harvested from available energy sources such as heat, mechanical motion or vibration, indoor lighting, electromagnetic fields, and air flow.

The energy management strategy FC/UC/BT hybrid system model has been developed and the control strategy was programmed in the LabVIEW™ environment and implemented using National Instrument (NI) devices. The energy management strategy is able to manage the energy flow between the main power source (FCs) and auxiliary sources (UC and BT). To control the hybrid system and achieved proper performance, a controller circuit was developed with the three energy sources aligned in parallel to deliver the requested power. The developed model demonstrates the proportion power from the FC, UC and BT under various load demand. Experimental results demonstrate that FC/UC/BT hybrid system operated automatically with the varying load condition.

The case study consists of five heat waves occurring in Porto (Portugal) urban area in a future climate scenario. Meteorological forcing and boundary data were downscaled for Porto urban area from the CMIP5 earth system model MPI-ESM, for the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 scenario. The influence of different resilience measures on the energy balance components was quantified and compared between each other. Results show that the inclusion of green urban areas increases the evaporation and the availability of surface moisture, redirecting the energy to the form of latent heat flux (maximum increase of + 200 W m− 2) rather than to sensible heat. The application of white roofs increases the solar radiation reflection, due to the higher albedo of such surfaces, reducing both sensible and storage heat flux (maximum reductions of − 62.8 and − 35 W m− 2, respectively). The conjugations of the individual benefits related to each resilience measure shows that this measure is the most effective one in terms of improving the thermal comfort of the urban population, particularly due to the reduction of both sensible and storage heat flux.

Captured CO2 is injected into saline aquifers to store pressure, generate artesian flow of brine, and provide a supplemental working fluid for efficient heat extraction and power conversion. Concentric rings of injection and production wells create a hydraulic mound to store pressure, CO2, and thermal energy. This energy storage can take excess power from the grid and excess and/or waste thermal energy and dispatch that energy when it is demanded, and thus enable higher penetration of variable renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind and solar). CO2 stored in the subsurface functions as a cushion gas to provide enormous pressure storage capacity and displace large quantities of brine, some of which can be treated for a variety of beneficial uses. Geothermal power and energy-storage applications may generate enough revenues to compensate for CO2 capture costs. While our approach can use nitrogen (N2), in addition to CO2, as a supplemental fluid, and store thermal energy, this study focuses on using CO2 for geothermal energy production and grid-scale energy storage. We conduct a techno-economic assessment to determine the levelized cost of electricity using this approach to generate geothermal power. We present a reservoir pressure management strategy that diverts a small portion of the produced brine for beneficial consumptive use to reduce the pumping cost of fluid recirculation, while reducing the risk of seismicity, caprock fracture, and CO2 leakage. © 2016 The Authors.",,"Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Geothermal energy; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Renewable energy resources; Reservoir management; Thermal energy; Concentric rings; Energy storage applications; Levelized cost of electricities; Production wells; Reservoir pressures; Sedimentary basin; Techno-economic assessment; Variable renewable energies; Electric load dispatching; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; geothermal energy; geothermal power; sedimentary basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980357026

However, with the development of new energy sources, storage and transmission technologies together with the heterogeneous architecture of the grid network, several new features have been incorporated into the smart grid. These features make the energy trading more complex and pose a significant challenge on designing efficient trading schemes. Based on this motivation, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of several typical economic incentive approaches adopted in the energy-trading control mechanisms.

In the present work we have attached quaternary piperidinium (QPi) cations to poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)s (PPOs) via flexible alkyl spacer chains with the aim to prepare AEMs. The bromine atoms of bromoalkylated PPOs were displaced in Menshutkin reactions to attach one or two QPi groups, respectively, via heptyl spacers. The cationic polymers have excellent solubility in, e.g., methanol, dimethylsulfoxide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at room temperature, and form tough and transparent membranes. AEMs with bis-QPi side chains efficiently form ionic clusters and reach very high hydroxide ion conductivities, up to 69 and 186 mS cm-1 at 20 and 80 °C, respectively. The AEMs further have excellent alkaline stability, and 1H NMR analysis showed no degradation of the AEMs after storage in 1 M NaOH at 90 °C during 8 days. Thermogravimetry indicated decomposition only above 225 °C. The AEM properties were further tuned by controlled formation of bis-QPi crosslinks through an efficient reaction between bromoalkylated PPO and 4,4′-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine) during a reactive membrane casting process. In conclusion, alkali-stable and highly conductive AEMs can be prepared by placing cycloaliphatic quaternary ammonium cations on flexible side chains and crosslinks. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chains; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Ionic liquids; Ions; Polyphenylene oxides; Positive ions; Thermogravimetric analysis; Anion exchange membrane; Cationic polymers; Excellent solubility; Hydroxide ions; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; Poly(2 , 6dimethyl-1 , 4-phenylene oxide); Quaternary ammonium; Reactive membranes; Alkaline fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979753591

The new core design promises novel applications for lightweight multifunctional structures due to increased flow in the inner spaces of the core construction, embedding of electrical lines, enhanced heat transfer, fuel storage and higher energy absorption compared to traditional cores. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber sandwich; Interlocking; Multifunctional; Three dimensional grid","Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Fuel storage; Heat transfer; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composite sandwich panels; Energy absorption capacity; Interlocking; Multi-functional structures; Multifunctional; Out-of-plane compression; Three-dimensional grids; Honeycomb structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979600050

Nevertheless, the oxygen release at high potentials in the present commercialized electrode materials (e.g. LiCoO2) leads to high thermal instability of these oxides and thus to many safety problems. This safety problem is more pronounced for stationary applications for which large size batteries were needed. Polyanionic materials in general, and particularly phosphates were well renowned by their high structural stability which are essential to overcome the above mentioned safety issue. Here, we present the structural and the electrochemical performances of three oxyphosphates M0.5TiOPO4 (M: Ni, Co, Fe). More than 300 mAh/g discharge capacity could be delivered by these phosphates under relatively high cycling rate. The lithium insertion/extraction mechanism is composed from an intercalation process for low lithium content to a conversion mechanism for higher lithium concentration leading to the extrusion of the transition metal M from the structure. © 2016 The Authors.","Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Phosphates","Anodes; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric tools; Electrodes; Energy storage; Engineering research; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Metal extrusion; Phosphates; Plug-in electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Transition metals; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; High energy densities; Intercalation process; Polyanionic materials; Stationary applications; Structural stabilities; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979599459

The development of many key sustainable energy technologies relies on fast oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. However, both reactions are sluggish. In the present work, we address these two issues synergistically by fabricating Fe2O3 wrapped in P and S dual-doped graphitized carbon (Fe2O3/P-S-CG) from soiled baby diapers, whose disposal and recycling are beneficial to the environment. Electrochemical tests revealed that Fe2O3/P-S-GC has a significant catalytic activity towards both the ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH. In particular, the difference between the ORR potential at 3 mA cm-2 and the OER potential at 10 mA cm-2 is as small as ∼0.86 V. This value is comparable to that of commercial precious metal-based catalysts.

As the trunk of a living tree can be divided into isothermal subvolumes, which are generally referred to as annual rings, and the trunk is a good heat storage material, depending on the tree dimensions and its species, it can potentially offer different temperature gradients according to the tree trunk depths. The hypothesis is to consider the application of this temperature gradient on the faces of a Peltier cell to obtain electrical energy. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, a wireless sensor network was developed for measuring internal temperature of trunks from different trees. The experimental results show that it is possible to obtain a sufficient temperature gradient to harvest energy from tree trunks. Additionally, it is also shown that it is possible to harvest thermal energy during the day and during the night while photovoltaic cell only works under sunlight. © 2016 Cleonilson P.

The current trend of development concerns transportation systems used in agricultural production, storage systems, systems for dosing feed and manufactured products as well as the majority of modern machinery and equipment used for production and cultivation of plants and breeding of animals or gardening, above all. This allows today's fanner (entrepreneur) to improve a series of daily activities with lesser involvement in direct physical labor, thus adding additional reserves of time and energy for increasing the scale and scope of other activities and enabling better management of capital, among other things. This article presents a novel rope-free mechatronic multi-car elevator system for vertical and horizontal transport and simultaneous integration of movement in two directions, which is used in Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). The elevator drive is based on a mechatronic planar positioning system with an aerostatic bearing. An original solution of a mechatronic rope-free elevator can be used for transportation of animals, agricultural produce (vegetables, fruit, corn, seeds, etc.), also suitable for transportation of hay, straw, and similar materials and products that are used for animal husbandry and agriculture. The structure and the principle of operation of the rope-free elevator are presented.

Hydropower plants are operated to meet most of the energy demand, while the complementary system is dispatched to make up the shortage in supply. During 13 years from 2000 to 2012 on average 91% of Brazilian effective electric generation was provided by hydropower. However, in the last three years this percentage was reduced, in sequence, to 79, 73, and 71%. Intense and expensive thermal dispatch was necessary, while hydropower production was reduced and reservoir storages were drawn down. In the last three years, several major watersheds in Brazil have experienced a very severe drought. At the same time, the energy problem was exacerbated by demand increase and delayed expansion of the power system. To analyze the impacts of drought on the hydropower system, we propose to focus not only on the inflows but also on energy. Three variables were compared: historical reservoir inflows from 1930 to 2015, corresponding energy inflows, and optimal hydropower production. A nonlinear programming model, called HIDROTERM, previously developed for the hydrothermal system, was used to evaluate the optimal hydropower production under the historical inflows.

Considering the surface OH groups/graphene layer system by means of density functional theory calculations, we evidenced the tendency of OH groups to cluster, resulting in enhanced system stability and no band gap opening. In the oxygen concentration range between 1.8 and 8.47 at%, with the addition of each new OH group, integral binding energy decreases, while differential binding energy shows the boost at even numbers of OH groups. Furthermore, we found that the clustering of OH groups over graphene basal plane plays a crucial role in enhancing the interactions with alkali metals. Namely, if alkali metal atoms interact with individual OH groups only, the interaction leads to an irreversible formation of MOH phase. When alkali atoms interact with clusters containing odd number of OH groups, a reversible transfer of an electron charge from the metal atom to the substrate takes place without OH removal. The strength of the interaction in general increases from Li to K. In an experimental investigation of a graphene sample which dominantly contains OH groups, we have shown that the trend in the specific interaction strength reflects to gravimetric capacitances measured in alkali metal chloride solutions. We propose that the charge stored in OH groups which interact with alkali metal cation and the π electronic system of the graphene basal plane presents the main part of its pseudocapacitance. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Binding energy; Bins; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Metal ions; Metals; Optical glass; Reduction; System stability; Alkali metal cations; Alkali metal chlorides; Differential binding; Experimental investigations; Functionalized graphene; Gravimetric capacitance; Oxygen concentrations; Specific interaction; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976400567

Here, we report on flexible dielectric papers based on biodegradable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for dielectric energy storage. Highly ordered, homogeneous CNF/CNT papers have been fabricated using a facile vacuum-assisted self-assembly technique. The obtained paper possesses a high dielectric constant of 3198 at 1.0 kHz, thus leading to enhanced dielectric energy storage capability (0.81 ± 0.1 J cm-3), which is attributed to the presence of a low loading of CNTs (4.5 wt%).

Combining this system with night time generation of TBAB hydrate slurry can significantly reduce the investment cost of systems for cooling purposes. TBAB hydrate slurry generation requires temperature around 12 °C, operates at atmospheric pressure and, from an energetic point of view, application of this slurry can contribute to significant energy savings. In this paper, a numerical model of a LHTS system is coupled with a hydrate crystal growth model, which has been validated with experimental data collected with a coil heat exchanger for TBAB hydrate generation. The model has been used for the estimation of the production of TBAB hydrate slurry in an air-conditioning system. Results indicate that with a certain volume of the LHTS system, it is possible to fulfil the considered 3 kW peak cooling demand for a specified office building without extra external energy input during the day. The presented work provides guidelines for the thermal performance and design optimization of a TBAB hydrate slurry based LHTS system for an air-conditioning system.","Cold storage; Growth model; TBAB hydrate slurry","Air conditioning; Atmospheric pressure; Cold storage; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Economics; Energy conservation; Heat convection; Heat storage; Hydrates; Hydration; IIR filters; Investments; Latent heat; Office buildings; Refrigeration; Slurries; Storage (materials); Crystal growth model; Design optimization; External energy; Growth modeling; Hydrate slurry; Investment costs; Latent heat thermal storage; Thermal Performance; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975889807

Since fossil resources are finite and their consumption leads to greenhouse gases to increase in the atmosphere. Global warming is a consequence of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere much more than limits. To deal with such matters governments and industries must take responsibility to develop and start using the renewable energy sources. Solar energy is the most substantial energy source in the world. One hour of the solar energy reaching the earth surface can compansate all energy need of the world for one year. In this study, it was considered that the solar energy can be stored as potential energy of compressed air. This can be simply accomplished by a heat engine. Here, air enclosed in a solar collector heats up and so does it gain pressure. Then the air pressure drives a double actuated piston cylinder mechanism. The moving piston compresses the embient air to a storage tank on the other side of the mechanism. By this way, the compressed air is always ready for use in necessary applications. Solar heat machine works according to Carnot Heat Machine Mechanism. The theromodynamic cycle is open to atmosphere; therefore, the air heated by solar energy is replaced with fresh air at the end of each cycle. The exhausted hot air can also be used for heating water or building. Here, a theoretical approach has been developed for the solar heat meachine cycle. In this approach, the thermal efficiency and solar conversion efficiency were defined with analytical relations obtained. © 2016, Gazi University Eti Mahallesi.

Pomegranates were harvested at the commercial harvest stage and packed in two different commercial types of MAP (MAP1, sealed in packages made of XtendR film; MAP2, sealed in bags made of ZOEPAC). Unpacked fruits stored in plastic boxes were used as the control. Following packaging treatments, all packed and unpacked fruit samples were stored at 6 ± 0.5 °C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity for 120 days, and they were removed from storage at 40-day intervals for different quality analyses. Furthermore, after each storage period, fruits were removed and kept at 20 °C for 3 days to simulate a period of shelf-life. During storage, O2 levels decreased and CO2 levels increased inside both packages, and a steady-state atmosphere (17.60–11.95 kPa O2 and 4.40–5.00 kPa CO2) was obtained at day 40 in cold storage. The MAPs significantly reduced weight loss and external physiological disorders, maintained visual quality, and prevented the decline of skin color, L* (lightness), C* (chroma), and hº (hue angle) compared to control fruit. MAP2 was the most effective packaging in reducing weight loss both in cold storage and shelf-life conditions. Titratable acidity and total soluble solids decreased during storage and shelf-life, and no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were observed between MAP1 and MAP2. Total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents and antioxidant activity increased slightly until the first 40 days of storage and then decreased during the rest of the storage, although ascorbic acid contents were gradually decreased. Ascorbic acid content was found to be the highest in the control fruit by the end of storage. Contents of organic acids were decreased in all treatments during storage, except for tartaric acid.

Studies on the combined actions of these 2 detrimental factors on the bone in females are limited. Objective: We sought to determine the interactive actions of estrogen deficiency and an HFS diet on bone properties and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Six-month-old Sprague Dawley sham or ovariectomized (OVX) rats were pair fed the same amount of either a low-saturated-fat, low-sucrose (LFS) diet (13% fat calories; 15% sucrose calories) or an HFS diet (42% fat calories; 30% sucrose calories) for 12 wk. Blood, liver, and bone were collected for correspondent parameters measurement. Results: Ovariectomy decreased bone mineral density in the tibia head (TH) by 62% and the femoral end (FE) by 49% (P &lt; 0.0001). The HFS diet aggravated bone loss in OVX rats by an additional 41% in the TH and 37% in the FE (P &lt; 0.05). Bone loss in the HFS-OVX rats was accompanied by increased urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations by 28% (P &lt; 0.05). The HFS diet induced cathepsin K by 145% but reduced osteoprotegerin mRNA expression at the FE of the HFS-sham rats by 71% (P &lt; 0.05). Ovariectomy significantly increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g mRNA expression by 136% and 170% at the FE of the LFS- and HFS-OVX rats, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The HFS diet aggravated ovariectomyinduced lipid deposition and oxidative stress (OS) in rat livers (P &lt; 0.05). Trabecular bone mineral density at the FE was negatively correlated with rat liver malondialdehyde concentrations (R2 = 0.39; P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The detrimental actions of the HFS diet and ovariectomy on bone properties in rats occurredmainly in cancellous bones and were characterized by a high degree of bone resorption and alterations in OS.

The storage medium is composed of an array of parallel flat plates submitted to an air stream. The optimization is based on an exhaustive search method. It is observed that the minimum heat storage mass is proportional to the mass airflow rate. An optimal relationship between the superficial heat transfer rate and the fluid flow inertia, given by the dimensionless parameter NTU, is found to be constant (4.03) and independent in respect to the mass flow rate.

Many people are exposed to vibration (WBV) in their occupational lives. The biodynamic responses of the human body in sitting conditions have been widely measured under whole-body vibration (WBV). The measures are most often expressed in terms of force-motion relations at the driving-point, namely, mechanical impedance, apparent mass and absorbed power, and flow of vibration through the body, such as seat-to-head and body segments vibration transmissibility. The absorbed power is a measure of the energy absorbed by the subject due to the external forces applied to the system. Materials and methods. The body behaves like a vibrating physical system with distributed energy-storage elements (masses, springs) and energy-dissipation elements (dampers). The total quantity of power can be divided into 2 components – one real and one imaginary. The real component reflects the energy-absorbing part of the system, due to the transformation of friction into heat within the tissues. The imaginary component reflects the energy-storing part of the system which does not consume any vibration energy. Results. The seated human is modeled as a series 4-DOF dynamic models. After introduction of the excitation, the response in particular segments of the model can be analyzed. As an example, the vibration power dissipated in an operator’s body segments has been determined as a function of the agricultural combination operating speed 1.4 – 2.75 ms-1. Conclusions. The concept of absorbed power as a measurement for evaluation of WBV exposure opens a new area for research. The important character of absorbed power is that it has physical significance and therefore can be measured as well as computed analytically. The absorbed power relates to dissipation of energy attributed to relative motions of the visco-elastic tissues, muscles and skeletal system, which under prolonged exposures could lead to physical damage in the musculoskeletal system. A structural model of the human operator allows determination of the dynamic characteristics of the model, and study of the energy flow between the elements of the model. © 2016, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

Crude grain coffee (Coffea canephora) with average initial moisture content of 12.61% (d.b.) was used. Grain was roasted at two levels: medium light (ML) and moderately dark (MD). Afterwards, grain was processed in three different particle sizes: fine (0.59 mm), medium (0.84 mm) and coarse (1.19 mm), besides the whole coffee lot. Samples prepared were then stored in two temperatures (10 and 30 ºC). These were analyzed during six months, at five distinct times (0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 days) regarding moisture content and water activity. Furthermore, mathematical modeling and thermodynamic properties acquisition of the coffee moisture adsorption process were accomplished.

The optimal system for the use of biogas from agricultural residues (manure and crop residues) in HCSP involves anaerobic digestion with upgrading of biogas to biomethane and injection into the gas grid for transport and storage. Using biogas from agricultural residues results in efficient reduction of non-renewable energy use and especially GHG emission, due to the avoidance of methane emission from manure storage. The net biomethane production from agricultural residues in EU-27 can potentially reach approximately 29,000 Mm3, sufficient to supply 320 CSP plants with a capacity of 100 MWe with HYSOL technology, producing 55% of the electricity from gas.

This solar energy can be utilized for air-conditioning by using solar-powered adsorption refrigeration cycle. Intermittent nature of the solar radiation leads to a challenge for continuous air-conditioning operation. In the present study, a combination of solar-powered adsorption refrigeration system and thermal storage is studied. Activated carbon-ammonia and activated carbon-methanol are the working pairs of the adsorption reaction. Analytical calculation results show that activated carbon-methanol pair indicates higher coefficient of performance (COP) than activated carbon-ammonia pair, while adsorption chiller system with hot water thermal storage has higher COP than the system with ice thermal storage. For the activated carbon-methanol case with hot water thermal storage, the COP is 0.79. Since this COP analysis is based on the ideal case with uniform temperature distribution within the reactor beds, which achieves equilibrium states at the end of the reactions. In more realistic situation, the reaction process will be terminated before reaching to the equilibrium states because of the non-uniform temperature distribution and the time required for the reaction. Transient simulation in which heat transfer and reaction equation are combined will be performed to model actual reactors. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Integration of a solar thermal power generation systems into Microgrids open a new horizon of renewable energy power generation to achieve the supply and demand balance of electricity. Microgrid dispatch strategy is a control method of energy balance between power generation and electricity consumption. A thermal storage integrated into the system buffers the intermittency of solar radiation used as the heat source of the power generation system. The daily starting time for the power generation is determined by the dispatch strategy in search of minimum power from the conventional grid and maximum electricity generation from the solar thermal power generation system. In the simulation stage, the heat energy available for power generation and amount of thermal energy saved in the thermal storage is calculated at each time step using measured solar radiation data as the heat source and load profile data as the consumption required. Based on the simulation result, the power generation starting time for the next day is determined. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatch strategy is demonstrated by obtaining the best starting time and identifying minimum power requiredfrom the conventional grid. The power supply from the conventional grid is reduced by 10% by applying the proposed methodology. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

We discuss some of his recent and innovative work regarding a new probability model that represents Intermittent Energy Sources for Computing and Communications, introducing Energy Packet Networks which are a probabilistic representation of the flow, storage and consumption of electrical energy at the microscopic level (in electronic chips), and at the macroscopic level (e.g. in buildings or data centers) and for its routing and dynamic usage by consuming units (such as computer elements, chips or machines). We next discuss his work on designing computer and communication systems that parsimoniously use energy in order to achieve a satisfactory level of quality of service (QoS). Trade-offs between system QoS and energy consumption are also considered. Then we turn to Prof. Gelenbe's pioneering work on Autonomic Communications and the design and implementation of CPN, the Cognitive Packet Network, and we also briefly review his spiking random neural network that was used in CPN. This is followed by a brief review of work that he conducted since 1999 on human evacuation from dangerous or catastrophic environments, and the design of technology driven Emergency Management Systems.

The PEG layer will serve as a robust interface layer to suppress the mobilization of charge carriers and protect Cu from oxidation. The BT-Cu particles were loaded as fillers in the matrix of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to fabricate the BT-Cu/PVDF composites. Microstructure and dielectric performance have been investigated. The results showed that the relative permittivity (ϵr) of the composites increased prominently with the loading amount and meanwhile the dielectric loss tangent was suppressed at a low level. For instance, the permittivity of BT-Cu/PVDF with the volume fraction of 53.7% reached 150 with a low loss of 0.16 at 1 kHz. The permittivities maintained high values of over 55 and the dielectric loss was less than 0.05 upto 1 GHz.

Low overpotential, high specific capacity (over 10200 mA h g-1), enhanced rate capability (∼7500 mA h g-1 at 0.6 mA cm-2) and excellent cyclability (up to 125 cycles) can be achieved by using B-OLC based electrodes in Na-O2 batteries.

Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that present high solar thermal-energy storage capacity, high latent heat of transition, high energy densities and low cost. PCMs can be formulated from a wide variety of materials including natural and synthetic polymers. These materials can be encapsulated with a series of purposes, such as increasing the rate of heat transfer and increasing thermal and mechanical stability. Although PCMs can be encapsulated at macro, micro, and nanoscales, only macro and micro capsules have been commercialized by different industries, whereas the nanoencapsulation is still limited to the laboratory level. The interest related to the encapsulation of PCMs on a nanoscale involves their better structural stability when compared to the macro and microcapsules. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This necessitates the consideration of new modeling and analysis approaches, which can serve as natural starting points for robust and scalable control and design strategies. In this 'vision' paper we will highlight two topics within the broad area of power networks: the modeling and analysis of the synchronous generator, and the modeling and analysis of power networks using the swing equation as an approximate model for the generator. In both cases we will discuss a port-Hamiltonian formulation, which reflects the underlying physics of power flow and energy storage. Although the port-Hamiltonian model of the synchronous generator reveals a clear structure it still poses fundamental challenges for its non-zero steady state stability analysis. It is shown how the swing equation can be directly deduced from the power balance of the port-Hamiltonian model of the synchronous generator. Under the phasor assumption, this leads to a port-Hamiltonian model of power networks of generators, which enables a straightforward stability analysis and provides a starting point for control. © 2016 International Federation of Automatic Control.

This paper discusses the current state of knowledge on the biofortification and nutritional value of food products from spring durum wheat grain, achieved by an agrotechnical method named ‘from field to table’ production. Biofortification refers to the production of safe food fortified with micronutrients and to the introduction of microorganisms that increase the bioretention of nutrients by plants, thus creating a new quality of food products as well as contributing to the protection of soil, perceived as a crucial resource in agricultural production. It is based on our knowledge of the physiology of yielding in conjunction with an increased productivity and higher value, essential in the context of health disorders due to dietary deficiencies. The choice of a durum wheat cultivation method depends on the crop’s habitat requirements, climate, proper selection of a previous crop, nutritional requirements, plant protection and storage. The conventional cultivation system diversifies the content of components, increasing Mn and Cu while decreasing P, K, Ca and Zn concentrations. Cultivation of this species on soil classified as very good wheat complex or good wheat ensures the highest yields characterised by high grain quality. This wheat is tolerant to water stress, although irrigation of spring durum wheat has been shown to improve nitrogen agronomic efficiency and to increase the yield of protein and energy. The recommended amount of nitrogen in plant fertilization is between 80-160 kg ha-1. Durum wheat flour has a higher content of yellow pigments and better qualitative composition of gluten proteins, while its kernels have lighter and thinner hulls. Durum wheat flour absorbs less water during bread baking. Owing to this attribute, pasta from durum wheat is more adhesive to sauces, has compact texture and is more difficult to overcook. © 2016, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Wearability (e.g. weight, bulkiness) and power are the two main competing characteristics of most assistive wearable devices. Energy efficient actuation systems with high power density per mass and volume are thus preferred. The biological muscle-tendon solution is very interesting for energy storage and generation of efficient cyclic patterns. The present study investigates on the capacity to replicate these biological properties using series elastic actuator (SEA) based on pneumatic cylinder technology. While classic SEA designs are composed of electric actuator in series with steel springs, pneumatic actuators are intrinsically compliant due to the compressibility of the fluid. The study starts by presenting an experimental approach for characterizing the elastic behavior of a pneumatic cylinder actuation targeting the assistance of the hip flexion. Results are then confronted to measurements of lower limb joints’ stiffness observed during walking to identify the suitability of the solution with the targeted application. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Pneumatic cylinder; Series elastic actuator; Walking assistive orthosis; Wearable assistive robotics","Actuators; Cylinders (shapes); Energy efficiency; Machine design; Pneumatic drives; Pneumatic equipment; Pneumatics; Robotics; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Assistive robotics; Biological properties; Energy-efficient actuations; Experimental approaches; Orthosis; Pneumatic Cylinders; Series elastic actuations; Series elastic actuators; Pneumatic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964826080

Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes intercalated reduced graphene oxides (rGO) were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. It has been found that the Co3O4 particles with a cubical shape are decorated on rGO matrix with an average size of ∼45 nm. The structural crystallinity of rGO-Co3O4 composites was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Raman spectroscopy confirmed the successful reduction of GO to rGO and effective interaction between Co3O4 and the rGO matrix. The electrochemical performances of rGO-Co3O4 electrodes were examined using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge techniques. The maximum specific capacitance (278 F g-1) is observed at current density of 200 mA g-1 in the C2 electrode resulting from effective ion transfer and less particle aggregation of Co3O4 on the rGO matrix than in the other electrodes. C2 exhibits good rate capability and excellent long-term cyclic stability of 91.6% for 2000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance may result from uniform intercalation of cobalt oxide over the rGO. These results suggest that the Co3O4 intercalated rGO matrix could play a role in improved energy storage capability. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Agglomeration; Capacitors; Cobalt; Cobalt deposits; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Graphene; X ray diffraction; Effective interactions; Electrochemical performance; Hydrothermal methods; Particle aggregation; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor application; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964622069

It is found that the MgH2/AlH3 (2:1) composite system showed improved dehydrogenation performance compared with that of as-milled MgH2 alone. The dehydrogenation process in the MgH2/AlH3 composite can be divided into two stages. During the first dehydrogenation process, AlH3 decomposed first to produce Al with hydrogen release. In the second dehydrogenation stage, the as-formed Al phase reacts with MgH2 to form Mg17Al12 phase at a temperature of about 250 °C, which is about 80 °C lower than the decomposition temperature of as-milled MgH2. The second step decomposition enthalpy of the system was determined by differential scanning calorimetry measurements and the enthalpies change to be 45.0 kJ mol-1 H2, which is smaller than that of MgH2 alone (75.7 kJ mol-1 H2). Kissinger analysis indicated that the apparent activation energy, EA, for the MgH2-relevent decomposition in MgH2-AlH3 composite was 94.0 kJ mol-1, which is 68.0 kJ mol-1 less than for as-milled MgH2 (162.0 kJ mol-1). Rehydrogenation processes show that Mg17Al12 is fully reversible. It is believed that the formation of the Al12Mg17 phase during the dehydrogenation process alters the reaction pathway of the MgH2-AlH3 (2:1) composite system and improves its thermodynamic properties accordingly. © 2016 The Authors.","Aluminium hydride; Destabilized system; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963499953

Thus, this study develops a reservoir optimization rule to generate a corresponding gain in energy production. It is well known that operating a reservoir is a complex problem that depends on many parameters such as inflow, storage capacity, water elevation, tailwater elevation, and evaporation. Therefore, in order to optimize energy production, there is a need to use heuristic algorithms such as the Cuckoo Search (CS). This study develops a CS algorithm-based solution to optimize the reservoir's operational system and generate an optimal operation rule curve. Results show that the CS algorithm improves the system operation, and the energy production will be increased by about 10% to a value of 160000 MWh with a corresponding economic gain of about $12 × 106 in total for 183 months. © 2016 Mutlu Yasar.",,"Algorithms; Curve fitting; Heuristic algorithms; Reservoirs (water); Complex problems; Cuckoo search algorithms; Energy productions; Operational systems; Optimal operation; Reservoir operating rules; Reservoir operation; Reservoir optimizations; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962091367

Construction of the generator is adjusted to the type of the source of mechanical energy. In order to obtain electrical energy from mechanical vibrations, the most frequent solution is beam structure. Effective electric energy generation by the piezoelectric generators depends on the following main factors: piezoelectric material used, generator structure, electronic system of the control and storage of energy, and the generator size. Generated by piezoelectric generators electric energy, can be used to power of miniaturized electronic devices with low power supply demand.

Oxidative stability means resistance to oxidation during purchase, processing and storage and is a key quality indicator of edible fats. Oils ought to be stored in dark-glass bottles, at low temperatures and with no access of light in order to effectively preserve their oxidative stability. Since all vegetable oils contain unsaturated fatty acids that can react with oxygen and deteriorate over time, displacement of oxygen with inert gases may result in a reduction of the rate of oxidation. In the study the effect of oil flushing with nitrogen on the quality and oxidative stability of cold-pressed rapeseed and sunflower oils was determinate. Material and methods. Commercial samples of cold-pressed rapeseed and sunflower oils were stabilized by generating anaerobic atmosphere in the bottles by blowing through with nitrogen and generation of a ""nitrogen cushion"". Oils were tested in accelerated at 63°C and long-term at 20°C storage tests. Results. After 20 days of Schaal oven test, the peroxide value in the flushing with nitrogen rapeseed and sunflower oils was, respectively, 4 and 7 times lower than in the control samples (without nitrogen). In turn, of the long-term storage test (with access of light 20°C), the peroxide value of oil flushing with nitrogen after 6 months of storage was 2.3 to 2.8-fold lower, respectively, than in the control sample. In the oil samples flushed with nitrogen peroxide formation was inhibited, however, as a result of the breakdown of the peroxides already existed in the oil, gradual decrease of the oxidative stability (determined via Rancimat test) was observed along with prolonged storage of oils. Conclusions. Oil flushing with nitrogen was a very effective way to reduce the changes caused by oxidation in cold-pressed rapeseed and sunflower oil. © Copyright by Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu.","Cold-pressing; Flushing; Nitrogen; Oxidative stability; Rapeseed oil; Storage; Sunflower oil","Energy storage; Fatty acids; Glass bottles; Nitrogen; Oils and fats; Oilseeds; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Peroxides; Stability; Storage (materials); Unsaturated fatty acids; Vegetable oils; Anaerobic atmosphere; Cold pressing; Flushing; Key quality indicators; Oxidative stability; Peroxide formations; Rapeseed oil; Rate of oxidations; Sunflower oil; canola oil; edible oil; lipid peroxide; nitrogen; sunflower oil; vegetable oil; chemistry; cluster analysis; food handling; food packaging; food preservation; food quality; food storage; heat; multivariate analysis; oxidation reduction reaction; Poland; principal component analysis; Cluster Analysis; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Food Handling; Food Packaging; Food Preservation; Food Quality; Food Storage; Hot Temperature; Lipid Peroxides; Multivariate Analysis; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Plant Oils; Poland; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960397425

One of these sources, the result of the industrial revolution and of great importance to the development of humanity, is petroleum, a substance composed primarily of hydrocarbons, which give rise to several other products such as fuels, lubricants, polymers, solvents, cooking gas, asphalt, fertilizers, and paints, among others. However, the incorrect storage and transport of this product can cause leaks and spills that generate huge damages to the environment and the economy. In environmental accidents involving oil spills in an aqueous medium, the difficulty of removing the oil has been one of the major challenges for the environment. Some of the materials used for this function are the synthetic non-biodegradable textile fibres, resulting in another environmental residue. The present research has been developed by a multidisciplinary team; Calotropis procera, a new fibre has been studied to be used in the sorption of oil spills, and an intensive research has been carried out to explore the possible potential of Calotropis procera fibres as bioadsorbents of petroleum in water. The choice of these fibers is due to their surface properties such as oleophylic and hydrophobic surface, their buoyancy and yet, being biodegradable natural polymers derived from the Brazilian Northeast region. An experimental planning was done and response surface methodology (RSM) was used by Design Expert software. The results were statistically efficient, obtaining a R2 = 0.9995. The fibers showed high adsorption efficiency, removing more than 90 % petroleum in water in both static and dynamic state. © RILEM 2016.","Bioadsorbents; Calotropis procera; Crude oil; Oleophylic; Textile fibres",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958950146

Annually, between1 and 1.5% new buildings are built and only between 0.2 and 0.5% are removed, therefore the focus needs to be put on the renovation of the existing building stock. The implementation of energy conservation measures (ECMs) in the residential sector becomes a very important strategy to meet the EU´s 20% energy consumption reduction of the 20-20-20 goals. The main challenge, however, is to determine which of the ECMs strategies are the best to provide not just with the best energy consumption reduction, but also with the best environmental impact and economic benefits. This paper addresses this issue and analyses the impact of different ECMs by focusing not only on the buildings themselves, but on the energy supply network and the overall energy system as a whole. To achieve this, we review five case studies in Sweden that use different ECMs as well as other alternatives, such as: distributed generation (DG) and energy storage. Results suggest that although there is no standard protocol that would fit all renovation projects, the existing methodologies fall short to provide the best overall impact on the energy system and that a broader analysis of the local conditions should be carried out before performing large building renovation projects. © 2016, Journal of Settlements and Spatial Planning.

For this purpose, a novel rule based controller with three stages is introduced. The first stage is determination of the operation modes (i.e. either charge or discharge commands) of the energy sources based on the direction of the power request (i.e. either in traction or regen request) and the charge/discharge states (i.e. energy sources either in charging or discharging phase). In the second stage, new weighting parameters used in rule tables are formulated based on the state of charge levels (SOC) of the energy sources to ensure the charge sustainability (i.e. SOC within limits). In the last stage, the power split rules are defined in rule tables based on the operation modes, states of the energy sources and the weighting parameters. The performance of the proposed strategy has been tested on a hybrid electric city bus developed in MATLAB/Simulink and compared with alternative rule based power split strategy through comprehensive simulation studies under different drive cycle conditions. For comparison purpose, two different case studies have been conducted. First, the results have been compared with the battery only system and then the effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been compared with that of alternative one. The simulation results showed that the proposed strategy significantly reduces the frequency of high C-rate current drawn from the battery and provides a more smooth change in battery current during sudden acceleration events when comparing with alternative strategy.","Battery; Energy storage; Hybrid electric vehicle; Rule based control; Ultracapacitor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958213710

In this paper, regional hydrological excitations to polar motion are investigated using monthly terrestrial water storage data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and from the five models of land hydrology. The results show that the areas where the variance shows large variability are similar for the different models of land hydrology and for the GRACE data. Areas which have a small amplitude on the maps make an important contribution to the global hydrological excitation function of polar motion. The comparison of geodetic residuals and global hydrological excitation functions of polar motion shows that none of the hydrological excitation has enough energy to significantly improve the agreement between the observed geodetic excitation and geophysical ones. © 2015 Wińska et al.

At present, no effective method has been realized to overcome the bottleneck of poor cyclability and low rate capability because of its huge volume change and low electrical conductivity. In this article, a facile synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate two-dimensional (2D) carbon encapsulated hollow Fe3O4 nanoparticles (H-Fe3O4 NPs) homogeneously anchored on graphene nanosheets (designated as H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs) as a durable high-rate lithium ion battery anode material. In the constructed architecture, the thin carbon shells can avoid the direct exposure of encapsulated H-Fe3O4 NPs to the electrolyte and preserve the structural and interfacial stabilization of H-Fe3O4 NPs. Meanwhile, the flexible and conductive GNSs and carbon shells can accommodate the mechanical stress induced by the volume change of H-Fe3O4 NPs as well as inhibit the aggregation of Fe3O4 NPs and thus maintain the structural and electrical integrity of the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode during the lithiation/delithiation processes. As a result, the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode exhibits outstanding reversible capacity (870.4 mA h g-1 at a rate of 0.1C (1C = 1 A g-1) after 100 cycles) and excellent rate performance (745, 445, and 285 mA h g-1 at 1, 5, and 10C, respectively) for lithium storage. More importantly, the H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs electrode demonstrates prolonged cycling stability even at high charge/discharge rates (only 6.8% capacity loss after 200 cycles at a high rate of 10C). Our results show that the 2D H-Fe3O4@C/GNSs are promising anode materials for next generation LIBs with high energy and power density. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Graphene; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Secondary batteries; Stresses; Synthesis (chemical); Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Carbon encapsulated hollow fe; Electrical conductivity; High charge/discharge rates; High-performance anode materials; Lithiation/delithiation; Lithium-ion battery anodes; Two Dimensional (2 D); Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958039413

The mechanism through which oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) improves viability of human extended criteria donor (ECD) livers is not well known. Aimof this study was to examine the benefits of oxygenatedHMP after static cold storage (SCS).Methods. Eighteen ECD livers that were declined for transplantation underwent ex situ viability testing using normothermic (37°C) machine perfusion (NMP) after traditional SCS (0°C-4°C) for 7 to 9 hours. In the intervention group (n = 6), livers underwent 2 hours of oxygenated HMP (at 12°C) after SCS and before NMP. Twelve control livers underwent NMP without oxygenatedHMP after SCS. Results. During HMP, hepatic ATP content increased greater than 15-fold, and levels remained significantly higher during the first 4 hours of NMP in the HMP group, compared with controls. Cumulative bile production and biliary secretion of bilirubin and bicarbonate were significantly higher after HMP, compared with controls. In addition, the levels of lactate and glucose were less elevated after HMP compared with SCS preservation alone. In contrast, there were no differences in levels of hepatobiliary injurymarkers AST, ALT, LDH, and gamma-GTafter 6 hours of NMP. Hepatic histology at baseline and after 6 hours of NMP revealed no differences in the amount of ischemic necrosis between both groups. Conclusions. Two hours of oxygenated HMP after traditional SCS restores hepatic ATP levels and improves hepatobiliary function but does not reduce (preexisting) hepatobiliary injury in ECD livers. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

As the demand for pure microalgae strains for commercial use increases, designing an effective photobioreactor (PBR) for mass cultivation is important. Chlorella vulgaris, a local freshwater microalga, was used to study the algal biomass cultivation and lipid production using various PBR configurations (bubbling, air-lift, porous air-lift). The results show that a bubbling column design is a better choice for the cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris than an air-lift one. The highest biomass concentration in the bubbling PBR was 0.78 g/L while the air-lift PBR had a value of 0.09 g/L. Key operating parameters, including draft-tube length and bubbling flowrate, were then optimized based on biomass production and lipid yield.

Next, we introduce TiO2 as an active CO2 and H2O conversion photocatalyst, including the current understanding of CO2 sorption modes, and mechanistic details of the conversion of H2O and CO2 to hydrocarbons. Subsequently, various modifications of TiO2 are described that enhance photocatalytic performance, with the focus on earth-abundant elements, including copper, iron, and nickel, in the form of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles and composites. Next, the creation of isolated Ti sites in mesoporous silica framework materials is discussed, followed by a description of the mechanism of CO2 conversion to hydrocarbons in these materials. Several attempts to create visible light-sensitive MMCT binuclear sites are also addressed. For effective CO2 reduction, water oxidation activity is essential. We will discuss some issues related to methodology to determine water oxidation efficacy, and discuss the mechanism of activity of IrOx and CoOx sites when present in mesoporous silica-based materials. Some attention is also paid to the prevention of the reverse reaction (hydrocarbons and oxygen to form CO2 and water), which would significantly decrease conversion efficiency. We conclude the overview of TiO2-based systems by discussing composites with graphene and metal organic framework materials.

In the last thirty years a more beneficial side of lactate as an alternative 'glucose sparing' fuel has been demonstrated. However, the translation of these growing insights to clinical practice seems to appear with great delay. Methods A review of the literature was performed, focusing on glucose and lactate in relation to cerebral energy metabolism, in the context of four typical clinical situations, namely (transient states of) low glucose availability for the brain due to hypoglycemia, combined with high blood lactate concentrations; permanent neuroglycopenia; lactic acidosis in mitochondrial disorders; and ischemic as well as traumatic brain injury. Results Lactate is thought to be an alternative fuel in the brain of patients with glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome and glycogen storage disease, and it has been demonstrated that lactate might have a protective role in ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Conclusion Lactate has an apparently largely ignored, but potential beneficial role in the clinical management of several neurologic disorders. © 2015 European Paediatric Neurology Society.","Brain energy metabolism; Brain injury; GLUT1 deficiency syndrome; Glycogen storage disease; Lactate; Mitochondrial disease","glucose; lactic acid; glucose; lactic acid; brain ischemia; brain metabolism; clinical practice; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy metabolism; fructose 1,6 biphosphatase deficiency; glucose blood level; glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome; glycogen storage disease; glycogen storage disease type 1; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lactate blood level; lactic acidosis; metabolic disorder; neurophysiology; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; traumatic brain injury; Acidosis, Lactic; blood; brain chemistry; child; metabolism; Acidosis, Lactic; Brain Chemistry; Child; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Lactic Acid",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950336573

Technologies based on the interruption of the breadmaking process represent an alternative to overcome product staling and microbiological deterioration. The production of par-baked breads is one of these technologies. It consists of baking the bread in two stages, and due to the possibility of retarding the second stage, it can be said that the bread can always be offered fresh to the consumer. The technology inserts logistics as part of the production process and creates the “hot point” concept, these being the locations where the bread is finalized, such as in the consumers’ homes or sales locations. In this work, a review of the papers published on this subject was carried out, and aspects related to both the formulation and the process were considered.

This drives research and building practice to search for solutions and new building concepts that contribute to achieving these goals. The work presented in this paper should be seen in that context. This research focuses on a building concept that makes use of the thermal energy storage capacity of materials and buildings. The concept combines the thermophysical benefits of low and high thermal mass buildings by adapting (on demand) to the most optimal thermal capacity. The main objective of this research is to identify if this so-called hybrid adaptable thermal energy storage (HATS) approach shows potential to reduce the energy demand of new lightweight residential buildings in the Netherlands and maintain or improve thermal comfort. This paper gives an overview of various HATS concepts and discusses the predicted performance of three HATS concepts. This research shows that the HATS approach is able to reduce the heating energy demand compared to a lightweight and heavyweight reference case. Furthermore, it shows that the HATS approach is able to improving thermal comfort compared to the lightweight reference case and maintain thermal comfort compared to the heavyweight reference case. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXOS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions by 96% and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40%, 60% and 80% of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22%, 41% and 59% of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12% between the 40% and 80% RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2-3% reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12% reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80% and 40% RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0-1% reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2% reduction in 80% RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1-3% increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40% for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70% for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a ""revenue gap"" for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60% and 80% RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emission reduction; Demand response; Electricity storage; Flexibility; Intermittent renewable sources; Power system modeling","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Compressed air; Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Gas plants; Investments; Renewable energy resources; System stability; Demand response; Electricity storages; Emission reduction; Flexibility; Power system model; Renewable sources; Cost reduction; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; emission control; energy market; investment; numerical model; photovoltaic system; power generation; power plant; renewable resource; simulation; wind power; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944183871

The model is based on a reference device with standard structure; sputtered Mo on soda lime glass, a reactively sputtered and annealed Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber layer, chemical bath deposited CdS and sputtered i-ZnO buffer layers, and front contact formed with sputtered ZnO:Al and an evaporated Ni/Al/Ni grid. The efficiency of the reference device is 6.7%. Model parameter values of the absorber layer are based on the analysis of temperature dependent current-voltage (J-V-T) measurements, capacitance-voltage (C-V) and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements, performed on the reference device, and on the comparison of simulated and measured quantum efficiency (QE) and current-voltage (J-V) performance. Additional parameters are taken from literature. The key elements, electron-hole pair generation and recombination in the absorber layer, are the main focus in this study. Reported values of the absorption coefficient of CZTS vary around one order of magnitude when comparing data from reflectance-transmission (R-T) measurements with ellipsometry measurements, and calculations. Therefore, a modified semi-empirical absorption coefficient, extracted from R-T and QE measurements, with the depletion width from CV and DLCP, is presented and used in this study. The dominating recombination path is evaluated with J-V-T analysis and the zero Kelvin activation energy (EA,0) is extracted from both temperature dependent open circuit voltage (VOC) and from modified Arrhenius plots. In each case,EA,0is found to be substantially smaller than the bandgap energy, even when considering bandgap narrowing due to disorder, which is an indication that the VOCdeficit observed in our CZTS device dominated by interface recombination. Finally, a complete device model is established, with J-V and QE simulations in good agreement with corresponding measurements, where the interface has the biggest impact on the VOCdeficit, but with clear contribution from bulk recombination, with minority carrier diffusion length 250 nm, and from bandgap narrowing, giving a lower than nominal bandgap energy of 1.35 eV. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Absorption coefficient; CZTS; Interface recombination; Kesterite; Modeling; Simulation","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Arrhenius plots; Cadmium sulfide; Diffusion; Digital storage; Energy gap; Models; Molybdenum; Open circuit voltage; Zinc oxide; Absorption co-efficient; CZTS; Interface recombination; Kesterites; Simulation; Capacitance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944111905

In this run renewable energy can play an important role for electricity generation. Bangladesh abuts by Bay of Bengal, as a result the southern areas face around 2∼5 m of tidal head/height rise and fall and as it is in the tropical region it gets an average daylight of 7∼8 hper day. Thus the hydro (tidal) energy and solar energy can be the key points to meet the scarcity of power.

This paper presents a seasonal cold storage system that uses separate type heat pipes to charge the cold energy from ambient air in winter automatically, without consuming any energy. The charged cold energy is stored in the form of ice in an insulated tank and is extracted as chilled water for cooling supply in summer, which help to reduce the chiller running time and reduce the associated electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emission significantly. A quasi-steady two-dimensional mathematical model of the system is developed for characterizing the dynamic performance of ice growth (i.e., cold charging). The model is validated using the field measurement data from an ice charging experiment conducted in Beijing. The impacts of various affecting factors, including the weather data and the key parameters of heat pipes, on the charging performance of the cold storage system are analyzed.

This aims to improve the performance of traditional linear decision rules when applied to short-term electrical reserve operation. We derive a primal problem whose solution is a time-coupled rule for up- and down-regulating the power injections of each controllable device, such as a generator or energy storage unit, in response to discovered values of prediction errors. This rule depends on the 'bin' into which measured prediction errors fall, so that, for example, up-regulation follows a different rule to down-regulation. We also derive an associated dual problem, whose solution provides a lower-bound on the best possible primal cost. This allows the suboptimality of a candidate solution based on a particular decision rule parameterization to be bounded. The primal and dual solutions are also compared to the so-called prescient case, in which the values of the uncertainty are known in advance. We demonstrate the method using numerical case studies, including the standard IEEE-118 bus network, in which a minimum possible reserve cost is identified using the dual lower-bounding approach. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Automatic generation control; Piecewise linear decision rules; Power systems; Renewables integration; Robust optimization","Errors; Optimization; Energy storage unit; Linear decision rules; Performance bounds; Power injection; Power system dispatch; Prediction errors; Reserve optimizations; Robust optimization; Numerical methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922731164

The uncertainty is assumed to be bounded, with estimated first and second moment statistics available. The rolling 'look-ahead' process employs a planning horizon of several hours, with re-optimization taking place each time the first step has been implemented. We present an expected-cost formulation incorporating multi-stage recourse on continuous decision variables - plans for adjusting the dispatch in the light of future information to be discovered at each stage of the optimization horizon. The generic formulation allows the flexibility of devices such as energy storage units to be exploited in the reserve mechanism. We demonstrate using closed-loop numerical tests that significant reductions in the cost of accommodating uncertainty are attainable relative to a time-decoupled reserve mechanism. In contrast to previous results, we show that a time-coupled cost function is not required for this benefit to be observed. In addition, we show that relaxing binary unit commitment decisions after the first step of the horizon brings significant computational speed-ups, and in some cases also reduce closed-loop system operation costs. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Automatic generation control; Forecast uncertainty; Linear decision rules; Multistage optimization; Power generation dispatch; Wind energy integration","Closed loop systems; Cost functions; Costs; Decision making; Electric power systems; Operating costs; Uncertainty analysis; Computational speed; Decision making process; Decision variables; Electrical power system; Energy storage unit; Heterogeneous devices; Planning horizons; Unit-commitment; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922440613

However, traditional GC-eDRAM implementations require boosted control signals in order to write full voltage levels to the cell to reduce the refresh rate and shorten access times. These boosted levels require either an extra power supply or on-chip charge pumps, as well as nontrivial level shifting and toleration of high voltage levels. In this brief, we present a novel, logic compatible, 3T GC-eDRAM bitcell that operates with a single-supply voltage and provides superior write capability to the conventional GC structures. The proposed circuit is demonstrated with a 2-kb memory macro that was designed and fabricated in a mature 0.18-μm CMOS process, targeted at low-power, energy-efficient applications. The test array is powered with a single supply of 900 mV, showing a 0.8-ms worst case retention time, a 1.3-ns write-access time, and a 2.4-pW/bit retention power. The proposed topology provides a bitcell area reduction of 43%, as compared with a redrawn 6-transistor SRAM in the same technology, and an overall macro area reduction of 67% including peripherals. © 2015 IEEE.","Access speed; data retention time; embedded DRAM; gain cell; low power operation","CMOS integrated circuits; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Macros; Static random access storage; Area reduction; Control signal; Energy efficient; High voltage level; Level-shifting; Low power application; Single supplies; Static leakage; Low power electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922425056
