Enhancing the storage performance is necessary to increase the performance of most systems. The stratification phenomenon is employed to improve the efficiency of storage tanks. Heat at an intermediate temperature, not high enough to heat up the top layer, can still be used to heat the lower, colder layers. There are a lot of parameters to study the stratification in a water tank such as the Mix Number and the Richardson Number among others. The idea studied here was to use these stratification parameters to compare two tanks with the same dimensions during charging and discharging processes. One of them is a traditional water tank and the other is a PCM-water (a water tank with a Phase Change Material). A PCM is good because it has high energy density if there is a small temperature change, since then the latent heat is much larger than the sensible heat. On the other hand, the temperature change in the top layer of a hot water store with stratification is usually small as it is held as close as possible at or above the temperature for usage. In the system studied the Phase Change Material is placed at the top of the tank, therefore the advantages of the stratification still remain. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the use of PCM in the upper part of a water tank holds or improves the benefit of the stratification phenomenon.

This holds for autonomous devices but even more so for future medical implants. Evidently, rechargeable integrated all-solid-state batteries will play a key role in these fields, enabling miniaturization, preventing electrode degradation upon cycling and electrolyte leakage. Planar solid-state thin film batteries are rapidly emerging but reveal several potential drawbacks, such as a relatively low energy density and the use of highly reactive lithium. Thin film Si-intercalation electrodes covered with a solid-state electrolyte are found to combine a high storage capacity of 3500 mAh g-1 with high cycle life, enabling to integrate batteries in Si. Based on the excellent intercalation chemistry of Si, a new 3D-integrated all-solid-state battery concept is proposed. High aspect ratio cavities and features, etched in silicon, will yield large surface area batteries with anticipated energy density of about 5 mWh μm-1 cm-2, i.e. more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of integrated capacitors. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Apart form that, biomass has the unique advantage among the rest of renewable energy sources, to be able to provide solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels that can be stored, transported, and utilized, far a way from the point of origin. For the northern region of Macedonia in Greece, biomass utilization is considered to be a major issue, due to the considerably intensive regional agricultural activities. Wood by-products, fruit cores, rice husk and cotton gin waste provide a promising energy source for the region. The energy potential of the available agricultural biomass produced in the region is much enough to cover the 10% of the annual oil consumption utilized for thermal applications. However, the cost of energy utilization of biomass is considerably high due to the high cost of the logistics concerning the collection, transport, and storage of biomass. The available utilization technologies developed, to handle efficiently all different species of biomass, cover a wide technological range. One of the most promising technologies involving thermal treatment of biomass and the production of a gaseous fuel (biogas) for industrial heat applications and electricity production, is the thermochemical conversion. In the present work, an investigation concerning biomass potential for energy production in the region of central Macedonia in Greece, utilizing several locally produced biomass species, is conducted. Emphasis is put on the energy utilization of agricultural by-products and residues. Agricultural sector is of greal importance due to the considerably intensive agricultural activities in the region of Central Macedonia.","Agricultural residues; Biomass; Energy; Greece; Thermal treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949012759

The excitation system of the LC-inverter type based on TPl 10k/20 thyratron in absence of any non-linear elements was developed. An experimental investigation of the energy and temporal parameters of the pumping and lasing for ArF laser on the He:Ar:F2 mixture with excitation system developed was carried out. The comparative analysis of the ArF laser pumping and radiation parameters in dependence of the high-voltage switch type such as a standard spark gap RU-65, and thyratron TPI 10k/20 was performed. The output radiation energy for a laser with thyratron TPI 10k/20 was obtained to be of 1.4 times higher than that with standard spark gap RU-65 at the same pumping conditions. Such increase the output energy was shown to be achieving owing to higher level of the pumping intensity due to higher voltage on the discharge gap that occurs due to lower energy losses into TPI thyratron in comparison with the RU-65 spark gap and leads to more efficient energy transfer from storage to discharge circuit. As a result for ArF laser with TPI thyratron in He:Ar:F 2 mixture the output radiation energy of 1.0 J with the total efficiency of 1.7% has been achieved.

The modelled change in biomass heat storage (Jtr) is driven by radial heat diffusion within the trunks and surface heat exchange by convection, insolation and longwave radiation. The calculation requires only variables from the previous and current time step and is independent of measured biomass temperature. The model was applied to a 40 m tall Australian temperate Eucalyptus forest at the Tumbarumba Ozflux site. A comparison between modelled and measured trunk temperatures showed agreement to within 1 °C, providing confidence in the model. Hourly values of Jtr peaked at 61 W m-2 for this site. Similar values of Jtr were obtained using an adaptation of the force-restore method. Additional calculations for a range of leaf area indices and trunk radii enable a quick estimate of the maximum hourly value of Jtr for any forest with given leaf area index, quadratic mean trunk radius (at breast height) and biomass. Inclusion of heat storage fluxes in the hourly available energy budget for the forest improved agreement between available energy and measured heat fluxes above the canopy, with energy closure rising from 90 to 101%. Accounting for Jtr in the SVAT model also improved agreement between measured and modelled fluxes of sensible and latent heat. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The dihedral orbitais are a set of orbitals situated in each dihedral angle of the chain. The LCDO-MO approach remains basically topological, and we display its direct relation to known graph theoretical concepts. Using this approach, we define the dihedral electronic energy and the dihedral electronic partition function of a linear macromolecular chain. We show that the partition function per dihedral angle quantifies the degree of folding of the dihedral graph. We analyze the empirical relationship between these two functions by using a series of 100 proteins. We also study the relation between these two functions and the percentages of secondary structure for these proteins.

Therefore, incorporating energy-awareness in all the layers of the protocol, stack is a basic requirement. Different sensor network applications generally require similar physical and link layers and the design of these layers is focused on system level power awareness such as dynamic voltage scaling, radio communication hardware, low duty cycle issues, system partitioning and energy aware MAC protocols (Heinzelman 2000; Min 2000; Woo 2001; Ye 2002; Eugene 2001). However, network layer gets influenced by the type of application besides ensuring energy-efficient route setup, reliable data-delivery and maximising network lifetime. Accordingly, routing in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial and should take into consideration its inherent features along with application and architectural requirements. The routing techniques are employed by contemporary communication and ad hoc networks cannot be applied directly to wireless sensor networks due to the following reasons: Traditional IP based protocols are inapplicable as it is infeasible to assign and maintain unique IDs for such a large number of sensor nodes As against a typical communication network nearly all the applications of WSNs require flow of data from several sources to one destination. Multiple sensor nodes within the vicinity of the sensed phenomenon might generate same data. In contrast to other networks, this fact can be exploited at the network layer to improve energy efficiency and bandwidth requirements. Sensor nodes have severe limitation on transmission power, energy reservoir, processing capability and storage that are not major issues in other networks. Sensor networks are application specific and the design requirement changes. Sensor networks are data-centric networks, i.e., they require attribute based addressing and queries are also formed in attribute-value pairs. For example, if a sensor network is queried with ""temperature 60""then only the sensors with temperature greater then 60 will respond. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892241152

The ability to determine the wear mechanisms holds the key in determining the service life of pneumatic conveying pipelines in the industry. Based on the understanding of the wear process as well as the material interactions, a wear model has been proposed to predict the thickness loss in the pneumatic conveying pipelines. The model is developed based on particle impact energy delivered to the surface and the unit energy for material removal from the surface in cutting and deformation mechanisms. A number of other factors such as particle concentration, particle angularity and coefficient of restitution to accommodate the energy transfer to the surface have been included into the model. Particle velocity instead of superficial air velocity of the pipeline has been used in the model for prediction of wear loss from the surface. Industrial wear process has also been simulated at the laboratory for accelerated wear testing. Finally the output of the model has been compared with the depth of wear measured using the ultrasonic transducer from the accelerated wear testing. With limited experimental data, the model showed good correlation with the measured data.

Important in designing such PV powered products is an efficient energy transfer along the elements of the energy chain, i.e. from PV converter into the batteries and from batteries to the application. For an efficient energy transfer it is essential that the elements in the energy chain are optimally matched.

The growing demand for Natural Gas in residential and industry section and supply pushing for covering this demand, are the reasons for such statement. For responding to this phase of Natural Gas life, Iran needs investment especially in upstream development, technology transfer and facilitating in exports and imports. According to the annual report in long term Middle East will be the second exporter region and Iran which is the first holder of reserves and first producer and consumer in this area is a potential exporter for next decades. The Islamic Republic of Iran is able to produce more than 400 millions cubic meters per day of Natural Gas from giant Pars field. Regarding internal demand a half of this production can be assigned to exports, inter regionally or worldwide. Iran was the first country in the area to export Natural Gas to the ex. USSR through a 42 inches pipeline with a length of 1100 Km. The flow was 10 BCM/Y. Pipeline to Turkey has completed and gas flow to this country has started from 3 BCM/Y. Also Armenia will have soon been able to receive Natural Gas from Iran. Importing gas from Turkmenistan implies that Iran is an interregional gas dealer. The strategic role of Persian Gulf and the huge amount of gas reserves in this area has provided a very good opportunity for Iran to export gas to demanding countries through pipeline or in the form of LNG. In energy sector the policy is substitution of oil products by Natural Gas .That is why gas consumption shows such as a high growth over the last decade. Transmission pipelines with a length of 20000 Km takes gas from various sources to destinations in the whole country. Lines with diameter of 56, 48 and 42 inches have been employed to carry more than 500 millions cubic meters per day of Natural Gas. In 21st century gas industry liberalization has been main program for government. Treatment units, distribution and service facilities are more introduced to private investors. For overcoming the high seasonal difference of consumption installation of underground Natural Gas storage have been recognized as the best choice.

Due to the country's reliance on coal as a major energy source and the large petrochemical industries, South Africa is amongst the world's high CO 2 emitters. Carbon dioxide sequestration into uneconomical coal seams has been proposed as a strategy for carbon dioxide emission reduction as coals have a high gas storage capacity. However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding as to the actual CO2 uptake and retention mechanisms by the various components in South African coals. Coal is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic components, and varies in composition across the country. Adsorption properties could be enhanced by understanding the CO2 uptake behaviour of different individual coal macerals, as porosity is related to maceral composition. Typically, vitrinite predominately contains micropores, and inertinite contains mesopores and macropores. Therefore the maceral and microlithotype composition plays a significant role in the porosity and gas transport properties related to CO2 sequestration. South African coals are typically rich in inertinite, differing from Northern Hemisphere coals, and consequently research results conducted on non-South African coals may not be applicable. The objective of the project is to determine the uptake of CO2 in a variety of South African coals with varying rank (bituminous coal versus semi-anthracite) and varying maceral composition (vitrinite-rich coal versus inertinite-rich coal, versus mineral-rich coal). Adsorption rate and amount of gas adsorbed will be determined, as well as any CMB release. As CO2 sequestration is likely to occur in deep coal seams, temperature and pressure could be additional variables.",,"Adsorption properties; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Emission reduction targets; Gas storage capacity; Gas transport properties; Petrochemical industry; Temperature and pressures; Anthracite; Bituminous coal; Coal deposits; Developing countries; Emission control; Gas adsorption; Global warming; Transport properties; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877658993

Additionally, the pilot plant will be used to test the performance of new energy efficient solvents and to validate modelling work. The design of the pilot plant is based on a commercial CO2 production plant using alkanolamine as an absorbent. The pilot plant operates on a slipstream of the flue gas taken after the deNOx and FGD plants. The flue gas does not undergo any further treatment or conditioning before it enters the CO2 capture plant.

An experimental study was carried out to characterize the effect of chemical activation on the pore characteristics of two Australian coals. Activated carbons were prepared using KOH and NaOH as the activating agents. Physical and chemical properties of coals and activated carbons were characterized using N2 adsorption, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Original coal minerals and their association with carbon matter were quantified using SIROQUANT and QEMSCANTM. The effects of coal properties and activating agents on the pore characteristics of activated carbon are discussed. The study demonstrated that with the help of chemical activation both Australian coals can be successfully used to prepare advanced carbons with exceptionally high surface area (2884 m2/g) and micropore volume (1.42 cm3/g). The study further showed that NaOH had greater influence on the modification of porous nature of higher volatile coal while KOH had greater effect on lower volatile coal. Both coals provided higher carbon yield when activated with KOH compared to activation with NaOH. The effect of coal properties and the activating agents on pore structure is found to be consistent with past mechanisms. The study suggests that the pore structure of Australian coals can be conveniently tailored to develop advanced materials for gas and energy storage devices by optimizing coal properties and nature of chemical activating agent.","Activated carbon; Alkali activation; Coal; SIROQUANT; TEM and QEMSCAN; XRD","Alkali activation; Physical and chemical properties; Pore characteristics; Porous carbon materials; QemSCAN; SIROQUANT; Transmission electron microscopy (TEM); XRD; Activated carbon; Chemical activation; Chemical properties; Pore structure; Raman spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Coal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877640663

Since the system is vulnerable to faults close to the sources, additional reactive power support is necessary to improve the fault ride-through capability of the system and the performance of the motors. During a fault, the motor terminal voltage is very low. The unbalance between the electrical torque and the mechanical torque decelerates the motor. After the fault-clearance, the motor starts to accelerate if the electrical torque generated is larger than the mechanical torque. In order to produce the required torque, the motor consumes much more reactive power than under normal condition. If the reactive power support is not sufficient, the motor will keep decelerating until it stops. A StatCom can be installed to provide fast and dynamic reactive power support and voltage control to the system. In this paper, a control scheme for a StatCom with energy storage capability is proposed. The system performance, especially the motor speeds, will be analyzed through simulations carried out in PSCAD. It is shown in the paper that the scheme with active power compensation effectively helps the system to recover from faults. Although this incurs extra cost for the increased dc voltage of the converter and the dc side capacitor, the overall rating of the converter can be reduced by utilization of the proposed scheme.","Energy storage; Fault recovery; Induction motor; Phase jump; Statcom; Voltage source converter; VSC; Weak network","Fault recovery; Phase jumps; Statcom; Voltage source converters; VSC; Weak network; Capacitors; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Induction motors; Power converters; Reactive power; Torque; Torque motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877281064

Certain additives degrade at lead-free reflow temperature as well as high temperature storage exposure at 175 deg C. The influence of such additives used in epoxy mold compound on gold-aluminum inter-metallic compound formation has been studied. Plastic ball grid array test package encapsulated with thermally unstable additives show trace elements from the degraded additive when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The element ingress and reside on the non-bonded regions of the ball bonds with increasing high temperature exposure. As the bonded regions remain free of the degraded elements, regular growth of inter-metallic compound progress while inter-metallic compound formation is retarded at non-bonded regions contaminated with trace elements. The resulting morphology after extended high temperature storage exposure shows voids that coalescence into a series of micro cracks. Thermally stable additives are found to be critical in ensuring green, reliable epoxy mold compound fulfilling the qualification requirements of ultra fine pitch integrate circuit package.

As an option, solar photovoltaic (PV) is gaining popularity, though its high initial cost is a major barrier for its widespread use. It can supply electricity, as stand alone grid connected and isolated PV hybrid energy systems. This paper discusses the techno-financial feasibility study for an electrical power supply system for a rural (island) village. The design tool HOMER was used as the sizing and optimization tool. Solar radiation and related load information are the input data required, and the procedure has been applied to the island community of Kohjig, located in the gulf of Thailand. The results of the analysis show that there are potential niche markets for hybrid power supply system for application in an island community. Their attractiveness is enhanced due to the rising cost of fossil fuel transportation and the difficulty in extending the distribution system over the island. The study of Kohjig shows a system comprising a 15 kWp PV system connected to the diesel generator together with three days of battery storage can provide about three fourth of the load. This would allow for fuel savings of 47, 655 liters/a.",,"Distribution systems; Electrical power supply; Feasibility studies; Fuel transportations; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid power supply systems; Optimization tools; Solar photovoltaics; Costs; Electric power distribution; Electricity; Fuel economy; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Sun; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875908625

The use of a bad relation between these three parameters and the building cooling loads makes a so long payback period, so it's good to know how much is going to grow the solar development when a square meter more is added or when a smaller tank is chosen or when the chiller is over-dimensioned. A well dimensioned system is the first step to maximize the exploitation results, that must be followed by a good control system to optimize operational variables. This article presents an no-dimensional study about how important is each one of the typical relation between parameters in solar cooling systems. These simulations are made with TRNSYS16 [7] and are based on a real identified model placed in Valladolid.

A complete renewable energy demonstration system was provided to improve the services offered to tourists who stay overnight at rural houses. The community selection performed by the Uruguayan Renewable Energy Work Group, assisted by sociologists using the methodology and criteria implemented in a prior project, is described. The community was characterized including social, demographic and organizational issues, a carefully designed enquiry, mostly related to energy and production issues, was performed and a forecast for future needs was completed. Agreements about the renewable energy demonstration system characteristics were reached in a workshop attended by all community members. Also, load requirements and number and type of appliances were characterized. Due to project fund restrictions, only one complete system could be installed. Its location in one of the several farm houses where lodging is offered was discussed with the community reaching a consensus. The system installed uses wind energy to satisfy illumination, communications and refrigerator needs and solar water heating. Also, excess wind power will be used to support water heating. The local wind potential assessment, using short time wind measurements related to those obtained at near-by meteorological stations, and the system design are presented. Users received training about the system operation and its power and energy restrictions.

A full-scale test facility using the PCMGW was monitored for two years, and was modeled using the thermal building simulation package, SUNREL, to evaluate the latent heat storage performance of the PCM treated wallboards. Measured and simulated results showed that the use of PCMGW met two needs: quick absorption of solar heat for use during off-sunshine hours and avoid overheating during sunshine hours. The PCMGWs effectively smoothed out diurnal daily fluctuations of indoor air temperatures on sunny days and, therefore, providing thermal comfort. Although the benefits of PCMGW were clearly demonstrated, it was necessary to optimize the melting point and quantity of the PCM and to highlight the importance of showing how many days the PCM could effectively minimize the indoor temperature fluctuation. In a 90-day period during summer, a PCM of with a melting range of 18°C - 22°C could be fully utilized for 39% and partially utilized for 55.5% of the summer days when there is either partial melting or partial freezing.

Some researches showed that low flow rates systems with highly stratified heat storages would have higher system efficiency than similar traditional ones. In practice considering the higher cost of stratified heat storages, heat storage without stratification would be applied in many large-scale systems. In this study the effects of flow rates on the system performance are numerically and experimentally investigated. Flow rates vary from 0.001 to 0.035 kg/(s·m2). A solar heating system applied in the industrial pr°Cess has been constructed in this study. The system is mainly composed of a collecting area of 192 m2 and a storage tank of 30 m3. The hot water is supplied to a boiler and daily water consumption of 40 tons is expected all the year round. A long-term monitoring of the system has been conducted since July 2006. Numerical calculation using TRNSYS model showed that the system efficiency increases with decreasing flow rates from 0.035 to 0.005 kg/(s·m2), but decreases with decreasing flow rates from 0.005 to 0.001 kg/(s·m2). The system efficiency varies from 0.47 to 0.54. With highly stratified heat storages the system efficiency could be 3% to 8% higher than those without stratification. The monitored data from July 2006 to April 2007 showed apparent discrepancy of system efficiency at the higher flow rate of 0.035 kg/(s·m2) between numerical and experimental results. The monitored system efficiency at the higher flow rates of 0.035 kg/(s·m2) is about 0.32. With decreasing flow rate to 0.02 kg/(s·m2) the system efficiency dramatically increases to 0.37. There appears a peak at the flow rate of about 0.025 kg/(s·m2) but not at 0.005 kg/(s·m2) as shown in the calculation results. The monitored data till now showed an apparent different tendency in comparison with the numerical calculation.

In parallel, a thermal building simulation code, using SUNREL software, was used to simulate the performance of the huts. Measured and simulated results in summer showed that the use of PCMGW effectively reduced diurnal daily fluctuations of indoor air temperatures and maintained the indoor temperature at the desired comfort level for a longer period of time.

It combines an unglazed transpired solar collector (UTC), r°Ck bed, and a biomass gasifier stove with heat exchanger. The system utilises part of the r°Ck bed to supply supplementary heat. The UTC supplies the required hot air during the day (to meet the load), and the stove-heat exchanger unit supplies hot air to the r°Ck bed (to charge it), also during the daytime. The r°Ck bed stores the thermal energy during the daytime, and supplies heat during off-sunshine hours - both during day and night. The system was evaluated by drying 22 kg of red chilli, using hot air at 60°C and 90 m3/h, from an initial moisture content of 76.7% (w.b) to 8.4% over 32.5 hours of continuous drying. The dryer contributed to a reduction of 66% in drying time compared to open sun drying. The temperature of hot air supplied was stable at 60±3°C for over 24 hours during the entire drying duration. Providing a load fraction of 91.6% during the 24-hour operation, the air heating system can successfully dry red chilli in a continuous drying operation, at required air temperature and flow rate, which can be maintained fairly constant.

A wireless sensor network typically consists of a base station (sometimes called sink, or gateway), and a set of sensor nodes (sometimes called sources, see Fig. 12.1). The sensor nodes are used to continuously capture environmental data such as temperature, humidity, lightness, etc. To send these data back to the base station and assist message routing, they are also equipped with radio transceivers that are capable of short-range transmission. The base station, as observed from the figure, serves as the gateway of the sensor network to exchange data and control messages with external applications to accomplish certain missions. As a typical example of the sensor network, suppose an external application wishes to know the average temperature of a certain area spanned by the sensor network. An explicit query (called an aggregation query) is then sent to the base station, which in turn forwards it to all the sensor nodes pertaining to this area. The temperature data (sometimes called readings or sensor values) are collected, averaged, and finally returned to the base station and the external application. capacity, they can assist the processing procedure in many ways. In what follows, we briefly introduce some basic notions that are frequently used by sensor network systems, and gradually elaborate them as we explore this topic. Snapshot query vs. continuous query. If the query involves a temporal parameter, which spans a limited or unlimited period of time, it is a continuous query. Such queries are usually used to monitor the physical world and its evolution over time. In contrast to a continuous query, a snapshot query only asks for the sensor data at a specified time instant. Query arrival rate vs. data capture (update) rate. For a particular sensor node, query arrival rate denotes the rate of incoming queries whose querying area overlaps the nodes coverage. This rate shows how popular this sensor node is, and it is often regarded as an external parameter (i.e., it cannot be controlled by the sensor network). The data capture (sometimes called ""data update "") rate, on the other hand, denotes how often the sensor samples (sometimes called collects) the data. Different from query arrival rate, data capture rate is often tunable by the base station or the sensor itself. It is noteworthy that, these two rates are the two competing factors that affect the performance of the sensor network, similar to the consumer-producer relations. Push V.S. pull-based data dissemination. The collected data from a single sensor can be either pushed to the central server, i.e., the base station, or still kept locally at the sensor until some query explicitly pulls the data. Local V.S. centralized storage. From the storage point of view, push-based dissemination advocates centralized data storage while pull-based dissemination advocates local storage. It is also understood that centralized storage favors high query arrival rate and low data capture rate while local storage favors low query arrival rate and high data capture rate. Some recent work suggests hybrid pull-and-push-based dissemination, or in the storage terms, distributed sensor storage (Zhang et al. 2003). The idea is neither to send an overwhelming volume of raw sensor readings directly to the base station, nor to keep them at sensing locations, but rather, to organize and distribute them to appropriate locations throughout the sensor network so that these data can be quickly retrieved and queried later. Among the distributed storage proposals, data-centric storage is the most popular one (Ratnasamy et al. 2003). It names (or more formally, indexes) the data being stored for future searches. Both the base station and sensor nodes can access the data by their names across the entire sensor network, which explains why this storage scheme is called ""data-centric "". This chapter mainly concerns the energy consumption issue during query processing in sensor networks. While the base station is supplied with unlimited power, the sensor nodes are usually battery-powered. In most cases, these batteries are inconvenient or even impossible to replace once they are deployed in the wild field. On the other hand, most sensor applications require continuous monitoring of data, which further makes energy efficiency a critical factor in the design of a good sensor network. Among all the sources that may consume sensor energy, wireless radio transmission is the most dominant source (Pottie et al. 2000). This is especially true in those networks where the sensor nodes fall far apart, since the power consumption for radio transmission is at least quadratic to the distance of transmission. The second major source that consumes significant energy is the sampling activities of the sensor nodes. Thus, a good design of energy-efficient sensor network should: (1) reduce unnecessary data transmission; (2) reduce the frequency of sensor reading. When a sensor node runs out of energy, its coverage is lost. In most scenarios, the mission of an application would not be able to continue if the total coverage loss over the entire area is remarkable. Formally, the network lifetime of a sensor network is the time duration until it fails to carry out the mission due to insufficient number of ""alive "" sensor nodes (Akyildiz et al. 2002). Energy- efficient data management is crucial for the sensor networks to accomplish the mission and accomplish it economically. However, this is a challenging task due to the following reasons. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875678829

Because these are often provided by conventional generating units, wind power must be taken into account in the commitment and dispatch generation of these units in the system. In this paper, impacts of wind power on the existing generation system and the opportunities for base-load coal, fast gas turbines, and different energy storage options are explored. Results include information on energy storage op-eration cycles, total operating cost, wasted wind power re-sources and emissions. It is shown that the feasibility of different generation options is dependent on the amount of wind power installed in the system. The value of base- load coal and gas-fired combined cycle decreases with the amount of installed wind power, whereas the value of underground pumped accumulation storage increases, although unlikely to become profitable. In this case, the use of heat boilers at combined heat and power locations appears to have the most potential for efficiently creating additional technical space for wind power integration.","Cost optimization; Enery storage; Power system operation; System integration; Wind power","Combined heat and power; Cost optimization; Generating unit; Generation systems; Large-scale wind power; Power system operations; System integration; Wind power integrations; Coal storage; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Optimization; Profitability; Underground gas storage; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875348170

The basic task of the scavenger is to convert ambient energy, e.g. HF.V engine vibration or centripetal tire acceleration into electrical energy. As these energy harvesting devices shrink in dimensions, while still providing sufficient energy, they will be key enablers for wireless autonomous sensor networks. For such purpose harvesting devices are being investigated, which feature a footprint of 1 cm2 and an average power harvesting level of 100 μW. A scavenger (in combination with an energy storage system) may be used to increase the energy efficiency of an autonomous system, thus exceeding the operational time of a purely autonomous energy storage-powered device. Subsequently, fully autonomous systems rely on energy storage systems which arc continuously recharged by a scavenger. As an example, an Intelligent Tire system may measure and transmit the tire pressure and temperature through a wireless communication to a base station, e.g. a reading unit or the on-board computer of a vehicle. Subsequently, other parameters as the tire identification, force and friction may also be determined and transmitted by the Intelligent Tire system. These parameters may be further used for an efficient control, steering and increase safety of the HCV. Efficient power and energy storage management under the Intelligent Tire platform operational conditions is very important. As a result, various batteries and ultracapacitors systems arc investigated in this article and their suitability for autonomous transducer systems will be also indicated.

The author believes that this is the best way to reduce both operational costs and the fossil fuel consumption of ethanol industry, which is mostly due to sugar cane transportation. This advantage tends to increase in the coming years, since the ratio of fossil fuel consumption per ethanol unit produced will increase, as new distilleries capacity is four to five times larger than the present average. Hence, transportation distances will increase as harvesting areas increase. The project will be developed in two phases, starting with the conversion of three diesel-powered trucks into EHET, to be used regularly in order to provide significant experience data.

The coupling has multiple advantages. It allows the vehicle to travel a significant part of the time in all-electric mode. Second, it allows the grid to use the vehicle as an energy storage device, enabling a higher penetration of distributed generation with intermittent energy production. From the perspective of grid balancing the fleet of hybrid electric vehicles can act as a controllable load. Power electronics for the grid coupling can provide reactive power to enhance the power factor of the installation and can be used as an active filter to eliminate harmonics. By injecting electrical energy in the grid, the HEV can be used as a reserve power unit to set off the loss of a power plant, as a replacement for peak power units, as part of a microgrid or as stand-alone mobile generator. Other possibilities such as peak-shaving are possible from a technical point of view, but lack the necessary economical feasibility. The interaction of a HEV with the power grid was first proposed in the 1997 paper of Kempton and Letendre [1]. The concept became known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). However, since then, the research was mainly focused on the economical implications of such a system [2]-[3]. Specifications were given for the technical possibilities which a V2G-system needs, but very few research was done regarding the technical implementation. This paper tends to fill in this gap. Following sections describe a setup which realizes the coupling of a HEV to a single-phase electric power grid, proving the technically feasibility of a relatively simple single-phase power electronic circuit for a grid-coupled HEV based on Kalman-filter based d-q decompositions. A grid-coupled HEV is simulated with a power electronic circuit consisting of two back-to-back connected IGBT-converters.","Back-to-back coupled inverters; Control strategies; Grid-coupling HEVs; Park d-q-current components","Control strategies; Controllable loads; Current component; Economical feasibility; Electric power grids; Electrical energy; Grid-coupling HEVs; IGBT converters; Intermittent energy production; Micro grid; Mobile generator; Peak power; Peak-shaving; Plug-ins; Power factors; Power grids; Power units; Single-phase power; Technical implementation; Vehicle to grids; Active filters; Distributed power generation; Electric drives; Electric power factor; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Power electronics; Power plants; Secondary batteries; Sustainable development; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872008104

The chemical quality of the anodes, the physical quality of the anodes and the starter sheets, the electrolyte, the kind, the amount and the activity of the inhibitors, all of them have an influence on the quality of the cathodes, on the current efficiency, and on the energy consumption, just to highlight some of the parameters. The major goal of this survey is to find a model that helps to predict the current efficiency and the energy consumption based on some material, plant and process conditions. For model building a set of recorded parameters as model input have been used, most of them describing the chemistry of the anodes and the electrolyte. The second goal is to find out which of the used input parameters have a major impact on the model output and if some of them can be neglected for modelling the process. For building the models novel neural network architecture as an alternative to the common multi layer perceptron special network architecture is used - the completely connected perceptron. That completely connected perceptron has several advantages in approaching the optimal network size, especially in preventing from over sizing neural networks. For estimating the impact of the input parameters on the model quality sequential forward selection is used, a method used in statistics for estimating the influence of any model input on the resulting model. Neural networks create data driven (heuristic) models, thus the data need to be partitioned into training and testing subsets. Since the impact of data selection generally biases the model results, multi-fold cross validation technique is used to overcome that problem.","Computational Intelligence; Copper anodes; Copper Refinery; Neural Computation; Tankhouse optimization","Chemical quality; Copper anode; Copper refinery; Current efficiency; Data driven; Data Selection; Input parameter; Model inputs; Model outputs; Model qualities; Model results; Multi layer perceptron; Multi-fold cross validation; Neural computations; Novel neural network; Optimal networks; Over-sizing; Perceptron; Physical quality; Process condition; Sequential forward selection; Training and testing; Anodes; Artificial intelligence; Data reduction; Digital storage; Electric load forecasting; Electrolytes; Energy utilization; Metallurgy; Network architecture; Neural networks; Optimization; Refining; Copper",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871528817

The paper describes the software settings and discusses the importance of some guidelines prescriptions as mesh independence, adopted wind profile and the use of roughness in the domain floor. The CP values were applied in the BES-AFN model TAS for the São Paulo-Brazil climate. The main conclusion is that mesh and the adopted wind profile have a strong influence in the calculated CP values, and the guidelines prescriptions are relevant and should be followed. The BES-AFN results show large differences depending on the source of CP data: the CFD simulation or the generic values found in the literature. Experimental validation is recommended to assess the better CP source for AFN model.","Airflow network; CFD; Wind pressure coefficient","CFD simulations; Commercial packages; Experimental validations; In-buildings; Isolated buildings; Mesh independence; Network models; Pressure coefficients; Social housing; Software settings; Ventilation rate; Wind pressure coefficient; Wind profiles; Buildings; Climate models; Digital storage; Turbulence models; Wind effects; Computational fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869748714

The grape culture was chosen for being a product adapted to the area that has as reference the Pole of Petrolina. The grape is a perennial culture, with a deep radicular system, that is able be adjusted, to certain point, to a limited supply of water. For determining the hydric need of the culture, we adopted the model proposed by FAO, that uses the equation of Penman-Monteith to define the evapotranspiration. We also considered, a layer of water for washing the soil, to avoid salinization. With the purpose of attending the hydric demand of the plant the following factors were considered: pumped volume, pluviometric precipitation, storage of water in the soil and area to be irrigated, interrelated by the equation of mass conservation. The pumped volume is estimated by utilizability method, starting from the characteristic curve of the pump and the average monthly collected solar radiation. Finally the equipment used in the irrigation project is dimensioned and an economic analysis is carried out.

The main systematic change of the photon beam-position is induced by varying insertion device (ID) settings, such as photon energy, harmonic-selection or light polarization. An ID beam-position correction scheme is based on digital beam-position monitors (DBPM) located inside the storage ring, combined with analogue Bergoz BPMs, located inside the ID straight section, and analogue photon monitors (XBPMs), in beam line front-ends. The use of XBPMs in this correction scheme will be demonstrated.

The standards currently in place provide minimum requirements, since they want to create a level playing field that allows analyzers from different manufacturers to give the same results. It is good idea in concept, but it also acts as double edged sword. Manufacturers design their product to comply with these standards but typically do not provide data and measurements that would allow power quality analysis to go beyond current capabilities. To follow the guidelines set out by various standards and record faults or disturbances, today's meters rely solely on event-based triggers. While this method provides engineers with some information regarding an event, it does not allow for full analysis of all power parameters leading up to an event, during an event or how the overall network recovers after an event. Further, due to limitations in memory storage, it is likely that even the data captured by such recording method(s) will not capture all of the 'true' power and energy parameters. In a majority of cases, these limitations prevent power quality phenomena from being truly solved and prevent solutions that will eliminate future recurrence. This paper will highlight case studies of Power Quality troubleshooting that was not capable of solving the Power Quality problem with measurements simply taken to comply with standards. It will further show that by providing engineers with data beyond the standards, an unprecedented number of Power Quality events can not only be captured, but are definitively solved.","EN 50160; IEC 61000-4-30; Power quality analysis; Power quality troubleshooting; Standards compliance","Current capability; Electrical networks; EN 50160; Energy parameters; Event-based; IEC 61000-4-30; Level playing fields; Memory storage; Power parameters; Power quality event; Power quality monitoring; Power quality problem; Power-quality analysis; Engineers; Manufacture; Network management; Product design; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Power quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865521735

When natural gas is used as energy source, the burners of the energy-producing units are of the dual kind and can use fuel oil as combustible when necessary. This is because gas supply is switched off periodically during gas pipes or equipment maintenance. The fuel oil is kept in a long-term storage close to the working site. This practice guarantees fuel oil supply in case of emergency shut down of natural gas lines. When fuel oil is stored for a long period, deterioration processes begin causing operational difficulties when the fuel oil is suddenly needed. The changes in fuel quality materialize in physical and/or chemical properties. As a result the fuel may not comply with specification requirements or become no more compatible with the stipulations of the equipment producer. The paper discusses the possible changes in pour point, water content, ash, and metal content during storage. Chemical changes in the intermolecular relationships of fuel oil, that can change viscosity and stability, are accounted for. Processes connected with fuel oil production causing change in fuel oil stability during long term storage are explained. Finally, recommendations for optimal conditions for fuel oil storage and testing are suggested.","Fuel oil; Long term storage stability; Natural gas","Chemical change; Deterioration process; Energy needs; Energy source; Environmental requirement; Equipment maintenance; Fuel oil production; Fuel quality; Gas pipes; Long-term storage; Long-term storage stability; Metal content; Oil storage; Oil supplies; Optimal conditions; Pour points; Specification requirement; Chemical properties; Gas pipelines; Gas supply; Natural gas; Stability; Fuel oils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865269714

The heat transfer model needs the convective heat transfer information given by CFD and at the same time it can also provide surface temperature as the thermal boundary condition for CFD simulations. Through this model, the heat transfer and airflow behaviors in the buildings and the surrounding environment can be investigated. In addition, the effects of different building/ground materials were analyzed through the coupled airflow and thermal model. It is found that the building/ground thermal mass and its thermal properties can have significant influences on the thermal environment around the buildings.

The high affinity of NO for Fe is a well-known branch of coordination chemistry. Apart from the formation of heme-NO complexes in guanylate cyclase, it is well-known that the cytotoxic effect of NO is, at least in part, due to its interaction with Fe in a number of proteins, including: (i) the rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis, ribonucleotide reductase; (ii) the Fe storage protein, ferritin; (iii) haem-containing proteins; (iv) the [Fe-S] cluster enzyme catalysing the final step in the haem synthesis pathway, ferrochelatase; (v) other [Fe-S] cluster proteins involved in energy metabolism such as mitochondrial aconitase and those in complex I and II of the electron transport chain; and (vi) the [Fe-S] cluster-containing molecule, iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1), that plays a role in regulating Fe homeostasis. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The exergy content of a certain amount of energy is defined as the part of this energy that can be used to produce mechanical energy. The quality of a certain amount of energy is defined as the relative exergy content of this energy. Most of our buildings with their heating and cooling systems today are built for conversion of high quality energy sources to low quality use with a huge destruction of the available exergy as a result. Globally we have a huge potential for transforming our processes to more efficient use of the exergy and also for feeding our processes directly from renewable energy sources without the use of high quality energy sources. To develop our building concepts towards a low exergy building we have to analyze all the processes for energy conversion that take place through the operation of the building, to bring down the needed level of quality for the energy used and then make a holistic analysis of the system. Different processes for energy conversion in buildings are discussed especially giving the potential for saving energy and shifting the energy use to lower quality levels, i.e. in many cases to reduce the temperature levels needed for heating and cooling. The major obstacle for an extensive and effective use of renewable energy sources is the investment needed to be able to store heating and cooling energy in time. The paper gives a system concept under evaluation were the ground under the floor slab on grade is used as heat reservoir for the building. The main advantage of the system would be lower investment cost and at the same time give possibilities more effective annual storage compared to a single borehole. The paper also exemplifies how recent finite element technology where multiple physical phenomena can be studied simultaneously can be utilsed for design of low exergy components.","Buildings; Components; Integration; Low-exergy; Modeling; System","Components; Cooling energy; Different process; Energy source; Energy systems; Energy use; Finite element technology; Floor slabs; Heat reservoirs; Heating and cooling systems; High quality; Holistic analysis; In-buildings; Investment costs; Low qualities; Low-exergy; Mechanical energies; Physical phenomena; Quality levels; Renewable energy source; Saving energy; Single boreholes; Small community; System; System components; System concepts; Temperature level; Buildings; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Exergy; Indoor air pollution; Integration; Models; Natural resources; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857350109

The chapter provides a brief introduction on the concept and its origin, the text then focuses on the ideal behavior of each basic shunt and series FACTS device. Guidelines on the synthesis of the first generation of these devices, based on thyristors, are presented, followed by the newer generations of FACTS devices based on self-commutated semiconductor switches. The switching characteristics of thyristors - controlled turn-on and natural turn-off - are appropriate for using in line-commutated converters, like in conventional HVDC transmission systems with a current source in the DC side. In this latter application, the technology for series connection of thyristors is very important due to the high-voltage characteristics of the transmission voltage. Self-commutated switches are adequate for use in converters where turn-off capability is necessary. Thyristor-based FACTS devices use line or natural commutation together with large energy storage elements (capacitors or reactors). On the other hand, devices based on self-commutating switches like GTOs, IGCTs, or IGBTs uses gate-controlled commutation.

We analyse current anthropogenic H 2 emissions, particularly from the traffic sector, and assess future emissions on regional and global scales. These today fossil-fuel based H 2 emissions need to be balanced against the emissions of a ""leaky"" H2 economy to better understand future atmospheric H2 changes. For hydrogen vehicles, diffusive leakage of gaseous H2 during storage and propulsion, in both parking and running mode, is a significant loss, and therefore its quantification is crucial for the overall loss estimates.

Thermal chillers improve their efficiency when the temperature of the focus that is feeding them is greater while the collectors are working in bad yields when the medium temperature inside them grows. This makes so important to know the optimum operational temperature for each solar system. With the use of a simulation program, TRNSYS 16, the solar cooling absorption facility situated in CARTIF Foundatiońs building placed in the continental climate of Valladolid (Spain), has been modeled. In the system configuration exists cold and heat storage tanks to make the cooling offer a little independent of the demand. Varying the parameters of the existing collectors that can be found in the market and the temperatures needed to drive the chiller, a complete revision of the possibilities has been done. Climatological data proceeding from TMY archives has been used to simulate from June to September making an estimation of the energy produced with differential controls and constant flow mass pumps.

In most cases, these power plants lack significant storage capacity; therefore the more adequate control strategy is to keep constant the water level at the intake basin to capture the maximum amount of energy from the river flow. In this paper, the control of a diversion run of river hydro plant is considered. A practical criterion for tuning the gains of the PI controller is proposed. The influence of turbine operating point on controller gains is analyzed.

The water is cooled, in the charging period, in the evaporator during periods when the air conditioning load is low. The cold water is used, during the releasing phase, to supercool the liquid from the condenser prior to throttling to the evaporator. The flow of water in and out of the storage tank is controlled by two pumps which is in turn controlled through occupancy sensor input. Two heat exchangers were used, one to supercool the refrigerant after the condenser, and the other to cool the water that will be stored inside the cold storage tank.Initial tests show an increase in the coefficient of performance of the air conditioning system, however, energy consumption is not mitigated because of additional consumption by the pumps.","Cold thermal storage; Occupancy sensors","Air conditioning load; Airconditioning systems; Coefficient of Performance; Cold thermal storage; Cold waters; Energy consumption; Occupancy sensors; Sensor inputs; Storage tank; Thermal storage system; Two-pump; Warm water; Window type air conditioner; Cold storage; Condensers (liquefiers); Energy utilization; Evaporators; Heat convection; Heat storage; Pumps; School buildings; Sensors; Supercooling; Sustainable development; Teaching; Water tanks; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78249286552

Mr. Rensvik pointed out that there are various ways in which the short-sea shipping sector can improve its competitiveness. One is by developing new vessel concepts, e.g., module-based for lower construction costs and to provide a more effective transport platform. There are energy savings to be made through improved hulls and propulsion. An important factor would be to see the ship as part of a total transport infrastructure. Not least, using natural gas as a fuel would help to increase the use of natural gas ashore. The coastal gas infrastructure would comprise LNG reception terminals and storage at strategic locations along the coastline fed by small LNG ships, probably < 10,000 cu m.

Natural gas, which consists mainly of methane, fits this definition and is widely available in many countries. One of the strategic goals of the modern automobile manufacturing industry is to replace gasoline and diesel with alternative fuels such as natural gas. In this report, we elucidate the desired characteristics of an optimal adsorbent for gas storage. The U.S. Department of Energy has outlined several requirements that adsorbents must fulfill for natural gas to become economically viable, with a key criterion being the amount adsorbed at 35 bar. We explore the adsorption characteristics of methane on an armchair carbon nanotube and contrast it with the characteristics of CF4. In this research work, adsorptions of pure methane and tetraflouro carbon on (7, 7) armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were studied. Lennard-Jones potential was used for the gas-gas and gas-carbon nanotube interactions. Potential parameters for the carbon-gas and carbon-carbon interactions were obtained from the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules. Virial equation of state was used to study the pure gas molecules.

The produced CO 2 stream can be stored in depleted oil fields or aquifers. Post-combustion carbon capture is an attractive option, since this technology can easily be implemented in existing facilities without significant modifications. However, as CO 2 capture is an energy intensive process, there is a significant efficiency penalty with the addition of the capture plant. This effect can be minimised with appropriate integration between the power plant and the CO 2 capture plants. A study by Shell on the potential benefits of various integration options on the overall efficiency of a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant and a post-combustion CO 2 capture plant system was conducted to determine the optimum integration configuration between plants. The CCGT power plant considered consists of 2 Gas Turbine's (GT) and 1 Steam Turbine (ST) with a design capacity of approximately 800MWe at a net electrical Lower Heating Value (LHV) efficiency of approximately 58%. Addition of an amine based CO 2 capture plant, including drying and compression, and designed to produce high purity CO 2 at a pressure level suitable for aquifer storage, led to a net electrical LHV efficiency reduction to approximately 45%. A number of integration options as well as their combinations were simulated using a steady state, thermodynamic cycle modeling software tool for the power plant and an in-house developed spreadsheet tool for the capture plant. The best performance achieved resulted in an overall efficiency of approximately 50%. Technology, which is readily available in the market at the time of the study, was considered throughout the evaluation.

The technology consists of specialized hydrodynamic devises that convert crude oils which can have high water cuts into homogeneous high-octane gasoline or diesel whilst not greatly degrading the octane number. The new method does not require thermal treatment and/or catalysts. As the process reaches 94-98% of product output, mazut or any other analogous heavy fuel is added prior to the sprayer/injector. The add-mixed fuels can consist of: gas/oil plus water; diesel plus water; mazut and waste products of chemical processing plus water; liquid fuel plus coal dust plus water, for just some possibilities. The specialized hydrodynamic devices can (i) create various emulsions, dispersions and suspensions; (ii) atomize liquids and include saturation with flammable/non-flammable gases (iii) resolve problems with enhancement of thermo-mass-transfer processes in multi-component, multiphase substances, and (iv) resolve the problem with utilization of heavy hydrocarbon fraction sediments in fuel storage tanks by means of mixing them with the tank fuel in required proportions.

The use of an inductive stor- age (IS) of energy with an electro-explosive opening switch (EEOS) allows charging of a pulse forming line in about 100 ns; this ensures insulation of high electri- cal strength and reduces overall dimensions and weight of the line. Optimisation of various designs that include an EEOS is usually performed by examining a large number of experimental data for RLC circuit models. We consider a theoretical RLC-circuit model of a particular device, the magnetic-flux compression gen- erator (MCG). The energy conversion in the IS circuit occurs in two stages. Initially, the energy is stored in the inductance, with a partial loss for fuse heating; this stage is simultaneously one of heating and of accumu- lation of magnetic energy. At the second stage, the fuse resistance is determined mainly by the density of expanding metal and grows by a few orders of magni- tude in a short time (explosion stage), when the mag- netic field energy of increasing power is released into the fast-rising resistance of the fuse. We discuss the MCG detonation procedure, how the energy efficiency varies with respect to inductance and the EEOS pa- rameters, and how the energy is released to the load. ©2007 IEEE.",,"Circuit models; Experimental data; Field energy; Flux compression; High voltage; High-current generator; In-vacuum; Inductive energy storage; Low-voltage pulse; Magnetic energies; Opening switch; Optimisations; Pulse forming lines; Pulse power; Pulse voltage; RLC circuit; Two stage; Circuit theory; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Explosives; Heating; High energy forming; Inductance; Microwave generation; Plasmas; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350666464

Results show that the most common inhibiting factors are: poor organizational planning; inability to identit' strategic use of ICT or no ICT leadership; no funding for ICT projects; lack of ICT expertise and lack of proper ICT usage by final users; and lack of technical support.

Nano-structured calcium silicate (NCS) is a proprietary new material comprising nano-size platelets stacked together in a unique open framework structure forming discrete particles of about 1-5 microns in size. The material has a high pore volume with a consequent high liquid absorbency of up to about 500-600 g oil. 100g -1 silicate (ASTM Oil Absorption test D281), and a high surface area of up to about 500 m2 g-1. Phase change materials (PCMs) absorb and release heat energy (latent heat) associated with the liquid-solid transition at their melting point. Alkanes (paraffin waxes) which have good latent heat properties (-160-190 J g-1) are often used, as they are non-toxic and the operating temperature (melting point) can be tuned by altering the hydrocarbon chain length. The major practical problem of containing the liquid phase on melting has been overcome here by incorporating the alkane PCM into the highly porous NCS matrix to a level of about 300 wt% of NCS (1 kg of composite comprises 250 g NCS and 750 g PCM). The resulting composite NCS-300PCM remains a powdery solid above the alkane melting point and can be readily incorporated into packaging materials to provide heat buffering properties of about 110 J g-1 of composite. The NCS-300PCM composite utilising Rubitherm RT6 alkane with a melting point of about 8°C was incorporated into a 10 mm paperboard liner and also into bubble-wrap liners placed on the inside walls of a fluted paperboard container to provide effective thermal buffering capacity for the contents of the container around this temperature. A rectangular container with dimensions 270 mm long × 200 mm wide x 180 mm high was constructed from 4 mm C-fluted paperboard and lined with six bubble wrap ""Post-It"" bags containing a total of 400 g NCS-300PCM composite spread thinly and evenly in the six bags. The NCS-300PCM composite provided effective thermal buffering capacity by maintaining the temperature inside the container at 10°C for some 5 hours after the outside temperature had increased to about 23°C The temperature/time profile on the inside wall of the NCS-300PCM liners for the empty container, was the same when the container was filled with 2 kg of asparagus, which served as a model for perishable food. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the NCS-300PCM composite in providing thermal buffering to such food produce. The extent of thermal buffering appears to be sufficient to ensure the temperature of perishable foodstuffs inside such a container remains below about 10°C during transport and temporary storage en route from the supplier to the market, thereby enabling the freshness to be maintained. Hence the use of NCS-300PCM composite phase change materials contained in bubble wrap liners is a simple way to impart effective thermal buffering capacity to a fluted paperboard container or other type of package, to ensure the contents of the container are buffered at a requisite temperature for a desirable period of time.",,"Buoyancy; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Containers; Exhibitions; Food storage; Hydrocarbons; Latent heat; Liquids; Materials properties; Melting; Melting point; Metallic matrix composites; Nanostructures; Packaging materials; Paperboard containers; Paperboards; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Pulse code modulation; Silicates; Steelmaking; Thermochemistry; Absorption tests; Buffering capacities; Buffering properties; Calcium Silicates; Composite phase; Empty containers; En routes; Food packaging; Heat energies; Heat properties; High surface areas; Hydrocarbon chain lengths; Liquid phase; New materials; Open frameworks; Operating temperatures; Paperboard packages; Perishable foodstuffs; Phase changes; Pore volumes; Practical problems; Rectangular containers; Solid transitions; Temporary storages; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58349115201

They have several advantages over conventional molten salts and thermal oils such as negligible vapor pressure, wider liquid temperature range, and higher chemical stability. In this work, a series of ionic liquids such as [Cnmim][Cl], [Cnmim][Tf2N] and [C nmim][BF4] were synthesized and characterized using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Properties such as thermal stabilities, specific heat capacities and thermal storage densities were measured and calculated. After comparing these properties, it is found that thermal stability of ionic liquids with different anions was in the order of [Tf2N]- &gt;[BF 4]- &gt;[Cl]- within the studied temperature range. The calculated sensible thermal storage densities for the studied ionic liquid sample were greater than 160 MJ/m3 at 100°C. Special consideration is given to the thermodynamic properties changes of ionic liquid samples and their phase transformation enthalpies. Their possible application in latent heat storage systems to meet the requirements of high energy density is also discussed. It is concluded that ionic liquids are promising liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids, although the present understanding of their thermoeconomic and thermohydrodynamics is insufficient to accommodate the needs of modern thermal storage design, which requires maximization in latent heat storage systems (LHS) and their minimization of convection in sensible heat storage systems (SHS).

Australia has one of the highest levels of tunnel advance per capita per annum in the world, yet the use of underground space in our cities appears difficult for our planners and politicians to comprehend, not withstanding the general availability of good quality rock and contractor expertise in Australia. However, the lack of space in our urban areas is being highlighted as our major cities expand outwards and people and businesses gravitate towards city centres. Typical potential underground space uses include car parking, self-storage and archiving facilities, water storage, underground quarrying, small industrial facilities and another layer of traffic (electric and fuel cell) and services network. Historically, blasting in high density population areas has resulted in blast vibrations and blast overpressures exceeding the limits, which in some case have been set extremely low in terms of peak particle velocity (PPV). This makes conventional blasting difficult, often requiring low charge weights per delay and associated small blast sizes and slow advance rates. However, the introduction of new technologies, such as computer aided drilling, electronic delays and low-energy explosives has made this task considerably easier. Although more expensive than conventional blasting, excavation by blasting using these products and technologies in relatively good quality ground is believed, in most cases, to be less than the cost of mechanical excavation. In this paper, the authors look at innovative trends in underground quarrying, underground commercial space and tunnelling and put forward their concept of future excavation demand, future product requirements and technical specifications to the drill and blast community.",,"Advance rates; Australia; Blast overpressures; Blast sizes; Blast vibrations; Charge weights; High densities; Industrial facilities; Innovative trends; Major cities; New technologies; Peak particle velocities; Per capita; Planning processes; Product requirements; Services networks; Technical specifications; Underground spaces; Urban areas; Water storages; Blasting; Electric batteries; Excavation; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Process engineering; Regional planning; Technology; Urban planning; Explosives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049186296

The methodology will be validated using SPICE simulations. It is shown that when dealing with receiver termination sizing, the optimal size is determined by the required voltage swing at the receiver end to guarantee valid operation under the effect of crosstalk noise.

The envelope of a bank of log Gabor filters (resembling the receptive fields of complex cells from visual cortex) is taken as a local energy measure. In our approach to the feature integration problem, across the scales of each orientation, we compute initial conspicuity maps employing the T2 Hotelling statistic, as a multivariate measure of variance, and taking by this way conspicuous points with maximum local energy. Normalizing and integrating these maps, gathering the highest values of variance, we obtain a unique final saliency measure.

There are two main forms of energy used in the factory: electricity and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). The electricity bill is made-up of two components: the total kWh used as well as a peak demand penalty. These two components will be addressed in different ways. The electricity consumption is divided into the following main categories: lighting, HVAC and production line machinery. Several energy peak-shifting and energy conservation proposals have been suggested. Some have been put in place while others are waiting to be implemented. The implementation of these methods is expected to results in a significant reduction in the factory's electricity bill. On the LPG front, the study showed that the current conditions do not favour the switch from LPG to Natural Gas (NG). The conditions needed for this switch were identified.

The pressure for land has for long been large in the Netherlands and the chance of major accidents influencing neighboring land has been strictly regulated. Part of the program is a feasibility study on introducing the concept of inherently safer solutions to undustry and local authorities. TNO executed a communication and exploration project for introducing this concept to the industry of Zeeland and other involved actors like licensing authorities and the regional fire fighting organization. Part of it was a search for examples of successful implementation of the concept. Ultimate goal of the Province is to enhance solutions directed at decreasing the most prominent hazards at source in this part of the Netherlands.

Hertzen Russian State Pedagogical University","The mechanisms of electrization and charge storage of polymer fibers (PE and PP) produced by the melt blowing technology have been studied. A physical model is proposed of the fibrous structure formation. The model is based on representations of electrostatic attraction of fibers carrying a process (technological) charge. It is possible to impart unlike charges during melt blowing to different parts of the fibers found in the viscous flow state. Interaction of unlike charges leads to two main types of fiber bonding. The first type is formed when the fibers get fused at intersection and form thereby socalled nodes. The nodes are mechanically balanced structures that undergo destruction during polymer melting, i.e. at T&gt; Tm. The other type of joints appears when the contact is formed without melting of unlikely charged parts of the fibers. These bonds break at T&lt;Tm under the action of stresses in the fibrous samples at heating. Using a mini-electrode, differences in the spectra of thermally stimulated currents (TSC) have been recorded during charge relaxation in various zones of fiber contacts. As a result of forced electrization of the fibers in the field of the negative corona discharge, an efficient surface charge density has been reached in the polymer fibrous materials, equal to 20 nC/cm2. Structural traps in the oxidized surface layer of the fibers were found to be filled by the charge carriers due to the injective and dipolar-oriented mechanisms of polarization. Fiber modification by phosphorus trichloride PCl3 elevates stability of the electret charge in the fibrous materials and results in a shift of the main relaxation TSC peak into the region of high temperatures. This fact confirms that high-energy traps have been formed, from which the charge is liberated under the temperature above the polymer melting point Tm.","Electret charge; Fiber modification; Mechanisms of polarization; Phosphoruscontaining nanostructures; Polymer fibers","Balanced structures; Charge relaxations; Charge storages; Efficient surfaces; Electrization; Electrostatic attractions; Energy traps; Fiber bondings; Fiber contacts; Fiber modification; Fiber modifications; Fibrous materials; Fibrous polymer materials; Fibrous structures; High temperatures; Melt blowing technologies; Negative coronas; Oxidized surfaces; Phosphorus trichlorides; Phosphoruscontaining nanostructures; Physical models; Polymer fibers; Structural traps; ABS resins; Charge carriers; Charge density; Data storage equipment; Electrets; Electric corona; Fibers; Fluid dynamics; Materials testing; Melting; Melting point; Phosphorus; Polarization; Polyetherimides; Polymer melts; Polymers; Thermochemistry; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349093956

However, in case of a failure, a satellite should still be able to perform as many operations as possible, by circumventing or dealing with such a failure. An important factor for the reliability of a satellite is the relation between the CDHS and the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS). If the continuity of CDHS operation is less dependent on the continuity of the power, the reliability of the overall system will increase. The CDHS design of Delfi-C3 will serve as a case study to find ways of decreasing this dependency. This paper discusses the impacts of the absence of onboard energy storage for the CDHS design and the differences in the design philosophy compared to satellites which do have an EPS with onboard energy storage. The paper shows that this new approach can be useful for all satellites, independent of the availability of energy storage. Copyright IAF/IAA.

Forecasting is considered more useful than installing more ice storage systems in Taiwan because there is currently no way to forecast air conditioning load and store enough ice to meet the next-day air conditioning load demand. Real-time load forecasting can employ time series, regression analysis, and neural network methods, but neural networks are best able to forecast load. Since neural networks can achieve very high HVAC load forecasting accuracy, this method has great potential in practical applications. The ability to forecast peak air conditioning load on the next day allows sufficient ice to be stored during off-peak times to achieve the goal of energy conservation. This study obtains parameters affecting air conditioning load from weather forecasting data. Accurate weather forecasts can adequately predict next-day weather conditions, and thus enable even more accurate air conditioning load forecasts. When weather forecasts were used as neural network input parameters in an experiment, air conditioning load forecasts achieved an accuracy of 90%.","Back propagation networks; Load forecasting; Neural networks","Air conditioning; Artificial intelligence; Energy conservation; Energy management; Forecasting; Ice; Image classification; Network protocols; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Sensor networks; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Weather forecasting; Accurate; Air conditioning loads; Applications.; Back propagation networks; HVAC loads; Ice storages; Load forecasting; Neural Network methods; Neural-network; Peak times; Practical; Time series; Weather conditions; Electric load forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949090395

It is important for its nutritional values as a source of food, for industrial purpose and pharmaceutical use. Therefore, improvement in the method of extraction is important. More shea butter will be available if the method of processing and handling can be improved. The problem of shea butter processing starts with harvesting which is usually collected after dropping from the tree to the ground. Other problems include postharvest storage because of lack of facilities for immediate parboiling after harvest. Washing, drying and cracking of the nut to recover the kernel also constitute a menace because of inadeaquate facilities. The milling and roasting of the kernel prior to butter extraction is also laborious and tedious. The extraction process which involve mixing of the milled product by trampling, cooking of the mass and scooping of the butter and clarification is cumbersome and energy sapping procedure. Consequent upon these myriad of problems for local producers and processors, research efforts are being geared towards alleviating the problems. Efforts made are hereby highlighted in Nigeria and sub-Saharan region of Africa. Suggested solutions and recommendation are hereby made. The use of hydraulic press that will press this oil out at high temperature and pressure will bring out a good result in the extraction of Shea butter.","Butter; Extraction; Kernel; Problems; Processing; Shea nut","Calcination; Canning; Clarification; Crops; Data storage equipment; Dewatering; Food preservation; Harvesting; Mixing; Presses (machine tools); American society; Bearing materials; Biological engineers; Butter; Crop harvesting; Extraction; Extraction processing; High temperature and pressure; Hydraulic presses; International conferences; Kernel; Nigeria; Nutritional values; Post-harvest storage; Problems; Processing; Research efforts; Shea nut; Sub-Saharan; Food processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049115612

The capacitance sensor based technique can be used for forage material mass determination in order to utilize obtained data for yield maps creation. A parallel plate capacitance sensor (capacitor) operating at 27 MHz frequency was designed for our measurement. The capacitor was a part of an experimental oscillating circuit. The static laboratory measurements were carried out in summer 2005 with different forage crops at different maturity stages, at different levels of moisture content and with different sample weights. Each sample was spread and placed between two capacitor plates insulated from forage by a plastic cover. Firstly, freshly mowed material was measured in the capacitor and output data recorded and consequently moisture content was determined by the standardized method. In the same way another measurements were carried out with material water content within the range which is common for real harvesting conditions (i.e. 85-40 %). The capacitor output data were further processed. It was found out during our experiments that the values did not depend on the type of material measured. However, moisture content as well as contact pressure of material placed between the plates influenced the sensor's output signal. The results showed that there is a strong relationship between the weight of material and output sensor's signal and it is possible to recommend this experimental method for further research and development.","Capacitance sensor; Forage; Precision agriculture; Yield mapping","Capacitors; Crops; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Harvesting; Maps; Moisture; Moisture determination; Offshore oil well production; Sensors; Water content; American society; Best solution; Biological engineers; Capacitance sensor; Capacitance sensors; Capacitor plates; Contact pressures; Crop harvesting; Crop yields; Durable sensors; Experimental methods; Forage; Forage crops; Forage mass; International conferences; Laboratory measurements; Mass determination; Mate rial properties; Moisture content; Output data; Output signals; Parallel plates; Precision agriculture; Primary data; Research and development; Yield mapping; Yield maps; Capacitance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049084997

However, they also introduce a new set of problems mainly due to small memories, weak processors, limited energy and small packet size. Thus only a very few conventional protocols can readily be used in sensor networks. Sensor networks can exist in many different environments, and each environment has its own unique characteristics and requirements. As an example application, a home health care system is proposed and examined in detail in this paper. We show how cryptographically weak physiological data can be used to establish keys between body sensors, where the sensors have no other prior secret. This paper also proposes a protocol where a hand held device, such as a PDA, can establish a key with the majority of sensors found in our home health care system. This is achieved without the necessity of using traditional encryption. Detailed analysis of each of the protocols is provided. The protocols were implemented in TinyOS and simulated using TOSSIM and ATEMU. Energy consumption and memory requirements are analysed and it was found that an RSA implementation of our protocols has some advantages over an ECC implementation. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Home health care; Arsenic compounds; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Hand held computers; Health; Health care; Intelligent control; Internet; Network protocols; Sensors; Smart sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349156683

The sensor forms the generic component of a microclimate Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The network is based on IEEE 802.15.4 low power wireless protocol supported by ZigBee stack. The key objective of the network is to support remote monitoring and management of large orchards. The designed sensor together with a locally developed cell modem facilitate the main components for defining a microclimate wireless sensor network that could be accessed remotely. The developed sensor takes care of the critical environmental sensing for the horticultural application needs. It also takes care of energy management and selfreplenishment. Preliminary results of the design sensor reflect good performance in coverage of large horticultural fields at a reasonably low cost. Five Sunlight hours a day would keep the sensor functional through its storage mechanism. The architecture allows for both power and location awareness. Identification of the field areas that require attention could be made through either light emission or embedded location awareness algorithm. Range of view for the frost alarm system would be in the region of 500 meters.

The standards currently in place provide minimum requirements, since they want to create a level playing field that allows analyzers from different manufacturers to give the same results. It is good idea in concept, but it also acts as double edged sword. Manufacturers design their product to comply with these standards but typically do not provide data and measurements that would allow power quality analysis to go beyond current capabilities. To follow the guidelines set out by various standards and record faults or disturbances, today's meters rely solely on event-based triggers. While this method provides engineers with some information regarding an event, it does not allow for full analysis of all power parameters leading up to an event, during an event or how the overall network recovers after an event. Further, due to limitations in memory storage, it is likely that even the data captured by such recording method(s) will not capture all of the 'true' power and energy parameters. In a majority of cases, these limitations prevent power quality phenomena from being truly solved and prevent solutions that will eliminate future recurrence. This paper will highlight genuine case studies of Power Quality troubleshooting that was not capable of solving the Power Quality problem with measurements simply taken to comply with standards. It will further show that by providing engineers with data beyond the standards, an unprecedented number of Power Quality events can not only be captured, but are definitively solved.","EN 50160; IEC 61000-4-30; Power quality analysis; Power quality troubleshooting; Standards compliance","Administrative data processing; Computer networks; Data recording; Data storage equipment; Electric measuring instruments; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Management information systems; Standards; EN 50160; IEC 61000-4-30; Power quality analysis; Power quality troubleshooting; Standards compliance; Power quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51149112065

We proposed multi-dimensional data structure to storage of the data that enable effective querying. Data from particular companies are transformed. The transformation language has been developed for this reason. For evaluation of reliability it is necessary to have data on the number and range of the examined piece of equipment. Thus it is not only the case of data on e.g. the number of failures and the mean duration of a failure of the line of the given type and the given voltage level, but also the case of data on the total range of the observed piece of equipment, i.e. here on the total length of the line of the given type and the given voltage level. The result of analysis is the determination of the failure rate and mean failure duration for particular items of equipment or for group of equipments.

Technology is moving toward a situation in which households manage their own energy generation and consumption, possibly in cooperation with each other. As a first step, in this paper a decentralized controller based on model predictive control is proposed. For an individual household using a micro combined heat and power (μCHP) plant in combination with heat and electricity storages the controller determines what the actions are that minimize the operational costs of fulfilling residential electricity and heat requirements subject to operational constraints.

The standards currently in place provide minimum requirements, since they want to create a level playing field that allows analyzers from different manufacturers to give the same results. It is good idea in concept, but it also acts as double edged sword Manufacturers design their product to comply with these standards but typically do not provide data and measurements that would allow power quality analysis to go beyond current capabilities. To follow the guidelines set out by various standards and record faults or disturbances, today's meters rely solely on event-based triggers. While this method provides engineers with some information regarding an event, it does not allow for full analysis of all power parameters leading up to an event, during an event or how the overall network recovers after an event. Further, due to limitations in memory storage, it is likely that even the data captured by such recording method(s) will not capture all of the 'true' power and energy parameters. In a majority of cases, these limitations prevent power quality phenomena from being truly solved and prevent solutions that will eliminate future recurrence. This paper will highlight case studies of Power Quality troubleshooting that was not capable of solving the Power Quality problem with measurements simply taken to comply with standards. It will further show that by providing engineers with data beyond the standards, an unprecedented number of Power Quality events can not only be captured, but are definitively solved. ©2007 IEEE.",,"Administrative data processing; Computer networks; Data recording; Data storage equipment; Electric measuring instruments; Exhibitions; Management information systems; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Standards; Electrical networks; Event-based; Playing fields; Power parameters; Power quality analysis; Power quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649083653

Most CDS-based algorithms focus on building the minimal CDS to find as many redundant nodes as possible. However, role rotation is not considered so that the dominating nodes will run out of energy much faster than the non-dominating nodes. Existing CDS-based algorithms for maximizing network lifetime rely on the up-to-date remaining energy level (REL) information within h-hop neighborhood to rotate node roles iteratively. Furthermore, global time synchronization is required to synchronize every round. The overhead on REL updating and time synchronization can lead to energy waste and packet collision. In this paper, we first propose a randomized rotation algorithm, which can totally avoid REL updating. Then, dominating node history is added as an enhancement to further extend network lifetime. Finally, we propose a broadcast-based synchronization mechanism to reduce the synchronization overhead and assist dominating node selection.

Selecting proper DC capacitor (Cdc) may keep negative-sequence current and harmonics low, and as a result, prevent overcurrents within the STATCOM. However, the capacitor value depends on the type of distortion. In this paper, we propose and develop a current control strategy based on angle control, to prevent over-currents (and trips) in the VSC during and after system faults and harmonic distortions, and to ensure the STATCOM with small Cdc to supply required reactive power.

The central element of the back-end system of the TileCal detector is the Read-Out Driver (ROD).The main components of the TileCal ROD are the Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) placed on the Processing Unit (PU) daughterboards. This paper presents a detailed description of the code developed for the DSPs. The code is divided into two different parts: the first part contains the core functionalities and the second part the reconstruction algorithms. The core acts as an operating system and controls configuration, data reception and transmission and synchronization between front-end data and the Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) information. The reconstruction algorithms implemented on the DSP are the Optimal Filtering (OF), Muon Tagging (MTag) and Missing ET calculation. The OF algorithm reconstructs the deposited energy and the arrival time of the signal for every calorimeter channel within a front-end module. This reconstructed energy is used by the MTag algorithm to tag low transverse momentum muons that may escape the ATLAS muon spectrometer Level 1 trigger whereas the Missing ET algorithm computes the total transverse energy and the projection on X and Y axis for the entire module that will be used by the Level 2 trigger system. © 2007 IEEE.","ATLAS; Digital signal processors; Optimal filtering; Read-out driver","Algorithms; Automobile drivers; Calorimeters; Calorimetry; Codes (standards); Codes (symbols); Data storage equipment; Energy management; Repair; Restoration; Signal processing; Spectrometers; Arrival time; ATLAS; ATLAS experiment; Atlas muon spectrometer; Data reception; Deposited energy; Front-end module; Level-1; On-line algorithms; Operating systems; Optimal filtering; Read-out driver; Read-out drivers; Reconstruction algorithms; TileCal; Transverse energy; Transverse momentum; Trigger systems; Digital signal processors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249142307

In the study the system power loss, the bus rms voltage, the THDv at each bus, and the capacitor site suitability are modeled as fuzzy membership functions.

The implementation of the interlock should guarantee a maximum of uninterrupted time of operation which includes the implementation of self diagnostic and repair strategies on module basis. Additional tasks include collection and temporary storage of status information of individual channels; transfer of this information to a higher level control system, but also the enactment of slow control functions. The interlock implementation is based on a 4U 19""-Crate which houses a controller and different slave modules which implement the interface to the components of the RF station. A dedicated, user defined backplane connects the controller to all slave modules. The Controller incorporates a 32-bit RISC NIOS-II processor inside a Cyclone-II FPGA device from ALTERA [6]. The program running on this processor performs all necessary control and monitoring functions to all slave modules in the crate, but not the interlock function itself. The interlock function is implemented as hardwired logic and keeps working, even if the processor stops or the program hangs up. The software performs a system-test on power-up, to test the hardware functionality and the crate configuration. On success, the interlock hardware gets configured for operation and the crate is put into the working state. After initialization higher level applications get loaded. This covers the communication interface to the control system and a diagnostic interface, which is used during installation and trouble shooting. For this purpose, LabVIEW tools are used to present information. In addition, a HTTP Server on the interlock controller provides the possibility to change configuration and view actual status information. It also implements tools which allow to reconfigure the whole FPGA design or to upload a new software version via Ethernet. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Control systems; Data storage equipment; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Health; High energy physics; Leveling (machinery); Problem solving; Program processors; Software design; Testing; Transfer functions; Back planes; Communication interfaces; Configurable; Control and monitoring; FPGA designs; FPGA devices; Hardware functionalities; Lab VIEW; Level control systems; Repair strategies; Slow control; Temporary storage; Trouble shooting; Working state; Concurrency control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249128636

Arcing faults are substantially unconstrained free-burning arcs within electrical equipment. In order to assess the hazards of arcing faults to personnel in the immediate vicinity of the fault it is necessary to understand their nature and be able to quantify the hazards. This involves an understanding of the energy dissipation and the energy transfers in the near vicinity of these uncontrolled arcs. This paper sets out to describe the physics of arcing faults and uses this to describe the energy transfers within an arcing fault. This is the basis for describing the potential energy transfers to personnel in the vicinity of an arcing fault. © 2007 Blaise Pascal Academic Press.","Absorption; Air column; Arcing fault; Diffuse column; Electrode jets; Electrode-material column; Emission; Energy transfer; Line radiation; Plasma cloud; Restricted column","Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Personnel; Absorption; Air column; Arcing fault; Arcing faults; Diffuse column; Electrical equipments; Electrode jets; Electrode-material column; Emission; Free-burning arcs; Insulation failures; International conferences; Line radiation; Plasma cloud; Poten tial energy; Restricted column; Electric fuses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249083833

This procedure may provide vital information about the operating conditions of different sub-systems and modules, including both electronic systems and sensing instruments. These systems usually measure specific parameters, like temperature, pressure etc, by using a combination of sensors, A/D and D/A converters, memory modules, small processors and other miscellaneous modules. Energy measurements performed over a specific time period of several clock cycles determine the overall energy consumption parameters during specific execution of tasks or related to specific groups of instructions.

A 2N (99%) Au bonding wire, well known for its high-reliability performance, currently has narrow process windows. It was combined with a capillary re-engineered to improve the ultrasonic energy transmission between the wire and the bonding surface and therefore, enhance bondability.

Two wire diameters, 1.0- and 0.6 mil, were used in the work to verify the effectiveness of the combined solution in both standard and ultra-fine pitch applications.

For handling node failure, previous algorithms typically prefer to have redundant nodes so the power efficiency was compromised. This paper describes a Power-CDS (P-CDS) mechanism that schedules active and backup sensor nodes in the backbone for tolerating failures.

Component models devised for embedded systems are typically restricted due to the limited computing, storage and power resources of the target systems. Most existing component models for embedded systems therefore only support a static component architecture and provide a simple and lightweight core. With the increasing demand for more feature-rich embedded systems these component architectures must be extended. In order to remain useful for the development of resource-restricted embedded systems, however, the extensions must be optional. Creating such extensions requires a cost-effective development process that can produce reusable, rather than application- specific, extensions. This necessitates a systematic approach to seamlessly integrate application specific requirements of the extension, the existing component model and the constraints of the computing environment. In this paper we propose a scenario-based architectural approach to extending the capabilities of the CAmkES component model. This approach is used to distil application specific requirements and computing constraints, summarise generic scenarios, drive the extension to the core CAmkES architecture. We illustrate our approach with a case study involving the addition of dynamic capabilities to CAmkES. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Architecture design; Component; Embedded system; Extension; Scenario","Application-specific; Application-specific requirements; Architectural approach; Architecture design; Case studies; Component; Component architectures; Component modelling; Component-based development; Computing environments; Development processes; Dynamic Capabilities; Embedded system; Extension; International conferences; Power resources; Quality of softwares; Scenario; Systematic approaches; Target systems; Architecture; Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Computer software reusability; Computer software selection and evaluation; Computer systems; Cost effectiveness; Energy policy; Integrated circuits; Software architecture; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50049091743

In this circuit structure, the proposed converter is operated in an interleaved fashion to reduce output current ripple and with a coupled inductor to increase step-up voltage ratio. As compared with the counterparts of conventional converter topologies, the proposed converter has the merits of less component count, higher efficiency, smaller size, and they are easier to implement.

The sharpness of an image depends on the focusing accuracy of the lens. This principle is utilized to find the profile of a test specimen. For a microscope with a fixed-focal length objective lens, the acquired image will reach the maximum sharpness when the relative distance between the lens and the surface point is equal to the focal length of the lens. The sharpness of an image is defined to be the sum of absolute difference of the gray scale level within the interested area. The optical profile measurement system finds the best focused position for many evenly spaced square patches in the image by moving the lens along the optical axis and acquiring image at constant intervals. In theory, the relation between the sharpness value and the relative objective distance exhibits a Gaussian function distribution. However, sharp edges, poor illumination and many other factors will deviate the distribution profile from the ideal one, and give erroneous profile information. To improve the accuracy of the profile measurement system, we propose a focus position screening algorithm which can judge the quality of the focusing information based on the sharpness function distribution. This algorithm can remove unreliable measurement points resulted from out-of-focus background, and sharp edges. These algorithms are implemented in a prototype system to measure the profile of a EIA-0603-size ceramic capacitor with a dimension less than 1 mm. The profile of the capacitor is accurately measurement to the accuracy of the objective lens' depth of field. ©2007 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Ceramic capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electronics industry; Energy storage; Functions; Imaging techniques; Industrial electronics; Lenses; Light measurement; Measurements; Microscopes; Optical instrument lenses; Optical instruments; Photography; Three dimensional; Annual conference; Constant intervals; Depth of field; Depth-of-focus; Focal lengths; Gaussian functions; Gray scaling; Measurement points; Objective lenses; Optical axes; Optical microscope; Optical-; Out-of-focus; Profile measurements; Prototype systems; Relative distances; Shape from Focus; Sharp edges; Sharpness function; Sum of absolute difference; Test specimens; Three-dimensional objects; Edge detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949103735

Accordingly passive devices need to be embedded in printed circuit boards by using High Density Interconnection (HDI) technology to fit current products. Categories of passive device include capacitors, resistors and inductors. Among which capacitors cover the largest area in all kinds of electronic products. In figure.1, for example 68% of volume of passives is contributed by capacitors in Nokia mobile phones. For this reason, capacitors should be the first one to be embedded in circuit boards. The development of embedded capacitors should be divided into three parts: Material, Manufacturing Process, and Circuitry Design. The materials of embedded capacitors must have high dielectric constant (Dk), low dissipation factor (Df) and have to be compatible with PCB manufacturing processes. PCB manufacturers should adjust their process parameters to embed capacitors smoothly and establish an electric library for designers. Eventually, designers can construct a circuitry which uses embedded passive devices from all the library data.

As more and more increasing of the functionality in I.C. development, the number of passive components accompanied with active device is extremely increasing. Due to the high speed of the microelectronic devices, capacitors need to be as close to the I.C. as possible to avoid the parasitic effects. However, the embedded technology may face some problems such as the mechanical-thermal stresses and the warpage of the package so that the poor interconnects were achieved.

The package solution enables the capacitors disposing in the substrate to minimize the circuit length, therefore the inductance and the noise interference could be reduced.

The policy emphasises the roles of information technology for the enablement and facilitation of economic and social development. One of the objectives is to develop the ability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to compete in the world market. Although there are successful cases, majority of the companies among the Thai SMEs sector are still in an early stage of utilising E-commerce technologies to reap benefits from new opportunities. Therefore, there is a need to understand, to extract and to acquire knowledge about the adoption and use of the e-commerce technologies by SMEs in Thailand. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been applied to many studies on the adoption and use of innovation and technologies. This proposed study intends to use a modified TAM named, TECTAM (Thai E-commerce Technology Acceptance Model), as a research tool and model to study e-commerce acceptance among the Thailand's SMEs sector. The predominant dimensions of this study are based on TAM perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). In terms of PU, the near-term and long-term usefulness are considered. On the other hand, the PEOU will be concerned with the social influence processes and the cognitive instrumental processes. In addition, this study will investigate how to increase the benefits from the relationship between TAM and other approaches. Finally, the study aims to apply the use of TECTAM model in terms of e-commerce technologies acceptance and how they could be used.

It is shown that the conventional three-wire DVR could not properly compensate for voltage sags containing a zero sequence component due to the lack of zero sequence current circulation path within the restorer. It is proposed that a four-wire DVR can mitigate unbalanced voltage sags with zero sequence component effectively as it provides a circulation path within the DVR for zero sequence current. However, the interaction of DC-side with AC-side in this topology leads to an unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages and it causes zero sequence resonance especially when the DVR is under open loop control. The closed-loop control can provide additional damping to mitigate possible harmonic resonance. However, the DC-link ripple voltage due to the fundamental zero sequence current cannot be avoided. This may need larger capacitors in the DC-link than that is normally required. The DC-link voltage ripple can be eliminated by introducing a fourth leg in the DVR and by controlling the DVR under closed-loop control.

The result reduces to a linearised state space model that can be readily solved, with the Fourier solution coefficients defining the state space matrix terms. The solution can be readily developed for converters of any level, and allows rapid analytical investigation of the dynamic (and static) balancing behaviour over a wide range of conditions. Furthermore, the approach allows powerful strategies such as root locus to be used to investigate the converter's performance as a function of changes in parameters such as modulation index and load.

This new device was designed and fabricated using planar processing techniques to produce a micrometer sized cylindrical shaped, well defined microdosimeter sensitive volume. Cylindrical structures were employed to allow for a better definition of the average chord length of the sensitive volume compared to the previous elongated parallelepiped solid state designs. The structures were manufactured on individual mesas situated on top of a buried oxide insulating layer. These mesa designs eliminated lateral charge diffusion. Two kinds of test structures were designed with sensitive region widths of 2 um and 10 μm. ISE TCAD modeling of the electrostatic potential and electric field profile of the cylindrical microdosimeter were carried out to obtain 3D potential and electric field profiles. The modeling found that as expected a radial electric field was established across the cylindrical shaped sensitive volume. The modeling also found it was possible to increase the reverse bias voltage to a point where internal amplification of event signals was obtained.

These Indirect x-ray detection elements are commonly used both in medical and industrial imaging applications. The aim of this work has been the evaluation of the kernel response fuction for these arrays. The kernel response fuction k(x) is the average number of photoelectrons detected in each array channel per x-ray photon impinging on the array in perpendicular direction at a distance x from the center of the element. The kernel function has an intrinsic dependence both on the radiation transport in the detector and on the scintillating light yield and its optical path and absorption. The objective of the present work is to achieve a more detailed parametrization of these devices for their simulation and optimization inside imaging systems. We have performed measurements with a commercial 1.6 mm photodiode array optically coupled to CsI(Tl) and a 0.8 mm pitch photodiode array optically coupled to two CsI(Tl) and Gadox scintillators. These devices were irradiated with a highly collimated (FWHM 0.25 mm) 50 kV tungsten target x-ray beam. Signal measurements were compared with simulation data from MANTIS (an optical and radiation transport Monte Carlo code based on PENELOPE and DETECT-II). We have been able to achieve good agreement (relative difference normalized to maximum less than 2%) between measurements and Monte Carlo. These results show that in the case of CsI(Tl), where a discrete cristal array is used, there is a significative light cross-talk between adjacent channels that reaches a 5% of maximum signal corresponding to a distance of 2.1 mm (pitch + 0.5 × crystal width). This is a consequence of a very thin backing wall between crystal elements, that tends to diminish dead areas between the detector elements. Nevertheless, although intrinsic CsI detection efficiency is almost 100% at these energies, due to the photodiode fill factor and optical transport there is a 40% signal drop when the beam impact parameter coincides with the cell array intermediate point. Thus the average efficiency of the array is actually below 84% from the kernel expresion. For the Gadox scintillation we observe a higher light dispersion that accounts for a wider kernel behaviour. As for CsI(Tl), the Gadox array exhibits an important signal loss in the intermediate array positions. The spectral sensivity of the commercial arrays were also measured. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Light emission; Luminescence; Monte Carlo methods; Optoelectronic devices; Photodiodes; Photons; Scintillation; Scintillation counters; Signal processing; Tungsten; Adjacent channels; Average numbers; Beam impacts; Cell arrays; Crystal elements; Crystal widths; Dead areas; Detection efficiencies; Detector elements; Fill factors; Imaging applications; Impact parameters; Kernel functions; Light dispersions; Monte carlo; Monte Carlo codes; Optical paths; Optical transports; Optical-; Parametrization; Penelope; Perpendicular directions; Photodiode arrays; Radiation transports; Scanning arrays; Scintillating lights; Scintillator arrays; Sensivity; Signal losses; Signal measurements; Simulation and optimizations; Simulation datums; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349140480

We characterize the trade off between the energy consumption and source to sink delay in order to extend the operation of individual sensors and hence increase the lifetime of the WSN.

Incision has resulted from the increase in transport capacity of the rivers caused by their channelization, and the concomitant decrease in sediment supply to the channels. In some of the rivers, in-stream gravel mining has additionally reduced the amount of sediment available for fluvial transport. Where the rivers had insufficient energy to destroy the river-control structures and remained laterally stable following their channelization, bed degradation has proceeded at a relatively steady rate. On the high-energy rivers, the periods of incision of the regulated channel alternated with the periods of lateral channel migration following the destruction of channelization structures. The main phase of incision of the Carpathian rivers occurred progressively later in the upstream direction, this reflecting the variation in timing of the most intense channelization works along their course, the operation of upstream-progressing bed degradation as well as the concentration of the land use changes from the second half of the century in the montane parts of the catchments. A marked increase in flood hazard to downstream reaches and a reduction in the potential of Carpathian floodplains for sediment storage have been the most important detrimental effects of the river incision manifested at the regional scale. Changes in management of the rivers are necessary to reduce their transport capacity and re-establish the conditions for water and sediment storage on the floodplains. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The paper begins by identifying that single phase multicell CSI's and Flying Capacitor Voltage Source Inverters (FCVSI) form a topological dual pair. This allows the established understanding of the natural balance process of the FCVSI intermediate capacitor voltages to suggest that the intermediate inductor currents of the CSI should also settle to their target balance values when Phase Shifted Carrier (PSC)PWM is used. This concept is confirmed by full switched simulations. Next, an analytic model is developed to explore the dynamic response and robustness of the balancing process, using a Double Fourier series representation of the converter switching signals to linearise a non-linear transient circuit model. The model is verified against simulations, and predicts that the resistance of the intermediate inductors can perturb the steady state balancing point. The model further predicts that the resistance of the inductance must be small compared to the load resistance to minimise this effect. Results obtained on a five level experimental CSI precisely match the theoretical model and hence support these conclusions. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Channel state information; Dielectric devices; Dynamic response; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Fourier analysis; Fourier series; Harmonic analysis; Information retrieval; Analytic modeling; Capacitor voltages; Circuit modeling; Current source converters; Current-Source Inverter; Double Fourier series; Flying capacitors; Inductor currents; Load resistances; Multi-cell; Non-linear; Phase shifting; Single phasing; Steady states; Switching signals; Theoretical model; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349097851

By employing a radio frequency (RF) radial dipole field kicker, particle spin directions can be rotated slowly over many turns. A model which couples three dimensional spin motion and longitudinal particle motion was constructed to describe non-equilibrium spin dynamics in high energy electron storage rings. The effects of a stochastic synchrotron radiation on the orbital motion in the accelerator synchrotron plane and its influence on the spin motion are studied. The main contributions to the spin motion, the synchrotron oscillations and the stochastic synchrotron radiation all have different influence on the spin polarization reversal. They also have different relative contributions in different regions of the parameter space. The results indicate that polarization reversal might be obtained in high energy electron storage rings with a significant noise even with relatively small strengths of a perturbing magnetic field.

These will be the highest energy collisions in a controlled environment to-date, to be provided by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN by mid 2008. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects events online in a three level trigger system in order to keep those events promising to unveil new physics at a budgeted rate of ∼200 Hz for an event size of ∼1.5 MB. This corresponds to a reduction of O(105) from the initial bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz at nominal operating conditions. This paper focuses on the data-logging system on the TDAQ side, the so-called ""Sub-Farm Output"" (SFO) system. It takes data from the Event Filter farm, which is the third level trigger, and it streams and indexes the events into different flies, according to each event's trigger path. The data flies are moved to CASTOR, the central mass storage facility at CERN. The final TDAQ data-logging system has been installed using 6 Linux PCs, holding 24 disks of 500 GB each, managed by three RAID controllers on each PC. The data-writing is managed in a controlled round-robin way among three independent filesystems associated to a distinct set of disks, managed by a distinct RAID controller. This design allows fast I/O, which together with a high speed network permits to minimize the number of SFO nodes.

Another project combining hydrocarbon production with CO2 sequestration began in the October 30, 2007, when scientists at the University of Bergen discovered CO2 storage can also offer a method of recovering methane from hydrates. Although the procedure can be used on an untouched methane hydrate zone, the technique might be used in an existing oil and gas field also.",,"Engineering research; Hydrates; Oil wells; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249110030

In this study, we continue to experimentally evaluate its performance using real tissue and a fast photoacoustic imaging system. The estimation method requires the use of gold nanorods and wash-in time-intensity analysis. In addition, shape transition of gold nanorods is induced by laser and it results in changes in the optical absorption spectrum. By monitoring temporal concentration changes of the injected gold nanorods, the time-intensity curve (TIC) is calculated and curve-fitted to estimate the mean flow velocity. The fast imaging system consisted of a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser system, an ultrasonic digital phased array system, and a custom-design photoacoustic probe. The effective frame rate of the system in this case is limited by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the laser to 15 Hz. An in vitro flow model consisted of chicken breast tissue in which a polyethylene tubing was embedded. Human blood mixed with gold nanorods was injected into the tubing by using a syringe pump. In the results, flow rates ranging from 0.125 to 2 mm/s can be measured, with an average normalized standard deviation of 31.3%. The correlation coefficient between the measured flow velocities and their linear regression fit was 0.83. Therefore, the proposed method is proven effective for relative mean velocity measurements. © 2007 IEEE.","Fast imaging; Mean flow assessment; Nanorods; Photoacoustic imaging; Time-intensity measurement","Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Blood; Concentration (process); Correlation methods; Digital image storage; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy absorption; Estimation; Flow velocity; Food processing; Gold; Hemodynamics; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Industrial management; Injection (oil wells); Lasers; Light absorption; Nanorods; Nanostructures; Neodymium; Optoelectronic devices; Photoacoustic effect; Plasmons; Pulsed laser applications; Regression analysis; Standards; Technological forecasting; Titanium carbide; Tubing; Ultrasonics; Velocity measurement; Blood flows; Chicken breast; Concentration changes; Correlation co-efficient; Estimation methods; Fast imaging; Flow estimation; Flow modelling; Frame rates; Gold nanorods; Human bloods; In-vitro; Intensity analysis; Mean flow assessment; Mean flow velocities; Mean velocities; Optical absorption spectrum; Phantom measurements; Phased arrays; Photoacoustic imaging; Polyethylene tubing; Pulse Repetition Frequency; Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers; Shape transitions; Standard deviation; Time-intensity measurement; Ultrasonic imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48149114273

Our method can firstly identify the foreground objects, and then the foreground can be replaced by painting with the background information. Specifically, the foreground objects are detected and removed by applying image segmentation based on graph cuts. Then we can paint the holes by employing a modified texture synthesis method based on texton mask. In the first step, the user could mark some pixels as ""object"" or ""back-ground"", called the ""seeds"" in the algorithm. In particular, the region penalties in our method are defined in CIELab color space, meanwhile the pairwise similarity is based on color distance in the perceptual color space. Relying on the principle of energy minimization, the segmentation process partitions an image into two sets: background and object. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both ""object"" and ""background"" can contain several isolated parts. After the ""object"" parts are removed, based on the surrounding information and background structure, we can find the matching patches from the texton mask obtained from the source image. After that, we select the best matching patch to fill the hole and blend the boundary areas to improve the final result.

The system consists of a general purpose master processor and several slave hardware accelerators. The communication between the master processor and the hardware accelerators is performed without interrupts by using piecewise-static run-time scheduling. After the data content of each macroblock has been discovered, the master processor computes a short static schedule for the accelerators. This removes the need for the accelerators to interrupt the master processor when the assigned task is finished. Therefore, context save overheads in the master processor are avoided and energy efficiency improves. The accelerators execute functions that perform block-level decoding operations (IDCT, inverse quantization etc.), which have deterministic execution times and can be scheduled statically. The task scheduling algorithm executed by the master processor is able to take into account the costs and restrictions of a shared memory with limited access capabilities and marks memory accesses separately to the schedule. The possible heterogeneity of the processing units is also taken care of. Tests show that the proposed scheme is feasible and can be used as an alternative to traditional synchronization methods. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Application specific integrated circuits; Conservation; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Efficiency; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Hardware; Image coding; Integrated circuits; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Programmable logic controllers; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Data contents; Decoding operations; Deterministic execution; Hardware accelerations; Hardware accelerators; Hardware-accelerated; International symposium; Inverse quantization; Macro block; Master processor; Memory accesses; MPEG-4 video; Processing units; Run-time; Run-time scheduling; Shared memories; Simple profile; Synchronization methods; System on Chips; System-on-chip implementations; Task-scheduling algorithms; Video decoders; Acceleration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48049095716

Hence, GPSR routing algorithm will ignore the old storage node. Our scheme can spread storage into different sensor nodes.

The life expectancy of the batteries will affect the economical development of EV that leading to the public acceptance. Conventionally, the charging and discharging processes are conducted on the whole battery strings that will experience an unbalance charging due to the distinct characteristics of each battery in the battery strings. An unbalance charging not only can seriously reduce the life expectancy of battery, it also will result in insufficient usage of electric power. In order to resolve the problem stated above, the development of a battery equalization charger becomes an important research topic. With the aid of battery equalization charger, each battery will experience a balance charging process and obtain the equally energy charging regardless the different characteristic of each battery. In this paper, an equalization charger based on positive/negative pulse technology is proposed. The positive pulse current is utilized to charge the whole battery strings and the negative pulse current will extract some energy from the battery strings that will store in the energy storage components. According to the energy distribution among the batteries, a transformer utilizes the energy from the energy storage components to redistribute the energy within the batteries that is leading to the balance charging process. The proposed equalization charger is composed of a DC-to-DC converter and a multi-winding transformer. This simple structure of proposed equalization charger comes with a simple circuitry and provides the benefit of a low cost devise. An experiment test is conducted based on the same operational conditions on battery strings with or without the equalization charger. The results show that the proposed equalization charger can achieve the effectiveness of equalized charging, provide a better charging performance, and effectively control the battery temperature. This provides an effective way to extend the life expectancy of battery strings. © 2007 IEEE.","Charge equalization; Electric motorcycle; Positive/negative pulse charger; Series connected battery strings","Automobile parts and equipment; Automobiles; DC transformers; Electric automobiles; Electric charge; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Electric windings; Energy storage; Flywheels; Transformer windings; Annual meetings; Balance (weighting); Battery equalization; Battery strings; Battery temperature; Charging (materials); Charging performance; Charging processes; Dc converters; Discharging processes; Economical development; Effectively control; Electric powers; Energy distributions; Energy storage components; Life expectancies; Low costs; Operational conditions; Public acceptance; Pulse currents; Simple structures; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849125901

Unlike traditional inverters, the integration of front-end voltage boost circuitry and inverter circuitry allows it to perform buck-boost voltage inversion. In order to form a distinct neutral potential in the corresponding voltage boost circuitry for correct B4 inverter operation, necessary modifications are derived step by step. The resulted dc networks with symmetrical placement of passive components allow complete charging and equal energy distribution between capacitors. Modulation wise, the proposed buck-boost B4 inverters can be controlled using a carefully designed carrier-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) scheme that will always ensure balanced three-phase outputs as desired, while simultaneously achieving minimal voltage stress across semiconductors. Besides the advantage of reduced active components, buck-boost B4 inverters use a little more passive components when compared with buck-boost B6 inverters, which would allow a selectable tradeoff in practice. Moreover, analysis for discontinuous conduction mode of inductor current reveals the additional voltage relationship between dc input and ac output which is beyond the expectation when continuous inductor current is assumed. These theoretical findings, together with the inverter practicality, have been confirmed in Matlab/PLECS simulations and experimentally using laboratory implemented inverter prototypes. © 2007 IEEE.","B4 inverter; Buck-boost; Voltage source inverters","Electric inverters; Energy storage; Modulation; Pulse modulation; Pulse width modulation; Reusability; Active components; Annual meetings; Buck Boost; Carrier (CO); Charging (materials); DC networks; Discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM); Equal energy; Inductor currents; Passive components; Pulse width modulation (QuadPWM); Step-by-step; Voltage boost; Voltage stressing; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849123990

But the integration of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to supply chains is difficult due to their limited technological capabilities. The objective of this work is to determine those factors affecting IT implementation among SMEs. To determine which factors of the internal context of the company (its characteristics and structure) and which of their external atmosphere (businesses environment and partners' influence) affect the adoption and/or the assimilation of technology, a survey among SMEs located in the central part of Mexico was conducted. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed determining that the external factor ""influence of clients"" only affects IT adoption, whereas all the internal factors related with the perceptions of the CEO-owner, plus a technology supporting culture and human resources, affect both adoption and assimilation. Contrary to expectations, a high CEO-owner innovation perception decreases the adoption and commitment to ITs implementation; whereas a high perception of insecurity/discomfort about electronic relations increases both adoption and assimilation of ITs. The study results allow the establishment of recommendations for the design of technology supporting plans for SMEs integration to their supply chains. © 2007 PICMET.",,"Cerium alloys; Chains; Electric energy storage; Information technology; Supply chain management; Technology; Converging technologies; Human resources; Information technology (IT) implementation; International (CO); IT adoption; Multivariate statistical analysis (MVSA); Portland; Process synchronization; Small and medium enterprises (SMEs); Supply chain integration; Technological capabilities; Supply chains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849122478

The converter combines a slow primary source and a fast storage to power a common load (e.g., an inverter). Since this type of system is gaining popularity in sustainable energy generation systems and electrical vehicles, the proposed topology is of practical interest. The proposed converter consists of three high-frequency inverter stages operating in a six-step mode, and a high-frequency three-port three-phase symmetrical transformer. The converter provides galvanic isolation and supports bidirectional power flow for all the three ports. An arbitrary power flow profile in the system can be achieved by phase shifting the three inverter stages. Thanks to the three-phase structure, the current handling capability of the circuit is larger and the ripple currents at the dc sides are much lower owing to the interleaving effect of the three-phase, and thus the VA rating of the filter capacitors is much lower.

This approach uses operational amplifiers with R-C networks to realize the notch filter, therefore it can be implemented into the existing pre-regulators with minor modification. The notch filter can be applied in both continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) pre-regulators and discontinuous-conduction- mode (DCM) preregulators.

Doing so, we extend the spin-off period of the disk drive and cut down on the DRAM capacity at the cost of (extra) flash. We study two different streaming applications: mobile multimedia players and media servers.

Such functionality requiring extended system structures including data acquisition units, real time clocks and active transmitters causes a high energy consumption of the tag and requires an on board energy store (battery).

A regulated clock signal (RCS) comes from regulating the frequency, duty cycle and amplitude of the system clock pulse which also serves as a trig pulse of a reference counter. The RCS is integrated by an Integrator to transform into the SRS which can accurately correspond with the output codes of the reference counter. With gradually increasing duty cycles according to the voltages of the SRS, the larger duty cycle the longer integration time is set up. Larger voltages from the integration of prolonged duty cycles are generated to compensate linkage currents at the capacitor. The problem of higher voltages resulting higher leakage currents at the capacitor in the Integrator can be overcome. The simulation results show that the accuracies of all ramp pieces of the SRS are within ±1/2LSB. The main advantages of the SRS for testing converters include accurate correspondence between the SRS and the reference counter and digital designs in linkage current compensation and in test response analyzers.

Instead of using orientation information like surface normals, local data distribution analysis is performed to identify the local surface property so as to guide the selection of local fitting models. We formulate the determination of the globally consistent orientation as a graph optimization problem. Local belief networks are constructed by treating the local shape functions as their nodes. The consistency of adjacent nodes linked by an edge is checked by evaluating the functions and an energy is thus defined. By minimizing the total energy over the graph, we can obtain an optimal assignment of labels indicating the orientation of each local shape function. The local inference result is propagated over the model in a front-propagation fashion to obtain the global solution.

Such atoms may be displaced due to the stress caused by high temperature, frequency and current, leading to failures. NBTI (negative bias temperature instability) is one of the most important sources of failure affecting transistors. NBTI degrades PMOS transistors whenever the voltage at the gate is negative (logic input ""0""). The main consequence is a reduction in the maximum operating frequency and an increase in the minimum supply voltage of storage structures to cope for the degradation. Many PMOS transistors affected by NBTI can be found in both combinational and storage blocks since they observe a ""0"" at their gates most of the time. This paper proposes and evaluates the design of Penelope, an NBTI-aware processor. We propose (i) generic strategies to mitigate degradation in both combinational and storage blocks, (ii) specific techniques to protect individual blocks by applying the global strategies, and (iii) a metric to assess the benefits of reduced degradation and the overheads in performance and power. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Generic strategies; Global strategies; High temperature (HT); Individual (PSS 544-7); International symposium; Logic inputs; Maximum operating frequency (Fmax); Micro architectures; Negative bias- temperature-instability (NBTI); PENELOPE; Pmos transistors; Storage structures; Supply voltages; Atomic physics; Atoms; Degradation; Energy storage; MOSFET devices; Sulfate minerals; Thermodynamic stability; Transistors; Negative temperature coefficient",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349086635

A modulation strategy that was presented previously is able to remove completely the lowfrequency voltage oscillations that appear on the neutral point for some operation conditions. However, such a modulation strategy has an important drawback; it increases significantly switching losses on the converter. The hybrid modulation proposed here combines such a modulation with sinusoidal PWM. The main characteristic of this hybrid modulation is the capacity to reduce switching losses at the cost of having some low-frequency voltage oscillations on the neutral point. The amplitude of these oscillations can be controlled thanks to the degree of mixture between the two strategies. Performance of the hybrid modulation is analyzed in this paper and compared with the original strategies. Switching losses are evaluated by simulation, and some experimental results show how the hybrid modulation performs with balancing the dc-link capacitors. ©2007 IEEE.","Double-signal pulse-width modulation (DSFWM); Hybrid modulation; Neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter; Sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SFWM)","Electric inverters; Electric network analysis; Energy storage; Frequency modulation; Motion estimation; Power electronics; DC-link capacitors; Hybrid modulation; International conferences; Low frequency (LF); Modulation strategies; Neutral point clamped (NPC) converters; Neutral points; Operation conditions; Sinusoidal PWM; Switching losses; Voltage oscillations; Modulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149112825

One is a path search protocol which finds the best path by flooding whole or part of the network with path search messages costing significant amount of energy and bandwidth. The other is a simple tree routing protocol which eliminates path search by solely following the parent-child links and, therefore, conserves energy and bandwidth but generates inferior routes. We propose a hybrid routing protocol which improves the efficiency of tree routing with minimum additional storage and computational cost. Particularly, in addition to the parent-child links, the proposed protocol also uses links to other one-hop neighbors if they are identified to be able to provide a route shorter than the tree path. The address assignment scheme of ZigBee networks Is exploited to make such identification possible. Simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed protocol. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Computational efficiency; Detectors; Hybrid sensors; Information technology; Network protocols; Network routing; Sensor networks; Sensors; Standards; Telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; address assignment; Computational costs; International symposium; One hop neighbors; Path search; simulation results; tree routing; Wireless sensors; ZigBee networks; ZigBee standard; Routing protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749147255

The last one protects the load against all types of line disturbances but it is the most expensive and the one with the lowest efficiency. On the other hand, off-line and interactive UPS have higher efficiency and lower cost, but they show an important drawback: a switching time from normal mode to stored-energy mode. As a consequence, there is a notch in the UPS output voltage during this switching time. In a previous paper [1], authors proposed a method for filling these voltage notches with a sinusoidal waveform generated by a switch-mode converter. In this one, a simplified notch filler is proposed. It consists of two capacitors charged one with positive and the other with negative voltage. If the fault occurs in the positive period, the positive charged capacitor is connected to the load. This connection is then modulated in order to obtain a sinusoidal waveform at the load. In the negative period, the other capacitor is used in the same way. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Fillers; Filling; Loads (forces); Power electronics; Turbulent flow; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Uninterruptible power systems; Applied (CO); energy modes; In order; Lower cost; mode converters; negative voltages; Normal modes; output voltages; Sinusoidal waveform; Switching time; Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS); Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS); Power supply circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449138923

These voltage drops can make battery voltage go under the specified autonomous sensors' voltage supply range leading to a runtime reduction from the ideal case. In this paper battery-capacitor hybrids are proposed to reduce voltage drops in autonomous sensors. Analytical expressions for the voltage transient behavior and runtime extension under pulsed loads have been presented. Minimal capacitor's value for a determined voltage drop has been also obtained. Experimental results were carried out using two types of loads, a pulsed resistor and a real autonomous sensor. The runtime extensions achieved were 185 % and 169 % respectively. The ideal runtime (assuming no voltage drop) is nearly achieved in both cases, so almost all energy can be extracted. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; DC generators; Dielectric devices; Drops; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Fluid mechanics; Sensors; Supply chains; Voltage control; Analytical expressions; Autonomous sensors; Battery voltages; Experimental results; High impedance; High-voltage (HV); international conferences; paper batteries; Power supplies; Pulsed-power; Run time; Sensor technologies; Transient behaviors; Two types; voltage drops; voltage supply; Detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449128206

Instead of using a separate service supply feeder, a capacitor bank is used on the dc side of the series inverters in the DVR to provide the ride-through function during voltage dips. The capacitor voltage is regulated by adjusting the relative phase shift of the inverter output with respect to the mains voltage. The control scheme is based on using the boundary control with a second-order switching surface to dictate the states of the switches. The DVR can also maintain limited voltage restoration and balancing functions. A 1.5kVA, 220V prototype has been built and tested. The transient responses of the DVR during the voltage dip have been studied. Theoretical prediction has been favorably compared with the experimental results.

The analysis here supports the design process and aims to ensure that the panels survive structural qualification testing. This analysis therefore forms part of the overall qualification process. The stiffened and honeycomb panels being considered in this document form the outer box structure of the satellite. These panels consist of the space-facing facet (SFF), solar panels including solar cells and earth facing facet (EFF). All these panels are key parts of the satellite's structure and are critical to mission safety. The separation panel is particularly highly loaded, since it supports the battery pack, reaction wheels, gyro module, magnetorquer rods and sun sensors. The separation panel also supports the solar panel assembly. The solar panels are also of critical importance, their integrity maintaining the required power supply to operate the satellite's electronic systems. As being different from the SFF and EFF, the solar panels are made of aluminum honeycomb panels. The solar panels are particularly sensitive, as they carry arrays of delicate ceramic solar cells together with their wiring. Throughout all loading conditions experienced during the mission, the solar panels must continue to support the solar cells without cell failures or wiring disconnections. The EFF is perhaps the least critical of the stiffened panels but still must support the top of the solar panel assembly and must carry various antennae.The main objective of this study is to assess the strength and vibration response properties of the stiffened and honeycomb panels by conducting static stress and modal analyses. For the case of static loading, the reliability can be estimated with great efficiency, whereas for dynamic loading the performance depends on the considered frequency range. The obtained results are very significant in that, they illustrate the feasibility of a full scale analysis for structural reliability in a design context for large-scale structures. The analyses are conducted by means of the finite element method. For the static case, the SFF and EFF are meshed with hex elements and the honeycomb panels are meshed with solid brick and shell elements. For the calculated gRMS value the static analysis had been conducted in each axis of the panel assembly. For the dynamic case, the same finite element mesh and material properties had been used. In this case, the boundary conditions are applied in such a way to determine the mode shapes and the resonance frequencies. Furthermore, the stress values had been determined with respect to the applied static and dynamic loading cases. They had been compared with the allowable stress values of the materials. In this paper the complete finite element analyses procedures are described and the results of the analyses are presented. According to the computed results, some conclusions are drawn in order to guide experimental qualification tests. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Aerospace industry; Aluminum; Boundary conditions; Boundary value problems; Cells; Direct energy conversion; Dynamic loads; Facings; Honeycomb structures; Isomers; Light metals; Loading; Loads (forces); Modal analysis; Numerical analysis; Photovoltaic cells; Process design; Process engineering; Product design; Quality assurance; Radioactive waste storage; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Resonance; Satellites; Separation; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural panels; (I ,J) conditions; Allowable stresses; Aluminum honeycomb panels; Applied (CO); Battery packs; design context; design processes; Dynamic loadings; Electronic systems (ES); Finite element (FE); Finite element analysis (FEA); Finite element meshing; frequency ranging; full scale; honeycomb panels; In order; international conferences; key parts; Large-scale structures; Loading conditions; Magnetorquer; mate rial properties; Mission safety; Mode shapes; Power supplies; Qualification processes; Qualification testing; reaction wheels; Resonance frequencies; Shell elements; Solar panels; Space technology (ST); Static and dynamic loading; static loading; Static stresses; Stiffened panels; Strength (IGC: D5/D6); Stress values; Structural qualification; Structural reliability; Sun sensors; Vibration responses; Finite element method",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449110334

It was found that the specific surface area of ceria and the doping of Zr play an important role on the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and the reactivity toward methane steam reforming. After calcination at 9000C, ceria prepared by Surfactant-assisted method (SF) was observed to have significantly higher surface area than those prepared by Templating (TP) and Precipitation (PP) methods; this material showed strong OSC and better reforming reactivity compared to others. The degree of OSC was measured by the number of hydrogen uptake from the temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The value of hydrogen uptake from the TPR of ceria prepared by SF was 2084 mmol/g, whereas those of ceria prepared by TP and PP were 1724 and 781 mmol/g, respectively. According to the reactivity toward methane steam reforming, after purging in 3 kPa methane at 900°C for 8 h, the methane conversion for ceria prepared by SF was approximately 38%, whereas those of ceria prepared by TP and PP were 22%. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"International symposium; methane steam reforming; Oxygen storage capacity (OSC); Reactivity (Chemical); Solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC); specific surfaces; Zr doping; Cells; Cerium alloys; Direct energy conversion; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas fuel purification; Methane; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Photoacoustic effect; Pneumatic control equipment; Specific surface area; Steam engineering; Storage (materials); Surfaces; Zirconium; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249088562

Besides the next parameters of working gas as: pressure, temperature, molecular mass, degree of its contamination etc., the duration of the electric energy input in working gas (duration of the current, pulse) influences on velocity and efficiency too. The changing of duration of the electric energy input by programming of capacitor storage discharge can be performed. The experiments, which were carried out, showed the next main results. The projectile velocity increases by 7-10% at the programmed discharge mode comparatively to the synchronous mode, although the energy inserted in the arc is equal for both modes. The efficiency of energy conversion from internal energy of working gas to the kinetic energy of the projectile at velocity of 2100 m/s increases from 15 to 17%. Thus, to achieve equal projectile velocity the pulsed pressure at the programmed mode would be lower than the same parameter at the synchronous mode. That is very important, for example, at launching of projectiles containing penetrators of big elongation. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Acceleration; Ballistics; Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Electric currents; Electric discharges; Electric equipment; Electroacupuncture; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fluid mechanics; Gases; Launching; Microfluidics; Pressure; Projectiles; Speed; Storage (materials); Velocity; (001) parameter; discharge modes; Electric energies; electro discharges; Electrothermal (ET); Experimental results; Internal energies; Kinetic (Polym.); Long time; Penetrators; Projectile velocities; Pulsed-power; Working gas; Energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149123174

It consists of a variable high voltage DC source, a rotating spark gap and a low inductance capacitor. The spark gap allows switching both the charging and discharging phases of the capacitor into the load. The time delay between positive and negative pulses is one half of the repetition period, which is controlled by revolutions of the rotating spark gap. The amplitude of output voltage pulses can be varied up to 35 kV with the repetition frequency up to 100 Hz. Shape of output pulse is determined by used capacitor and the load value. For typical parameters (capacitor 14 nF, average load value ∼ 100 Ω) pulses with exponential slope, rise time 40 ns and pulse duration ∼ 3 μs are generated. The potential applications of such system include in particular generation of the pulse electrical discharges in the liquid phase.

The switching frequency is continuously adjusted to minimize switching losses by ensuring virtually zero-current commutation. The inverters are based on a series-resonance topology in a half-bridge inverter with energy dosage characteristic. All modules have essentially the same resonant frequency, since the resonance is formed by the leakage inductance of the HV transformer and stable film capacitors. There are two means to regulate the output voltage. Wide-range regulation is provided by modules' commutation on/off, while fine-tuning is done by the frequency regulation. Special attention was paid in designing the system to be capable of dealing with high EMI, an outcome of the electrical pulsed discharge. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Architectural design; Capacitance; Capacitors; Computer networks; Dielectric devices; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Electric corona; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric potential; Electric power distribution; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic waves; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Fluid mechanics; Magnetism; Natural frequencies; Pollution control; Resonance; (+ mod 2N) operation; Charger systems; Control applications; Corona discharge (CD); Current commutation; DC power supplies; film capacitors; Frequency regulations; Half bridge inverters; High-voltage (HV); leakage inductances; Multi-phase; output voltages; Pulsed discharges; Pulsed-power; Pulsed-power supplies; Resonant frequencies; Switching losses; Wide-range; Control system applications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149111684

The duration and shape of current pulses produced by these generators are within a rather narrow range that is governed by the detonation rate of the strongest high explosives used in these generators. To generate current pulses having different shapes and duration over a wide load range, various arrangements and devices matching generator and load parameters are applied. To attain these ends, such arrangements and devices may use inductive coupling of the generator contour with the load contour, storage of the magnetic energy produced by MCG and its switching onto the load using breaking units of electrically exploding wires or explosive current and various plasma-erosion opening switches. The main objective of these arrangements and devices is to generate a load current pulse of the required shape, whose power would be comparable or higher than the MCG power. When using breaking units of electrically exploding copper wires (EEW), the current source power gain is rather low [1]. Therefore, to generate high power energy pulses fast MCGs should be used. Helical magnetic cumulative generators with simultaneous high explosive charge axis initiation (HSMCG) make it possible to generate power energy pulses on the loads having rather high inductance (several microhenries) with the voltage pulse amplitude of several hundred kilovolts. A short contour deformation time of these MCGs (∼10 μs) allows various generator current contour breaking units to be used efficiently for generating current pulses in the load with the rise time of 1 μs and less. This paper presents the experimental results of studies into HSMCG where the initial field was generated using an external solenoid and the flux capture scheme [2, 3].

The AC capacitor set can avoid the damage caused by the power resonance and harmonic current injection after using this hybrid reactive power compensator. Because the AC capacitor set can effectively block the DC voltage generated from the power converter to the utility, only a two-arm structure without using the split DC capacitors is required for the power converter in the three-phase three-wire distribution power system.

In [1] it has been demonstrated the superior memory performance in terms of fast program/erase speed, long data retention time and good endurance by replacing the conventional floating gate with Ge nanocrystals (nc-Ge) acting as the isolated charge traps. Among many techniques attempting to efficiently and controllably synthesize the Ge nanoclusters, the ion-beam-synthesis technique is particularly favorable because of its precise control over the density and depth distributions of the implanted ions, as well as its fully compatibility to the mainstream Si technology [2]. Although there is enormous research on the Ge-nanocrystal based NVM, there are few studies on the charging effect on the current conduction in the gate stack. As revealed by this work, the charging has a significant impact on current conduction in the gate stack and thus it may affect the NVM performance. In this work, a 30 nm of SiO2 thin film was grown on the p-type (100) Si substrate by dry oxidation at 950 °C. Subsequently, Ge ions were implanted into the SiO2 film with a low energy Ge implantation followed by a thermal annealing. Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) measurement was used to determine the depth profile of Ge ions in the SiO2 thin film. Aluminum was deposited by electron-beam evaporation to form the top and backside electrodes for the MOS structures. A Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system together with a HP 4284A LCR meter was used for the electrical measurements. The charging effect on capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics has been studied. Charging in nc-Ge leads to a shift in C-V characteristics, providing the possibility of application in memory devices. On the other hand, charging causes large modulations in I-V characteristics, which can be explained in terms of the breaking / formation of the nc-Ge tunneling paths based on the percolation concept. ©2007 IEEE.",,"Charged particles; Computer networks; Data storage equipment; Electric conductivity; Electrons; Germanium; Heat conduction; Logic gates; Microfluidics; Multitasking; Nanoclusters; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Photoacoustic effect; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor materials; Semiconductor switches; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Technology; Charge-trap (CT); Charging (materials); Charging effects; Current-conduction; Data retention time (DRT); Depth distributions; Floating gate (FG); Gate stacks; Ge nanocrystals; Germanium nanocrystals; Implanted ions; International (CO); Ion-beam-synthesis (IBS); Mainstream (MS); memory performance; Nano clusters; Nano crystals; Non-volatile memory (NVM); On current (Ion); Precise control; Si-technology; Nanostructures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949223576

Due to the low-level analog output of typical sensors, designing interface electronics that ""does no harm,"" i.e. does not impair sensor performance, is quite challenging, especially in today's mainstream CMOS technology, whose inherent precision is limited by 1/f noise and component mismatch. However, since most sensors are quite slow compared to transistors, dynamic techniques can often be used to trade speed or bandwidth for higher precision. Examples of such techniques are auto zeroing, chopping, dynamic element matching, switched-capacitor filtering and sigma-delta modulation.

The comparison of time-amplitude dependences of the radiated field for the ""bow-tie"" radiator and a modified ""diamond dipole"" with different angular dimensions has shown that the ""diamond dipole"" with angular dimension of 180° has a maximal pulse amplitude and minimal duration of afterpulse oscillations of the radiated field.

Static memories are dominating factors in the cost, the performance and the energy consumption of such systems. Deep deep submicron scaling beyond 130 nm complicates the design of SRAM circuits that make a good compromise between performance and energy consumption. This is mainly caused by leakage and technological variability. The effect of leakage and variability is amplified by the fact that large area penalties are unacceptable for cost reasons. As a consequence, novel circuit designs are needed to alleviate the additional problems introduced by advanced scaling while keeping classic scaling advantages intact. This paper gives an overview of circuit techniques that have recently been proposed to improve the position of SRAMS in the area-energy-performance design space.

From a thermodynamic perspective, they represent open systems, constantly importing and exporting energy and matter across their boundaries; the output invariably being less ordered due to irreversible internal processes (dissipation). In analogy to natural ecosystems, the uptake, transport and storage of substances in urban sites as well as their transformation can be considered equivalent to urban metabolism. Apparently inspired by progress that has been made in the study of natural ecosystems, a range of tools based on thermodynamics have recently been applied to better understand this urban metabolism and how it can be optimised. In this paper we review progress that has been made in both domains (i.e. natural and anthropogenic ecosystems). In particular, we consider applications of entropy, energy, exergy and (the quasi-thermodynamic) emergy. We attempt to qualitatively define a seemingly general dichotomy between the explanatory power of a given thermodynamic concept and its calculability. We conclude that whilst thermodynamic considerations indisputably provide a general framework for understanding cities and their evolution, further research is needed for them to become operational representations of urban metabolism and indicators of sustainability. We suggest possible pathways for achieving this.","City; Entropy; Evaluation; Open system; Sustainable development; Thermodynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449110087

A mathematical model, based on finite volume method, for a 2-Dimensional domain is developed for solving the melting problem. Transient simulation has been performed for different fin and PCM layer thicknesses, while the ratio of PCM layer to fin thickness is held constant, for different base plate temperatures. Computational results show that the phase change time and consequently heat absorption and release rate depends on thermal and geometrical parameters such as fin spacing, thickness and height.

The framework combines the advantages of SWBA and Energy-Not Served (ENS) approaches. In the paper, we use EBSWBA to assess the reliability of systems containing renewable energy sources (RES), fossil fueled sources and electricity storage. Furthermore we propose a novel technique for the calculation of EBSWBA indices, the Contingency Enumeration for Small Isolated Power Systems (CESIPS) that is derived from the Contingency Enumeration (CE) methodology. This technique also enables the formation of probability distributions of indices.

In particular, non firm access to the network has been proposed as a method to increase the penetration of DG. The impact of the connection policies arising from non firm access are investigated in detail here. The Irish system is used as a case study, and with reference to the available energy resource and network parameters, the costs and benefits of DG are determined under a number of planning policies. The costs and benefits assessed include connection and cycling costs along with emissions, capacity value and fuel bill saving. It is shown that a significant increase in the net benefits of DG is gained if the appropriate connection policy is utilised from the outset and conversely that significant costs are incurred if ad hoc policies are employed. Furthermore, it is shown that non firm access has the scope to facilitate a significant extra amount of DG capacity. © 2007 IEEE.","Costs; Dispersed storage and generation; Energy resources; Linear programming; Power distribution planning; Power system economics; Wind power generation","Economic analysis; Electric power systems; Energy resources; Linear programming; Wind power; Dispersed storage; Network parameters; Power distribution planning; Power system economics; Wind power generation; Distributed power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549123143

Matrix converters provide an all-silicon solution to the problem of converting AC power from one frequency to another, offering almost all the features required of an ideal static frequency changer. They possess many advantages compared to the conventional voltage or current source inverters. A matrix converter does not require energy storage components as a bulky capacitor or an inductance in the DC-link, and enables the bi-directional power flow between the power supply and load. The most of the contemporary modulation strategies are able to provide practically sinusoidal waveforms of the input and output currents with negligible low order harmonics, and to control the input displacement factor. Sophisticated pulse width modulation strategies in terms of various optimization criteria are known in case of indirect frequency converters, whereas both the inverter and the rectifier can be operated with pulse width modulation. The instantaneous state of both the output and the input converter waveforms depend at any time on the switch state of the converter power switches. Suitable switch states sequence of the nine matrix converter switches can be indirectly derived from the given switch states sequence of the twelve switchers of the indirect frequency converter. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Capacitors; Electric inverters; Induction motors; Pulse width modulation; All-silicon solution; Current source inverters; Matrix converter induction motor drives; Static frequency changer; Electric drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549116820

The main energy substrate for the brain under normal conditions is glucose but at the cellular level, i.e., neurons and astrocytes, lactate may play an important role as well. In addition to this the possibility exists that glycogen, which functions as a glucose storage molecule and which is only present in astrocytes, could play a role not only during aglycemia but also during normoglycemia. These issues are discussed and it is concluded that both glucose and lactate are of importance for the maintenance of normal glutamatergic and GABAergic activity. However, with regard to maintenance of an adequate capacity for glutamate transport, it appears that glucose metabolism via the glycolytic pathway plays a fundamental role. Additionally, evidence is presented to support the notion that glycogen turnover may play an important role in this context. Moreover, it should be noted that the amino acid neurotransmitters can be used as metabolic substrates. This requires pyruvate recycling, a process that is discussed as well. © Springer 2007.","Astrocyte; GABA; Glutamate; Neuron; Synapse","adenosine triphosphate; glucose; glutamic acid; glycogen; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; 4 aminobutyric acid; glucose; glutamic acid; glycogen; lactic acid derivative; article; astrocyte; cytoplasm; energy balance; excitotoxicity; GABAergic transmission; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; mitochondrial respiration; molecular mechanics; nerve cell; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; animal; energy metabolism; metabolism; physiology; review; synapse; Animals; Astrocytes; Energy Metabolism; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glucose; Glutamic Acid; Glycogen; Humans; Lactates; Neurons; Synapses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41749084451

To grasp the issues relating to the transport of CO2, it is necessary to be aware of its physical properties. For the issues relating to the transport of CO2 by ship, the most efficient way to transport CO2 is in supercritical or dense phase because it has a higher density in these states. The practice of transporting liquefied gas, such as LPG and LNG, is well established and they can be carried in fully refrigerated, semi-pressurized, or fully pressurized ships. For the issues relating to transport by pipelines, captured CO2 must be transformed to dense phase by compression above its critical point prior to transport by pipeline, which itself will be determined by the impurities present in the flow. The major sources of CO2 emissions and potential sinks in the UK to be used in EOR or simply for storage are shown. The major sources are mostly coal/gas/oil fired power stations and some large industrial concerns such as steel and cement works. Thus, in order for carbon capture and storage to perform its function as a bridging technology to a carbon neutral future in the UK, these issues must be addressed with considerable urgency if CO2 transportation is not to impose a bottleneck on its implementation.",,"Energy policy; Enhanced recovery; Greenhouse gases; Offshore oil fields; Offshore power plants; Storage (materials); Carbon capture; Carbon neutral technologies; Enhanced oil recovery; Sinks; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449136316

Raw material production in the sawmills and use of sawdust in the pellet mills are out of phase during a large part of the year and for reasons of logistics there is a need for storage of large quantities of the raw material. Long-term storage changes the sawdust and, therefore, processing parameters have to be adapted, making some knowledge of storage time or maturity necessary. An experiment on the industrial storage of pine and spruce sawdust was carried out over a period of 16 weeks. Samples were taken out every week and all samples were analysed by visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy, while some samples were analysed by GC/MS for their composition of fatty- and resin acids. The resulting data were subjected to multivariate data analysis. GC/MS data showed the difference between pine and spruce sawdust and the influence of maturity. This maturity effect could be associated with the decrease in fatty- and resin acids due to auto-oxidative reactions. The first six weeks of storage had no influence on the concentration of fatty- and resin acids. Most of the changes in the amount of fatty- and resin acids occurred in the fresh pine sawdust during weeks six to 12. Since the spruce sawdust had less initial amounts of fatty- and resin acids, the changes were less in absolute terms but the fractional changes were similar to pine. During weeks 13 to 17 the fatty- and resin acids content had stabilised and changes were marginal. Multivariate analysis of the vis-NIR data showed a major effect due to maturity associated with a colour change and also weaker effects of fatty- and resin acid differences. PLS regression was used to predict the storage time with RMSEP values between 10 and 15 days. However, since weather conditions, precipitation and seasonal variation, have a very strong influence on the rate of maturing of sawdust it will be necessary to monitor the stored sawdust to determine the degree of maturity. Because of the large flow rate human eye assessment should be replaced by frequent vis-NIR measurements. The vis-NIR spectra allow prediction of storage time and therefore maturity. © IM Publications LLP 2007.","Fatty acids; GC/MS; Moisture content; NIR spectroscopy; PCA; Pine; PLS; Resins; Spruce; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749116978

This is a serious problem because gas turbines have been used traditionally to provide electricity during the peak power demands, and the peak power demands in many areas occur on summer afternoons. An aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) was employed for cooling of the inlet air of the GT. Water from a confined aquifer was cooled in winter and was injected back into the aquifer. The stored chilled water was withdrawn in summer to cool the GT inlet air. The heated water was then injected back into the aquifer. A 20 MW GT power plant with 6 and 12 h of operation per day, along with a two-well aquifer, was considered for analysis. The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the GT performance improvement. The conventional inlet air cooling methods such as evaporative cooling, fogging and absorption refrigeration were studied and compared with the ATES system. It was shown that for 6 h of operation per day, the power output and efficiency of the GT on the warmest day of the year could be increased from 16.5 to 19.7 MW and from 31.8% to 34.2%, respectively. The performance of the ATES system was the best among the cooling methods considered on the warmest day of the year. The use of ATES is a viable option for the increase of gas turbines power output and efficiency, provided that suitable confined aquifers are available at their sites. Air cooling in ATES is not dependent on the wet-bulb temperature and therefore can be used in humid areas. This system can also be used in combined cycle power plants.

The proposed control is interesting for this application because it exhibits reduced switching losses and the output power control is linear with the switching frequency. Considering that the load is disconnected from the source during part of the switching period, with DM control. A time-domain analysis method is proposed to obtain the analytical expression of the output power, the capacitor voltage and load current. The validity of the analytical expression is checked through simulation. Finally, an experimental comparison of efficiency between traditional controls and the DM control is performed for the induction heating application.

It will commit Australia to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 108% of its baseline 1990 output.

While bus-connected systems commonly use a shared memory paradigm, NoC-based ones easily allow the exploration of distributed memory alternatives. This paper proposes a hybrid memory organization for NoC-based systems as the way to minimize the energy spent during the code transfer when task migration or dynamic task allocation needs to be performed. In our hybrid approach, the code can be transferred from the node where the task was originally running or from a memory positioned at the center of the system. The choice between the two options is done at runtime in a very intuitive way, based on the distance between the nodes involved on the transfer. Results are very encouraging and indicate that the proposed hybrid organization reduces the code transfer energy by 24% and 10% on average, as compared to global- and distributed-only memory organizations, respectively.

Dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used for the purpose of the study. A model was developed in order to describe FKM's viscoelastic behavior at various temperatures. The model was fitted to experimental data using an algorithm, which was developed for this purpose. As a result the FKM discrete relaxation spectrum at two reference temperatures was obtained, as well as the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation parameters or the activation energy equivalent. Further on, the model was applied on storage modulus and loss tangent values obtained from the experiments, during which the temperature increased linearly. It was observed that the WLF equation fits well with the results during the glass transition, while the Arrhenius-type relationship predicted too rapid decrease of the storage modulus during the glass transition.

Hundreds of tonnes of nanoparticles already enter the environment annually, but still very little is known of their interactions with biological systems. Recent studies indicate that some nanoparticles are not completely benign to biological and environmental targets. The challenge for toxicologists is to identify key factors that can be used to predict toxicity, permit targeted screening, and allow material scientists to generate new, safer nanoparticles with this structure-toxicity information in mind.

Particularly, advanced storage options such as metal hydrides and carbon nanotubes are often hinted favourable to conventional, liquid and pressurized, storage options. This study assesses the technical and economic performance of four onboard storage technologies in a well-to-wheel assessment. It does so for centralized and onsite hydrogen production scenarios with gaseous pipeline and liquid truck distributed hydrogen. Energetically, centralized production and liquefaction outperforms onsite production and liquefaction by 20% on the average primary energy input, despite the need of pipeline or over the road distribution. The gaseous handling on the filling station performs better with an average driving energy use of 0.11 MJp/km compared to 0.15 MJp/km for liquid handling. The advanced onboard storage technologies perform better by 22% than the conventional storage technologies on primary energy input in the chain. The average driving cost for gaseous and liquid onboard storage are 53% above the gasoline reference cost of 21 € ct / km and the advanced onboard storage technologies as much as 98%, almost double the reference cost. The car expenditure for a fuel cell driven car compared to an internal combustion engine driven car is for a large part responsible for this difference.

The structure, thermodynamic and electrochemical properties of these materials has been examined. The nickel addition is advantageous for the formation of Mg-Fe amorphous structures and for the improvement of the electrochemical properties of the studied alloys. With the increasing of nickel content, at first cycle, the discharge capacity of the 2Mg-Fe alloys increases first and then decreases reaching a maximum of 155 mAh g- 1 at x = 100. For all 2 Mg + Fe studied materials, MA with nickel effectively reduced the degradation rate of the studied electrodes.

Copper and palladium layers were produced by the reduction of CuSO4 and PdCl2 salts, respectively. The physical properties of the base alloys, Mg50Ni50 and Mg50 Ni50 + 10 wt % of Ti or Pt, before and after the deposition process of Pd and Cu were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ni K-edge. For all alloys, XRD and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results have shown the presence of a predominant amorphous structure. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) results showed that the introduction of Ti and Pt did not affect the electronic properties of the Ni atoms in the alloys and that the Ni atoms are appreciably oxidized during the electroless deposition of Cu and Pd. On the other hand, for electrochemically Cu- and Pd-coated Mg50Ni50 alloys there are only minor changes in the electronic properties of the Ni atoms. In all cases, it is observed that the introduction of Pt and/or the Pd electrochemical coating of the particle surface improves the cycling stability of the alloys. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Amorphous materials; Ball milling; Cycle life; Metal hydride battery; Surface treatment","Additives; Amorphous materials; Ball milling; Surface treatment; Cycle life; Metal hydride battery; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549023544

There were substantially higher concentrations of WSC and N in the stubble compared with the roots following defoliation, confirming the stubble as the primary site for energy storage, with roots playing a lesser role. However, high R2 values for the relationships between WSC concentration in roots and regrowth variables suggested that plants of prairie grass were reliant on WSC reserves from the roots in addition to the stubble to meet the energy requirements of plants until adequate photosynthetic tissue had been produced. The sequence of priority for allocation of WSC reserves followed the order of leaf growth, root growth and tillering during the regrowth period.

Therefore, biogas plants without heating system work only in warmer regions for the whole year. In regions with extreme temperature variations, for instance in Turkey, the biogas plant should be built with heating system. One of the methods is to use solar energy to increase the reactor temperature. In this study, solar heated biogas plants were reviewed. Furthermore, the optimization of insulation thicknesses and solar energy systems for 5 m3 biogas reactor were carried out for two different cities for three different climatic zones in Turkey. Based on the obtained results, the ratio of annually produced biogas used for reactor heating was calculated for each city, with and without solar heating system. Obtained results indicate that the biogas consumption for reactor heating is decreased by approximately 19% for average of six cities when solar heating system is used.

From the thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium point of view, the reduction of magnetite by hydrogen, CO, CH4 and a model syngas (mixtures CO + H2 or H2 + CO + CO2) and oxidation of iron by steam has been studied. Attention was concentrated not only on convenient conditions for reduction of Fe3O4 to iron at temperatures 400-800 K but also on the possible formation of undesired soot, Fe3C and iron carbonate as precursors for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formation in the steam oxidation step. Reduction of magnetite at low temperatures requires a relatively high H2/H2O ratio, increasing with decreasing temperature. Reduction of iron oxide by CO is complicated by soot and Fe3C formation. At lower temperatures and higher CO2 concentrations in the reducing gas, the possibility of FeCO3 formation must be taken into account. The purity of the hydrogen produced depends on the amount of soot, Fe3C and FeCO3 in the iron after the reduction step. Magnetite reduction is the more difficult stage in the looping process. Pressurized conditions during the reduction step will enhance formation of soot and carbon containing iron compounds. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The dependence of electret surface potential on electret storage pressures after charging was investigated for four groups of experiments. As pressure was reduced from 1000 mbar to 0.1 mbar a sharp decay of surface potential was observed. The results obtained show that the main parameter determining the start of surface potential sharp decay is the pressure to initial surface potential ratio.

The production of dormant eggs is induced by stimuli associated with deteriorating growth conditions, and enable Daphnia populations to survive temporarily harsh environmental conditions. Dormant eggs are expected to have developed special biochemical adaptations to bridge this long unfavourable period, but little comparative biochemical data are available for dormant and subitaneous eggs. We compared levels of the following molecules between subitaneous and dormant eggs: (a) triglycerides, which are the most abundant energy storage molecules in Daphnia, (b) glycerol, a cryoprotectant also involved in energy storage, and (c) the heat shock protein Hsp60, a molecular chaperone that may assist in maintaining protein structural integrity and inhibiting cell metabolism during diapause. Unexpectedly, no difference in triglycerides content between egg types was found. As expected, dormant eggs contained more glycerol and relatively more Hsp60 than subitaneous eggs. The biochemical composition of dormant eggs can therefore be seen as an adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions these eggs encounter. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cladocera; Diapause; Heat shock protein; Hsp60","Energy storage; Environmental impact; Glycerol; Growth kinetics; Metabolism; Proteins; Cladocera; Daphnia; Heat shock protein; Biodiversity; adaptation; crustacean; diapause; environmental conditions; protein; Cladocera; Daphnia; Daphnia magna",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448931174

It is in the national interest of Kuwait to decelerate the continuous increase of peak electric power demand. One way to do this is to install for new complexes or high-rise apartments buildings distributed utilities (isolated small power plants), mainly for air conditioning A/C systems. Fuel cells are among the alternatives considered for distributed utilities. This paper discusses the use of commercially available phosphoric acid fuel cell PAFC, known as ONSI P25 to operate air conditioning systems for big buildings in Kuwait. The proposed fuel cell, which is usually delivered with built-in heat exchanger for hot water, is operated by natural gas and uses a propylene glycol-water loop to recover thermal energy. The PAFC has 200 kW nominal electric power capacity, and produces thermal energy of 105 kW thermal energy at 120 °C, and 100 kW at 60 °C. The performance characteristics for the proposed fuel cell are very well documented. In the present study, it is suggested that the fuel cell operates combined mechanical vapor compression and absorption water chillers to utilize the fuel cell full output of electric power and waste heat. Also, to meet the required A/C cooling capacity system by the limited fuel cell power output, it is proposed to use cold storage technique. This allows fuel cell power output to supply the needed energy for average as well as peak A/C system capacity. © 2006.","Absorption water chillers; Air conditioning systems; Air cooled MVC; Cooling load; Mechanical vapor compression MVC; Natural gas; Phosphoric acid fuel cell; Water cooled MVC","Electric loads; Electric power generation; Natural gas; Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC); Water absorption; Absorption water chillers; Air conditioning systems; Air cooled MVC; Cooling load; Mechanical vapor compression (MVC); Water cooled MVC; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548097843

But, while such places are characterized by harsh thermal extremes, they also present unique opportunities for microclimatic enhancement. This potential has motivated a series of studies in the and Negev region of Israel, beginning with a measurement campaign showing that a dense urban fabric can provide significant thermal benefits due to protection from solar radiation, which is dominant within the overall energy exchange. To generalize these findings, an innovative modelling approach - using an open-air, scaled urban array - was used to study variations in urban geometry under realistic radiative loading and boundary-layer turbulence. The surface energy budget above this small-scale urban canopy was found to be similar to observed energy exchange patterns of actual cities. Measurements within the scaled urban canyons served as input to a pedestrian-centred energy exchange model, and a semi-empirical model was also developed for predicting pedestrian energy exchange and thermal discomfort as a function of urban attributes and meteorological data for a given land-use area. This integrated modelling approach revealed that increased urban density, while serving to increase radiative trapping and storage of heat within the urban fabric, also reduces pedestrian thermal stress during the critical daytime hours. This 'cool island' effect is enabled by the high thermal inertia of the built-up area, and the sharp diurnal fluctuations that are peculiar to a hot-arid climate. Its impact is contingent, however, upon the orientation of the street canyon in question - increasing as street-axis orientation approaches north-south and becoming negligible in the east-west direction.

The total number of (sub)tropical urban climate studies, however; is still small (<20% of all urban climate studies). The available work is further biased towards descriptive studies rather than process work that seeks to indicate the physical climatology of (sub)tropical cities. The available results allow for a preliminary comparison with data from temperate latitudes. Urban heat island (UHI) intensities are generally lower compared to those of temperate cities with comparable population and show a seasonal variation with lower (higher) intensities during the wet (dry) season. (Sub)tropical population-based relations may exist but insufficient appropriate data is available to confirm a logarithmic relationship or systematic differences between different climate types. The (sub)tropical energy balance studies are biased towards dry, clear sky conditions. The amount of net radiation dissipated by sensible heat during daytime is about 40% which is similar to values observed in (sub)urban areas of cities located in temperate climates. Energy partitioning is modulated by water availability and higher percentage of vegetation promotes latent heat flux at the expense of surface heat storage. The apparent strong influence of vegetation and water availability on the energy partitioning irrespective of the climate type, suggests vegetation to be an effective means to reduce heat storage uptake during daytime and hence has the potential to effectively mitigate the nocturnal heat island. it is important to ensure that the rapidly expanding cities of the developing world incorporate climatological concerns in their design to provide a better living and working environment for a large segment of the world's inhabitants.

Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands","Maintenance of a tight coupling between energy production and consumption of energy-metabolites in different cellular locales, i.e., energy homeostasis regulation, is crucial for proper functioning and viability control of every cell. Balance in global and local concentrations of ATP, the key energy metabolite of life, is hereto essential. A better understanding of how cellular energetics-and in particular, the aspect of compartmentalization-is regulated is therefore relevant for health and disease. Reversible exchange of high-energy phosphoryl groups between ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) in the creatine kinase (CK) circuit is a mechanism of the physiological regulation of storage and adequate compartmentalization of cellular energy. The CK-PCr system is particularly important in contractile cells and in cell types with high cell shape plasticity, such as muscle or brain cells. Energy requirements in brain are special because both neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) are highly dynamic, with elaborate peripheral processes that form distinct locales in the cell. During development as well as in adulthood, brain cells have to invest a high percentage of their ATP not only for ""normal"" maintenance of housekeeping functions but also for fuelling of molecular transport, intracellular communication, actomyosin-based dynamics during synaptogenesis, and continuous dendritic spine or glial endfeet remodeling. In addition, neurons and glial cells have to invest high and sudden amounts of ATP for fuelling of Ca2Th-and NaTh/KTh-ATPases involved in electrogenic or ion homeostasis activity and for neurotransmitter cycling or neuroendocrine signaling. In the brain of mammals, the various creatine kinase enzymes that are coupled to these energy needs are expressed differently but generally consist of the dimeric brain-type creatine kinase (B-CK), distributed mainly throughout the cytosol, and the octameric/dimeric ubiquitous creatine kinase (UbCKmit) isoform, located in the mitochondria. B-CK is found throughout the brain but generally occurs at higher levels in glial cells than in neuronal cell types. UbCKmit expression is also widespread and is correlated to mitochondrial activity, mainly in neurons. Here we give an overview of studies into the biological significance of the CK system in the CNS. By using gene knockout in embryonic stem cells, we have generated mouse strains that carry null mutations for either B-CK (B-CK= mice) or UbCKmit (UbCKmit= mice) or for both enzymes (CK= mice). For phenotyping of brain functions in these mice, histo-anatomical analyses and biophysical approaches with MR spectroscopy or MR imaging were used. Neurobehavioral approaches for monitoring of brain functions also were employed. For this purpose, a battery of different behavioral and learning paradigms was developed and used to study the relationship between phosphocreatine-creatine energetics and task performance. Tests used included habituation behavior and spatial learning tests, which specifically address hippocampal-based brain functions, as well as the acoustic startle reflex challenge, which probes the auditory brainstem circuit. In addition, the response to seizure induction and other integral physiological features, including body temperature control, were monitored. Mice with complete CK deficiency (CK=) were studied most intensely. CK= mice appeared viable; however, their growth and development was affected, resulting in an overall smaller body posture. Furthermore, the complete lack of CK in the brains of these animals severely impaired spatial learning and was coupled to abnormal startle responses and hearing problems. In contrast, the visual and motor functions, exploration behavior, and anxiety-related responses were not changed in CK= mice, suggesting no global deficit in sensorimotor function or motivation. Various effects on behavior were consistent with underlying anatomical changes in the hippocampus. Others can best be explained by loss of functional integrity that may have occurred in development. Parallel to the anatomical and behavioral abnormalities, CK= mice also had problems with thermoregulation, presumably due to an altered hypothalamic thermostat. Furthermore, their response to chemical seizure induction appeared suppressed. When combined, our findings suggest that the lack of creatine kinase isoforms renders the synaptic circuitry in brain less efficient for coping with (sudden) changes in sensory or cognitive activity or for handling of intrinsic and extrinsic signals that affect whole-body physiology. Metabolic changes and cellular changes due to (signaling to) altered growth and pruning in development or turnover of synaptic spines during adulthood may have an important role, but further research is needed to couple CK function at the molecular and cellular levels to events at the system level. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In most cases, updating older heating systems to more efficient units in addition to the use of double layer glazing, insulation materials, and energy curtains significantly reduces fuel consumption. Insulating greenhouses must not conflict with the need for high light transmission through the structure. Since solar radiation loads often significantly exceed the instantaneous heat requirement of a greenhouse, many ideas have been proposed to capture this excess heat and store it for later greenhouse heating. Heat pumps are promising for use in an integrated cooling and heating system. In the study described in this paper, a simple spreadsheet approach was used to evaluate the performance of a system utilizing a heat pump and water storage. The evaluation bases its calculations on historic hourly weather data to determine hourly cooling and heating rates and storage status. The calculations allow for evaluations of the appropriate size of the heat pump, storage device, and heat exchangers. The calculations are used to investigate storage capacities that are sized for one to a few days harvest of surplus heat from the greenhouse for a range of percentages of peak cooling requirement. The model includes the option of utilizing a geothermal source for the heat pump to charge the storage during periods when greenhouse cooling is not required. The first study presented examines the impact of increasing thermal storage capacity on heat utilization from a generic co-generation system. The second considers a specific, natural gas fired, fuel cell system for various sizes of greenhouse at two different locations and includes the utilization of CO2 from the reformer section. The heat pump study looks at the relationships between capacities of the heat pump and storage for two different locations. Provided hourly weather data are available for other sites, the spreadsheet approach can be used for other locations across the world.","Alternative energy; Co-generation; Fuel cell; Simulation; Spreadsheet; Weather data","Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Fuel consumption; Heat pump systems; Light transmission; Alternative energy; Greenhouse heating; Spreadsheet; Weather data; Greenhouses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649027799

Today our critical source of energy is petroleum, and the world's growing population will soon exhaust our petroleum reserves. Some energy conserving measures have been successful, but not widely accepted. Petroleum resources can be conserved by generating solar power 24 hours a day in a geosynchronous-orbit satellite and delivering it through a microwave beam to an Earth-surface receiving station for distribution to users. In 1977 the United States was paying $45 billion a year for imported petroleum that supplied 23% of the nation's consumed energy. The cost of this imported petroleum motivated a system analysis and preliminary design of a solar power satellite in geosynchronous orbit that could deliver 10,000 megawatts of continuous power to an earth-surface receiving station. The analysis revealed that an overwhelming cost item would have been the propellants consumed in the fleet of rocket ships that would lift the 909,713 metric tons of the solar-power satellite's components 35,768 km into geosynchronous orbit. The recently developed carbon-based nanotechnology cable would eliminate that need for these rocket ships. This cable can carry over 40 times the load that a steel cable having the same weight can carry. It could be looped over a pulley on a satellite that is placed above the solar-power satellite's synchronous orbit location. An earth-surface winch could then hoist the components to the satellite's geosynchronous location where they would be assembled into the geosynchronous solar-power plant. Boeing has just announced the development of a 40% efficient silicon solar cell. Using these cells would cut the size of a 10-gigawatt solar array into half the size of a solar array in which power is generated with the best previously available solar cells.",,"Electric energy storage; Hydroelectric power plants; Nanotechnology; Receiving antennas; Solar cells; Solar energy; Earth-surface receiving station; Geosynchronous orbit; Petroleum reserves; Rocket ships; Orbiting solar power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35648977536

This review discusses new findings that may explain how gut microbiota can be involved in the control of energy and metabolic homeostasis.

Gut microbiota could now be considered a 'microbial organ' placed within a host organ. Recent data suggest that the modulation of gut microbiota affects host metabolism and has an impact on energy storage. Several mechanisms are proposed that link events occurring in the colon and the regulation of energy metabolism. SUMMARY: Gut microflora may play an even more important role in maintaining human health than previously thought. The literature provides new evidence that the increased prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes cannot be attributed solely to changes in the human genome, nutritional habits, or reduction of physical activity in our daily lives. One must also consider this important new environmental factor, namely gut microbiota. Scientists may take into consideration a key question: could we manipulate the microbiotic environment to treat or prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes? This opens up a new area in nutrition research. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Energy metabolism; Gut microflora; Lipopolysaccharide; Microbiota; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","colon; daily life activity; diet; energy balance; energy metabolism; environmental factor; feeding behavior; health status; homeostasis; host pathogen interaction; human; human genome; intestine flora; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; review; scientist; Bacterial Physiology; Diet; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Intestines; Probiotics; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349018683

Here, we first introduce the principles of storage rings and electron cooling. A whole class of experiments exploits the cold electron beams available in the electron coolers and electron targets of storage rings. The recombination experiments have applications in fusion and astrophysical plasmas. Dielectronic resonances at meV to eV energies are measured with a resolution and absolute accuracy to much below a meV. The measurements of these resonances provide a serious challenge to theories for describing correlation, relativistic, quantum electrodynamical effects, and isotope shifts in highly ionized ions. Experiments with internal targets in storage rings use the high luminosity of cooled MeV ions for collisions. First measurements demonstrate the resolution with a He RIMS apparatus (He gas-jet Target for Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy) in Thomas-like electron-transfer processes by protons.

Adipocytokines are biologically active substances produced by adipocyte with different physiological functions. These substances have multiple effects on several tissues acting on the intermediate and energy metabolism. For these reasons, attention has recently been focused on the possible relationship between adipocytokines, thyroid status, and thyroid dysfunction. Leptin, a signal of satiety to the brain and regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism, reflects the amount of fat storage and is considered as a pro-inflammatory adipocytokine. Adiponectin is inversely related to the degree of adiposity, increases insulin sensitivity, and may have antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Resistin impairs glucose homeostasis and insulin action in mice but not in humans. Resistin might be considered a pro-inflammatory adipocytokine and participate in obesity-associated inflammation. Several reports indicate that leptin regulates thyroid function at hypothalamic-hypophyseal level and, conversely, thyroid hormones might control leptin metabolism at least in some animals studies. Both adiponectin and thyroid hormones share some physiological actions as reduction of body fat by increasing thermogenesis and lipid oxidation. Resistin also seems to be regulated by thyroid hormones, at least in rats. Thyroid dysfunction does not significantly affect serum leptin concentrations. Serum levels of adiponectin are no influenced by thyroid hypofunction; however, hyperthyroidism is associated with normal or elevated adiponectin levels. Finally, discordant results in resistin levels in thyroid dysfunction have been reported in humans. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme will fund ≤ 100% of the carbon capture and storage unit of the first full-scale coal-fired power plant in the UK to be fitted with CCS. The government hopes to find cost-effective ways of using fossil fuels more cleanly, and meet the challenges of climate change and energy security. The government will consider a phased approach to the project as long as the full CCS chain is demonstrated by 2014, and the project captures around 90% of the CO2 emitted by the equivalent 300 Mw generating capacity as soon as possible thereafter. RWE Npower is already positioning itself to benefit from the government's position. The company revealed plans to build a 1 Mw post-combustion CCS pilot plant at the Aberthaw power plant, South Wales, which it will bring onstream in 2010.

In order to be able to avoid the occurrence of visually inconsistent results, we pose all of the above image-editing tasks in the form of a discrete global optimization problem. The objective function of this problem is always well-defined, and corresponds to the energy of a discrete Markov random field (MRF). For efficiently optimizing this MRF, a novel optimization scheme, called priority belief propagation (BP), is then proposed, which carries two very important extensions over the standard BP algorithm: ""priority-based message scheduling""and ""dynamic label pruning.""These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP, which is caused by the huge number of labels associated with our MRF. Moreover, both of our extensions are generic, since they do not rely on the use of domain-specific prior knowledge. They can, therefore, be applied to any MRF, i.e., to a very wide class of problems in image processing and computer vision, thus managing to resolve what is currently considered as one major limitation of the BP algorithm: its inefficiency in handling MRFs with very large discrete state spaces. Experimental results on a wide variety of input images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our image-completion framework for tasks such as object removal, texture synthesis, text removal, and image inpainting. © 2007 IEEE.","Belief propagation (BP); Image completion; Markov random fields (MRFs); Optimization; Texture synthesis","Algorithms; Global optimization; Image enhancement; Markov processes; Dynamic pruning; Image completion; Image inpainting; Markov random fields (MRFs); Texture synthesis; Image processing; algorithm; article; artifact; artificial intelligence; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artifacts; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36349027673

The antiobesity and hypolipidemic effects of black tea have attracted increasing interest, but the mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain unclear. In the present study, the black tea major component theaflavins were assessed for their hepatic lipid-lowering potential when administered in fatty acid overload conditions both in cell culture and in an animal experimental model. We found that theaflavins significantly reduced lipid accumulation, suppressed fatty acid synthesis, and stimulated fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, theaflavins also inhibited acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase activities by stimulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through the LKB1 and reactive oxygen species pathways.

These tissues take creatine from the plasma via a 2Na+/1Cl-/1creatine cotransporter (CRT). We have previously demonstrated that renal apical membrane presents a 2Na+/1Cl-/1creatine cotransport activity. The goal of this study was to determine whether this transporter is ontogenically regulated. Na+/Cl-/creatine transport activity was evaluated by measuring [14C]-creatine uptake into renal brush-border membrane vesicles. CRT mRNA expression was measured by Northern and real-time PCR assays. E20 foetuses, newborn, suckling, weaning and adult (2- and 8-month-old) Wistar rats were used. The results revealed that neither the vesicular volume, the binding of creatine to the brush-border membrane vesicles, nor the purity of the brush-border membrane vesicle preparations was affected by maturation. Fetal and neonatal kidneys contained a creatine transporter that was qualitatively indistinguishable from that in the adult: it was concentrative, Na+- and Cl--dependent, electrogenic and inhibited by guanidinopropionic acid. Maturation increased this transport activity by increasing the maximal rate of transport (Vmax) without significantly changing the apparent Km. Northern analysis revealed two transcripts for CRT of 2.7 kb and 4.2 kb in all the ages tested. Northern and real-time PCR assays showed that, as seen with NaCl-dependent creatine transport activity, maturation increased CRT mRNA expression. This study reports for the first time that: (i) an apical renal Na+/Cl-/creatine cotransporter is already active in rat foetuses and (ii) development regulates Na+/Cl-/creatine cotransport activity by increasing the density and/or turnover of the transporters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of Spain, it can more than double in the next 4 years, reaching a 20 GW level. To become competitive in a liberalized market, wind energy reliability requirements should be guaranteed, so storage systems are being considered to avoid the impact of the lack of adequate winds on the electricity generation process. This paper, assuming different scenarios for the electricity markets and the wind farm operation, analyzes the minimum requirements on energy efficiency of a storage system based on the use of hydrogen as energy vector to become economically competitive for each of those scenarios. Simulation of a wind park with such a buffer system for different operation scenarios shows a direct dependence of the economical profit on the energy efficiency of this hydrogen backup system. A direct conclusion of the study is the necessity for an improvement of the currently available values of the efficiency of the subsystems that compose the hydrogen buffer.

For this purpose, borax (Na2 B4 O7) is sintered with quartz powder (SiO2) to obtain borosilicate glass then heated with metallic sodium (Na) under high hydrogen pressure. Furthermore, a study of the hydrogenation characteristics of borosilicate glass has been made using change in hydrogen pressure drop as function of reaction time in the process.

Throughout life, the total amount of body fat exhibits some oscillations. Typically, there are three specific periods in which there are notable increases in fat mass, specifically early in life, during pregnancy and lactation, and with ageing. The existence of the first two peaks in fat mass has been interpreted, from an evolutionary point of view, as a beneficial manoeuvre to protect against the scarcity of energy to the offspring of the species. Nevertheless, the role of increasing body fat with ageing is more dubious. However, recent evidence suggests that the gain in adiposity in senescence may also be interpreted in the same evolutionary context. The aim of this review is to focus on the age-related changes in fat depots. In addition, an evolutionary explanation to the observed changes has been emphasized. © 2007 The Author.","Ageing; Energy allocation; Evolutionary theories; Fat","adaptation; adipose tissue; aging; body fat; body fat distribution; evolution; first trimester pregnancy; hormonal regulation; human; intraabdominal fat; lactation; lipid storage; perinatal development; postmenopause; premenopause; reproduction; review; second trimester pregnancy; stress; third trimester pregnancy; weight fluctuation; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Body Composition; Child; Child, Preschool; Evolution; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Requirements; Pregnancy; Reproduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448958524

I also quantified how long they were able to hibernate without access to food before their body fat stores were depleted. Pygmy-possums exhibited a prolonged hibernation season lasting on average for 310 days. The longest hibernation season in one individual lasted for 367 days. For much of this time, despite periodic arousals after torpor bouts of ∼12.5 days, energy expenditure was reduced to only ∼2.5% of that predicted for active individuals. These observations represent the first report on body-fat-fuelled hibernation of up to an entire year and provide new evidence that prolonged hibernation is not restricted to placental mammals living in the cold. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Australian mammal; Energy expenditure; Fat storage; Prolonged hibernation; Unpredictable climate","fat reserve; food availability; hibernation; marsupial; temperature effect; winter; animal experiment; article; body fat; Cercartetus nanus; cold; controlled study; energy expenditure; food intake; hibernation; lipid storage; mammal; marsupial; nonhuman; placental mammals; winter; Animals; Australia; Body Weight; Hibernation; Opossums; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Burramyidae; Cercartetus nanus; Eutheria; Mammalia; Metatheria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948860118

Because conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) can increase lean body mass, enhance feed efficiency, and modulate lipid metabolism, this study investigated the effects of CLA at two levels of dietary fat on energy efficiency, nitrogen retention, and plasmatic and hepatic lipid levels in rats during dietary protein repletion. Methods: The animals were subjected to a moderate protein restriction for 14 d. After that, they were fed a protein repletion diet for 30 d, supplemented or not with CLA at recommended and high-fat levels. Energy efficiency, nitrogen balance, and nutritional parameters in serum and tissues were evaluated. Results: Protein repletion improved most of the nutritional parameters evaluated independently of CLA supplementation at both fat levels. At recommended fat levels, CLA did not have any effect. At high-fat levels, energy efficiency increased more than 20% by fat accumulation in carcasses and epididymal pads, serum cholesterol increased (two-fold), and liver triacylglycerol accumulation remained elevated. However, at high-fat levels, CLA prevented lipid accumulation in liver and adipose tissue. Conclusion: Protein repletion improved the nutritional status of protein-restricted rats with minor effects of CLA at both dietary fat levels. However, when high-fat diets were given, CLA-enriched oil showed preventive effects on liver and adipose tissue lipid accumulation and no deleterious effects were observed. Because there are no studies dealing with CLA effects on protein repletion, this experimental model could improve nutritional interventions to overcome the protein-deficit stage. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, hydrogen is regenerative and environmentally friendly. Hence, hydrogen storage is very important for humans. Hydrogen storage in metal hydrides is considered as one of the most attractive methods. In the present work, the hydrogen absorption-desorption behavior of the boron compounds has been compared. We present recent developments in the search for hydrogen-storage capacity of boron. Boron compounds have a very high energy density, much better than that of liquid hydrogen and also a lot safer. LiBH4 is a complex hydride that consists of 18 mass% of hydrogen. It has stability compared with other chemical hydrides and an easy conversion to H2. Thus, there are a good many reasons that hydrogen-storage materials for LiBH4 will be used in the future at many ranges for power sources. The future warrants further investigations of the B-H system from the viewpoint of hydrogen energy storage.","Boron; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lithium boron hydride","Absorption; Chemical stability; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds; Chemical fuels; Lithium boron hydride; Metal hydrides; Boron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848928082

The standard design that consists of a number of identical pumps operating in parallel is examined in comparison with two other configurations, using one variable-speed pump or an additional set of smaller jockey pumps. The aim is to reduce the amount of the wind generated energy that cannot be transformed to hydraulic energy due to power operation limits of the pumps and the resulting step-wise operation of the pumping station. The plant operation for a period of one year is simulated by a comprehensive evaluation algorithm, which also performs a detailed economic analysis of the plant using dynamic evaluation methods. A preliminary study of the entire plant sizing is carried out at first using an optimization tool based on evolutionary algorithms. The performance of the three examined pumping station units is then computed and analyzed in a comparative study. The results reveal that the use of a variable-speed pump constitutes the most effective and profitable solution, and its superiority is more pronounced for less dispersed wind power potential. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the lipid oxidation of refrigerated avocado purée as affected by the addition of α-tocopherol and/or sorbic acid with antioxidant and antimicrobial purposes, respectively. Hence, the formation of hydroperoxides and secondary oxidation products was studied throughout storage under different modified atmosphere packaging conditions. Addition of α-tocopherol clearly reduced rancidity of the lipid fraction. When the antioxidant was added, hydroperoxide formation was inhibited for a period of at least 12 weeks with little effect of the presence of sorbic acid and O 2 availability. On the contrary, absence of α-tocopherol in the product formulation preceded the production of secondary oxidative metabolites and a rapid saturation of the fatty acid chains. Sorbic acid was found to have a moderate prooxidant effect (p &lt; 0.05).

The analytical model is verified against available experimental data and other numerical predictions.

A major disadvantage, however, is its very slow desorption kinetics. It has been argued that, in contrast to the well-known rutile-structured Mg hydride, hydrided Mg-transition metal alloys have a much more open crystal structure facilitating faster hydrogen transport. In this paper, the electrochemical aspects of new Mg-Sc and Mg-Ti materials will be reviewed. Storage capacities as high as 6.5 wt.% hydrogen have been reached with very favourable discharge kinetics. A theoretical description of hydrogen storage materials has also been developed by our group. A new lattice gas model is presented and successfully applied to simulate the thermodynamic properties of various hydride-forming materials. The simulation results are expressed by parameters corresponding to several energy contributions, for example mutual atomic hydrogen interaction energies.

Both these approaches were applied in the present work for the alloy 72 wt.% Mg-20 wt.% Ni-8 wt.% Mm (ternary eutectic Mg-Mg2Ni-MmMg12). The alloy was processed by the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) technique. In ECAP the sample is subjected to heavy plastic strain by pressing it through a die with an angle of 90°. ECAP treatment resulted in a fine microstructure compared to the rather heterogeneous as-cast material. Hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated samples were investigated using SEM and XRD. Hydrogenation properties were studied by TDS and PCT. Hydrogenated samples consist of MgH2, Mg2NiH4 and MmH2+x and exhibit a maximum H-storage capacity of ∼5.5 wt.%. To initiate the first hydrogenation, the alloy needs to be activated at ∼300 °C. However, already after one hydrogenation cycle its H-absorption becomes quite fast: 4.5 wt.% H is absorbed in just 15 min. Vacuum TDS (heating rate 0.5 °C/min) shows that desorption starts at low temperature, ∼135 °C, with a peak at ∼210 °C. The alloy was also subjected to high energy ball milling (HEBM) in Ar or H2 to yield further refinement of the microstructure. ∼1 wt.% Nb2O5 was added to facilitate H exchange. The H sorption characteristics of the alloy treated by ECAP and HEBM have been compared with the ones for the as-cast material. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Their parameters slowly change with time due to environmental effects or rapidly due to faults. It is preferable that the control technique in this system possesses robustness for various fault conditions and disturbances. Many control techniques that using Advanced Super-conducting Magnetic Energy Storage (ASMES) to improve power system stability have been proposed. While fuzzy controller has proven its value in some applications, the researches applying fuzzy controller with ASMES actively reported. However, it is sometimes very difficult to specify the rule base for some plants, when the parameters change. To solve this problem, a Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Controller (FMRLC) is proposed in this paper, it investigates multi-input multi-output (MIMO) FMRLC for time-variant nonlinear system. This provides the motivation for adaptive Fuzzy control, where the focus is on the automatic on-line synthesis and tuning of fuzzy controller parameters (i.e., use online data to continually learn the fuzzy controller which will ensure that the performance objectives are met). Simulation results show that the proposed controller is able to work with a non-linear and non-stationary power system (i.e., single machine - infinite bus system), under various fault conditions and disturbances.

Current models predict that the protonation/deprotonation of specific acidic c ring residues is at the core of the proton translocation mechanism by this enzyme. To probe the mode of proton binding, we measured the covalent modification of the acidic c ring residues with the inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) over the pH range from 5 to 11. With the H+-translocating ATP synthase from the archaeum Halobacterium salinarium or the Na+-translocating ATP synthase from Ilyobacter tartaricus, the pH profile of DCCD labeling followed a titration curve with a pKa around neutral, reflecting protonation of the acidic c ring residues. However, with the ATP synthases from Escherichia coli, mitochondria, or chloroplasts, a clearly different, bell-shaped pH profile for DCCD labeling was observed which is not compatible with carboxylate protonation but might be explained by the coordination of a hydronium ion as proposed earlier [Boyer, P. D. (1988) Trends Biochem. Sci. 13, 5-7]. Upon site-directed mutagenesis of single binding site residues of the structurally resolved c ring, the sigmoidal pH profile for DCCD labeling could be converted to a more bell-shaped one, demonstrating that the different ion binding modes are based on subtle changes in the amino acid sequence of the protein. The concept of two different binding sites in the ATP synthase family is supported by the ATP hydrolysis pH profiles of the investigated enzymes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Biological membranes; Biosynthesis; Deprotonation; Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Protonation; Covalent modification; Electrochemical gradient; Proton binding sites; Proton translocation mechanism; Enzyme kinetics; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; carboxylic acid; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; hydrogen; phosphate; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; sodium ion; acidity; alkalinity; amino acid sequence; article; binding site; chloroplast; covalent bond; energy; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; Halobacterium salinarum; Ilyobacter tartaricus; mitochondrion; nonhuman; pKa; prediction; priority journal; proton transport; reaction analysis; sequence analysis; site directed mutagenesis; titrimetry; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Bacterial Proton-Translocating ATPases; Binding Sites; Cattle; Cell Membrane; Chloroplasts; Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; Escherichia coli; Fusobacteria; Gene Deletion; Halobacterium salinarum; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Mitochondria, Heart; Models, Biological; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protein Subunits; Protons; Recombinant Proteins; Rotation; Sodium; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Spinacia oleracea; Substrate Specificity; Escherichia coli; Halobacterium salinarum; Ilyobacter tartaricus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448959682

This warm stream of air is leaving part of its thermodynamic energy to the air turbines placed in the path of the airflow. The solar chimney power stations were named Solar Aero-Electric Power Plants (SAEPPs) due to their similarity to Hydro Electric Power Plants. The efficiency of the SAEPPs is roughly proportional to the height of their solar chimneys. Solar Chimneys can be made as reinforced concrete structures (Concrete Solar Chimneys, CFCs), or as lighter than air inflated structures (Floating Solar Chimneys FSCs). These floating solar chimneys are made by successive balloon tubes, filled with a lighter than air gas. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights 1.5÷3 Km giving to their SAEPPs higher efficiencies than Concrete Solar Chimney SAEPPs. Using ground thermal storage, or artificial thermal storage in the form of water in closed plastic tubes, it can be proved that the SAEPPs can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the SAEPPs, although renewable by nature, can have a similar operation to conventional power stations and thus can replace them. In the present paper a comparison for construction cost of SAEPPs with Floating Solar Chimneys and Concrete Solar Chimneys is given. It is shown that FSC Technology Power Plants is 5 to 6 times cheaper than CFC Technology Power Plants. © 2007 IEEE.","Aero; Chimney; Electric power plant; Floating; Solar","Chimneys; Chlorofluorocarbons; Compressed air motors; Electric generators; Greenhouse effect; Solar collectors; Thermodynamic properties; Balloon tubes; Floating solar chimney; Hydro Electric Power Plants; Solar Aero-Electric Power Plants (SAEPP); Solar Chimney; Solar power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348928795

In practical systems flash is used in different packages such as on-board flash chips, compact flash cards, secure digital cards and related formats. Our experiments reveal non-trivial differences in their access costs. Furthermore, databases may be subject to different types of workloads. We show that existing databases for flash are not optimized for all types of flash devices or for all workloads and their performance is thus suboptimal in many practical systems. FlashDB uses a novel self-tuning index that dynamically adapts its storage structure to workload and underlying storage device. We formalize the self-tuning nature of an index as a two-state task system and propose a 3-competitive online algorithm that achieves the theoretical optimum. We also provide a framework to determine the optimal size of an index node that minimizes energy and latency for a given device. Finally, we propose optimizations to further improve the performance of our index.

Due to the fact that the terminal voltage of an ultracapacitor varies with the level of energy stored, a power electronic converter with voltage boosting capability is usually needed at its terminals to interface with a load operating at a constant voltage. For the case of a classical boost dc-dc converter supplying a resistive load by drawing energy from a bank of ultracapacitors, the paper derives small-signal transfer functions by considering a time-varying steady-state. To reduce the complexity of resulting exact expressions of poles, highly accurate approximate expressions are also derived. Furthermore, it compares how the control characteristics change when a constant voltage source such as a battery replaces the ultracapacitor bank. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate values of poles and zeros and to describe how the poles and zeros vary with the duty ratio. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Capacitor storage; Capacitors; Electric loads; Power electronics; Duty ratio; Power electronic converters; Ultracapacitor banks; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248883502

The system uses a soft switched current-fed push-pull converter for DC to AC conversion. The AC current, which flows through a disk coil embedded into a mouse-pad, provides a time varying magnetic field that transfer power to a power pick-up coil located within the mouse, through magnetic induction. This power, which was tuned-up and regulated by an advanced voltage control method- dynamic detuning control, has proven to be able to provide sufficient power to drive a wireless mouse. Furthermore, an energy buffer system is added which backs up and allocates the induced power to allow mouse operation and energy storage to occur in a coordinated way. This system allows the mouse to sustain in operation even when it is moved away from the mouse-pad. A minimum duration of 2 minutes was achieved when the mouse was constantly active. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Computer mouse; Energy buffer; Mouse operation; Wireless mouse; Capacitors; Digital to analog conversion; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Electromagnetic induction; Energy storage; Voltage control; Mice (computer peripherals)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248836955

In the proposed converter, an auxiliary switch and clamp capacitor is used to recycle the energy stored in die leakage inductor, limit the voltage stress of switches and achieve resonance between the transition interval between the main and auxiliary switches. During the transition interval, the resonance based on the junction capacitance of switches and transformer leakage inductance can achieve ZVS operation of power switches. The pulse-width modulation (PWM) waveforms of two switches are generated in a complementary way with a time delay. Two modules of the series-connected transformers with center-tapped rectifier are used in the proposed converter to share the load current. Since these two modules are connected in series in the primary side and parallel-connected in the secondary side. The load current can be equally shared by these two center-tapped rectifiers. Based on the operation behavior, each transformer in the proposed converter can be operated as an inductor or a transformer. No output filter inductor is needed in the proposed converter. The circuit analysis, principle of operation, steady state analysis and design considerations of the proposed converter are provided in detail.

Deregulations of its functions are associated with metabolic diseases. We show here that deletion of one PPARγ allele not only affected lipid storage but, more surprisingly, also the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and utilization, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and glycerol export as well as in IR/IGF-1 signaling. These deregulations led to reduced circulating adiponectin levels and an energy crisis in the WAT, reflected in a decrease to nearly half of its intracellular ATP content. In addition, there was a decrease in the metabolic rate and physical activity of the PPARγ+/- mice, which was abolished by thiazolidinedione treatment, thereby linking regulation of the metabolic rate and physical activity to PPARγ. It is likely that the PPARγ+/- phenotype was due to the observed WAT dysfunction, since the gene expression profiles associated with metabolic pathways were not affected either in the liver or the skeletal muscle.

The model is based on membrane approximation and suited for vessels where most of the elastic elements are oriented axially, while circumferential contraction is exerted by redirecting axial stress by some network of oblique fibers. For the experimental data considered in this paper, the ratio between axial and circumferential stress depends almost exclusively on the circumferential extension ratio. As a consequence, the mechanical system can be formally decomposed in a kinematic system reacting by axial contraction on circumferential extension without any loss or storage of energy, serially connected to a hyperelastic system acting only in axial direction. Both systems are modeled separately by equations obtained by a purely phenomenological approach with two parameters for each system. This leads to reasonable reproduction of the experimental data. Introducing a correction parameter, which takes into account that the model assumption on the decomposition does not hold exactly, we get better reproduction of data. However, this is paid for by loss of physical rigor and in particular by departing from the assumption of hyperelasticity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas protein and carbohydrate degradation and oxidation are closely adjusted to their intakes, fat balance regulation is less precise and that fat is more likely to be stored than oxidised.It has been demonstrated that dietary fatty acids have an influence not only on the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, thus modulating several metabolic processes that take place in the adipocyte, but also on the composition and the quantity of different fatty acids in adipose tissue. Moreover, dietary fatty acids also modulate eicosanoid presence, which have hormone-like activities in lipid metabolism regulation in adipose tissue.Until recently, the adipocyte has been considered to be no more than a passive tissue for storage of excess energy. However, there is now compelling evidence that adipocytes have a role as endocrine secretory cells. Some of the adipokines produced by adipose tissue, such as leptin and adiponectin, act on adipose tissue in an autocrine/paracrine manner to regulate adipocyte metabolism. Furthermore, dietary fatty acids may influence the expression of adipokines.The nutrients are among the most influential of the environmental factors that determine the way adipose tissue genes are expressed by functioning as regulators of gene transcription. Therefore, not only dietary fat amount but also dietary fat composition influence adipose tissue metabolism. © 2007 The Authors.","Adipose tissue; Dietary fatty acids","adipocytokine; icosanoid; membrane phospholipid; adipose tissue; cytokine production; energy balance; fat intake; fatty acid transport; gene expression; human; icosanoid metabolism; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; macronutrient; priority journal; review; Adipocytes; Adipokines; Adipose Tissue; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Leptin; Paracrine Communication",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048966251

An intermediate inductance or a separating discharger is proposed to be used as a matching element between the POS and the load. An analysis is made of the effect of both versions of the matching system on the synchronization of the POS modules and the energy transfer from the inductive storage to the load. Methods for optimizing the matching element are examined. It is shown that the POS modules can be synchronized and the inductive storage energy can be efficiently transferred to a low-impedance load. A multigap vacuum discharger with a point anode and plane cathode is to be used as a separating discharger. Such an electrode system make it possible to concentrate the electric field at the point anode and to substantially enhance the electric strength of the inter-electrode gap.

Large amounts of different congeners and isomers of these compounds exhibit a variety of adverse biological effects. Interactions among different classes of compounds, frequently with opposing effects, complicate hazard evaluation and risk assessment. WAT is the key organ for energy homeostasis and it also releases metabolites into the circulation and adipokines with systemic effects on insulin sensitivity and fuel partitioning in muscles and other tissues. Its beneficial role is lost in obesity when excessive accumulation of WAT contributes to severe diseases, such as diabetes. POPs may crossroad or modulate the effect of endogenous ligands of nuclear transcription factors, participating in differentiation, metabolism and the secretory function of adipocytes. These mechanisms include, most importantly: i) endocrine disrupting potency of POPs mixtures on androgen, estrogen or thyroid hormone metabolism/functions in WAT, ii) interference of dioxin-like chemicals with retinoic acid homeostasis, where impact on retinoid receptors is expected, and iii) interaction with transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors is likely. Thus, the accumulation and action of POPs in WAT represents a unitary mechanism explaining, at least in part, the effects of POPs in the whole organism. By modulating WAT differentiation, metabolism and function, the POPs could affect not only the physiological role of WAT, but they may also influence the development of obesity-associated diseases. © 2007 Institute of Physiology, v. v. i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","Adipokines; Endocrine disruption; Organic pollutants; White adipose tissue","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; drug derivative; endocrine disruptor; hormone; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorodibenzo 4 dioxin; polychlorodibenzo-4-dioxin; transcription factor; unclassified drug; adipogenesis; animal; classification; drug effect; energy metabolism; genetic transcription; genetics; human; metabolism; pathophysiology; pollutant; short survey; white adipose tissue; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Endocrine Disruptors; Energy Metabolism; Environmental Pollutants; Hormones; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35648933928

Some studies indicate that the Trp64Arg polymorphism in the gene encoding the β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and earlier onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of this polymorphism and its relationship with obesity and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. Material and methods. We performed the study on 200 women, aged 50-60 years. Estimation of anthropometric parameters and total body fat, android and gynoid fat deposits was carried out using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Oxidative stress was estimated by measurement of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in serum. Blood for analysis was collected before, directly after and 6 h after a 30-min physical test on a cycle ergometer. ADRB3 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Results. The frequency of Trp64/Arg64 genotype in the investigated population was 12%, and of Trp64/Trp64 was 87%. The Arg64/Arg64 genotype was present in only 1% of women. Women bearing the Trp64/Arg64 genotype did not differ in any measured anthropometric parameters from women bearing the Trp64/Trp64 genotype. Moreover, genotype had no influence on oxidative stress parameters. Likewise, in both groups, mean plasma level of TBARS was increased significantly (p < 0.05) directly after the endurance test and remained elevated 6 h after the test. Conclusions. The Trp64Arg polymorphism of ADRB3 seems to not be related to obesity in postmenopausal women. Moreover, the Trp64Arg polymorphism has no influence on oxidative stress intensification after standardized physical effort in postmenopausal women. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.","β3-Adrenergic receptor; Obesity; Oxidative stress; Postmenopausal women","arginine; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; tryptophan; adult; anthropometry; article; bicycle ergometer; blood analysis; body fat; controlled study; DNA polymorphism; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; endurance; exercise; exercise test; female; genetic polymorphism; genotype; human; lipid storage; major clinical study; measurement; obesity; oxidative stress; polymerase chain reaction; postmenopause; priority journal; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Postmenopause; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348994793

Optimal liver HMP is poorly defined. Superiority of liver HMP over simple cold storage (SCS), the current standard preservation, must be proven before HMP is applied clinically. In this study, morphology and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents of HMP livers at different flows and with versus without O2 studied in a porcine ex vivo model were compared to SCS. Methods: Pig livers were procured, flushed with HTK and preserved via SCS or HMP at 3 HMP settings: high flow (HF); low flow (LF); low flow + O2 (300 mm Hg) (LFO). HMP livers were perfused via the hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) with KPS-1 TM at 4°C to 6°C for 24 hours with HF: PV: 3 to 5 mm Hg, 1 mL/g liver/min for HA and 25 mm Hg; LF: PV: 3 to 5 mm Hg, 0.5 ml/g liver/min with HA: 20 mm Hg. Morphology and ATP levels were measured in preserved liver tissues. Results: Throughout the SCS preservation, livers remained intact. In HMP livers, vacuoles appeared after 4 hours of preservation in the HF group and after 12 hours in the LF livers. LFO livers remained intact with limited vacuoles. Compared to SCS, HMP livers showed dilated sinusoids, particularly in the HF group. ATP remained relatively constant or even increased during HMP, particularly in the LF group, whereas ATP decreased after SCS. Conclusion: Among the various HMP settings, HMP with LFO was superior. ATP levels were the highest in LF. In contrast with all HMP groups, SCS showed the lowest ATP levels, indicating that HMP has the potential to better preserve energy stores. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Although there is firm evidence for a centrally mediated regulation of adipocyte function via the autonomous nervous system, little is known about signaling between adipocytes. Amino acid neurotransmitters are candidates for such paracrine signaling. Here, we applied immunohistochemistry to detect components required for amino acid transmitter signaling in rat fat depots. In interscapular brown adipose tissue as well as in interscapular, mesenteric, perirenal, and epididymal white adipose tissues, we demonstrate robust immunosignals for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) isoforms GAD65 and GAD67. Moreover, all adipose tissues stained for the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1 and the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT in addition to the vesicle marker synaptophysin. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed that VGLUT1 and VGAT, but not VGLUT2 or VGLUT3, are localized in vesicular organelles in adipocytes. The receptors for glutamate (subunits GluR2/3 and NR1 but not mGluR2) and for GABA (GABAARα2) were present in the adipocytes. The presence of glutamate, GABA, their vesicular transporters, and their receptors indicates a paracrine signaling role for amino acids in adipose tissues.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the chronic exposure to a palatable diet (chocolate) in adult neonatally handled rats. We measured the consumption of foods (standard lab chow and chocolate), body weight gain, abdominal fat deposition, and levels of plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, and corticosterone in adult neonatally handled (10 min/d, first 10 d of life) and nonhandled rats. We found an increased intake of chocolate in handled rats, but this consumption decreased over time. Handled male animals exhibited higher body weight, higher caloric efficiency, and lower triglyceride levels. Nonhandled females that were exposed long-term to the highly caloric diet had increased abdominal fat deposition compared with handled females. Overall female rats had increased abdominal fat deposition, higher total cholesterol and glucose levels, and lower insulin in comparison with males. Interestingly, chocolate consumption diminished the weight of the adrenal glands in both handled and nonhandled animals. These findings suggest that neonatal handling induces a particular metabolic pattern that is sex specific. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

We expect the new composite material's superior performance will resolve existing problems with cryogenic and liquid oxygen storage/tank materials. We began development of this composite because XCOR's vehicles, as well as most of our customers' vehicles, require lightweight, long-service life LOX tanks. This material has numerous advantages over other, more traditional composites. It is naturally resistant to microcracking, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and has inherent resistance to combustion. When used in a skin-foam-skin composite, it also serves as thermal insulation as well as structure. Additionally, it is durable, repairable, and can withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures. The fluoropolymer composite maintains strength and flexibility at extreme temperatures (-260 to plus 280 degrees C/-436 to plus 536 degrees F). We recently finished the first round of qualification tests using Dupont's newly released Teflon® PFA TE-7224 dispersion formula, which replaces 335. In a previous NASA contract XCOR conducted various tests on skin and sandwich coupons, as well as cylinders made with 335.

Because the fuel cell does not have capability for energy storage and its output voltage is easily affected by load variations and polarization loss, the power electronic technique is required to solve the problems of the unstable output voltage and fast energy compensation. And to better design these kinds of applications, the FC dynamic model is required. Due to the PEM (Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) FC stack characteristic, the stack temperature will affect the output voltage, output current and the stack temperature. Therefore, how to obtain a stable output and the optimum control is the focus of this paper. The current mode control is applied for the proposed system. A good dynamic response can be achieved when the load changes. A digital signal processor (DSP) is applied for the system control. Finally, a 600W hybrid generation system including the fuel cells, lead-acid batteries and a bi-directional dc/dc converter is constructed and verified through experiments. © 2007 IEEE.","Dynamic respond; Fuel cell; Hybrid power system","Digital signal processors; Electric potential; Lead acid batteries; Polarization; Current mode control; Dynamic respond; Hybrid power systems; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748842581

METHODS: Fourteen human donor bulbi unsuitable for transplantation were used. A horizontal lamellar cut was prepared in the donor cornea with an FS laser by using a raster and/or a spiral spot pattern. The control group consisted of the paired cornea of the same donor. EC density was evaluated before and after preservation in organ culture. The PLD was stripped from the anterior part by using either a forceps or a blunt dissection technique. The damage to the endothelium was evaluated. RESULTS: EC loss after organ storage was not statistically significant between the FS cornea group and the control group in the 15- (7.7% ± 6.9% and 8.9% ± 8.1%, respectively; P = 0.78) and 30-kHz (4.3% ± 4.0% and 3.7% ± 3.6%, respectively; P = 0.75) group. There was no significant effect of laser frequency (15 vs. 30 kHz) on EC loss (7.7% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.25). Dissection by using a forceps stripping technique resulted in higher EC loss than that with a blunt dissection technique (13.0% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: EC loss after FS laser lamellar cutting is not dependent on the frequency (ie, energy level) of the laser. A blunt dissection technique of PLDs resulted in acceptable EC loss and supports the clinical use of the FS laser for the preparation of PLDs. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Corneal endothelial viability; Endothelial keratoplasty; Femtosecond laser; Organ culture","article; cell loss; cell viability; controlled study; cornea endothelium; Descemet membrane; forceps delivery; human; human experiment; keratoplasty; laser surgery; normal human; organ culture; priority journal; Aged; Cell Count; Cell Survival; Corneal Transplantation; Descemet Membrane; Endothelium, Corneal; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Laser Therapy; Male; Organ Culture Techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748827329

One of the main global challenges in the years to come is therefore to reduce the CO2 emissions. Increasing energy efficiency and a transition to renewable energy as the major energy source can reduce CO2 emissions, but such measures can only lead to significant emission reductions in the long-term. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technological option for reducing CO2 emissions on a shorter time scale. A model to calculate the CO2 capture potential has been developed, and it is estimated that 25 billion tonnes CO2 can be captured and stored within the EU by 2050. Globally, 236 billion tonnes CO2 can be captured and stored by 2050. The calculations indicate that wide implementation of CCS can reduce CO2 emissions by 54% in the EU and 33% globally in 2050 compared to emission levels today. Such a reduction in emissions is not sufficient to stabilize the climate. Therefore, the strategy to achieve the necessary CO2 emissions reductions must be a combination of (1) increasing energy efficiency, (2) switching from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources, and (3) wide implementation of CCS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

After different exposure times, survival, reproduction, growth (weight and length), lipid and protein content of the organisms were determined. After six days of exposure at 15-30 μ g of dinoseb/g dry soil, the weight, lipid, and protein content of the exposed organisms were higher than the controls. This stimulation seems to indicate that Collembola adopt a strategy of increasing their growth in order to improve their reproduction. This hypothesis was confirmed by the number of eggs laid which was greater in exposed organisms. After 21 days, all measured parameters decreased. The results show that after having produced an effort to increase growth and reproduction, lethality increases.

In optical data storage system, laser irradiation is used to write and read information in phase change film. The original phase state of phase change film without annealing is amorphous state. After laser irradiation, the laser energy transferred to phase change film increases temperature to create crystalline features. To study the effects of laser wavelength and fluence on feature fabrication, different kinds of laser systems are used to irradiate non-annealing phase change film to fabricate crystalline features in micro/nano-sizes. Electrical force microscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy are used to characterize the electrical and optical properties of phase change film, respectively. Two kinds of phase change film, Ge1Sb2Te4 and Sb2Te3, are used. Alkaline solution has the ability to etch the amorphous and crystalline states of phase change film selectively. The phase change film patterned by laser irradiation is etched by alkaline solution to fabricate two- and three-dimensional structures. The etching selectivity and rate of alkaline solution for the two phase change films are studied. It provides a novel approach to fabricate new functional micro/nano devices by combining further etching or deposition techniques. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Specimens from 15 populations collected in Canada, Greenland and Europe were reared in the laboratory in a common-garden experiment to test whether glucose and glycogen concentrations correlated with genetic variation in freeze tolerance among the populations. Populations from Canada, Sweden, Poland and Finland did not differ much in their freeze tolerance and were able to tolerate freezing for 18 d down to at least -14 °C (lowest temperature tested). Specimens collected in a relatively warm climate (Denmark) were the least freeze tolerant, and also had the lowest concentrations of glucose when frozen at -2 °C. However, there was no clear evidence that glucose concentration is a determinant in the degree of freeze tolerance of D. octaedra when considering the whole assemblage of populations. The role of phylogenetic inertia was tested by looking for serial independence and no influence of phylogeny was detected in our findings allowing us to exclude the possibility that phylogenetic relatedness between populations is a major evolutionary factor explaining the observed differences for freeze tolerance and related traits. The size of the glycogen reserve was significantly correlated with the ability to tolerate freezing. Large glycogen reserves may be advantageous in very cold regions in order to maximise cryoprotectant production and/or as a source of energy for the anaerobic metabolism occurring during prolonged freezing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) being endowed with fairly high degree of solar radiation is a potential candidate for deployment of PV systems for power generation. Literature indicates that commercial/residential buildings in KSA consume an estimated 10-45% of the total electric energy generated. In the present study, solar radiation data of Dhahran (East-Coast, KSA) have been analyzed to assess the techno-economic viability of utilizing hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical commercial building (with annual electrical energy demand of 620,000 kW h). The monthly average daily solar global radiation ranges from 3.61 to 7.96 kW h/m2. NREL's HOMER software has been used to carry out the techno-economic viability. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system comprising of 80 kWp PV system together with 175 kW diesel system and a battery storage of 3 h of autonomy (equivalent to 3 h of average load), the PV penetration is 26%. The cost of generating energy (COE, US$/kW h) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.149 $/kW h (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1 $/L). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets for a given hybrid system. Emphasis has also been placed on unmet load, excess electricity generation, percentage fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for different scenarios such as PV-diesel without storage, PV-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), cost of PV-diesel-battery systems, COE of different hybrid systems, etc. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

EG and CF in different mass fractions (2%, 4%, 7%, and 10%) were added to SA, and thermal conductivities of SA/EG and SA/CF composites were measured by using hot-wire method. An almost linear relationship between mass fractions of EG and CF additives, and thermal conductivity of SA was found. Thermal conductivity of SA (0.30 W/mK) increased by 266.6% (206.6%) by adding 10% mass fraction EG (CF). The improvement in thermal conductivity of SA was also experimentally tested by comparing melting time of the pure SA with that of SA/EG and SA/CF composites. The results indicated that the melting times of composite PCMs were reduced significantly with respect to that of pure SA. Furthermore, the latent heat capacities of the SA/EG and SA/CF (90/10 wt%) composite PCMs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique and compared with that of pure SA.

High ship service electrical load coupled with electric propulsion are the drivers towards the Integrated Electric Propulsion (IEP) systems being specified for modern surface combatants and are the pre-cursors to the Integrated Full Electric Propulsion (IFEP) systems of the future. IFEP is defined as Complex integration and paralleling of different types and sizes of power sources to efficiently provide energy to propulsion and other ship's loads Single Generator Operation through the use of energy storage devices in association with solid state converters for improved ride-through and fight-through capabilities Extended use of electrified auxiliary systems for reduced maintenance and improved survivability. Systems configurations and topologies are ever changing to meet such requirements and applications. The land based facilities such the US Navy's Integrated Power System site in Philadelphia and the Royal Navy Electric Ship Technology Demonstrator (ES TD) in the United Kingdom are such vehicles by which future IFEP systems can be evaluated and de-risked.

This paper uses a high fidelity modeling and simulation approach to investigate the impact of real and reactive power, pulse ramp rate, pulse duration and frequency of occurrence of the pulsed power load. For this purpose, a notional shipboard power system, modeled in a real-time digital simulator, is used. Most pulsed loads on shipboard systems are not fed directly from the prime power system but via an energy storage system. This energy storage system in turn is interfaced with the shipboard prime power system typically through an electronic front-end charging circuit In order to evaluate the impact of pulsed loads, existing power quality standards (related to voltage transients, harmonic distortions, and frequency variations) are applied. © 2007 IEEE.","Modeling and simulation; Power quality; Pulse power; Shipboard power systems","Computer simulation; Electric distortion; Electric loads; Power quality; Reactive power; Ships; Charging circuit; Harmonic distortions; Pulse power; Shipboard power systems; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548830427

Potential of the catalysts in the soot oxidation is evaluated in TGA with a feed gas containing O2. Seven hundred degree Celsius calcination leads to a decrease in the surface area of the rare-earth modified CeO2 compared with CeO2. However, an increase in the meso/macro pore volume, an important parameter for the soot oxidation with O2, is observed. Rare-earth ion doping led to the stabilisation of the CeO2 surface area when calcined at 1000 °C. XRD, H2-TPR, and Raman characterisation show a solid solution formation in most of the mixed oxide catalysts. Surface segregation of dopant and even separate phases, in CeSmOx and CeYOx catalysts, are, however, observed. CePrOx and CeLaOx catalysts show superior soot oxidation activity (100% soot oxidation below 550 °C) compared with CeSmOx, CeYOx, and CeO2. The improved soot oxidation activity of rare-earth doped CeO2 catalysts with O2 can be correlated with the increased meso/micro pore volume and stabilisation of external surface area. The segregation of the phases and the enrichment of the catalyst surface with unreducible dopant decrease the intrinsic soot oxidation activity of the potential CeO2 catalytic sites. Doping CeO2 with a reducible ion such as Pr4+/3+ shows an increase in the soot oxidation. However, the ease of catalyst reduction and the bulk oxygen-storage capacity is not a critical parameter in the determination of the soot oxidation activity. During the soot oxidation with O2, the function of the catalyst is to increase the 'active oxygen' transfer to the soot surface, but it does not change the rate-determining step, as evident from the unchanged apparent activation energy (around 150 kJ mol-1), for the catalysed and un-catalysed soot oxidation. Spill over of oxygen on the soot surface and its subsequent adsorption at the active carbon sites is an important intermediate step in the soot oxidation mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These alternative sources of energy are usually environmentally friendly and emit no pollutants. However, the capital investments for those renewable sources of energy are normally high and there are also maintenance cost differences to be considered. Furthermore, due to the variability of these power sources, reliability issues should be addressed when integrating different power sources. In this paper, a grid-connected hybrid generating system comprising wind turbine generators, photovoltaic panels, and storage batteries is designed. In this multi-source generation system design, three design objectives are considered, that is, costs, reliability, and pollutant emissions. Considering the complexity of this problem, we have developed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to derive a set of non-dominated solutions, each of which represents a candidate system design. A numerical example is discussed to illustrate the design procedure and the simulation results are analyzed. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Global optimization; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Turbogenerators; Capital investments; Grid connected hybrid power systems; Maintenance cost; Power sources; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548777608

In addition, many emerging reconfigurable architectures have been optimised for low power. However, carrying out run-time reconfigurations often involves a costly reconfiguration overhead both in execution time and in energy consumption. Only the execution-time overhead was dealt with in the previous work. Here, the approach is significantly extended in order to reduce the reconfiguration energy overhead as well. To this end, a configuration memory hierarchy is proposed, with a shared memory layer consisting of a module optimised for performance combined with a module optimised for energy-efficient accesses. For this hierarchy, the authors have developed a mapping algorithm that decides where to load each configuration in order to achieve significant energy savings without introducing any performance degradation. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.",,"Computer architecture; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Resource allocation; Supervisory and executive programs; Energy-aware reconfigurable systems; Reconfiguration energy; Run-time reconfigurable resources; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548712330

Deeper cache hierarchies with larger cache sizes can mask these latencies for codes with good data locality and reuse, such as structured dense matrix computations. However, cache hierarchies do not necessarily benefit sparse scientific computing codes, which tend to have limited data locality and reuse. We therefore propose a new memory architecture with a Load Miss Predictor (LMP), which includes a data bypass cache and a predictor table, to reduce access latencies by determining whether a load should bypass the main cache hierarchy and issue an early load to main memory. Our architecture uses the L2 (and lower caches) as a victim cache for data removed from our bypass cache. We use cycle-accurate simulations, with SimpleScalar and Wattch to show that our LMP improves the performance of sparse codes, our application domain of interest, on average by 14%, with a 13.6% increase in power. When the LMP is used with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), performance can be improved by 8.7% with system power savings of 7.3% and energy reduction of 17.3% at 1800MHz relative to the base system at 2000MHz. Alternatively our LMP can be used to improve the performance of SPEC benchmarks by an average of 2.9% at the cost of 7.1% increase in average power. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Computation theory; Hierarchical systems; Natural frequencies; Voltage measurement; Energy reduction; Load Miss Predictor (LMP); SimpleScalar; Victim cache; Computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548810162

Value Prediction appeared as an effective way of increasing processor performance by overcoming data dependences, but at the risk of becoming a thermal hot spot due to the additional power dissipation. This paper proposes the design of low-leakage Value Predictors by applying static decay techniques in order to disable unused entries from the prediction tables. We explore decay strategies suited for the three most common Value Predictors (STP, FCM and DFCM) studying the particular tradeoffs for these prediction structures. Our mechanism reduces VP leakage energy efficiently without compromising VP accuracy nor processor performance.

The fusion reaction rate with 100% vector polarized reactants is expected from simple theory to increase by a factor of 1.5. With presently available polarizations, fusion reaction enhancements of ∼15% are achievable and of significant interest, while several avenues for obtaining higher polarizations are open. The potential for survival of initial fusion fuel polarizations at ∼108 K plasma core temperatures (∼5KeV) throughout the time interval preceding fusion burn was addressed in a seminal paper in 1982. While the positive conclusion from those calculations suggests that reaction enhancements are indeed feasible, this crucial factor has never been tested in a high temperature plasma core because of difficulties in preparation and injection of sufficiently polarized fusion fuels into a high temperature reactorfusion plasma. Our solution to these problems employs a new source of highly polarized D in the form of solid HD which has been developed and used in our laboratories. Solid HD is compatible with fusion physics in view of its simplicity of elemental composition and very long (weeks) relaxation times at 4K temperature, allowing efficient polarization-preserving cold-transfer operations. Containment and polarization of the HD within polymer capsules, similar to those used in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), is an innovation which simplifies the cold-transfer of polarized fuel from the dilution refrigerator polarization-production apparatus to other liquid helium temperature cryostats, for storage, transport and placement into the barrel of a cryogenic pellet gun for firing at high velocity into the reactor. The other polarized fuel partner, 3He, has been prepared as a polarized gas for applications including high-energy polarized targets and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. It will be introduced into the reactor by loading at high pressure into a thick-walled ICF-type polymer shell for injection into the plasma core with a room temperature injection gun. Based on current experience, polarizations of both D and 3He of ∼55% are projected, producing a fusion yield increase of about 15%. A collaboration is being developed for implementing this experiment at the DIII-D Ttokamak experiment at San Diego, operated by General Atomics for the U.S. Department of Energy. Calculations indicate a 10% fusion yield increase in the 14.6 MeV protons from the D- 3He reaction will provide a statistically significant test of polarization retention in the plasma. Injection of the polarized fuels into a 4He or 1H plasma improves the discrimination of the effects of polarized fuels. Details of the HD fuel preparation, of the polarization processes, and of the injection into the plasma will beare presented. If the expected fusion reaction yield increase indicative of polarization retention is detected, a route to significantly improved second generation D-3He fusion would be established, as well as confidence to undertake the more difficult polarization of tritium, which would offer important cost savings and improved prospects of ignition in the ITER program. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Nuclear fusion; Polarized 3He; Polarized D",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548734272

The challenge is to maintain an environmental temperature within the shelter not significantly lower than 0 °C in the extreme Antarctic environment where temperatures drop to -80 °C and the average temperature is below -50 °C. Greatly compounding the difficulty of this task is the reliance entirely on renewable energy sources. Energy is stored both electrically in batteries and thermally in water. In order to evaluate alternatives CRREL has constructed an energy model of the system. This model accounts for all the major heat losses from the shelter including heat loss through walls, optical domes, instrumentation cable access ports, and infiltration heat loss. The heat balance on the interior components includes heat flows to/from the thermal storage media (water), to/from the batteries, and waste heat from the instrumentation and controls contained in the shelter. A simple model of the wind turbine generator output has also been included in the system model. A full-scale ARRO was constructed, instrumented and tested in one of CRREL's environmental chambers at -50 °C. This paper describes the design approach, full-scale test, and presents results of model calculations compared with measured values obtained during testing. A prediction of the shelter performance in Antarctica will be presented.

This method is conceptually similar to existing EDA methods such as Morokuma analysis but includes several important new features. The first is a fully self-consistent treatment of the energy lowering due to polarization, which is evaluated by a self-consistent field calculation in which the molecular orbital coefficients are constrained to be block-diagonal (absolutely localized) in the interacting molecules to prohibit charge transfer. The second new feature is the ability to separate forward and back-donation in the charge-transfer energy term using a perturbative approximation starting from the optimized block-diagonal reference. The newly proposed EDA method is used to understand the fundamental aspects of intermolecular interactions such as the degree of covalency in the hydrogen bonding in water and the contributions of forward and back-donation in synergic bonding in metal complexes. Additionally, it is demonstrated that this method can be used to identify the factors controlling the interaction of the molecular hydrogen with open metal centers in potential hydrogen storage materials and the interaction of methane with rhenium complexes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Decomposition; Molecular orbitals; Monomers; Optimization; Polarization; Charge-transfer energy; Energy decomposition analysis (EDA); Energy lowering; Intermolecular interaction energies; Molecular interactions; alkene; borane derivative; methane; rhenium; water; article; chemical model; chemistry; dimerization; hydrogen bond; thermodynamics; Alkenes; Boranes; Dimerization; Hydrogen Bonding; Methane; Models, Chemical; Rhenium; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848820892

In lotic ecosystems, most of the organic matter is allochthonous, imported as bank runoff or as aerial drift. Bank runoff is already processed soil material, particulate or dissolved. Unprocessed plant litter represents the aerial drift. The energy content of unprocessed organic matter is not readily available to consumers; it has to be processed by the microbial community. Microorganisms are most active in biofilms, comprised of fungi, bacteria, protozoa etc., and their organic excretions attached to surfaces. The colonizable surface area in sediments is negatively correlated with the grain size. Therefore, the largest amounts of organic matter are likely to occur in small grain size classes, which shows that biofilms are an important component of the organic matter pool. Most of the meiobenthic species, which play also a very important role in these processes, are closely connected to biofilms. These and their associated communities are doubtless an important food source for benthic consumers. The main energy pathway passes from organic matter (either particulate or dissolved) to the microbial community in biofilms, which transforms the organic matter and makes it available and palatable to benthic consumers. Wherever the benthic community is living, either in bed sediments or on macrophytic surfaces, the energy stored in biofilms or their associated communities is mostly used. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Saccharides as organic raw materials can open new perspectives on the way to new biocompatible and biodegradable products which could help to overcome the problems resulting from the upcoming restrictions of petrochemical resources. Construction of well-defined carbohydrate polymer backbones is very challenging as it is difficult to realize complete regio and stereo-control of the glycosylating process. Most synthetic approaches are therefore based on the modification or degradation of naturally occurring polysaccharides resulting in less then perfect products. Enzymes have several remarkable catalytic properties compared with other types of catalysts in terms of their selectivity, high catalytic activity, lack of undesirable side reactions and operation under mild conditions. A biocatalytic pathway to synthesize saccharides is therefore very attractive as it results in well-defined polysaccharides avoiding the above drawbacks. When biogenic polysaccharides are combined with synthetic macromolecules, surfaces etc. materials with new interesting properties arise and the processability of the designed hybrid materials is facilitated. Amylose and amylopectin hybrid materials can be synthesized via enzymatic polymerization routes utilizing transferases. This approach opens access to well-defined hybrid structures bearing amylase or amylopectin moieties that cannot be synthesized by any other means. Copyright © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The dopants also enhance the hydrogen-binding energy at higher coverages and enable the degree of hydrogenation to be substantially increased relative to that available with empty-cage C60. Overall, the encapsulated metals increase the capacity and improve the energy efficiency for hydrogen storage. We identify materials capable of storing 6.1 wt % hydrogen and elucidate a subtle interplay between reactivity and structure which will be important for designing the next-generation hydrogen-storage materials. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Chemical reactivity; Doping (additives); Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogenation; Encapsulated metals; Endohedral dopants; Hydrogen binding; Fullerenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648834572

The infected leaves were characterized during the viral infection without visible disease symptoms. The symptomless infection led to a decrease in plant biomass. The non-photochemical fluorescence quenching, qN, declined, whereas the photochemical quenching, qP, and the Chl a/b ratio were not significantly affected. Photoacoustic and oxygen evolution measurements showed that the energy storage and oxygen evolution rate decreased in the infected leaves. Enhanced alternative electron sinks during the symptomless viral infection were also estimated. The changes in fluorescence and DF temperature curves demonstrated an enhanced stability of the thylakoid membranes in the infected leaves. This effect was clearly expressed at high actinic light intensities. The viral infected in vitro grown grapevine plants were used in the present study as a simplified model system that allow to avoid the involvement of different environmental factors that could interfere with the GLRaV infection and the virus-grapevine interactions.

Many protocols for wireless networks -routing, topology control, information storage/retrieval and numerous other applications -have been based on the idealized unit-disk graph (UDG) network model. The significant deviation of the UDG model from many real wireless networks is substantially limiting the applicability of such protocols. A more general network model, the quasi unitdisk graph (quasi-UDG) model, captures much better the characteristics of wireless networks. However, the understanding of the properties of general quasi-UDGs has been very limited, which is impeding the designs of key network protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we present results on two important properties of quasi-UDGs: separability and the existence of power efficient spanners. Network separability is a fundamental property leading to efficient network algorithms and fast parallel computation. We prove that every quasi-UDG has a corresponding grid graph with small balanced separators that captures its connectivity properties. We also study the problem of constructing an energy-efficient backbone for a quasi-UDG. We present a distributed localized algorithm that, given a quasi-UDG, constructs a nearly planar backbone with a constant stretch factor and a bounded degree. We demonstrate the excellent performance of these auxiliary graphs through simulations and show their applications in efficient routing. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Information management; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Storage allocation (computer); Topology; Network algorithms; Quasi unitdisk graph (quasi-UDG) models; Unit-disk graph (UDG); Wireless networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548319600

For embedded systems, its benefits can be even pushed further by properly matching the partition to the memory access patterns. When leakage energy comes into play, however, idle memory blocks must be put into a proper low-leakage sleep state to actually save energy when not accessed. In this case, the matching becomes an instance of power management problem, because moving to and from this sleep state requires additional energy. In this work, we propose an explorative solution to the problem of leakage-aware partitioning of a memory into disjoint sub-blocks. In particular, we target scratchpad memories, which are commonly used in some embedded systems as a replacement of caches. We show that the total energy (dynamic and static) cost function yields a non-convex partitioning space, making smart exploration the only viable option; we propose an effective randomized search in the solution space which has very good match with the results of exhaustive exploration, when this is feasible. Experiments on a different sets of embedded applications has shown that total energy savings larger than 60% on average can be obtained, with a marginal overhead in execution time, thanks to an effective implementation of the low-leakage sleep state. © 2007 EDAA.",,"Dynamic programming; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Leakage currents; Logic circuits; Architectural leakage-aware management; Memory access patterns; Partitioned scratchpad memories; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548317609

Moreover, since this algorithm works not only for entire arrays, but also parts of arrays - like, for instance, array references or, more general, sets of array elements represented by lattices [11], this signal-to-memory mapping technique can be also applied in multi-layer memory hierarchies. © 2007 EDAA.",,"Algorithms; Conformal mapping; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Storage allocation (computer); Loop-organized algorithmic specifications; Multi-dimensional arrays; Multi-dimensional signals; Hierarchical systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548314145

The key to improving performance in DTNs is to engineer a greater number of transfer opportunities. We earlier proposed the use of throwbox nodes, which are stationary, battery powered nodes with storage and processing, to enhance the capacity of DTNs. However, the use of throwboxes without efficient power management is minimally effective. If the nodes are too liberal with their energy consumption, they will fail prematurely. However if they are too conservative, they may miss important transfer opportunities, hence increasing lifetime without improving performance. In this paper, we present a hardware and software architecture for energy efficient throwboxes in DTNs. We propose a hardware platform that uses a multi-tiered, multi-radio, scalable, solar powered platform. The throwbox employs an approximate heuristic for solving the NP-Hard problem of meeting an average power constraint while maximizing the number of bytes forwarded by it. We built and deployed prototype throwboxes in UMassDieselNet - a bus DTN testbed.

The production process is currently shifting from homogeneous to heterogeneous using solid catalysts for a cleaner process and ease of product separation. The free fatty acid and moisture contents in the raw materials must be sufficiently low to avoid soap formation. The production of biodiesel with full compliance with ASTM D6751-07 or EN 14214:2003 is an uphill task. Current technologies for biodiesel production still do not provide more significant energy surplus. Biodiesel has relatively lower energy content, causing higher fuel consumption. Biodiesel has a drawback in terms of its cold flow properties. A high iodine value can cause degradation and polymerization of biodiesel components. Unconverted monoglyceride, diglyceride and triglyceride impurities will affect the engine performance. The alcohol content in biodiesel can attack rubber seals and gaskets. Biodiesel also can undergo chemical and biological modification to affect its quality in long-term storage. Biodiesel is also associated with high-level NOx emission, a fact that needs special attention. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biodiesel; Drawback; Fuel; Improvement; Technical challenges","Biodiesel; Chemical modification; Fueling; Gaskets; Biodiesel components; Biodiesel production; Chemical and biologicals; Cold flow properties; Drawback; Future improvements; Improvement; Technical challenges; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749141012

Reproductive investment (gonado-somatic index), energy stores (liver cell density and hepatocyte vacuolation), and overall body condition (hepato-somatic index and Fulton's K) of female fish varied significantly among depths and among the three reefs sampled. Male conspecifics displayed no variation between depth or reef. Depth influenced growth dynamics, with faster initial growth rates and smaller mean asymptotic lengths with decreasing depth. In female fish, relative gonad weight and overall body condition (Fulton's K and hepato-somatic index) were generally higher in shallower depths (≤10 m). Hepatic lipid storage was highest at the deepest sites sampled on each reef, whereas hepatic glycogen stores tended to decrease with depth. Depth was found to influence energy allocation dynamics in C. rollandi.

This becomes a critical factor for the overall energy consumption, area, and performance of the systems. Loop transformations are essential to improve the data access locality and regularity in order to optimally design or utilize a memory hierarchy. However, due to abstract high-level cost functions, current loop transformation steering techniques do not take the memory platform sufficiently into account. They usually also result in only one final transformation solution. On the other hand, the loop transformation search space for real-life applications is huge, especially if the memory platform is still not fully fixed. Use of existing loop transformation techniques will therefore typically lead to suboptimal end-products. It is critical to find all interesting loop transformation instances. This can only be achieved by performing an evaluation of the effect of later design stages at the early loop transformation stage. This article presents a fast incremental hierarchical memory-size requirement estimation technique. It estimates the influence of any given sequence of loop transformation instances on the mapping of application data onto a hierarchical memory platform. As the exact memory platform instantiation is often not yet defined at this high-level design stage, a platform-independent estimation is introduced with a Pareto curve output for each loop transformation instance. Comparison among the Pareto curves helps the designer, or a steering tool, to find all interesting loop transformation instances that might later lead to low-power data mapping for any of the many possible memory hierarchy instances. Initially, the source code is used as input for estimation. However, performing the estimation repeatedly from the source code is too slow for large search space exploration. An incremental approach, based on local updating of the previous result, is therefore used to handle sequences of different loop transformations. Experiments show that the initial approach takes a few seconds, which is two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art solutions but still too costly to be performed interactively many times.

In order to assess their influence on the system's dynamic behavior or to determinate the device's control strategy using direct methods, proper energy functions for these devices are needed. In this paper the energy functions for the whole spectrum of FACTS devices with an ESS have been developed. For each of the devices various energy functions were proposed according to the control strategy applied. The energy functions were constructed as additional terms that can be added to any existing structure-preserving energy function (SPEF). Tests within a single-machine infinite-bus system proved the correctness of the proposed energy functions. The application of new energy functions was demonstrated on the problem of transient-stability assessment.

First, the transduction rate was improved by using a high piezoelectric voltage constant (g) ceramic material having a magnitude of g33 = 40 × 10-3 V m/N. Second, a transducer structure, cymbal, was optimized and fabricated to match the mechanical impedance of vibration source to that of the piezoelectric transducer. The cymbal transducer was found to exhibit ∼40 times higher effective strain coefficient than the piezoelectric ceramics. Third, the electrical impedance matching for the energy harvesting circuit was considered to allow the transfer of generated power to a storage media. It was found that, by using the 10-layer ceramics instead of the single layer, the output current can be increased by 10 times, and the output load can be reduced by 40 times. Furthermore, by using the multilayer ceramics the output power was found to increase by 100%.

The exercise increased tendon strength after the fifth month, energy absorption in the eighth month, and ultimate tensile stress in the first month. Age increased tendon strength and energy storage and reduced stiffness but did not alter stress. There was an increase in collagen content in the fifth month.

Comparison of these is difficult, however, the paper compares devices of similar material system and structure within each generic scheme. PV/electrolysis is the more mature technology but there is still a wide range of potential 'solar to hydrogen' efficiencies.

While the PV/electrolyser system requires fewer PV panels compared to the PV/battery scenario due to the seasonal storage ability of H2, the final number of PV modules is only marginally less at the highest latitude due to the lower energy recovery efficiency of H2 compared to batteries.

Materials and methods: This study depended on the analysis of a questionnaire that was completed by volunteering medical centers. The questionnaire was mailed to all institutions in Turkey with a mammography device and which were registered with the Turkish Atomic Energy Commission and individual city health administration databases (n=456). Results: It was not possible to determine the exact number of mammography devices in Turkey. In all, 270 questionnaires were completed and returned from the registered centers. Among the mammography devices declared (n=291), automatic exposure control (AEC), spot view, and magnification view were not used at 21%, 34%, and 43% of the centers, respectively. Preoperative wire localization was not practiced at 180 centers (62%) despite the ability to do so. At 16% of the centers, mammograms were not labeled and at 57% of the centers labeling was handwritten. At 23% of the centers only small cassettes were used, and at 58% the heat and at 94% the humidity of film storage areas were inappropriate or unknown. At 25% of the centers light and at 15% radiation exposure of the film was present. Mammography quality control tests were performed at 40%, and in 70% control records were not well kept. There were no thermometers in 49% of the centers, no phantom breast at 80%, no sensitometer at 93%, and no densitometer at 81%. At 50% of the centers, regular periodic maintenance was not performed. Second look was performed consistently at 12% of the centers and BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) categorization was used at 40%. Conclusion: The exact number of mammography devices is not officially known in Turkey, and it is apparent that registration of some devices was not made by the Turkish Atomic Energy Commission.

While unirradiated PMH exhibited no ESR signal, irradiated PMH was found to have an unresolved broad resonance line of singlet appearance. Results related with the variations of peak heights with applied microwave power, sample temperature, storage time at room temperature and annealing time at high temperatures were used to determine the structural and kinetic features and activation energies of the contributing radicalic species. Two tentative radicalic species were proposed and their spectroscopic parameters were determined through spectrum simulation calculations. The dosimetric potential of PMH was also investigated and it was concluded that PMH does not present the characteristics of a good dosimetric material, but that ESR spectroscopy could be used in the discrimination of irradiated PMH from unirradiated one.","ESR; Irradiation; Kinetics; Piperacillin monohydrate; Temperature","Computer simulation; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Gamma rays; Hydrates; Ion bombardment; Rapid thermal annealing; Spectrum analysis; Molecular damages; Piperacillin monohydrate; Piperacillin monohydrate (PMH); Room temperature; Sodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548336586

The cylindrical LHTES device was filled with spheres of encapsulated RT20 paraffin, a phase-change material (PCM). A numerical model of the LHTES was developed to identify the parameters that have an influence on the LHTES's thermal response, to determine the optimum phase-change temperature and to form the LHTES's temperature-response function. The last of these defines the LHTES's outlet-air temperature for a periodic variation of the inlet ambient-air temperature and the defined operating conditions. The temperature-response function was then integrated into the TRNSYS building thermal response model. Numerical simulations showed that a PCM with a melting temperature between 20 and 22 °C is the most suitable for free cooling in the case of a continental climate. The analyses of the temperatures in a low-energy building showed that free cooling with an LHTES is an effective cooling technique.

The ability to study complex kinematical and dynamical features of turbulence provides means of extracting the underlying physics of turbulent fluid motion. The objective is to analyze the use of a vorticity field line approach to study numerically generated incompressible turbulent flows. In order to study the vorticity field, we present a field line animation technique that uses a specialized particle advection and seeding strategy. Efficient analysis is achieved by decoupling the rendering stage from the preceding stages of the visualization method. This allows interactive exploration of multiple fields simultaneously, which sets the stage for a more complete analysis of the flow field. Multifield visualizations are obtained using a flexible volume rendering framework, which is presented In this paper. Vorticity field lines have been employed as Indicators to provide a means to Identify ""ejection"" and ""sweep"" regions, two particularly important spatio-temporal events in wall-bounded turbulent flows.

In these islands more than 600,000 people are living mainly in small remote communities. The main economical activities of the islanders are apart from tourism, seafaring, fishery, agriculture and stock farming. One of the major problems of the area is the insufficient infrastructure, strongly related with the absence of an integrated and cost-effective electrification plan. In this context, the present work is concentrated on analyzing the present situation and demonstrating the future prospects of electricity generation in the Aegean Archipelago islands. For this purpose, one should first investigate the time evolution of the corresponding electricity generation parameters (i.e. annual electricity consumption, peak power demand, capacity factor, specific fuel consumption) for the last 30 years. Subsequently, the corresponding diesel and heavy-oil consumption along with the electricity production cost for every specific autonomous power station of the area are investigated. Special attention is paid in order to estimate the contribution of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy balance of each island. Finally, an attempt is made to describe in brief the most realistic electricity production solutions available, including the operation of hybrid RES-based power plants in collaboration with appropriate energy storage facilities. Additionally, the idea of connecting the islands of the area with the mainland and interconnecting them is also taken into consideration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite or even because of this, the diversity and spatial variability of soil physical and chemical properties is exceptionally high and could be fundamental in governing biodiversity and ecosystem function. In arid landscapes, the way the soil sheds, admits, stores, diverts and transmits water is crucially important. Namaqualand's soils possess special features, which modify water infiltration, hydraulic conductivity and subsurface storage and provision of water to plants. These include pedodermal crusts; a natural mulch of surface gravel or desert pavement; water-repellent soils with fingered infiltration of rain water; textural discontinuities at depth; subsurface horizons cemented with silica, calcite, fibrous clays or gypsum; soluble salts that affect plant water uptake osmotically; clay minerals having exceptional water-absorbing capacity and that are unique to arid environments; and a mechanism, in deeper sandy soils, for thermally induced upward transport of water vapour-a kind of nocturnal distillation-that seems to lessen the need for plants to root deeply. Superimposed on this already impressive pedodiversity are the almost ubiquitous heuweltjies-broad, low mounds which add further complexity to fluxes of water, salts, energy and nutrients in the landscape. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This is basically due to low gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of these devices that result in shorter autonomy, in addition to more weight and less usable space in the vehicle. An alternative that could make electric motors more attractive for vehicular applications by replacing batteries as the main electricity source is the fuel cell. Hydrogen is the main fuel used in these cells, but the hydrogen storage systems developed so far are heavier and bulkier than their equivalent for conventional liquid fuels such as diesel, gasoline and alcohol, despite heavier energy densities compared to batteries. This paper reviews technological aspects of fuel cells, the main storage systems for hydrogen and other energy sources, data on fuel use and the types of vehicles most commonly used in the Brazilian road transportation sector, followed by an overview of the insertion of hybrid ethanol-electric buses in Brazil. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Solid-state storage offers low power consumption, but its capacity is an order of magnitude smaller than the hard disks needed for high-resolution photos and digital video. In order to create a device with the space of a hard drive, yet the low power consumption of solid-state storage, hardware manufacturers have proposed using flash memory as a write buffer on mobile systems. This paper evaluates the power savings of such an approach and also considers other possible flash allocation algorithms, using both hardware- and software-level flash management. Its contributions also include a set of typical multimedia-rich workloads for mobile systems and power models based upon current disk and flash technology. Based on these workloads, we demonstrate an average power savings of 267 mW (53% of disk power) using hardware-only approaches. Next, we propose another algorithm, termed Energy-efficient Virtual Storage using Application-Level Framing (EVS-ALF), which uses both hardware and software for power management. By collecting information from the applications and using this metadata to perform intelligent flash allocation and prefetching, EVS-ALF achieves an average power savings of 307 mW (61%), another 8% improvement over hardware-only techniques. © 2007 SPIE-IS&T.",,"Algorithms; Computer systems; Data storage equipment; Electric power utilization; Flash memory; Digital video; Mobile multimedia computers; Mobile systems; Solid-state storage; Multimedia services",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548294190

Providing an energy storage medium that uses power efficiently and reduces the problems mentioned above is therefore a major concern. The development of such a medium has attracted public interest, with several energy storage applications (including batteries and flywheels) already having been investigated. A wide range of large-scale electric double-layer capacitors [EDLCs] that are rapidly charged and discharged have been developed, and offer durability, maintenance-free features, low-pollution and high efficiency. For their fundamental study, we produced a prototype DC electrified railway energy storage system consisting of EDLCs, a diode bridge rectifier, a chopper system and a pulse-width modulated [PWM] converter, with useful information obtained from charge / discharge tests. Based on these results, two energy storage systems were built for DC 600 V and DC 750 V, and verification tests were conducted in conjunction with the Enoshima Electric Railway Company Ltd. and the Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau. It was confirmed through verification tests that energy storage using electric double-layer capacitors provided effective functions to DC 600V and DC 750V railway systems. The tests proved to be a guideline for actual application in DC 1,500V or DC 3,000V railway systems.","Electric double-layer capacitors; Energy storage system","Electric potential; Flywheels; Locomotives; Maintenance; Electric double-layer capacitors; Energy storage system; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548285869

Enhanced crystallinity of hot-poled samples was observed independent of thermal history and crystalline structure, indicating the absence of recrystallization during poling. Absorption measurements confirmed the ordered structure in hot-poled samples due to the permanent orientation of the dipoles and higher crystallinity, thus resulting in increased and long-retained capacitance of the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) capacitor device from high frequency C - V characterization.

In recent years, scientific applications have become increasingly data-intensive. This is especially true in the fields of astronomy and high energy physics. Furthermore, the lowered cost of disks and commodity machines has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of free disk space spread across machines in a cluster. This space is not being exploited by traditional distributed computing tools. In this paper we have evaluated ways to improve the data management capabilities of Condor, a popular distributed computing system. We have augmented the Condor system by providing the capability to store data used and produced by workflows on the disks of machines in the cluster. We have also replaced the Condor matchmaker with a new workflow planning framework that is cognizant of dependencies between jobs in a workflow and exploits these new data storage capabilities to produce workflow schedules. We show that our data caching and workflow planning framework can significantly reduce response times for data-intensive workflows by reducing data transfer over the network in a cluster. We also consider ways in which this planning framework can be made adaptive in a dynamic, multi-user, failure-prone environment.

Quite a lot of node clustering techniques have appeared in the literature, and roughly fall into two families; those based on the construction of a dominating set and those which are based solely on energy considerations. The former family suffers from the fact that only a small subset of the network nodes are responsible for relaying the messages, and thus cause rapid consumption of the energy of these nodes. The later family uses the residual energy of each node in order to direct its decision about whether it will elect itself as a leader of a cluster or not. This family's methods ignore topological features of the nodes and are used in combination with the methods of the former family. We propose a novel distributed clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks, based on a novel metric for characterizing the importance of a node, w.r.t. its contribution in relaying messages. The protocol achieves small communication complexity and linear computation complexity. Experimental results for various sensor network topologies show that the protocol generates only a few clusters, guaranteeing a small number of message relays thus improving network lifetime. © 2007 IEEE.","Backbone formation; Clustering; Energy conservation; Network life-time; Sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Communication; Computational complexity; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Self organizing storage; Backbone formation; Network graph; Network life-time; Residual energy; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548120906

Leptin, produced by adipocytes, is the key hormone in appetite regulation and suppression of orexigenic, hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY). We wanted to establish and compare levels of leptin and NPY in different obesity types in childhood, and to investigate their correlations with auxological parameters. Twenty-one obese children (seven girls and 14 boys), divided into two groups, were compared with 14 controls. The mean age of the study group was 10.81 ± 3.69 years and the mean puberty stage was 2.21. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.80 kg/m2 (range 23.30-47.02) and the mean overweight 30.73 kg (range 8.00-74.00). The mean leptin level was higher in boys and in the group with central obesity, but was not significant. Leptin/NPY ratio and leptin/BMI ratio was also higher in the central obesity group and there was a more significant difference compared with controls. We found significant correlation of the leptin level with body mass (BM), body mass excess (BME), and BMI (p &lt; 0.05). The mean leptin level in obese children was very high (36.39 ng/ml). Leptin and NPY levels showed inverse values in two different obesity types. Results are suggestive for leptin resistance rather than leptin deficiency in our group of obese children. Orexitropic signaling proteins correlated significantly with auxological parameters. Determination of the leptin and NPY concentrations provided evidence that obesity represents disease with neuroendocrine dysfunction and high leptin/NPY ratio, which could be a useful marker for central obesity. ©2007 with author.

Low-dimensional phase-change materials in nanoscale dimensions offer advantages over their bulk or thin-film counterpart in several aspects such as reduced programmable volume and reduced thermal energies in phase transition. These features contribute to low power operation, excellent scalability, and fast write/erase time. In this paper we reported a general bottom-up synthesis approach and systematic material analysis study of one-dimensional chalcogenide-based phase-change materials including germanium telluride (GeTe), indium selenide (In2Se3), and germanium antimony telluride (Ge2Sb2Te5) nanowires that are targeted for nonvolatile resistive switching data storage. The phase-change nanowires have been synthesized via thermal evaporation method under vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The morphology, composition, and crystal structure of the synthesized nanowires were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The assynthesized nanowires are structurally uniform with single crystalline structures.

Therefore, a wide variety of data structures are utilized to facilitate the storage and access to these vast amounts of computed information. Additionally, the need for reliable software design and the development of large applications following the object-oriented paradigm increase the amount of dynamic buffers and redundant accesses to the data stored in these buffers. In this paper, we propose a systematic, design optimization methodology to remove these intermediate dynamic buffers, thereby reducing the memory accesses of the targeted applications without altering the input-output behaviour of the algorithms. The reduction is focused on sequences and is especially relevant for embedded systems, which have limited on-chip communication bandwidth and the energy consumption of the memory subsystem is high, due to the energy consumption associated with each memory access. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is assessed in a 3D reconstruction multimedia application and shows a significant reduction in memory accesses.

Here we examine the importance of energy (carbohydrates) derived from photosynthesis to the gametogenesis of corals following long-term, experimental exposures to diuron. Two broadcast spawning corals, Acropora tenuis and A. valida, and a brooding coral, Pocillopora damicornis, were exposed to 0 (controls), 1.0 (low) and 10 (moderate) μg l-1 diuron treatments for 2 to 3 mo prior to spawning or planulation. Diuron caused photoinhibition in each species, with pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometery recording consistent declines in effective quantum yields of 20 % at 1.0 μg l -1 and 75 % at 10 μg l-1 diuron compared to control corals. A. valida and P. damicornis were both sensitive to chronic diuron-induced photoinhibition, becoming severely bleached (loss of Symbiodinium spp. and/or reductions in light-harvesting pigments), especially at 10 μg l-1 diuron. At this moderate concentration, A. valida sustained both partial and full colony mortality. A. tenuis was more resistant to these concentrations of diuron, and neither bleached nor sustained partial mortality in any of the treatments. We found 2.5-to 5-fold reductions in total lipid content (coral tissue, oocytes and planulae) for the 3 species in the presence of diuron, indicating significant use of storage lipid to meet nutritional demands under conditions of chronic photoinhibition. Polyp fecundity was reduced by 6-fold in A. valida and both A. valida and P. damicornis were unable to spawn or planulate following long-term exposures to 10 μg l-1 diuron. This is the first study to investigate the sub-lethal effects of chronic herbicide-induced photoinhibition on symbiotic corals and provides evidence of a link between reduced energy acquisition due to PSII photoinhibition and reduced reproductive output in zooxanthellate corals. © Inter-Research 2007.","Coral; Diuron; Herbicide; Photoinhibition; Photosynthesis; Pigment; Reproduction; Symbiosis","coral reef; dinoflagellate; herbicide; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; pollution exposure; reproduction; sublethal effect; symbiosis; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef Lagoon; Pacific Ocean; Acropora tenuis; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Pocillopora damicornis; Symbiodinium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748844776

Both hardware and software approaches can be explored to balance the power/performance tradeoff associated with the external memory. In this paper we present a hardware-based, programmable external memory page remapping mechanism which can significantly improve performance and decrease the power budget due to external memory bus accesses. Our approach was developed by studying common data access patterns present in embedded multimedia applications. In the paper, we evaluate a mechanism that can perform page remapping of external memory. We also develop an efficient algorithm to map application data and instruction memory into external memory pages. We employ graph-coloring techniques to guide the page mapping procedure. The objective is to avoid page misses by remapping conflicting pages to different memory banks (i.e., by assigning them different colors). Our algorithm can significantly reduce the memory page miss rate by 70-80% on average. For a 4-bank SDRAM memory system, we reduced external memory access time by 12.6%. The proposed algorithm can reduce power consumption in majority of the benchmarks, averaged by 13.2% of power reduction. Combining the effects of both power and delay, our algorithm can benefit significantly to the total energy cost.

Ideally, the caching strategy should be tailored to the application's memory needs, thus enabling optimal use of this on-chip storage to maximize performance while minimizing power consumption. However, doing this in hardware alone is difficult due to hardware complexity, high power dissipation, overheads of dynamic discovery of application characteristics, and increased likelihood of making locally optimal decisions. The compiler can instead determine the caching strategy by analyzing the application code and providing hints to the hardware. We propose a hardware/software co-managed partitioned cache architecture in which enhanced load/store instructions are used to control fine-grain data placement within a set of cache partitions. In comparison to traditional partitioning techniques, load and store instructions can individually specify the set of partitions for lookup and replacement. This fine grain control can avoid conflicts, thus providing the performance benefits of highly associative caches, while saving energy by eliminating redundant tag and data array accesses. Using four direct-mapped partitions, we eliminated 25% of the tag checks and recorded an average 15% reduction in the energy-delay product compared to a hardware-managed 4-way set-associative cache.

An optimizing compiler can exploit an IRF by packing an application's instructions, resulting in decreased code size, reduced energy consumption and improved execution time primarily due to a smaller footprint in the instruction cache. The nature of the IRF also allows the execution of packed instructions to overlap with instruction fetch, thus providing a means for tolerating increased fetch latencies, like those experienced by encrypted ICs as well as the presence of low-power L0 caches. Although previous research has focused on the direct benefits of instruction packing, this paper explores the use of increased fetch bandwidth provided by packed instructions. Small L0 caches improve energy efficiency but can increase execution time due to frequent cache misses. We show that this penalty can be significantly reduced by overlapping the execution of packed instructions with miss stalls. The IRF can also be used to supply additional instructions to a more aggressive execution engine, effectively reducing dependence on instruction cache bandwidth. This can improve energy efficiency, in addition to providing additional flexibility for evaluating various design tradeoffs in a pipeline with asymmetric instruction bandwidth.

As a result, more computational and storage capabilities are added to accommodate ever more demanding applications. Unfortunately, adding more resources typically comes on the expense of higher energy costs. New chip design with Multiple Clock Domains (MCD) opens the opportunity for fine-grain power management within theprocessor chip. When used with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), we can control the voltage and power of each domain independently. A significant power and energy improvement has been shown when using MCD design in comparison to managing a single voltage domain for the whole chip, as in traditional chips with global DVS. In this paper, we propose PACSL a Power-Aware Compiler-based approach using Supervised Learning. PACSL automatically derives an integrated CPU-core and on-chip L2 cache DVS policy tailored to a specific system and workload. Our approach uses supervised machine learning to discover a policy, which relies on monitoring a few performance counters. We present our approach detailing the role of a compiler in constructing a custom power management policy. We also discuss some implementation issues associated with our technique. We show that PACSL improves on traditional power management techniques that are used in general MCD chips. Our technique saves 22% on average (up to 46%) in energy-delay product over a DVS technique that applies independent DVS decisions in each domain. Compared to no-power management, our technique improves energy-delay product by 26% on average (up to 64%).

Increased levels of TH1 cytokines are produced by activated macrophages in the presence of an acute or chronic infectious disease and suppress the sensitivity of insulin receptors on the membrane of muscle cell and adipocytes. Both cells are activated by inflammatory cytokines and contribute to enhance acute inflammation and to maintain a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation in apparently healthy obese individuals. The increased number of macrophage in the adipose tissue of obese individuals acts as an amplifier of inflammation. Patients with osteoarthritis and metabolic syndrome frequently are complaining about hotness and recurrent edema of feet and hands. It is probable that hyperinsulinemia in the presence of insulin resistance and inflammation, induce vasodilation through the TNF mediated-iNOS overexpression. Patients with metabolic syndrome express clinically the consequence of a poor uptake, storage and energy expenditure by the muscle and any other insulin dependent tissue and the consequence of high insulin plasma levels are vasodilation and increased protein synthesis. The fatigue and muscle weakness induced by insulin resistance and inflammation in obese patients with metabolic syndrome increase the frequency and the intensity of traumatic events of peripheral or axial joints that result in stretch and breaking of tenoperiosteal junction and abrasive damage of cartilage and therefore in these patients with metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory state the reparative process of cartilage and periarticular tissues would be severely modified by the growth factor activity in presence of high levels of insulin. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model, previously developed and validated for an insulated Class-A pan, was upscaled to the case of AWRIs by introducing a new formulation of the wind function combining the Brutsaert and Harbeck formulae. The model was run for different combinations of area (S) and depth (D) at several locations of the Segura River Basin (South Eastern Spain) where routine pan evaporation measurements (Ep) were available. The monthly and annual Kp values were derived from the simulation runs as the ratio of the simulated AWRI evaporation to the measured pan evaporation, E/Ep. Results at a monthly scale indicated that D was the main factor affecting the evolution and the value of the surface temperature and evaporation rate, while S, for a given value of D, had only a small influence. Monthly Kp varied significantly through the year, the variation range being larger for deep AWRIs (0.5 &lt; Kp &lt; 1.5) than for shallow ones (0.8 &lt; Kp &lt; 1.2). At a yearly scale, Kp was found nearly constant for a given AWRI, with small inter-annual variations. Annual Kp varied in the range 0.76 (S = 50,000 m2) to 0.86 (S = 500 m2), depending primarily on S, and to a lesser extent, on the vapour pressure deficit measured at the location. Empirical formulae allowing to predict annual Kp as a function of S and vapour pressure deficit were proposed. It was concluded that the proposed modelling approach can be applied to accurately estimate values of Kp in AWRIs at regional scale, taking into account the influence of reservoir dimensions and local climate conditions. Its application under South Eastern Spain conditions supplied the monthly and annual values of Kp to be used under similar Mediterranean semi-arid climates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many scheduling schemes have been proposed for sensor networks with high node density, to extend their lifetime by making only some nodes active while allowing others to go to sleep with negligible power consumption. However, most scheduling schemes do not take into account that the directional and uneven data traffic moving towards a data sink results in some areas running out of energy more rapidly than others, which may disconnect the network and the data sink, thereby wasting residual energy in other areas. This study proposes to balance the power consumption throughout the network for homogeneous sensor networks with high node density. The sensor network is partitioned into rectangular grids. Only one node is scheduled to be active in each grid at any time, to monitor that grid and to relay the data from other grids. To make energy stored in a grid proportional to the total power consumption of that grid, the lifetime of all individual grids is equalized. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only extends the lifetime but it also improves the performance of sensor networks by preventing some areas from being out of monitoring earlier than other areas when the connectivity of the network is lost. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Balance the power consumption; Directional and uneven data traffic; Power consumption; Scheduling; Sensor networks","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Condition monitoring; Data communication equipment; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Scheduling; Balance the power consumption; Directional and uneven data traffic; Sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648833265

The study was carried out in stands of three different species characteristic of the semiarid South East of Spain (Retama sphaerocarpa, Anthyllis cytisoides and Stipa tenacissima). Comparison of the two methods showed that EB boundary-layer resistances, unlike TD, implicitly considers the peculiarities of the plant architecture and structure, as well as its distribution in the field and the presence or absence of substrate under the canopies. In contrast, for the TD method, quantitative attributes of the vegetation (average vegetation height, h, leaf area index, L, fractional vegetative cover, f, drag coefficient, cd and the eddy diffusivity decay constant, n) are necessary, which are not only sometimes difficult to obtain in the field, but also seem to be insufficient to explain the development of the soil boundary layer in sparse semiarid vegetation. The advantages of using the EB method are both practical and theoretical. Positioning of the sensors and data storage with automatic data loggers is easy, and does not require knowledge of the aerodynamic attributes of the vegetated area. Furthermore, it allows qualitative interpretation of the effect of non-transpirable vegetative elements, as well as the architecture of the vegetation and its distribution in the field, neither of which are considered in the turbulent diffusion theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Specific scenarios for biomass usage in household heating systems are deployed. The evaluation is based on environmental and economic criteria. Considering the economic investigation, the investment in a biomass heating system for a residence is economically attractive, even if it is going to replace an existing oil system. The increased oil cost and the compensations due to the reduction of Greenhouse Gases Emissions are the most significant reasons for this choice. © by PSP. 2007.","Bio-heat; Biomass; Renewable energy sources; Technology evaluation","biofuel; biomass; domestic work; environmental assessment; fuel consumption; fuelwood; greenhouse effect; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547751304

Particularly, fuel cell electric vehicles are gaining attention as a real alternative to the pure IC engine vehicle. Because of this emerging technology, considerable research into the configurations of these fuel cell electric vehicle systems is being considered. The main components include the main power supply, an energy storage system to increase the power density of the system, a DC-DC converter to supply energy to the energy storage system or vehicle accessories and the motor drive. Because these systems are expensive and potentially unsafe when testing new algorithms, there is a need for a static power system test facility. This test facility will include any or all of the components of the actual fuel cell electric vehicle system and can be used to simulate behavior of the system and optimize it This paper presents such a system that was simulated using MATLAB® Simulink and implemented in hardware for testing of emerging electric vehicle systems at the University of Alabama's Electro-Mechanical Systems Laboratory (EMSyL). © 2007 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computer hardware; DC-DC converters; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Internal combustion engines; MATLAB; Alternative energy vehicles; Fuel prices; Power density; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547697070

The browning reaction followed a zero-order kinetic model. Its maximum activity was at pH 6.0. This activity was completely inhibited at a pH below 3.0 regardless of temperature; however, in alkaline conditions, pH inhibition depended on temperature and was observed at values above 9.0 and 11.0 at 8 and 25°C, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of substrate oxidation depended on pH within the range in which activity was observed. The reaction occurred according to an isokinetic system because pH affected the enzymatic reaction rate but not the energy required to carry out the reaction. In the alkaline pH region, browning was due to a combination of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions that occurred in parallel. These results correlated well with the browning behavior observed in intentionally bruised fruits at different temperatures and in different storage solutions.

Although these techniques help to avoid or control congestion, they do not address the issue of data persistency effectively. This paper presents an adaptive self configuring in-network storage model for data persistency in wireless sensor networks. The model is built on a clustered sensor field where we have utilized dense node deployment in the vicinity of the routing nodes to act as data buffers during congestion periods in order to avoid data loss.

Industrial processes typically have a large number of measured variables, which presents some degree of random errors and, less frequently, gross errors. In this text, in order to simplify the notation and terminology we classify all instrument and process errors in these two categories. Any significant systematic bias is included in the gross error category. Data reconciliation allows the measurements to be adjusted (""reconciled"") to satisfy process restrictions (mass and energy balances) and improve measurements quality. The results obtained by data reconciliation can also provide benefits in custody transfer issues. Custody transfer is the responsibility transfer during the storage and transportation of a measured refined product volume. Any loss or gain resulting in a non-trustful measurement is considered as the transportation company responsibility. Therefore, the work objective is to propose a data reconciliation methodology, in a process involving diesel oil custody transfer in a Transpetro's terminal (Terminal of Sao Caetano do Sul), in order to evaluate and correct possible inconsistencies, besides to know a single measure that represents better the measurement system. In this study we will use data from static measurement in tanks, dynamic measurement in turbine and ultra-sonic device. A database will be obtained in two basic steps: process modeling and data reconciliation to consolidate the mass balance. The reconciled value shows us that there is a bias in the ultra-sonic meter and the turbine meter measurement is more reliable, as expected.

Four isoproteic (crude protein: 52% DM) diets were formulated to contain one of two lipid levels (11 and 21% DM). Furthermore, within each dietary lipid level the digestible carbohydrate content was varied by the incorporation of extruded or crude peas meal. Triplicate groups of 50 sole (IBW: 23.6 ± 1.2 g) were grown in recirculated seawater (temperature: 20°C; salinity: 35 ppt) over 67 days. At the end of the study, liver and muscle samples were withdrawn for analyses of fat content, fatty acid profile, TBARS and activity of selected antioxidant enzymes. During the experimental period the mean fish weight about doubled in all treatments. Dietary treatments affected tissue lipid content, with highest values being generally observed in fish fed high digestible carbohydrate levels. The fatty acid composition of muscle samples were little affected by dietary treatments. The low lipid content of muscle and its highly conservative fatty acid profile suggest that muscle may not be a preferential lipid storage site in Senegal sole. The TBARS values were higher in fish fed diets with high lipid level. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher in livers of fish fed diets with the high lipid level. CAT and SOD activities and TBARS values were also related to the dietary starch type, given that the higher oxidation rates were observed in fish fed the diets containing digestible carbohydrates. This study suggests that lipid and carbohydrate energy sources interact in the definition of the fish oxidative status, and that Senegal sole diets should contain a low lipid level and raw starch, in order to produce fish less prone to oxidation.",,"Pisum sativum; Solea senegalensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547327679

The different synthesis, purification, and postprocessing methods produce CNTs with different physical characteristics, which can be applied in different fields ranging from composite materials, medical applications, and electronics to energy storage. The widespread projected use of CNTs makes it important to understand their potential harmful effects. In this environmental health review we observed a remarkable range of results of some of the toxicology studies. The comparability should be improved by further standardization and introduction of reference materials. However, at present the findings of this review suggest several key points: a) there are different types of CNTs, and therefore they cannot be considered a uniform group of substances; and b) in environmental compartments, CNTs can be bioavailable to organisms. The properties of CNTs suggest a possible accumulation along the food chain and high persistence. In organisms the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of CNTs depend on the inherent physical and chemical characteristics such as CNT functionalization, coating, length, and agglomeration state that are influenced by the external environmental conditions during CNT production, use, and disposal stages.

Treatment of such patients usually involves restoring their blood volume with transfusion of blood (stored at 2°C - 6°C) and/ or crystalloids or colloids (stored at ambient temperature). Rapid infusion of these cold fluids can worsen or even induce hypothermia in these patients. Warming of intravenous fluids at accident sites has traditionally been difficult due to a lack of suitable portable fluid warmers that are not dependent on mains electrical or battery power. If latent heat, the heat released when a liquid solidifies (an inherently temperature limiting process) can warm intravenous fluids, portable devices without a reliance on electrical energy could be used to reduce the incidence of hypothermia in trauma patients. Methods: Rapid infusion of red cells into patients was timed to sample typical clinical flow rates. An approved dry heat blood warmer was compared with a prototype blood warmer using a supercooled liquid latent heat storage material, to warm red cells whilst monitoring inlet and outlet temperatures. To determine the effect of warming on red cell integrity compared to the normal storage lesion of blood, extracellular concentrations of potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and haemoglobin were measured in blood which had been warmed after storage at 2°C - 6°C for 1 to 42 days. Results: A prototype latent heat fluid warmer consistently warmed red cells from approximately 4°C to approximately 35°C at typical clinical flow rates. Warming of stored blood with latent heat did not affect red cell integrity more than the approved dry heat blood warmer. Conclusion: Using latent heat as an energy source can satisfactorily warm cold blood or other intravenous fluids to near body temperature, without any adverse affects. © 2007 McEwen and Roxby; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"hemoglobin; infusion fluid; lactate dehydrogenase; potassium; article; blood flow velocity; blood transfusion; controlled study; energy resource; erythrocyte preservation; erythrocyte transfusion; human; human cell; in vitro study; intensive care; intermethod comparison; portable equipment; storage temperature; temperature measurement; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748889592

Lack of estrogen results in the development of a metabolic syndrome in humans and rodents, including excess adiposity, hepatic steatosis (in male but not female aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice) and insulin resistance. Estrogen replacement results in a prompt reversal of the energy imbalance symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency. A corollary to the perturbed energy balance observed in the ArKO mouse is the death by apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of male ArKO mice, an area of the brain pivotal to the regulation of energy uptake, storage, and mobilisation. An extension of our work exploring the relationship between estrogen and adiposity has been to examine the role played by androgens in energy balance. We have demonstrated that an increased androgen to estrogen ratio can promote visceral fat accumulation in the rodent by inhibiting AMPK activation and stimulating lipogenesis. Therefore, understanding the regulation of energy homeostasis is becoming an increasingly fascinating challenge, as the number of contributors, their communications, and the complexity of their interactions, involved in the preservation of this equilibrium continues to increase.

The potential energy was estimated by the DLVO theory and short range hydration forces and compared to the experimentally determined zeta potential. The strongest attraction between particles occurs at the isoelectric point (pH 4) and resulted in large aggregates, which gave relatively higher values of viscosity, yield stress, moduli, and shear thinning effects. The relative viscosity as a function of volume fraction was fitted to the Krieger and Dougherty model for all the suspensions. Oscillation measurements showed that the suspensions display elastic behaviour at low pH and viscous behavior at high pH. Furthermore, suspensions with high salt content had higher storage moduli.

Two control strategies where developed: one based on heuristics and the other based on an optimization model using neural networks. These strategies were translated to algorithms and implemented in a digital signal processor, and their performance was evaluated in urban driving. The results were incorporated to an economic evaluation of the system, which shows that the reduction in costs would only justify the inclusion of this type of system in a lead-acid battery-powered vehicle if the battery life is extended by 50% or more, which is unlikely. The same results were extrapolated to a case in which the lead-acid batteries are replaced by a fuel cell.

We argue that neither nuclear energy, nor coal gasification with carbon collection and storage can provide sufficient climate-neutral energy to be probable routes to a hydrogen future. Their contributions are likely to be too little and too late to be of much help. Hydroelectricity, geothermal and biomass energy can all provide base-load power, but even combined have limited potential, and are not always climate-neutral in operation. On the other hand, the high-potential renewable energy (RE) sources, particularly wind and direct solar energy, are intermittent. Further, wind resources are poorly matched to the existing distribution of world population. Wind power's high potential compared with present electricity demand, high return on energy invested, intermittency, and mismatch with load centres all favour hydrogen conversion and transmission to load centres. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon capture and storage; Hydrogen from wind energy; Intermittent renewable energy; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy","Carbon; Gas fuel storage; Hydrogen; Nuclear energy; Carbon capture and storage; Hydrogen from wind energy; Intermittent renewable energy; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547838116

We used the long-term energy model TIMER 2.0, to study the use and production of hydrogen and its influence on global CO2 emissions. This is done using a set of scenarios with assumptions on technology development, infrastructural barriers and climate policy (CP). We found that even under optimistic assumptions hydrogen plays a minor role in the global energy system until the mid-21st century due to the system inertia-but could become a dominant secondary energy carrier in the second half of the century. Hydrogen is mainly produced from coal and natural gas. Hence, hydrogen-rich scenarios without climate policy increase CO2 emissions up to 15% by 2100 compared to the baseline. However, if climate policy is assumed, CO2 from fossil feedstock-based hydrogen production is captured and sequestrated, which indicates that an energy system that includes hydrogen is much more flexible in responding to climate policy. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Climate policy; Hydrogen economy; Long-term scenarios","Climate change; Energy conservation; Hydrogen storage; Particulate emissions; Climate policy; Hydrogen economy; Long term scenarios; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547828767

Valldemossa Km 7.5, 07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain","Background: There is epidemiological evidence that perinatal nutritional factors may have long-term effects on obesity. Which nutrients or food components are involved in this programming mechanism are unknown. Breast milk contains leptin, a hormone that regulates food intake and energy expenditure, and previous studies in rats have shown that leptin orally administered during lactation exerts anorexigenic effects. Objective: To evaluate whether supplementation with physiological doses of oral leptin during lactation has long-term effects on body weight regulation. Design: A daily oral dose of leptin (equivalent to five times the amount of leptin ingested normally from maternal milk during the suckling period) or the vehicle was given to suckling male rats during lactation. Animals were fed after weaning with a normal fat (NF) or a high-fat (HF) diet. We followed body weight and food intake of animals until the age of 6 months, and measured the size of adipose tissue depots, the thermogenic capacity, the expression of leptin in the stomach and adipose tissues and the expression of two appetite-related peptides (neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)), leptin receptor (OB-Rb) and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS-3) in the hypothalamus at the age of 6 months. Results: Leptin-treated animals had, in adulthood, lower body weight and fat content and ate fewer calories than their untreated controls. Unlike adipocitary leptin production, adult animals that were leptin-treated during lactation displayed higher gastric leptin production without changes in OB-Rb mRNA levels. In addition, in response to HF diet, leptin-treated animals (contrary to controls) showed lower hypothalamic NPY/POMC mRNA ratio. Hypothalamic OB-Rb mRNA levels decreased in control animals as an effect of HF diet feeding, but remained unchanged in leptin-treated animals; SOCS-3 mRNA levels were lower in leptin-treated animals than in their controls, both under normal or HF diet. Conclusion: The animals that received leptin during lactation become more protected against fat accumulation in adult life and seem to be more sensitive to the short- and long-term regulation of food intake by leptin. Thus, leptin plays an important role in the earlier stages of neonatal life, as a component of breast milk, in the prevention of later obesity. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Breastfeeding; Leptin; Metabolic imprinting; Overweight","fat; leptin; leptin receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; proopiomelanocortin; recombinant leptin; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; adipose tissue; adulthood; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; body weight; breast milk; caloric intake; controlled study; diet supplementation; drug dose increase; fat content; fat intake; feeding; feeding behavior; food intake; gene expression regulation; hormone synthesis; hypothalamus; lactation; lipid storage; male; newborn; newborn period; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; rat; regulatory mechanism; stomach; suckling; thermogenesis; weaning; weight control; Adipose Tissue; Administration, Oral; Aging; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Body Weight; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Lactation; Leptin; Male; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Rats; Rats, Wistar; RNA, Messenger; Stomach; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins; Animalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547396431

These compounds have been shown to be a useful intermediate for the preparation of energetic compounds. In the present study, the thermal stability of the DAF and DAG was determined by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and simultaneous thermogravimetery- differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of TG analysis revealed that the main thermal degradation for the DAF and DAG occurs in the temperature ranges of 230-275°C and 180-230°C, respectively. On the other hand, the TG-DTA analysis of compounds indicates that DAF melts (at about 182°C) before it decomposes. However, the thermal decomposition of the DAG started simultaneously with its melting. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20°C min-1) on the DSC behaviour of the compounds was verified. The results showed that, as the heating rate was increased, decomposition temperatures of the compounds were increased. Also, the kinetic parameters such as activation energy and frequency factor for the compounds were obtained from the DSC data by non-isothermal methods proposed by ASTM E698 and Ozawa.

Glucocorticoids protect body lipid and the metabolic status quo. We studied the combined effects of OE and corticosterone in adrenalectomized female rats: daily OE gavages (0 or 10 nmol/g) and slow-release corticosterone pellets at four doses (0, 0.5, 1.7, and 4.8 mg/d). Intact and sham-operated controls were also included. After 8 d, body composition and plasma metabolites and hormones were measured. OE induced a massive lipid mobilization (in parallel with decreased food intake and maintained energy expenditure). Corticosterone increased fat deposition and inhibited the OE-elicited mobilization of body energy, even at the lowest dose. OE enhanced the corticosterone-induced rise in plasma triacylglycerols, and corticosterone blocked the OE-induced decrease in leptin. High corticosterone and OE increased insulin resistance beyond the effects of corticosterone alone. The presence of corticosterone dramatically affected OE effects, reversing its decrease of body energy (lipid) content, with little or no change on food intake or energy expenditure. The maintenance of glycemia and increasing insulin in parallel to the dose of corticosterone indicate a decrease in insulin sensitivity, which is enhanced by OE. The reversal of OE effects on lipid handling, insulin resistance, can be the consequence of a corticosterone-induced OE resistance. Nevertheless, OE effects on cholesterol were largely unaffected. In conclusion, corticosterone administration effectively blocked OE effects on body lipid and energy balance as well as insulin sensitivity and glycemia.

The present study analyzes the relationship between energy storage molecule concentration (i.e. tissue balance of protein-carbohydrate-lipid levels) and the gonadal output in two populations located at different depths (16-18 m and 40-45 m depth) through a seasonal cycle (2002-2003). In June 2003, another six populations have been sampled to compare medium-scale geographical variation. The colonies sampled were less than 6 cm high, thus representing the majority of the population in the studied area. There was no clear relationship between energy storage (i.e. carbohydrate and lipid levels) and gonadal output, nor in the seasonal cycle or the spatial variation. A clear-cut seasonal trend of energy storage was detected only in the shallower population. The water temperature was warmer at 20 m depth and the water transparency (Secchi disk) was also higher (lower seston concentration) in 2003 when the same periods in 2002 and 2003 were compared (May-August). Carbohydrates seemed to be more sensitive to food constraints than lipids. The partial mortality detected in summer 2003 in the sampling area appeared to be recorded in the carbohydrate and lipid levels of this species, especially in the shallow population. The biochemical levels prove to be a useful tool to detect unusual environmental conditions that may cause partial or total mortality in benthic suspension feeders. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"benthos; carbohydrate; coral; environmental conditions; lipid; mortality; protein; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; Alcyonaria; Anthozoa; Corallium rubrum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547109834

This reserve must be appropriately activated by means of the primary frequency control (PFC). Because the generation is an electro-mechanical process, the primary control reserve controllability is not as fast as required, especially by modern power systems. Since the new improvements achieved on the conventional control methods have not been enough to satisfy the high requirements established, the necessity of enhancing the performance of the PFC has arisen. At present, the new energy storage systems (ESS) are a feasible alternative to store excess energy for substituting for the primary control reserve. In this way, it is possible to combine this new ESS with power converter based flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS). This allows an effective exchange of active power with the electric grid and, thus, enhances the PFC. This paper presents an improved PFC scheme incorporating a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) coupled with a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device. A detailed full model and a control algorithm based on a decoupled current control strategy of the enhanced compensator are proposed. The integrated STATCOM/SMES controller topology includes three level, multi-pulse, voltage source inverters (VSI) with phase control and incorporates a two quadrant, three level, dc-dc chopper as the interface between the STATCOM and the SMES coil. A novel three level control scheme is proposed by using concepts of instantaneous power in the synchronous rotating d-q reference frame. The dynamic performance of the presented control algorithms is evaluated through digital simulation performed by using SimPowerSystems of SIMULINK/MATLAB™, and technical analysis is performed to obtain conclusions about the benefits of using SMES devices in the PFC of the electric system. Presently, a laboratory scale prototype device based on digital signal processors (DSP) is being implemented. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Salinity and temperature, suspended solids concentration, and particle fluxes in the water column were measured at seven stations situated on the tidal flat formed at the river mouth, the delta slope, and along the fjord axis down to the fjord mouth. Turbidity currents were measured in situ using a current meter combined with a turbidity meter. The sediments collected with a Niemisto gravity corer were x-rayed and analyzed for granulometric composition. The results of the major sampling campaign undertaken in July 2002 were supplemented with winter hydrological data from January 1996. Since the river is frozen in winter, no fresh water or fluvial sediment supply is observed in the fjord water column. A hypopycnal plume of brackish water (1.5 m thick) extends in summer as far as 0.8 km from the river mouth. The highest concentration (826 mg l-1) and vertical flux (over 1000 g m-2 day-1) of suspended solids were noted at the edge of the tidal flat and over the upper slope of the delta. Both concentrations and the solid particle flux decreased as distance from the river mouth increased. Local peaks of turbidity in the intermediate and deep water layers in the central fjord indicated the presence of hyperpycnal plumes. Tidal flat sediments are rhythmically laminated by the tidally controlled resuspension/redeposition cycles and occasionally eroded by catastrophic events such as intense storms or winter ice cover scouring. The steep inclination of the bottom of the slope (15-19°) promotes the gravity-driven processes of sediment transport (debris flows). Frequent resuspension and redeposition events can be traced on x-radiographs and in the granulometric composition of the sediment cores collected on the slope. Turbidity currents are observed throughout the fjord, although their intensity and frequency of occurrence change as distance from the river mouth increases. The near bottom hyperpycnal flows transport the finest sediment over the slope and into the low energy environment of the central basin of Adventfjorden. The current study shows that the patterns of sediment storage and sedimentary dynamics in a glacier-fed river estuary are driven by gravity flows and turbidity currents rather than by the patterns of the vertical sedimentation of suspensions in the water column. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Specimens were prepared from four resin composites; Point 4 (Kerr), Premise (Kerr), Filtek Supreme (3M/ESPE), Ceram X (Dentsply), and two polyacid-modified resin composites; Dyract (Dentsply) and F2000 (3M/ESPE). The specimens were immersed in distilled water for 1 week, transferred to one of three aqueous media at 60 °C for 2 weeks; distilled water, 0.01 mol/L lactic acid or 0.1N NaOH, washed and immersed in 50% (w/w) aqueous silver nitrate for 10 days at 60 °C and placed in a photodeveloper solution. After reduction of the silver, specimens were embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned and polished, coated with carbon, and examined by backscattered mode scanning electron microscopy. The depth of silver penetration into the degraded area was measured from the SEM micrographs. Energy dispersive analysis X-ray (EDAX) was used to confirm the presence of silver. Results: NaOH produced the greatest depth of degradation and lactic acid the least. Premise showed the greatest depth of silver penetration when subjected to NaOH, and Filtek Supreme the second with peeling of the surface and cracking, whereas F2000 and Point 4 showed the least in NaOH and lactic acid.

This paper describes an extensive study on the acceptance of CCS by stakeholders in the Netherlands and explores one of the determining factors in the acceptance of CCS by the lay public, i.e. the way the Dutch press perceives and portrays CCS. The stakeholder analysis shows that there is a positive attitude towards CCS by industry, government, and environmental NGOs, provided that the conditions they pose on the deployment of CCS are met. The content analysis of Dutch news articles conveys that the media portrayal of CCS is-to a certain extent-a balanced reflection of the way CCS is perceived by the stakeholders. Both analyses show that the concerns about CCS have not overshadowed the main promise that CCS is part of the solution to climate change. However, the current negative aspects of CCS as raised by different stakeholders and the media will remain if no action is taken. Therefore, the conditions posed on the use of CCS, as well as the actions required to meet these conditions, could function as a proxy for the 'societal voice', articulating the most important issues concerning the future acceptance of CCS technology. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It provides more than 97% of all electricity generated by renewable sources. The main advantage of hydro systems is elimination of the cost of fuel. Hydropower on a small-scale is in most cases ""run-of-river"", with no dam or water storage, and is one of the most cost-effective and environmentally benign energy technologies to be considered both for rural electrification in less developed countries and further hydro developments in Europe. Multipurpose dams, like Porsuk Dam in Eskisehir, are constructed with the aim of supplying domestic, irrigation and industrial water except electricity generation. Porsuk basin has suitable valley in upstream of existing Porsuk Dam for realizing of small reservoirs. The discharge capacity of Porsuk River is appropriate only to install Small Hydropower Plants (SHPs). For the sustainable management of Porsuk River water, except existing Porsuk Dam, it is required to construct a few new dams on this river. The valley of Porsuk River is suitable to construct concrete faced rockfill dams (CFRDs). For this propose, initially, historical data of inlet and outlet of Porsuk reservoir has been investigated. Historical data have been analyzed on a monthly basis for 32 years. It has been calculated that the electricity generation using this potential is 20.69 GWh/year with 4.2 MW installed capacity from Porsuk Dam. For the evaluation of all the Porsuk River water potential, it is required constructing at least two new dams in the hilly Porsuk basin. It is calculated that the total electricity generation from these two will reach up to 37.79 GWh/year with 2×2.8 MW installed capacity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, cogeneration units are mostly considered as stand-alone facilities, although, in reality, they will be part of a system that may also contain a thermal-storage tank and back-up boiler. Secondly, usually mainly static and simplified methods are used to calculate the possible reduction of CO2 emissions. In this paper, these issues are discussed in two parts. The dimensioning of cogeneration facilities to fulfil a certain heat demand and the impact of thermal-storage tanks on the operational behaviour of these units are dealt with. It is shown that the use of thermal-storage tanks prolongs the yearly operation time of a CHP facility and allows the cogeneration unit to operate more continuously. Also, it is clarified how to interpret thermal load-duration diagrams in a correct way. Furthermore, the impact of thermal storage on the overall CO2 emissions is investigated. Hereby, the interaction with the expansion of the central power system and the annual use of the cogeneration units are two important parameters. Using a small thermal-storage device causes the net reduction of CO2 emissions, in comparison with a reference scenario without additionally installed cogeneration, to be almost three times higher compared to the case without heat buffer. Finally, it is shown that the operational behaviour of multiple small-scale cogeneration units can be approximated by the behaviour of one large fictitious unit for the determination of the net reduction of CO2 emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This means that a part of energy stored during previous deformation begins to release. The point where the energy storage rate is zero turned out to be the point of Considère stability criterion.

For these time-of-flight measurements at the GELINA white neutron source, the use of a fast digitizer significantly increases the efficiency compared with a conventional data acquisition system. First, the pulse processing time required to obtain the amplitude with high resolution is significantly reduced so that pulse pile-up with the prompt gamma-burst is eliminated for neutron-induced events. Second, an improved time response is obtained for which the amplitude and rise time dependence is strongly reduced compared to that of a conventional constant fraction discriminator. Excellent energy and time resolution is obtained with algorithms suitable for on-line signal processing, so that data storage is under control. Bench tests are presented that compare methods of signal processing.

This ""filmless"" technique is an alternative for the use of medium to coarse-grain X-ray films. In addition to having an extremely wide dynamic range compared to conventional film, CR-technique is much more sensitive to radiation, thus requiring a lower exposure dose. This results in shorter exposure times and a reduced safety area. In addition to the reduced cost on consumables, the return on investment of CR systems is strongly determined by savings in exposure time, processing times and archival times. But also intangible costs like plant shutdown, environment safety and longer usability of isotopes are increasingly important when considering replacing film by Storage Phosphor systems. More than in traditional radiography, the use of digital images is a trade-off between the speed and the required quality. Better image quality is obtained by longer exposure times, slower phosphor screens and higher scan resolutions. Therefore, different kinds of storage phosphor screens are needed in order to cover every application. Most operations have the data, associated with the tests to be performed, centrally stored in a database. Using a digital radiography system gives not only the advantages of the manipulation of digital images, but also the digital data that is associated with it. Smart methods to associate cassettes and Storage screens with exposed images enhance the workflow of the NDT processes, and avoid human error. Automated measurements tools increase the throughput in different kinds of operations. During the fall of 2005, the ASTM 2445/2446 and the European Standards EN 14784-1/2 have been published after long years of discussion. The standards describe a measuring method and a classification for CR systems, together with the different test classes in function of the material thickness and used energy. These publications broaden the application field of Computed Radiography. One of the applications waiting for standardisation is the radiographic inspection of welds. Weld inspections cover more than half of the applications in the oil and gas market, and replacing film by Computed Radiography would bring total cost savings to the inspection company. This paper gives an overview of the different CR standards and weld inspection. It describes the different aspects of a radiographic system, including the requirements of the hardware, the different kinds of storage phosphor screens, the software and the workflow in general. Finally it demonstrates that the standards can be met with the most modern CR technology and it presents some image quality results.","Computer radiography; Welding inspection","Accident prevention; Dosimetry; Phosphors; Plates (structural components); X ray films; Computer radiography; CR systems; Exposure dose; Welding inspection; Radiography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547659346

A SiC susceptor were used to absorb the microwave energy and rapidly transfer the heat to the film. Low microwave power and short time have been used. The films obtained are crack-free, well-adhered, and fully crystallized. The microstructure displayed a polycrystalline nature with nanograin size. The metal-BST-metal structure of the thin films treated at 700 °C show good electric properties. The ferroelectric nature of the BST35 thin film was indicated by butterfly-shaped C-V curves. The capacitance-frequency curves reveal that the dielectric constant may reach a value up to 800 at 100 kHz. The dissipation factor was 0.01 at 100 kHz. The charge storage density as function of applied voltage graph showed that the charge storage densities are suitable for use in trench type 64 Mb (1-5 μC/cm2) and 265 Mb (2-11 μC/cm2) DRAMs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was carried out to determine the effect of the freeze-thaw treatment on rheological behaviour and the activation energy in different commercial creams. Freeze-thaw treatment was made at different times of frozen storage within a range from 0 to 6 weeks. For each freezing cycle, the sample was submitted to rheological measurements within range of temperature between 20 and 40°C. A rotational, concentric cylinder viscosimeter Viscotester VT550 (Germany) type Searle was used in this work. The apparent viscosity is defined as the ratio of shear stress and shear rate, which was varied between 17.8 and 445 s-1. The Power Law or Oswaltd Waele model describes well the rheological behaviour of the analyzed samples. Furthermore, in all cases sample viscosity increased when was exposed to freeze-thaw treatment with respect to the not treated sample. And other hand, the activation energy has high values; hence there is clear evidence that the rheological behaviour presents a high dependence with the temperature.

Product branching fractions together with absolute DR cross-sections were measured. The branching fractions were determined at a relative collision energy between the ions and the electrons of ∼0 eV. With a probability of 34% the DR events resulted in no ruptures of bonds between heavy atoms (i.e. no breakage of the C-C bond or the C=O bond). In the remaining 66% of the events one of the bonds between the heavy atoms was broken. The energy-dependent cross-section for the DR reaction was measured between ∼0 and 1 eV relative kinetic energy. In the energy region between 1 meV and 0.2 eV the absolute cross section could be fitted by the expression σ(E) = 6.8 × 10-16 E -1.28 cm2, whereas in the energy interval between 0.2 and 1 eV the data were best fitted by σ(E) = 4.1 × 10-16 E-1.60 cm2.

Several carbonation processes proposed in literature for CO2 storage employ extraction of silicate minerals using a liquid solvent. In this study, the dissolution of natural serpentinite in respective solutions of acids, bases and ammonium salts has been investigated. Experiments performed at room temperature showed that H2SO4 was most efficient at extracting magnesium from serpentinite, followed by HCl, HNO3, HCOOH and CH3COOH. Experiments for determining the dissolution kinetics was performed at temperatures of 30, 50 and 70 °C in 2 M solutions of H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3. At 70 °C temperatures all magnesium was extracted from serpentinite in each of the three acid solutions tested during 1-2 h. Also a large part of iron in serpentinite was extracted, while very little silicon dissolved (&lt; 4%). The dissolution rate seemed to be limited by product layer diffusion for serpentinite particles with a size distribution of 74-125 μm. The apparent activation energies were 68 kJ mol- 1 for dissolution in H2SO4, 70 kJ mol- 1 for dissolution in HCl, and 74 kJ mol- 1 for dissolution in HNO3. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the number of erase times is also limited. In this paper, we propose using ah extra RAM buffer as the extension of the flash memory to reduce the number of erase operations, and to prolong the flash lifetime. Based on the extra RAM buffer, we design and implement a flash storage system, called Log Flash Storage System (LFSS), which incorporates two techniques. One is a novel data clustering method, which allows the hot data usually be updated in the RAM buffer, reducing the chances of updating and erasing flash blocks. The other is a new data layout approach for the flash memory so as to reduce the system mount time. We implemented the LFSS as a Linux kernel module.

Hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas, as a liquid (at 20 K), and in solid state compounds. The first two methods are established technologies with several limitations, the most important being their energy intensive character. Hydrogen storage in metal hydrides is considered one of the most attractive methods. While hydrogen has many obvious advantages, there remains a problem with storage and transportation. Hydrides reduce the risk factors of gaseous or liquid hydrogen. The metal hydrides provide a safe method for fuel storage in hydrogen-powered vehicles. LiBH4 is a complex hydride which consists of 18% mass of hydrogen. Therefore, there are many reasons why hydrogen-storage materials, for example LiBH4, will be used in the future at many ranges.

To achieve the global goals of reduction in CO2 emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been introduced as one of the most promising methods. One of the initiatives in this direction is the Norwegian government's decision to capture CO2 at the Kårstø gas power plant for permanent storage in a subsea aquifer in the North Sea. While both the capture and the storage issues have got considerable attention in the debate of how to realize CCS, the transportation has been regarded as fairly trivial. There are, however, several important technical issues to be resolved related to pipeline transport of dense CO2, and some of these are highlighted in DNV's report to the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) as input to their feasibility study of the Karstø CCS concept. Such issues are limitation of gas humidity to avoid corrosion of C-Mn steel pipes, severity of accidental entrance of wet gas, toughness requirements to ensure fracture arrest properties under a release of dense CO2, corrosivity of reproduced CO2 from enhanced oil recovery (EOR) reservoirs, and procedures for requalification of oil and gas pipelines for transport of dense CO2.",,"Carbon dioxide; Corrosion; Gas fuel storage; Gas pipelines; Toughness; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Enhanced oil recovery (EOR); Requalification; Gas supply",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548008838

Starting from a reference plan, alternative expansion plans are derived based on postponement/anticipation of circuit implementations. These plans are then ranked by using an economic index of merit (EIM) and the associated Pareto-optimal set is obtained through cost/benefit (trade-off) analyses. The cost/benefit is related to the variation of investments and operational costs of each alternative transmission plan. Besides the usual operational costs (active power losses, fuels, etc.) the unreliability costs, due to random failures in the system, are also considered as operational costs. Therefore, reliability evaluations are carried out for all transmission expansion plans (TEPs) in order to compute reliability indices, such as the Expect Energy not Supplied and Loss of Load Cost (LOLC). To reduce the computational effort, pruning techniques are used to limit the number of possible TEPs. The proposed approach is applied to a configuration of the Brazilian North-eastern system, considering a planning horizon of 10 years, to identify TEPs that are more balanced in terms of investment and reliability.

The FA composition of and mobilization from different fat depots reflect the functions of adipose tissues, e.g. in energy storage or insulation. Sixteen farm-raised sables (Martes zibellina), a terrestrial mustelid, were assigned into a fed control group or fasted for 4 days. The FA composition of the sable was relatively similar to other previously studied mustelids. The masses of the different fat depots decreased by 28-55% during fasting. The subcutaneous (sc) and intraabdominal (iab) fats had a uniform FA composition and the sable could mobilize both sc and iab FA. 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3 and 16:1n-7 were effectively mobilized, while long-chain saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased in proportion. Relative mobilization (RM) correlated inversely with the FA chain length and A9-desaturation increased RM of several MUFA compared to SFA. The results reinforce the hypothesis that the terrestrial sable can utilize sc and iab fat depots as energy reserves during nutritional scarcity.

Following a detailed study, dynamic compaction was selected to be the best option, especially for the foundations of the nine oil tanks at the site. To determine the dynamic compaction pattern, including the optimum number of drops, total energy and height of drop, a detailed trial programme was carried out. This included drilling boreholes, cone penetration test and standard penetraiton test performance and trial tamping as well as heave tests.

Objective: The aim was to evaluateearly changes in hormones involved in neuroendocrine regulations (serum cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin) and positive energy balance (serum insulin, leptin and ghrelin) during SGA treatment in normal-weight patients with schizophrenia with the purpose of exploring the possibility to combat weight gain early through manipulation of circulating hormone levels. Design: We conducted a randomized, partly cross-sectional and partly longitudinal, prospective study. Setting and Patients: Eighteen normal-weight in-patients with schizophrenia treated with FGA (first-generation antipsychotics) were referred to the Institute of Psychiatry. Twenty age-, gender- and BMI-matched healthy subjects were investigated at the Neuroendocrine Unit, Belgrade University. Intervention: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at baseline in all and then 13 patients were assigned to receive SGA (risperidone or clozapine) and OGTT was repeated after 1 and 3 months. Results: At baseline, patients with schizophrenia had higher peak glucose levels (p < 0.05), glucose area under the curve (AUC; p < 0.05), peak insulin levels (p < 0.05), insulin AUC values during OGTT (p < 0.01) and the calculated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) value than control subjects (p < 0.05). Patients with schizophrenia showed higher morning cortisol (p < 0.05) levels than control subjects. After 1 and 3 months of SGA therapy patients with schizophrenia gained bodyweight by 3.5 and 8.6%, respectively. Leptin levels steadily increased while cortisol levels decreased in the first month and remained so. Serum glucose, insulin and ghrelin levels on SGA were similar as at baseline. Circulating ghrelin levels decreased after OGTT during SGA which is consistent with a role for ghrelin in the initiation of meals. Conclusions: Treatment with SGA was associated with continuous weight gain, with an early increase in serum leptin levels and decrease in cortisol levels. Elevated circulating leptin was ineffective in the control of fat deposition. Similar plasma ghrelin levels and similar decrease pattern of ghrelin after OGTT compared to healthy subjects signify intact meal-promoting effects of ghrelin during SGA therapy, which at the same time renders anorexigenic pathways ineffective. This may lead to weight gain and further studies with a ghrelin antagonist may provide support for this hypothesis. Copyright © 2007 S.

This will be the first new project for Hydrogen Energy, the new company recently launched by BP and Rio Tinto, subject to regulatory approval. The project would be fully integrated with carbon capture and storage to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. The project's gasification facility and power station would be located in Kwinana, alongside BP's refinery and Rio Tinto's Hlsmelt facility, gasifying locally-produced coal from the Collie region to produce hydrogen and CO2. The power plant, which would be fueled by H2, would be capable of producing 500 Mw of low-carbon electricity. Subject to the successful outcome of detailed engineering and commercial studies, and providing government policy is in place to make the project commercially viable, a final investment decision to develop the project could be made in 2011, with the project coming into operation after a 3-yr construction period.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447506456

The implemented design techniques consist of a more efficient memory databus, the exploitation of the dynamic read stability of SRAM cells, a new low-swing write technique and a distributed decoder. An 8-KB 5T SRAM was fabricated in a 0.18-μm technology. The measurement results confirm the feasibility and the usefulness of the proposed techniques.

Unlike such methods, this work approaches the subject problem systematically, meaning that all relevant system elements and their characteristics have been analyzed: PV water pumping system, local climate, boreholes, soil, crops and method of irrigation; therefore, the objective function has been defined in an entirely new manner. The result of such approach is the new mathematical hybrid simulation optimization model for optimal sizing of PV irrigation water pumping systems, that uses dynamic programming for optimizing, while the constraints were defined by the simulation model. The model was tested on two areas in Croatia, and it has been established that this model successfully takes into consideration all characteristic values and their relations in the integrated system. The optimal nominal electric power of PV generator, obtained in the manner presented, are relatively smaller than when the usual method of sizing is used. The presented method for solving the problem has paved the way towards the general model for optimal sizing of all stand-alone PV systems that have some type of energy storage, as well as optimal sizing of PV power plant that functions together with the storage hydroelectric power plant. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was, therefore, to increase energy access in 1-year old Atlantic salmon after sea transfer by increasing the level of dietary fat, by exchanging some of the dietary oil with more easily oxidized medium chain triacylglycerols, or by dietary supplementation of potentially energy enhancing additives such as clofibrate and tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA). A natural outbreak of IPN occurred 8 weeks after sea transfer, and a significant dietary effect explaining 76% of the variation in mortality was observed. Relative percentage survival for the fish fed TTA in sea water was 70% when compared with the unsupplemented control, reducing mortality from 7.8 to 2.3%. Muscle fat content and plasma chloride were related to IPN mortality, suggesting that reduced hypoosmoregulatory capacity might be a predisposing factor to the onset of an IPN outbreak. Based on the observation of a threefold increase in white muscle mitochondrial fatty acid oxidizing activity by TTA, it is suggested that TTA has resulted in a re-allocation of dietary fatty acids from storage to energy producing oxidation. © 2007 The Authors.","Atlantic salmon; B-oxidation; Energy; IPN; Osmoregulation; TTA","1-(carboxymethylthio)tetradecane; chloride; clofibrate; fatty acid; fresh water; sea water; sulfide; tetradecylthioacetic acid; unclassified drug; adipose tissue; animal; animal disease; animal food; article; Atlantic salmon; blood; body composition; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet; diet supplementation; epidemic; fish disease; infectious pancreatic necrosis virus; metabolism; mitochondrion; mortality; oxidation reduction reaction; skeletal muscle; virus infection; Adipose Tissue; Animal Feed; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Birnaviridae Infections; Body Composition; Chlorides; Clofibrate; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Disease Outbreaks; Fatty Acids; Fish Diseases; Fresh Water; Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus; Mitochondria; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Salmo salar; Seawater; Sulfides; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250772946

This is mainly due to the relatively low thermal conductivity of organic latent heat materials. In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate a method of enhancing the thermal conductivity of paraffin wax by embedding aluminum powder in it. The size of the aluminum powder particles was 80 μm. The tested mass fractions in the PCM-aluminum composite material were 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 of aluminum. The used mass fraction in the experimental work was 0.5. The experiments were conducted by using a compact PCM solar collector. In this collector, the absorber-container unit performed the function of absorbing the solar energy and storing the phase change material (PCM). The solar energy was stored in the PCM and was discharged to cold water flowing in pipes located inside the PCM. Charging and discharging processes were carried out. The propagation of the melting and freezing fronts was studied during the charging and the discharging processes. The time wise temperatures of the PCM were recorded during the processes of charging and discharging. The solar intensity was recorded for the charging process. It was found that the charging time was reduced by approximately 60% by adding aluminum powder in the wax. In the discharging process, experiments were conducted for different water flow rates of 9-20.4 kg/h. It was found that the useful heat gained increased when adding aluminum powder in the wax as compared to the case of pure paraffin wax.

In order to ensure that the pathway losses are compensated by the more efficient end-use of the H2 fuel, calculations based on well-to-tank losses and tank-to-wheel efficiencies are used. Furthermore, in order to look into the consequences of introducing hydrogen, a top-down scenario has been worked out.

Cheremushkinskaya 25, Moscow, Russian Federation","Multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) appears because of Coulomb scattering of charged particles on each other. In hadron storage rings, it results in re-distribution of the energy between different degrees of freedom, growth of six-dimensional emittance, development of non-Gaussian tails in distribution function and sometimes to the loss of particles. Traditional method of IBS analysis is based on ""Gaussian model"", which is assumed that distribution functions are Gaussian ones for all degrees of freedom. The basic theorems derived from the Gaussian model are shortly discussed. More detailed IBS analysis can be done using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent tools. The FPE is written in ""coordinate-momentum"" space and in ""invariant space"" with account of the multiple IBS. Here, we consider two numerical methods of three-dimensional FPE solution developed at the last time: (1) the use of the ""Langevin equations map"" (LEM) and (2) the simulation of three-dimensional IBS using ""the binary collision map"" (BCM). The basics of both methods and examples of their application to storage rings are given. Alternative approach to the IBS analysis is named ""molecular dynamics"" (MD) based on the straight-forward integration of the particle trajectories taking into account the external electromagnetic fields and the Coulomb forces.

First, the process was simulated to determine the properties of the streams as well as the power and heat consumption of the process equipment. Second, a basic design was made for the major process equipment, and total investment costs were estimated with the help of the publicly available literature and a factorial cost estimation method. Finally, the sequestration costs were determined on the basis of the depreciation of investments and variable and fixed operating costs. Estimated costs are 102 and 77 €/ton CO2 net avoided for wollastonite and steel slag, respectively. For wollastonite, the major costs are associated with the feedstock and the electricity consumption for grinding and compression (54 and 26 €/ton CO2 avoided, respectively). A sensitivity analysis showed that additional influential parameters in the sequestration costs include the liquid-to-solid ratio in the carbonation reactor and the possible value of the carbonated product. The sequestration costs for steel slag are significantly lower due to the absence of costs for the feedstock. Although various options for potential cost reduction have been identified, CO2 sequestration by current aqueous carbonation processes seems expensive relative to other CO2 storage technologies. The permanent and inherently safe sequestration of CO2 by mineral carbonation may justify higher costs, but further cost reductions are required, particularly in view of (current) prices of CO2 emission rights. Niche applications of mineral carbonation with a solid residue such as steel slag as feedstock and/or a useful carbonated product hold the best prospects for an economically feasible CO2 sequestration process. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are discussed with respect to age structure of the current production plants, CO2 emissions, natural gas dependency and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) under stringent CO2 emission constraints. The analysis of the information from the power plant database, which includes planned projects, shows large variations in power plant infrastructure between the MS and a clear shift to natural gas-fuelled power plants during the last decade. The data indicates that this shift may continue in the short-term up to 2010 since the majority of planned plants are natural gas fired. The gas plants are, however, geographically concentrated to southern and northwest Europe. The data also shows large activities in the upstream gas sector to accommodate the ongoing shift to gas with pipelines, liquefaction plants and regasification terminals being built and gas fields being prepared for production. At the same time, utilities are integrating upwards in the fuel chain in order to secure supply while oil and gas companies are moving downwards the fuel chain to secure access to markets. However, it is not yet possible to state whether the ongoing shift to natural gas will continue in the medium term, i.e. after 2010, since this will depend on a number of factors as specified below. Recently there have also been announcements for construction of a number of new coal plants. The results of the simulations for the German and British power sector show that combination of a relatively low growth rate in power generation, ambitious national plans on renewables together with a strong expansion in the use of natural gas can meet national reduction targets in CO2 emissions. However, for both countries this will result in a strong dependency on natural gas. Successful application of CO2 capture will reduce this dependency, since this would allow for a significant amount of coal-based generation, which will contribute to security of supply. © 2007.","CO2 storage; Power plants; Security of supply","Computer simulation; Database systems; Energy efficiency; Gas fuels; Natural gas pipelines; Energy infrastructure database; Power plant database; Power plant inrastructure; Security of supply; Petroleum industry; computer simulation; database; natural gas; power generation; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147134519

This system functions as a stand-alone power system that is used to supply electricity for isolated buildings and is designed for integration with a micro-grid system (MGS), which is the future concept for a renewable energy-based power network system for Thailand. The system is comprised of the following components. An array with three different types of PV modules consisting amorphous thin film of 3672 W, polycrystalline solar cell of 3600 W and hybrid solar cell of 2880 W, making up a total peak power of 10.152 kW. In addition, there are three grid-connected inverters of 3.5 kW each, three bi-directional inverters of 3.5 kW each and an energy storage system of 100 kWh. After the first 6 months of system operation, it was found that all the components and the overall system had worked effectively. In total, the system had generated about 7852 kWh and the average electricity production per day was 43.6 kWh. The average efficiency of amorphous thin film panel, polycrystalline panel, hybrid solar cell panel and entire PV panel system was 6.26%, 10.48%, 13.78% and 8.82%, respectively. From the analysis of the daily energy production, daily energy consumption and energy storage, the results seem to indicate that there was some mismatching between energy supply and demand in the system. However, this can be overcome by integrating the system to a micro-grid network whereby the energy from the system can be diverted to other loads when there is a surplus and additional energy can be drawn from external sources and fed to the system when the internal supply is insufficient. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The first-order Raman spectra in the vicinity of Si peak were fitted from phonon confinement model including a term taking into account the amorphous phase. This analysis allowed the determination of the correlation length, which corresponds to the crystallite size, also considering the PS natural oxidation process. The photoluminescence band, generated by Si crystallites located on the outermost part of the PS layer, was also fitted with a Gaussian distribution. In order to investigate the porous silicon nanostructure, the micro-Raman spectra were measured for different sets of porous silicon samples. These spectra showed good reproducibility and the effects of the natural oxidation at different periods. A slight decrease in the crystallite size was observed for all samples sets studied, while the spectral part related to the amorphous phase did not describe significant changes. The central position of PL band, analyzed after the oxidation process, exhibited consistently a shift to higher energies. In addition, top view high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) images also confirmed a reasonable reproducibility and homogeneity. The results showed that after storing in air, natural oxidation can modify the Si crystallites size at the surface but not increase the amorphous phase. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Nano-structuring appears to be a promising strategy, in which the higher power density in nanosized materials is related to the dramatically shortened Li-ion diffusion paths. However, nanosizing materials also changes intrinsic material properties, which influence both ionic and electronic conductivity. In this work neutron diffraction is used to show that in addition to these two aspects, nanostructuring changes the phase behavior and morphology. Lithiated 40-nm TiO2 anatasc crystallites become single phase, either having the Li-poor original anatase phase, or the Li-rich Li-titanate phase, in contrast to microsized crystallites where these two phases coexist in equilibrium within one crystal particle. In addition, Lix TiO2 compositions occur with stoichiometries that are not stable in micron-sized crystallites, indicating enhanced solid solution behavior. Reduced conduction electron densities at the sites of the Li ions are observed by NMR spectroscopy. This is accompanied by reduced spontaneous Li-ion mobility, suggesting a correlation between the electron density at the Li-ion site and the Li-ion mobility. The present results show that in the case of lithiated anatase TiO2, significant effects on phase composition, morphology, and electronic configurations are induced, as well as slower intracrystallite Li diffusion. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

This is caused by the fact that light energy is the limiting substrate. Light supply is characterized by a constant photon flux which cannot be stored within the culture broth. In this study batch cultivations of Chlorella sorokiniana were closely followed in a bench-scale biocalorimeter (1.63 L, Ø 11.6 cm) illuminated with red light emitting diodes. Calorimetry provided the rate of light energy storage inside biomass representing chemical energy. Normalized to the total input of light energy this yielded the photosynthetic efficiency. It was highest in the beginning of the batch cultures: 14% at a cell density of less than 1 mL cells L-1. Efficiency decreased to 5.4% as cell density increased further to 5 mL cells L-1 (=2.5 g L-1). Efficiency was highest at low cell density when light penetrates far inside the reactor. Our results support previous findings that the presence of an increasing dark zone leads to reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The same trend was detected using measurements of carbon dioxide and ammonium consumption. The carbon dioxide consumption rate was used to calculate the enthalpy increase in the culture broth during photoautotrophic growth. The maximum photosynthetic efficiency calculated from the enthalpy increase was higher than the one measured directly in the biocalorimeter: 16% as opposed to 14%. This discrepancy probably is related to a combination of factors which are discussed opening up possibilities for further improvement of this technique. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Elements that form volatile hydrides, first of all mercury, are analysed by hydride generation techniques. In the absorption techniques the samples are vaporized into free, neutral atoms and illuminated by a light source that emits the atomic spectrum of the element under analysis. The absorbance gives a quantitative measure of the concentration of the element. ICP-AES and ICP-MS are multi-element techniques. In ICP-AES the atoms of the sample are excited by, for example, argon plasma at very high temperatures. The emitted light is directed to a detector, and the optical signals are processed to values for the concentrations of the elements. In ICP-MS a mass spectrometer separates and detects ions produced by the ICP, according to their mass-to-charge ratio. Dilution of biological fluids is commonly needed to reduce the effect of the matrix. Digestion using acids and microwave energy in closed vessels at elevated pressure is often used. Matrix and spectral interferences may cause problems. Precautions should be taken against trace-element contamination during collection, storage and processing of samples. For clinical problems requiring the analysis of only one or a few elements, the use of FAAS may be sufficient, unless the higher sensitivity of GFAAS is required. For screening of multiple elements, however, the ICP techniques are preferable. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Flame atomic absorption spectrometry; Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; Human biological material; Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Sample preparation","argon; graphite; mercury; trace element; analytic method; atom; atomic absorption spectrometry; atomic emission spectrometry; bioassay; body fluid; digestion; dilution; furnace; high temperature; human; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; mass spectrometry; microwave radiation; pressure measurement; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; review; spectroscopy; Absorption; Body Fluids; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metals, Heavy; Sensitivity and Specificity; Specimen Handling; Spectrophotometry, Atomic; Spectrum Analysis; Trace Elements; Volatilization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250196824

Generally, remote villages are driven by diesel generators. However, introduction/dissemination of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) into the existing diesel systems results in the reduction of the diesel fuel consumption and eventually allows atmospheric pollution to subside. A short-term energy storage integrated with wind-diesel system may compensate for fluctuations in the power output of the wind turbine and raise the fuel saving potential. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's (K.S.A) area is large, with large number of villages/settlements scattered all over the Kingdom. In the present study, hourly mean wind-speed data recorded at an airport, K.S.A., has been analyzed to investigate the technical and economic feasibility/viability of utilizing off-grid hybrid (wind-diesel-battery) power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote/isolated village with annual electrical energy demand of 13,244 MWh. The airport is located in the vicinity of the candidate settlement. The hybrid systems simulated comprise of various combinations (wind farms) of 600 kW commercial WECS supplemented with diesel generators and a short-term battery storage. The amount of battery storage capacity has been varied from 0 to 60 load minutes (equivalent to 0-60min of average load). National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) HOMER software has been used to perform the technical and economic analysis of hybrid wind-diesel-battery power systems. The investigation indicates that for a hybrid system consisting of 3.6MW (six 600kW wind machines, 50m hub-height) wind farm capacity together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW diesel units) and a battery storage of 30 load minutes (equivalent to 30 min of average load), the wind penetration is 24%. The cost of generating energy from the above hybrid configuration has been found to be 0.078 US$/kWh (assuming a diesel fuel price of 0.1 $/liter). The simulation results highlight that the number of operational hours of diesel generators in wind-diesel system decreases with increase in wind farm capacity. The study also illustrates that for a given hybrid wind-diesel system, the decrease in diesel run time is further enhanced by inclusion of battery storage capacity. An attempt has been made to address the effect of wind penetration, effect of hub-height on energy production, cost of wind-diesel-battery systems, cost of energy production, excess electricity, un-met load, percentage fuel savings and decrease in carbon emissions, etc (for different scenarios such as wind-diesel without storage, wind-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation).","Battery; Electrification of isolated settlements; Wind turbine; Wind-diesel-battery simulation","Diesel fuels; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Wind turbines; Electrification; Hybrid system; Wind energy conversion system; Wind farm; Wind-diesel-battery power system; Wind power; Diesel fuels; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Wind power; Wind turbines; carbon emission; consumption behavior; electricity generation; electrification; wind farm; wind power; wind turbine; wind velocity; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548356789

The bearing system is composed of a superconducting magnetic thrust bearing (SMB) and a permanent magnet bearing (PMB). The SMB was built with Nd-Fe-B magnet and YBCO superconducting blocks. The PMB has the function of positioning radially the switched reluctance machine (SRM) used as motor/generator and reduce the load over the SMB. The SRM drive is responsible to convert electrical into mechanical energy, and vice versa. The prototype still operates at low speeds, but the dynamical simulations of the SRM drive showed that the system can work at high speed, supplying the required energy during disturbances. In the tests performed with the FESS prototype, the system took or delivered energy from/to the grid when requested. © 2007 IEEE.","Flywheels; High-temperature superconductors; Superconducting magnetic bearings","Computer simulation; Energy storage; Flywheels; High temperature superconductors; Mechanical drives; Mechanical energy; Superconducting magnetic bearings; Switched reluctance machine; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547464670

After imbibition in water, ABA, or GA3 solutions, beechnuts were subjected to cold stratification, which breaks their dormancy. ABA delayed, whereas GA3 promoted seed dormancy breaking. Proteome maps for water, ABA, and GA3 were established, which displayed 1544 silver-stained spots. A total of 74 spots, showing significant changes in volume, were identified by MS. Of these, 18, 45, and 16 spots were identified as water-, ABA-, and GA3-responsive, respectively (five were regulated by both hormones). The classification of proteins showed that most of the proteins associated with dormancy breaking in water are involved in energy metabolism and protein destination. Most of the ABA-responsive proteins are involved in protein destination, energy metabolism, and development. Most of the GA3-responsive proteins are involved in energy metabolism (many more than for ABA and water) and plant defense. We conclude that the mechanism of seed dormancy breaking involves the proteins of many processes, beginning with hormone signal initiation, through signal transduction, transcription, protein synthesis, energy metabolism, storage materials, and ending with the cell cycle. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In this study, the effects of temperature, pH, and time on the stability of ammonium polyphosphate-fertilizer solution simulating a range of storage conditions were evaluated. Ion chromatography was used for the speciation of orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate in the polyphosphate- fertilizer solution over time. Polyphosphate solutions were very stable when the pH was maintained close to neutral (pH 6.4) and the temperature was less than 25°C. In contrast, at the lowest pH (2.3) and highest temperature (50°C) almost all tripolyphosphate and 96% of pyrophosphate was hydrolyzed after 28 d. The hydrolysis rate constant for tripolyphosphate at 50°C was calculated to be 9.2 ± 10-7 s-1 and the half-life 20 d. At 25°C, the half-life of tripolyphosphate was 34 d at pH 2.3 and 174 d at pH 5.4. The activation energy at pH 2.3 was 12.7 kJ mol-1. The results demonstrate that increasing temperature and decreasing pH have a deleterious effect on the stability of condensed P species in polyphosphate fertilizer.

In addition to managing the most important energy reserve of the body, it secretes a multitude of soluble proteins called adipokines, which have beneficial or, alternatively, deleterious effects on the homeostasis of the whole body. The expression of these adipokines is an integrated response to various signals received from many organs, which depends heavily on the integrity and physiological status of the adipose tissue. One of the main regulators of gene expression in fat is the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is a fatty acid- and eicosanoid-dependent nuclear receptor that plays key roles in the development and maintenance of the adipose tissue. Furthermore, synthetic PPARγ agonists are therapeutic agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.This review discusses recent knowledge on the link between fat physiology and metabolic diseases, and the roles of PPARγ in this interplay via the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Finally, we assess the putative benefits of targeting this nuclear receptor with still-to-be-identified highly selective PPARγ modulators. © 2007 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.","adipose tissue; energy homeostasis; obesity; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; adipose tissue; animal; energy metabolism; homeostasis; human; metabolism; obesity; physiology; review; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Obesity; PPAR gamma",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250803903

DR is the technique to reduce demand for energy, especially at times when the electric system is working near to or at the peak demand loads. If demand for energy at peak times can be managed, energy suppliers will be able to reduce the amount of generation required to supply the demand, which will eliminate the need for building new power plants and transmission systems. Hybrid and electrical vehicles are presenting an opportunity to help with peaking and DR. This involves ability to provide the storage of electricity off peak in an incredible distributed network that is part of where the energy is used.",,"Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Modernization; Project management; Technical presentations; Demand supply; Power plant building; Transmission systems; Distributed parameter control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250722575

The synchronous generator includes two three-phase stator windings displaced by 30° that are connected to the transformer load through two dc links with voltage source inverters (VSI). Following priority rules, the load is divided into steps. Each load step can be supplied by the WT when the wind speed varies between two predefined speed levels. The first goal of the WT control system is to supply the load with constant real power under constant voltage as the wind speed varies between two levels and the second is to operate smoothly interchanging the load steps when the wind speed breaks through a speed level. There are two controllers: the inverter controller that keeps the load voltage constant and the pitch controller acting on the blade's angle. Using simulation techniques, the operation of the WT system and the efficiency of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated for a wide range of wind speeds. © 2007 IEEE.","Converters; Synchronous generators (SGs); Variable-speed drives; Wind power generation","Control system synthesis; Electric inverters; Electric loads; Electric windings; Stators; Synchronous generators; Turbogenerators; Variable speed drives; Wind power; Voltage source inverters; Wind speed; Wind turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249794269

The energy efficiency and environmental load for systems based on rape methyl ester (RME), ethanol and biogas produced by processing raw material from the farm in industrial-scale plants were evaluated using a life cycle perspective. Eventual constraints when implementing the systems in practice were also identified and the farmer's costs for the systems estimated. The RME scenario showed some good characteristics; the energy efficiency and potential effects on global warming were favourable, the technology well known and no engine modifications were necessary. However, the high price of the organically produced rapeseed made the fuel expensive. The ethanol scenario provided fuel at a comparatively low cost, but the energy efficiency was low and existing engines would have to be modified. The biogas scenario was not as economically advantageous, due to high costs for storage and transport of the biogas and the extensive tractor modifications needed. The calculations further showed that systems based on so-called exchange of fuels, i.e. when the farm produces raw material for one type of biofuel, but instead uses another type of biofuel more suitable for its own tractors, were an economically favourable way of supplying the organic farms with 'self-produced' bio-based fuels. The exchange scenario based on delivery of organic wheat to a large-scale plant and use of RME at the farm was somewhat more expensive than scenarios based on production of biogas raw material at the farm. However, the wheat/RME system has the advantage of being possible to put into practice immediately, since industrial-scale wheat ethanol plants are in operation and RME fuel is available on the market. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Interest in the procedure has recently been renewed due to its potential to resuscitate marginal organs. This review describes experimental and clinical liver hypothermic machine perfusion studies and current developments. RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental studies have shown that oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion provides a complete washout and can restore parenchymal energy status, a phenomenon of particular importance in preservation of livers from compromised donors. Additionally, perfusion of the hepatic artery can prevent ischemic-type biliary lesions. Short-term and continuous hypothermic machine perfusion prior to or after cold storage preservation have proven more effective than cold storage alone. SUMMARY: The benefits of hypothermic machine perfusion for both heart-beating and nonheart-beating liver grafts seem promising in terms of expanding the donor pool. As liver hypothermic machine perfusion systems are not yet commercially available, the process is currently only clinically used for kidney grafts. Clinical application appears feasible in the near future as new, easy-to-use systems and solutions are currently under development. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Liver; Machine perfusion; Preservation; Preservation solution; Transplantation","hepatic artery; human; hypothermia; liver graft; liver ischemia; liver parenchyma; liver perfusion; liver preservation; review; tissue oxygenation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249027045

Specimens collected in Sweden were cold acclimated and then frozen at -7 °C to examine the influence of body mass on survival of freezing. Results showed that survival was negatively correlated to body mass. Glycogen content of the worms was variable and seemed to decrease with increasing body mass consistent with the hypothesis that freeze survival is dependent on the ability to rapidly break down glycogen and accumulate high concentrations of glucose. The results suggest that large worms (subadults and adults) invest energy in production of cocoons at the expense of glycogen storage for cryoprotectant production, whereas juvenile worms increase their survival chances by investing energy in glycogen storage at the expense of growth as a preparation for winter. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While ample data support either of the fat depots being causative or associative, valid argument for one depot often automatically belittles the other. Paradigms such as the visceral/portal hypothesis and the acquired lipodystrophy/ectopic fat storage and endocrine hypothesis have been proposed. Nevertheless, neither hypothesis alone explains the entire pathophysiological setting. Treatment of diabetes with thiazolidinediones selectively increases fat partitioning to the subcutaneous adipose depot but does not change visceral fat accumulation. This is in contrast to the preferential visceral fat mobilisation by diet and exercise. Surgical removal of visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue yields relatively long-lasting metabolic improvement only when combined with procedures that ameliorate adipose tissue cell composition. These studies illustrate that human adipose tissue in different anatomic locations does not work in isolation, and that there is a best-fit relationship in terms of volume and function among different fat depots that needs to be met to maintain the systemic energy balance and to prevent the complications related to obesity. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Adipocytokines; Adipose tissue cell composition; Adipose tissue distribution; Diet and exercise intervention; Insulin resistance; Lipolysis; Thiazolidinediones; Type 2 diabetes; Visceral and subcutaneous fat depot","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adiponectin; leptin; metformin; pioglitazone; sulfonylurea; troglitazone; adipose tissue; anthropometry; caloric intake; catecholamine release; cell composition; cytokine production; diabetes mellitus; diet; energy expenditure; exercise; gluconeogenesis; glucose transport; human; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; lipolysis; metabolic disorder; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; review; subcutaneous fat; tissue distribution; Adipose Tissue; Body Weight; Hormones; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic Syndrome X; Overweight; Thiazolidinediones",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247855853

To study this effect in more detail, the adhesion energy of sputtered and galvanically strengthened copper coatings on acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymer substrate was determined as a function of storage time. The adhesion energy is initially only about 6 J/m2, because of water introduced to the interface during the galvanic deposition process. Within about 48 hours most of the water disappears leading to a relatively rapid increase of the adhesion energy to a value of approximately 23 J/m2. Thereafter, an increase, albeit at a lower rate, was still measured and at the end of the study (1008 hours) adhesion energy of about 54 J/m2 was found. The increase during the latter period is attributed to structural rearrangements taking place near the interface. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a nanocomposite based on bioresorbable polymer-poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBHV) was prepared by the incorporation of nano-sized hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) using a solution casting method. Homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix was validated by the observation of field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The dynamic mechanical properties, thermal properties, and bioactivity of the nanocomposite were examined by using varieties of techniques including dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis detector (SEM + EDXA), Fourier transforms infra-red spectrometer (FT-IR) and thin-film X-ray diffractometer (TF-XRD). The results indicated that the storage modulus (E′) of PHBHV was considerably improved with the introduction of nano-HA. For an instance of examination at 1 Hz, the PHBHV/HA (100/30) nanocomposite showed an increment of 41.2% at -50 °C and 99.1% at 75 °C in E′ as compared with the polymer matrix. It was also found that higher testing frequencies used induce more elastic-like behavior. With the increase in the amount of nano-HA, both the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the activation energy (ΔE) for the glass transition increased, while the tangent of loss angle (tan δ) decreased due to the hindrance of the nanofillers to the mobility of the polymer segments. The thermal experiments revealed that, when incorporating HA nanoparticles, the decomposition of the polymer matrix was accelerated at the initial stage but postponed thereafter. The addition of nano-HA also resulted in a decrement in the melting enthalpy of PHBHV. The in vitro investigation indicated that the nanocomposite has an improved bioactivity over the conventional one. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Nanostructures; A.

The paraffin/EG composites with the mass fraction of 2%, 4%, 7%, and 10% EG were prepared by absorbing liquid paraffin into the EG. The composite PCM with mass fraction of 10% EG was considered as form-stable allowing no leakage of melted paraffin during the solid-liquid phase change due to capillary and surface tension forces of EG. Thermal conductivity of the pure paraffin and the composite PCMs including 2, 4, 7 and 10 wt% EG were measured as 0.22, 0.40, 0.52, 0.68 and 0.82 W/m K, respectively. Melting time test showed that the increasing thermal conductivity of paraffin noticeably decreased its melting time. Furthermore, DSC analysis indicated that changes in the melting temperatures of the composite PCMs were not considerable, and their latent heat capacities were approximately equivalent to the values calculated based on the mass ratios of the paraffin in the composites. It was concluded that the composite PCM with the mass fraction of 10% EG was the most promising one for LHTES applications due to its form-stable property, direct usability without a need of extra storage container, high thermal conductivity, good melting temperature and satisfying latent heat storage capacity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These systems can simultaneously provide electrical and thermal energy, thus achieving a higher energy conversion rate of the absorbed solar radiation than plain photovoltaics. Industries show high demand of energy for both heat and electricity and the hybrid PV/T systems could be used in order to meet this requirement. In this paper the application aspects in the industry of PV/T systems with water heat extraction is presented. The systems are analyzed with TRNSYS program for three locations Nicosia, Athens and Madison that are located at different latitudes. The system comprises 300 m2 of hybrid PV/T collectors producing both electricity and thermal energy and a 10 m3 water storage tank. The work includes the study of an industrial process heat system operated at two load supply temperatures of 60 °C and 80 °C. The results show that the electrical production of the system, employing polycrystalline solar cells, is more than the amorphous ones but the solar thermal contribution is slightly lower. A non-hybrid PV system produces about 25% more electrical energy but the present system covers also, depending on the location, a large percentage of the thermal energy requirement of the industry considered. The economic viability of the systems is proven, as positive life cycle savings are obtained in the case of hybrid systems and the savings are increased for higher load temperature applications. Additionally, although amorphous silicon panels are much less efficient than the polycrystalline ones, better economic figures are obtained due to their lower initial cost, i.e., they have better cost/benefit ratio. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The strategy optimizes the control of the hybrid system minimizing the total cost throughout its lifetime. The optimized hybrid system can be composed of renewable sources (wind, PV and hydro), batteries, fuel cell, AC generator and electrolyzer. If the renewable sources produce more energy than the one required by the loads, the spare energy can be used either to charge the batteries or to produce H2 in the electrolyzer. The control strategy optimizes how the spare energy is used. If the amount of energy demanded by the loads is higher than the one produced by the renewable sources, the control strategy determines the most economical way to meet the energy deficit. The optimization of the various system control parameters is done using genetic algorithms.

A life cycle approach was used in order to cover all important emissions and sinks due to activities linked to the peat fuel production and utilisation. Radiative forcing was used to describe the greenhouse impact, and the results are given per one petajoule of energy produced. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and sinks were considered. Investigated peat production reserves were pristine peatland (fen), forestry-drained peatland, and cultivated (cropland) peatland. The considered phases of the peat utilisation chain included peat fuel production, storage, transport, combustion and the after-treatment of the cut-away peatland. After-treatment alternatives were afforestation and restoration. The greenhouse impact of a considered peat fuel chain was calculated by subtracting the emissions/sinks of a production reserve in a state of non-utilisation from the emissions/sinks of peat utilisation chain. According to the results, the most climate-friendly peat production chain is cultivated peatland-afforestation. Cultivated peatland has large greenhouse gas emissions and these emissions from the land area are ceased by the removal of the peat layer, when the area is utilised for peat fuel production. If forestrydrained peatland or pristine fen is used for peat fuel production, the greenhouse impacts of these chains are of the order of the greenhouse impact of the utilisation chain for coal.

The main idea is in the availability to use a substandard electric power generated by a wind power station for the production of the commercial hydrogen and oxygen by the electrolysis of desalinated water. The proposed way of its realisation includes the application of an advanced wind turbine combined with a novel high-pressure alkaline electrolyser which directly supplies the generated hydrogen and oxygen into storage systems, bypassing the compression stage. © 2007 Springer.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249110063

Accurate gas-phase heats of formation were obtained using coupled cluster with single and double excitations and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) valence electron calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit with additional corrections including core/valence, scalar relativistic, and spin-orbit corrections to predict the atomization energies and scaled harmonic frequencies to correct for zero point and thermal energies and estimate entropies. Computationally cheaper calculations were also performed using the G3MP2 and G3B3 variants of the Gaussian 03 method, as well as density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional. The G3MP2 heats of formation are too positive by up to ∼6 kcal/mol as compared with CCSD(T)/CBS values. The more expensive G3B3 method predicts heats of formation that are too negative as compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS values by up to 3-4 kcal/mol. DFT using the B3LYP functional and 6-311+G** basis set predict isodesmic reaction energies to within a few kcal/mol compared with the CCSD(T)/CBS method so isodesmic reactions involving BN compounds and the analogous hydrocarbons can be used to estimate heats of formation. Heats of formation of c-B 3N3H12 and c-B3N3H 6 are -95.5 and -115.5 kcal/mol at 298 K, respectively, using our best calculated CCSD(T)/CBS approach. The experimental value for c-B 3N3H6 appears to be ∼7 kcal/mol too negative. Enthalpies, entropies, and free energies are calculated for many dehydrocoupling and dehydrogenation reactions that convert BNH6 to alicyclic and cyclic oligomers and H2(g). Generally, the reactions are highly exothermic and exergonic as well because of the release of 1 or more equivalents of H2(g). For c-B3N3H12 and c-B3N3H6, available experimental data for sublimation and vaporization lead to estimates of their condensed phase 298 K heats of formation: ΔHf°[c-B3N3H 12(s)] = -124 kcal/mol and ΔHf°[c-B 3N3H6(I)] = -123 kcal/mol. The reaction thermochemistries for the dehydrocoupling of BNH6(s) to c-B 3N3H12(s) and the dehydrogenation of c-B 3N3H12-(s) to c-B3N 3H6(l) are much less exothermic compared with the gas-phase reactions due to intermolecular forces which decrease in the order BNH6 &gt; cyclo-B3N3H12 &gt; cyclo-B3N3H6. The condensed phase reaction free energies are less negative compared with the gas-phase reactions but are still too favorable for BNH6 to be regenerated from either c-B 3N3H12 or c-B3N3H 6 by just an overpressure of H2. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Band structure; Boron; Extrapolation; Molecular orbitals; Nitrogen; Perturbation techniques; Thermochemistry; Complete basis set (CBS); Gas phase heats; Perturbative triples; Scaled harmonic frequency; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250172759

It was shown that the respiration rate has a maximum value for a given type of aquatic ecosystem: 30 g detritus equivalents/m2 y for coral reef, about 12 fertile estuaries or coastal lagoons and about 5 g detritus equivalents/m2 y for fertile ponds and lakes (according to Odum [Odum, E.P., 1969. Fundamentals of Ecology, third ed. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, London and Toronto, 575 pp.]). As ecosystem in addition to the growth of biomass also can develop by increasing the ecological network and the information content of the ecosystem, it is possible for ecosystems to move further away from thermodynamic equilibrium - increase the content of eco-exergy, even the maximum respiration rate has been achieved. The result is a Michaelis-Menten like graph for eco-exergy, used for respiration versus eco-exergy storage in the ecosystem. The same shape has been found for the graph, when observations from terrestrial ecosystems are applied.

From the measurement of the laser radiation transmission through the eye tissue is evident that the injury probability of the retina is higher for the case of 1064 nm instead of 1338 nm. The main reason for that is the radiation water absorption. The Q-switched diode pumped (at 808 nm) microchip laser emitting radiation at wavelength 1338 nm was designed and realized. This laser was based on diffusion bonded crystal (diameter 5 mm) which combines in one piece the laser active part (Nd:YAG, 4 mm long) and saturable absorber (V:YAG, 0.7 mm, T0 = 85%). The microchip resonator mirrors were deposited directly on the bonded crystal surfaces, output coupler reflexivity was 90%. The constructed ""alignment-free"" Q-switched microchip laser was tested under pulsed, and CW diode pumping.

Such a process is connected with energy losses, as most frequently it is the conversion of electrical energy into another form, for example mechanical, and then back to the primal electrical form. Though, the SMES technology offers the energy storage in an unchanged form, which is advantageous primarily in the achieved efficiency. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, commonly used in the medical facilities are based on the basis of superconducting magnet. After its rejection from operation, (basically caused only by its ""software fustiness"" and not by functional faults), there is a possibility of using such devices for the energy storage purposes.

The operating characteristics of the DMFC stack are applied to control the fuel ejection time and period, enabling the system to continue operating even when the MEAs of the stack are deteriorated. The portable system is also designed with several features including water balance and quick start-up (in 5 min). Notably, the proposed system using methanol sensor-less control with injection of pure methanol can power the DVD player and notebook PC. The system specific energy and energy density following three days of operation are 362 Wh kg-1 and 335 Wh L-1, respectively, which are better than those of lithium batteries (∼150 Wh kg-1 and ∼250 Wh L-).

In addition, the microscopic characteristics of the adsorbed phase have been accomplished by calculating density profiles and adsorption energy distribution functions. The results show that the first methane and hydrogen adsorbed layers are co-incident, and there is a second hydrogen layer that is not present in the pure compound adsorption. In addition, the adsorption energy stages for hydrogen in the mixture are more favorable than those for pure hydrogen, revealing that the presence of methane molecules favors energetic hydrogen stabilization (for micropores, hydrogen adsorption energy changes are observed from 6.3 to 75%, depending on the operational conditions).

They are the primary target for gastrin and mediate the control of gastrin on acid secretion and oxyntic mucosal growth. Knowledge of the molecular biology of the ECL cell is therefore important for understanding gastric physiology. Accordingly, we wanted to identify genes that are characteristically expressed in the ECL cells and controlled by gastrin. Methods: Using Affymetrix GeneChips®, RNA expression profiles were generated from ECL cells isolated by counterflow elutriation from hyper- or hypogastrinemic rats. Contamination from non-endocrine cells was eliminated by subtraction of the expression profiles of the fundic and antral mucosa. Results: The expression of 365 genes was ECL cell characteristic. Gastrin was found to control the expression of 120 which could be divided into two major groups depending on the known or anticipated biological function of the encoded protein: genes encoding proteins involved in the secretory process and genes encoding proteins needed to generate energy for secretion. Interestingly, gastrin stimulation also increased ECL cells expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Conclusion: The ECL cell specific expression profile is reminiscent of that of neurons and other endocrine cells exhibiting high expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis, storage and secretion of neuropeptides or peptide hormones.

Recent studies about planar dynamic modeling and analysis have shown the capability of the ABS in spindle-disk assembly via counteracting the inherent imbalance. To extend the analysis to be practical, non-planar dynamic modeling are conducted in this study to re-affirm the pre-claimed capability of the ABS system, along with experiments being designed and conducted to validate the theoretical findings. Euler angles are first utilized to formulate potential and kinetic energies, which is followed by the application of Lagrange's equation to derive governing equations of motion. Numerical simulations are next carried out to explore dynamic characteristics of the system. It is found that the levels of residual runout (radial vibration), as compared to those without the ABS, are significantly reduced, while the tilting angle of the rotating assembly can be kept small with the ABS installed below the inherent imbalance of the spindle-disk system. Experimental study is also conducted, and successfully validates the aforementioned theoretical findings. It is suggested that the users of the ABS need to cautiously operate the spindle motor out of the speeds close to the resonances associated with various degrees of freedom. In this way, the ABS could hold the expected capability of reducing vibration in all important directions, most importantly in radial directions. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",,"Computer simulation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic models; Equations of motion; Kinetic energy; Vibration analysis; Nonplanar modeling; Optical disk drives; Spindle-disk system; Optical disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548258188

Unless the low spatial resolution, the systems performs very well in diagnostic imaging because they improve lesion conspicuity through their better efficiency of absorption of x-ray photons and a linear response over a wide range of radiation intensities and the inherent high contrast resolution. With digital imaging, separation of the process of x-ray detection from the image display and storage is possible and makes optimization of each of these steps possible. In this regard, applying image processing can have a high impact on image quality. Different clinical trials are available to evaluate the accuracy of digital mammography. To control the image quality, dedicated quality parameters are developed and approved by the European Commission. However, unless the experience in diagnostic imaging with digital mammography, introduction in a screening environment still has difficulties. As telemammography is an advantage of digital imaging, practical implementation of different imaging systems in one large screening network is not solved yet. The radiologist also must be aware with the different kind of images coming from the different systems. The disadvantage of digital imaging is the high cost and the sharing of digital images with other facilities which not have a similar technology.

Composition and homogeneity of these bulks were checked by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), crystallinity was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Targets for RF magnetron sputtering were prepared from pulverized bulks by hot-pressing technique. Targets were characterized the same way as bulks. Thin Ag-Sb-S films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering as potential candidates for rewritable optical data storage films. Composition and homogeneity of prepared thin films were characterized by SEM-EDX, Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) and Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA); character (amorphous/crystalline) was traced by XRD. Optical properties (spectral dependence of refractive index) were evaluated on the basis of UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and variable angle spectral ellipsometry (VASE). Crystallization abilities were studied by the measurement of thermal dependence of the prepared thin films optical transmission. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Chalcogenides; A.

In this work, the composition of the Li-Mg-N-H system has been modified by the partial substitution of Mg or Li by Na. The changes in structure and hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics have been investigated. It was found that the peak temperature for hydrogen desorption was decreased by ∼10 °C, and that the hydrogen absorption/desorption isotherms were also significantly changed. Furthermore, the activation energy calculated by the Kissinger's approach was reduced after the substitution of Mg or Li by Na.

The main element of this system is an isolating spark gap that allows synchronization of the POS modules and prevents a repeated POS closure cutting off the inductive storage from the load. A spark gap based on a multigap explosive-emission diode, which was proposed and tested earlier, is insufficiently strong electrically to be used in the Baikal project aimed at the development of a superpowerful pulsed generator. An urgent problem of increasing the electrical strength of a 1-mm-wide vacuum gap, which is a basic element of the aforementioned spark gap, is being solved. It is proposed to use electrodes of the point (anode)-plane (cathode) type that allow the electric field to be concentrated at the point-type anode, thereby increasing the gap's electrical strength. The results of experiments aimed at the study of vacuum breakdown in this system of electrodes are presented. It is shown that this design allows the gap's strength to be raised by several times, a long service life of electrodes to be ensured thanks to the low energy-deposition density, and a multichannel (i.e., low-inductance) breakdown to be stably attained. A diagram of the spark-gap prototype is presented, its breakdown characteristics are obtained, and a full-scale scheme of the spark gap is presented. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2007.",,"Electric fields; Electric spark gaps; Electrodes; Switching theory; Synchronization; Vacuum applications; Explosive emission diodes; Inhomogeneous electric field; Plasma opening switch (POS); Spark-gap prototypes; Electric breakdown",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249877996

Although there have been enormous advances in the genetic underpinnings of obesity in recent years, the pathways that lead to obesity are still not completely understood. One of the ongoing challenges is the lack of a comprehensive definition of the obese phenotype that encompasses intermediary phenotypic expressions of biological and behavioral nature. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including nutrient exposures and dietary behaviors, can influence the development of the obese phenotype. Specifically, genes play a decisive role in the etiology of childhood obesity under the permissive circumstances of an obesogenic environment (increase in energy intake with a decrease in physical activity). Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex and their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many contributors to obesity (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance, variability in body composition), as well as the dynamic nature of this issue, genomic tools must continue to be employed to evaluate all dimensions of the obesity phenotype, such as biochemical characteristics, susceptibility markers, nutrient intake, feeding practices and gene-environment interactions. Fundamental knowledge of the types of genes involved and available gene-diet interaction studies in children's obesity are reviewed. Although there is a paucity of existing literature in this specific domain of childhood obesity, ongoing investigations utilizing large cohorts have potential for providing the knowledge needed for targeted interventions in the future. © 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.","Children; Diet; Gene; Interaction; Obesity","acid phosphatase; acid phosphatase 1; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; lipoprotein; melanocortin 4 receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2; proopiomelanocortin; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 2; body mass; cardiovascular disease; childhood disease; chromosome 12q; chromosome 6q; cohort analysis; diet; energy balance; energy metabolism; epidemic; epigenetics; family study; food intake; gene expression; gene function; gene interaction; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; genotype environment interaction; genotype phenotype correlation; heredity; heterozygote detection; human; hyperlipidemia; lifestyle modification; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; marker gene; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; physical activity; prevalence; primary prevention; priority journal; protein metabolism; quantitative trait locus; review; single nucleotide polymorphism; subcutaneous fat; treatment response; twins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249821906

We compare the formation of slow light in EIT and in self-induced transparency (SIT). For SIT, soliton-like propagation of light with essentially reduced group velocity takes place because of the temporary storage of an appreciable part of the pulse energy in the atoms. For EIT, no energy of the probe is stored in the atoms. This energy is transformed to the coupling field and leaves the sample with phase velocity c without absorption. Slow light is formed by a low frequency coherence induced at the input by the probe and coupling fields in a two-quantum excitation process.

Respiration rates were measured under the following O2 concentrations: 20, 15, 10, 5, and 2% at 5 temperatures (4, 8, 10, 13, and 16 °C). The effects of 5 CO2 concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, 15%) at two O2 levels (2 and 20%) were also examined at these temperatures. Mushroom respiration increased with temperature following an Arrhenius-type relationship; activation energies and corresponding Q 10 values were calculated. Lowering the oxygen concentration significantly decreased the respiration rate. The effects of reducing O 2 levels were greater at higher storage temperatures. Both activation energies and Q10 values were lower under reduced O2 atmospheres compared with those in air. A Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics model was evaluated for describing the influence of gas concentrations on respiration rate. The effects of O2 fitted the O2 enzyme kinetics model well. CO2 exhibited small inhibitory effects on respiration of whole and sliced mushrooms, especially at low O2 concentrations and low temperatures. The enzyme model was used to predict respiration under an optimal modified atmosphere for mushrooms, and the required film O2 and CO2 permeabilities were defined for key pack design parameters. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists.","CO2 production; O2 consumption; Respiration modeling; Respiratory quotient; Storage temperature","carbon dioxide; oxygen; Agaricales; article; atmosphere; biological model; cell respiration; chemistry; food handling; food packaging; food preservation; metabolism; methodology; permeability; prediction and forecasting; temperature; Agaricales; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Respiration; Food Handling; Food Packaging; Food Preservation; Models, Biological; Oxygen; Permeability; Predictive Value of Tests; Temperature; Agaricus bisporus; Basidiomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248228215

The obesity epidemic, with a marked increase in the incidence of the metabolic syndrome leading to diabetes type 2 as well as cardiovascular complications, has stimulated considerable interest in adipose tissue biology. Moreover, several studies in different species have shown that limited energy intake is associated with less inflammation, improved biomarkers of health and a marked increase in longevity. In addition, there is convincing evidence that an optimal amount of adipose tissue is essential for many body functions such as immune response, reproduction and bone quality. Some nutrients and their metabolites are important as energy sources as well as ligands for many transcription factors expressed in adipose tissue, including all energy-providing nutrients both directly and indirectly as well as cholesterol, vitamin E and vitamin D. In particular, fatty acids can be effectively taken up by adipocytes and they can interact with several transcription factors crucial for growth, development and metabolic response, e.g. PPARα, -δ and -γ, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins1 and 2 and liver X receptors α and β). Moreover, glucose is also readily taken up and stored as fatty acids via lipogenesis in adipocytes. It is known that some metabolic signals released as proteins from adipose tissue (adipokines) are important for normal as well as pathological responses to the amount of energy stored in the adipose organ. The future challenge will be to understand the function of adipose tissue in energy homeostasis and the interplay with nutrients in order to be able to give optimal advice for the prevention and treatment of obesity. © 2007 The Author.","Adipokines; Adipose tissue; Energy homeostasis; Fatty acids; Nutrients","adipocytokine; alpha tocopherol; arachidonic acid; biological marker; cholesterol; epoxyicosatrienoic acid; fatty acid; glitazone derivative; glucose; leptin; liver X receptor alpha; liver X receptor beta; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; polyunsaturated fatty acid; resistin; transcription factor; vitamin D; adipocyte; adipose tissue; bone metabolism; caloric intake; conference paper; disease predisposition; exercise; fatty acid metabolism; glucose homeostasis; human; immune response; inflammation; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; molecular biology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutrient; obesity; pathogenesis; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; reproduction; risk assessment; tissue distribution; tissue structure; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Nutrition Physiology; Obesity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247627318

Reproductive cycles of two populations of both species were studied in two distinct locations approximately 600 km apart (Medes Islands and Cape of Palos), in order to assess interpopulation variability on a relevant geographic scale. Seasonal variation of lipid concentration levels in the gorgonian tissue was used as a tool to quantify energy storage by each studied population in order to explain possible interpopulation differences in gonadal output. Sex ratio in Medes Islands populations of both species was 1:1, while in Cape of Palos sex ratio was significantly male biased (1:7) in P. clavata, and female biased (1.7:1) in E. singularis populations. Spawning timing occurred in all cases coinciding with a marked increase in sea-water temperature in spring, and after the most successful feeding season, but comparing localities there was a clear temporal shift in the time of gametes release, appearing well linked to the shift in sea-water temperature rising in spring in both sites at the depth where populations are placed. Therefore, in this study the temperature appears as the main synchronizing factor of gonadal development within these populations. Significant differences in gonadal volume per polyp were found in both species owing mainly to differences in the number of gonads per polyp between populations, with Cape of Palos populations displaying higher values in both studied species, suggesting that the exposition to different local conditions may be reverted in a different gonadal output. But the observed patterns in lipid concentrations levels in gorgonians disable us to conclude that lipid concentration levels explain the observed differences in gonadal output found in this study. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"benthos; interpopulation variation; invertebrate; lipid; littoral environment; reproductive cycle; seasonal variation; sex ratio; spatial variation; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Gerona [Catalonia]; Medes Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; Spain; Alcyonaria; Anthozoa; Eunicella singularis; Gorgonacea; Gorgonia; Paramuricea clavata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247624505

Despite the near-optimal decorrelation and energy compaction properties, application of the SA-DCT has been rather limited, targeted nearly exclusively to video compression. In this paper, we present a novel approach to image filtering based on the SA-DCT. We use the SA-DCT in conjunction with the Anisotropic Local Polynomial Approximation-Intersection of Confidence Intervals technique, which defines the shape of the transform's support in a pointwise adaptive manner. The thresholded or attenuated SA-DCT coefficients are used to reconstruct a local estimate of the signal within the adaptive-shape support. Since supports corresponding to different points are in general overlapping, the local estimates are averaged together using adaptive weights that depend on the region's statistics. This approach can be used for various image-processing tasks. In this paper, we consider, in particular, image denoising and image deblocking and deringing from block-DCT compression. A special structural constraint in luminance-chrominance space is also proposed to enable an accurate filtering of color images. Simulation experiments show a state-of-the-art quality of the final estimate, both in terms of objective criteria and visual appearance. Thanks to the adaptive support, reconstructed edges are clean, and no unpleasant ringing artifacts are introduced by the fitted transform. © 2007 IEEE.","Anisotropic; Deblocking; Denoising; Deringing; Discrete cosine transform (DCT); Shape adaptive","Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Discrete cosine transforms; Image quality; Luminance; Polynomial approximation; Deblocking; Grayscale images; High-quality denoising; Image filtering; Shape-adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA-DCT); Color image processing; algorithm; article; artifact; artificial intelligence; color; colorimetry; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; evaluation; Fourier analysis; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; signal processing; Algorithms; Artifacts; Artificial Intelligence; Color; Colorimetry; Computer Graphics; Fourier Analysis; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247470408

However, the use of the mitochondrial inhibitor antimycin A is incompatible with platelet transfusion. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate how energy-reduced (ER) platelets could be prepared in the absence of antimycin A. Study Design and Methods: Platelets in gas-impermeable bags in glucose-free medium were kept at 22°C for 4 h to reduce energy stores and thereafter stored at 4°C (ER22-4). Controls were energy-reduced platelets without prior incubation at 22°C (ER4), and MSPs in test tubes and untreated platelets in gas-permeable bags with glucose and stored at 22°C (C22) and 4°C (C4). Results: After 48 h storage, ER22-4 were superior to C22 with respect to pH preservation (6.4 ± 0.4 vs. 5.0 ± 0.4, n = 4), platelet count (800 ± 225 vs. 650 ± 150 × 109), thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced aggregation (50 ± 15 vs. 10 ± 5%) and glycoprotein (GP)Ibα expression (60 ± 15% vs. 28 ± 15). GPIbα expression was higher in ER22-4 than in ER4, indicating that energy suppression preserved GPIbα during cold storage. Conclusion: Metabolic suppression without the use of antimycin A could be mimicked by storage of platelets in glucose-free medium in gas-impermeable bags. Energy suppression preserved GPIbα expression during storage at 4°C. © 2007 The Author(s).","Antimycin A; Cold storage; Energy; GPIb; Metabolism; Platelet; Transfusion","antimycin A1; glucose; glycoprotein Ib alpha; thrombin receptor activating peptide; article; cryopreservation; gas exchange; human; incubation time; low temperature; metabolic inhibition; pH measurement; priority journal; storage; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte count; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte preservation; Antimycin A; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Cold; Energy Metabolism; Gases; Glucose; Humans; Mitochondria; Oxygen; Permeability; Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247394275

In this work, we take specifically into account triaxial (i.e. ellipsoidal) nuclear surfaces. The deformation is specified by the usual Bohr parameters. The calculations are carried out in two stages. In the first, one calculates the representative matrix of the Hamiltonian in the Cartesian oscillator basis. In the second stage one diagonalizes this matrix with the help of subroutines of the EISPACK library. This new version calculates all the eigenvalues up to a given cutoff energy, and gives the components of the corresponding eigenfunctions.

Nature of the problem: The single particle energies and the single particle wave functions are calculated from one-body Hamiltonian including a central field of Woods-Saxon type, a spin-orbit interaction, and the Coulomb potential for the protons. We consider only ellipsoidal (triaxial) shapes. The deformation of the nuclear shape is fixed by the usual Bohr parameters (β, γ). Method of solution: The representative matrix of the Hamiltonian is built by means of the Cartesian basis of the anisotropic harmonic oscillator, and then diagonalized by a set of subroutines of the EISPACK library. Two quadrature methods of Gauss are employed to calculate, respectively, the integrals of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, and the integral defining the Coulomb potential. Restrictions: There are two restrictions for the code: The number of the major shells of the basis does not have to exceed Nmax = 26. For the largest values of Nmax (∼23-26), the diagonalization takes the major part of the running time, but the global run-time remains reasonable. Typical running time: (With full optimization in the project settings of the Compaq Visual Fortran on Windows XP) With Nmax = 23, for the neutrons case, and for both parities, the running time is about 40 sec on the P4 computer at 2.6 GHz. In this case, the calculation of the matrix elements takes only about 17 sec. If all unbound states are required, the runtime becomes larger. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The machine is part of an energy storage flywheel, to be used as the peak-power unit in a hybrid electric passenger bus. To reduce the induced no-load losses due to the high rotational speed of the flywheel, the slots in the stator are made not of iron but of a nonmagnetic plastic material. This results in an air gap winding with a stator yoke consisting of stacked circular laminations. The analytical model includes the effect of the winding distribution on the field, the fact that it is in the air gap, and the effect of the eddy-current reaction field of the shielding cylinder. The two-dimensional magnetic field is solved in six defined machine layers and useful machine quantities are derived directly from it, leading to the machine voltage equation.

A mathematical dynamical model is proposed to evaluate the energy performance of a solar chimney with 24 cm concrete wall as storage surface for solar radiation. The results obtained with the proposed model are coherent with several models response and experiments reported on solar chimneys. As well, the difference of the proposed model to others is the incorporation of an unsteady state and the inclusion of thermal inertia. The results show that for a 2 m height and width of air channel of 14.5 cm, 0.011 kg/s air mass flow rate is obtained for 450 W/m2. The 24 cm thickness concrete wall, reaches its greater temperature 2 h later with respect to the maximum ambient temperature, maintaining its temperature over the beginning of the night, so nocturnal ventilation is achieved. The model shows the interest in continuing investigating on this cooling techniques and to built a solar chimney with thermal inertia for future experimental research. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This work explores different models for a solar domestic water heating system located near Viña del Mar, Chile, in order to improve model prediction accuracy over some existing alternatives. The main approach is semi-physical modeling, which combines phenomenological modeling and system identification. The former helps to organize in a conceptual form the available system knowledge, and the latter allows to adjust that knowledge into a particular model structure for a working system. Thus, with semi-physical modeling we take advantage of a basic property of classical identification models: they are linear-in-the-parameters, but may contain nonlinear regressors. Hence, while physical knowledge suggests nonlinear data regressors, system identification adjusts linear weighting parameters. The models proposed here incorporate nonlinearities based on physical system knowledge and they include, among other inputs and disturbances, air wind speed (v) and air relative humidity (RH), signals not usually considered in these model structures. Specifically, this work shows model predictive accuracy of storage tanks temperature for three model types: semi-physical, state-space and, a combination of semi-physical and a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer and eight neurons. The best models found here, according to prediction accuracy, are of semi-physical nature, and are obtained using stepwise regressor elimination algorithms which retain disturbances such as v and RH. Additionally, final models are validated with classical statistical tests such as AIC and correlation analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Feed availability and quality are serious constraints to livestock production in Ethiopia in general, and in its Northern Highlands in particular. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between feed availability and quality and live weight gain, milk and manure production and the soil C balance in Teghane, Northern Highlands of Ethiopia. The so-called JAVA model procedure, that essentially predicts metabolizable energy intake and animal production on the basis of feed quality and quantity, has been used and linked to a soil carbon balance. Forages were ranked according to their quality (on the basis of metabolizable energy intake by livestock) in descending order. Rations were formulated by stepwise including components of increasingly lower quality to calculate the trade-offs between feed quantity and quality. In the model, the soil C balance was described in relation to soil organic matter decomposition, C input from roots, grazing and/or harvesting losses, feed residues and manure. Moreover, an analysis of monetary values of live weight gain/loss, manure and draught power is included. The results of the model showed that mean daily live weight gain and milk production per TLU continuously increased with decreasing herd size, while total annual live weight gain reached a maximum (62 Mg) at the use of the 30% best feeds and a herd size of 630 TLU. Soil C balance at this level of feed use is negative and deteriorates with increasing feed use. The model estimated an optimum herd size of 926 TLU to attain the maximum combined monetary value of live weight gain, manure and draught power at 50% feed use. Actual herd size in the study area was 1506 TLU. Our results indicate that in areas where feeds of very different quality are available, maximum benefits from meat and/or milk production and soil C balance can be attained by selective utilization of the best quality feeds, through a storage and carry-over system. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Responses by citizens are described in relation to responses by professionally involved actors. Interviews with members of the government, industry and environmental NGOs showed that these professional actors are interested in starting up storage projects, based on thorough evaluation processes, including discussions on multi-actor working groups. As appeared from a survey among citizens living near a potential storage site (N=103), public attitudes in general were slightly positive, but attitudes towards storage nearby were slightly negative. The general public appeared to have little knowledge about CO2-storage, and have little desire for more information. Under these circumstances, trust in the professional actors is particularly important. NGOs were found to be trusted most, and industry least by the general public. Trust in each of the three actors appeared to depend on perceived competence and intentions, which in turn were found to be related to perceived similarity of goals and thinking between trustee and trustor.

The basic technology is straightforward, although there are a variety of various types of SWH systems. In the performance assessment of SWH systems, energy analysis (first law) method has been widely used, while the number of the studies on exergetic assessment is relatively low. The SWH system investigated consists of mainly three parts, namely a flat plate solar collector, a heat exchanger (storage tank) and a circulating pump. The main objectives of the present study are as follows, differing from the previously conducted ones: (i) to model and assess SWH systems using exergy analysis (second law) method as a whole, (ii) to investigate the effect of varying water inlet temperature to the collector on the exergy efficiencies of the SWH system components, (iii) to study some thermodynamic parameters (fuel depletion ratio, relative irreversibility, productivity lack and exergetic factor) and exergetic improvement potential, and (iv) to propose and present an exergy efficiency curve similar to the thermal efficiency curve for solar collectors. The system performance is evaluated based on the experimental data of the Izmir province, Turkey, which is given as an illustrative example. Exergy destructions (or irreversibilities) as well as exergy efficiency relations are determined for each of the SWH system components and the whole system. Exergy efficiency values on a product/fuel basis are found to range between from 2.02 to 3.37%, and 3.27 to 4.39% at a dead (reference) state temperature of 32.77 °C, which is an average of ambient temperatures at eight test runs from 1.10 to 3.35 p.m., for the solar collector and entire SWH system, respectively. An exergy efficiency correlation for the solar collector studied was also presented to determine its exergetic performance. It is expected that the model presented here would be beneficial to the researchers, government administration, and engineers working in the area of SWH systems for residential applications. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Tabs are increasingly used for energy efficient and economical cooling and heating of commercial buildings. Thereby, the building structure is used as thermal storage allowing the use of renewable energy sources. Based on a simulation study for a typical office building the aspects of thermal comfort, maximum permissible heat gains in the room and the re-cooling of the building mass are analysed. It is shown that depending on the maximum permissible daily room temperature amplitude with tabs typical heat gain profiles with peak loads up to around 50 W/m2 floor area can be managed. However, the transitional (mid-season) periods with already high solar gains and still restricted comfort range, in most cases will be decisive for the dimensioning of tabs, thus limiting maximum loads to lower values. The results also show that processes on the room side are almost unaffected from the processes on the supply side. In the cooling case, this allows for the re-cooling period of the fabric being extended to 24 h a day with accordingly ""high"" supply temperatures and peak load reductions of up to 50%.

The method combines ingredients from process networks, thermodynamics and systems theory to derive robust decentralized controllers that will ensure complete plant stability. As a first step, the considered process system is decomposed into abstract mass and energy inventory networks. In this framework, conceptual inventory control loops are then designed for the mass and energy layers to guarantee that the states of the plant, both in terms of extensive and intensive properties, will converge to a compact convex region defined by constant inventories. This result by itself does not ensure the convergence of intensive variables to a desired operation point as complex dynamic phenomena such as multiplicities may appear in the invariant set. In order to avoid these phenomena, thermodynamics naturally provides the designer, in these convex regions, with a legitimate storage or Lyapunov function candidate, the entropy, that can be employed to ensure global stability. Based on this, the control structure design procedure is completed with the realization of the conceptual inventory and intensive variable control loops over the available degrees of freedom in the system. To that purpose, both PI and feedback linearization control are employed. The different aspects of the proposed methodology will be illustrated on a non-isothermal chemical reaction network. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The CO2 mitigation cost indicates the minimum economic incentive required (e.g. in the form of a carbon tax) to make the cost of a less carbon intensive system equal to the cost of a reference system. If carbon (as CO2) is captured from biomass-fired energy systems, the systems could in principle be negative CO2 emitting energy systems. CO2 capture and storage from energy systems however, leads to reduced energy efficiency, higher investment costs, and increased costs of end products compared with energy systems in which CO2 is vented. Here, we have analyzed biomass-fired cogeneration plants based on steam turbine technology (CHP-BST) and integrated gasification combined cycle technology (CHP-BIGCC). Three different scales were considered to analyze the scale effects. Logging residues was assumed as biomass feedstock. Two methods were used to estimate and compare the CO2 mitigation cost. In the first method, the cogenerated power was credited based on avoided power production in stand-alone plants and in the second method the same reference output was produced from all systems.

The utilization of energy from wind is becoming increasingly attractive and is being widely used/disseminated for substitution of oil-produced energy, and eventually to minimize atmospheric degradation. Quantitative assessment of wind resource is an important driving element in successful establishment of a wind farm/park at a given location. More often than not, windenergy resources are relatively better along coastlines. In the present study, hourly mean wind-speed data of the period 1986-1997 recorded at the solar radiation and meteorological station, Dhahran (26°32′ N, 50°13′ E, eastern coastal plain of Saudi Arabia), have been analyzed to present different characteristics of wind speed in considerable depth such as: yearly, monthly, diurnal variations of wind speed, etc. The long-term monthly average wind speeds for Dhahran range from 4.2-6.4 m/s. More importantly, the study deals with impact of hub height on wind energy generation. Attention has also been focussed on monthly average daily energy generation from different sizes of commercially available wind machines (150, 250, 600 kW) to identify optimum wind machine size from energy production point of view. It has been found that for a given 6 MW wind farm size, at 50 m hub height, cluster of 150 kW wind machines yields about 48% more energy as compared to 600 kW wind machines. Literature shows that commercial/residential buildings in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated 10-40% of the total electric energy generated. So, concurrently, as a case study, attempt has been made to investigate/examine the potential of utilizing hybrid (wind+diesel) energy conversion systems to meet the load requirements of hundred typical 2-bedroom residential buildings (with annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh). The hybrid systems considered in the present case-study consist of different combinations of wind machines (of various capacities), supplemented with battery storage and diesel back-up. The deficit energy generated from the back-up diesel generator and the number of operational hours of the diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh have also been presented. The diesel back-up system is operated at times when the power generated from wind energy conversion systems (WECS) fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is depleted. The evaluation of hybrid system shows that with seven 150 kW WECS and three days of battery storage, the diesel back-up system has to provide 17.5% of the load demand. However, in absence of battery storage, about 37% of the load needs to be provided by the diesel system. © 2007.","Battery; Hub-height; Residential loads; Wind machines; Wind-diesel integration","Electric loads; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Offshore power plants; Power generation; Quantitative assessment; Residential loads; Wind resource assessment; Wind speed; Wind-diesel integration; Wind power; Electric loads; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Offshore power plants; Power generation; Wind power; assessment method; coastal plain; energy conservation; energy market; energy resource; global warming; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon reserve; quantitative analysis; renewable resource; wind power; wind velocity; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247547011

In other words, objects with different absorption properties generate photoacoustic signals with different frequency contents. Therefore, effects of absorption properties on photoacoustic spectral characteristics need to be fully understood in order to devise optimal setup for photoacoustic signal detection. The main purpose of this paper is therefore to numerically investigate such effects using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. Photoacoustic signal generation can be described by the thermal conduction equation, the continuity and the Navier-Stokes equations, and the state equations in the system. To reduce computational and storage requirements, an axis-symmetrical cylindrical coordinate system with the z-axis parallel to the laser irradiation direction is adopted in our study. Moreover, the MacCormack scheme, which is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time, and the first-order Mur absorbing boundary conditions are introduced to implement the FDTD code. The absorption coefficient range from 1 cm-1 to 100 cm-1 and the signals are detected in forward modes. Results show that the peak frequency of the signal with absorbing coefficient 1cm-1, 10cm-1, 20cm-1, 30cm-1, 50cm-1, and 100 cm-1 is 2.4MHz, 2.4MHz, 4.2MHz, 4.8MHz, 6MHz, and 7.8MHz when detected forwardly. Note that although the peak acoustic frequency increases with the absorption coefficient, but the linear relationship between the two parameters does not hold. The results also imply that photoacoustic image contrast can be improved by properly selecting the receiver signal bandwidth. Assuming two objects with absorption coefficient of 10cm-1 and 100cm-1, respectively, it is estimated that a 11.34dB contrast improvement is achievable in the forward mode, while a 8.13dB improvement is possible in the backward mode.","Absorption coefficient; Finite-difference time-domain FDTD; Photoacoustic signal","Finite difference method; Light absorption; Natural frequencies; Signal processing; Time domain analysis; Absorption coefficient; Acoustic frequency; Photoacoustic signal; Photoacoustic effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247333072

Fragmentation on the microsecond time scale was observed and assigned to statistical dissociation. Good fits to the decay spectra were obtained with a model based on microcanonical rate constants of the Arrhenius type with activation energies and preexponential factors for the dissociation that agree well with literature values. In accordance with results from other groups, dT2+ was found to have the longest lifetime among the cations. The importance of decay processes faster than the microsecond time scale is elucidated by a comparison between the total ion beam depletion and that due to the observed statistical decay. We find that such processes play a major role for all of the dinucleotides, being more than 25 times more probable than the microsecond statistical dissociation for dA2+, dG2+, and dC2+, about 10 times for dT2+, and between 2 and 6 times for dA2- and dT2-. For the cations, we ascribe these processes to nonstatistical dissociation prior to randomization of the excitation energy among all degrees of freedom whereas direct photoelectron detachment may play a role for the anions. Thus, our data indicate that the propensity for nonstatistical dissociation increases upon nucleobase protonation. Consistent with this trend, the propensity is less for dT2+ than for the other dinucleotide cations because the phosphoric acid group competes with thymine for the proton. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Deprotonation; Photodissociation; Rate constants; Statistical mechanics; Storage rings; DNA dinucleotides; Photon absorption; Statistical decay; Statistical dissociation; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247229116

We found that none of the investigated nanoporous carbon materials satisfy the US Department of Energy goal of volumetric density and mass storage for automotive application (6 wt% and 45 kg H2 m-3) at considered storage condition. Our calculations indicate that quasi-periodic icosahedral nanoporous carbon material can reach the 6 wt% at 3.8 MPa and 77 K, but the volumetric density does not exceed 24 kg H2 m-3. The bundle of single-walled carbon nanotubes can store only up to 4.5 wt%, but with high volumetric density of 42 kg H2 m-3. All investigated nanoporous carbon materials are not effective against compression above 20 MPa at 77 K because the adsorbed density approaches the density of the bulk fluid.

Obesity is associated with blunted skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, accumulation of bioactive lipids and insulin resistance. The factors contributing to defects in fatty acid metabolism are not understood but new data demonstrates that increased TNFα in obesity increases protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), which in turn suppresses the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical regulator of energy metabolism.1 These data identify a novel mechanism by which inflammation in obesity is a precursor to defects in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation that generates a vicious cycle exacerbating the development of insulin resistance. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.","ACC; AMPK; Macrophage; Protein phosphatase 2C; Skeletal muscle; TNFα","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; phosphoprotein phosphatase; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2c; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; fatty acid metabolism; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; review; signal transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247489726

Exposure to gamma radiation doses from 60Co was varied between 1 and 9 kGy. The glow curves obtained showed emission peak temperatures lying between 480 and 530 K and were found to be dose dependent. The emission peak temperature for each dose was found to shift towards high temperature as the dose increased indicating a non-first order kinetics, which could be attributed to the creation of deep level defects, caused by the irradiation. The reproducibility tests carried out on the samples showed that the sample preparation as well as the TL response of the barium titanate under gamma irradiation is reproducible and under acceptable limit. The dose response curve showed a good linearity over the dose range examined. The fading characteristics indicated that the TL spectra alter with storage time after irradiation and this has been attributed to the creation of traps of different energy level by irradiation and clustering effect leading to tunneling. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study has been done using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for modeling storage and separation of hydrogen-methane mixtures in idealized SWNTs bundles. These mixtures have been studied at several pressures, up to 12 MPa. We have found that the values of the stored volumetric energy and equilibrium selectivity greatly depend on the chiral vector (i.e., pore diameter) of the nanotubes. The bundle formed by [5,4] SWNTs (nanotube diameter of 6.2 Å) can be regarded as a threshold value. Below that value the densification of hydrogen or methane is negligible. Bundles with wider nanotube diameter (i.e., 12.2, 13.6, 24.4 Å) seem to be promising nanomaterials for hydrogen-methane storage and separation at 293 K. SWNTs with pore diameters greater than 24.4 Å (i.e., [18,18]) are less efficient for both on-board vehicle energy storage and separation of hydrogen-methane mixture at 293 K with pressures up to 12 MPa. SWNTs comprised of cylindrical pores of 8.2 and 6.8 Å in diameter (equivalent chiral vector [6,6] and [5,5], respectively) are the most promising for separation of the hydrogen-methane mixture at room temperature, with the former selectively adsorbing methane and the latter selectively adsorbing hydrogen. We observed that inside the pores of [6,6] nanotubes absorbed methane forms a quasi-one-dimensional crystal when the system has thermalized. The average intermolecular distance of such a crystal is smaller than the one of liquid methane in bulk at 111.5 K, therefore exhibiting the quasione-dimensional system clear compression characteristics. On the other hand, for a smaller nanotube diameter of 6.8 Å the hydrogen can enter into the tubes and methane remaining in bulk. We found, that in the interior of [5,5] nanotubes adsorbed/compressed hydrogen forms a quasi-one-dimensional crystal. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Binary mixtures; Liquid methane; Molecular dynamics; Nanostructured materials; Nanotubes; Hydrogen-methane mixtures; Room temperature; Threshold value; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247386362

Post combustion CO2 stripping is less efficient than precombustion stripping but is cheaper to implement an can be retrofitted to existing plants. Oxyfuel is still in the experimental phase.

This energy production can be carried out by means of hydroelectric plants with storage capacity, or by means of hydroelectric plants without that capacity (denominated flowing hydroelectric plants). Hydroelectric power stations of flowing type, object of this article, use the circulating flows along the river, presenting the necessary buildings and infrastructures for their conduction and utilization, but without presenting in their conception water storage systems. This type of power stations are designed and automated to operate between certain flow limits, working with constant water jump. The flow is adapted to the existent hydrological availability at any moment, presenting an appropriate operation to the behavior of the flow in the river. That is, the station produces energy when available flows exist that can be subtracted from the river inside the margins of admission of the power station: the “equipment flow” and a minimum operation flow called “technical minimum flow”. The optimization procedure proposed and developed in this work permits us to take advantage of the times of low-level flow (low water level) for production of electrical energy. The objective is to obtain that the turbine is able to work even below levels corresponding to the “technical minimal flow”. The volume used in the turbine is then expanded; that implies a higher energy production for the same use, as well as an amplification of the operation period, which implies an improvement of their efficiency. In this investigation work, the algorithms of regulation of the power station for every different flow have been devised and developed, as well as the increments in the production of the power station. © 2007, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Different amounts of PVP (2-30% w/w) were mixed thoroughly with an acrylic PSA. Films with different thicknesses (10, 40, and 70 μm) were prepared by casting the formulation on a poly(ethylene terephtalate) film. Peel tests were carried out by adhesive-coated tapes of 25 mm width on the stainless steel substrate at least for three samples. The samples were investigated by Fourier transmittance infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique and surface tension and viscoelastic properties measurements. The peel strength values are directly dependent on the thickness of adhesive. Also, results showed that due to the polar part of blend in 2 %w/w PVP, the peel strength has the maximum value. At higher concentrations of PVP, due to its surface migration, reduction in peel strength was more pronounced. The parallel investigations on the viscoelastic properties of blends showed that the storage modulus shifts to higher values at higher concentrations of PVP. Therefore, the bonding step becomes difficult and the peel strength decreases significantly.","FTIR; Peel strength; PSA; PVP; Surface energy","Acrylics; Adhesives; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Interfacial energy; Ketones; Polyethylene terephthalates; Polymer films; Adhesive thickness; Modulus shifts; Peel strength; Vinyl resins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547220581

Electrophysical processes proceeding in a feed circuit containing a semiconductor opening switch and intermediate inductive energy storage are also considered. It is shown that the semiconductor opening switch controls the amount of energy in the inductive storage, and a high-voltage short prepulse with a peak pump power density of ∼1 MW cm-3 appearing during the current interruption can produce a volume-discharge plasma and create the inverse population for the time ∼10 ns, providing the conditions for efficient pumping of the active medium from the main capacitor. The time dependences of the pump and emission powers, the concentrations of electrons, excited xenon atoms, HCl (v) molecules in excited vibrational states and of the ionisation, recombination, and attachment rates are calculated. Kinetic processes determining the parameters of laser radiation are analysed. The output energy up to 1.0 J is obtained for 90-ns (FWHM) pulses with the efficiency up to 4.0 % with respect to the pump energy. The maximum output power was 11 MW for the lasing efficiency of 4.7% with respect to the pump power.

An optimization and technical parameter study for a CO2 capture process from flue gas of a 600 MWe bituminous coal fired power plant, based on absorption/desorption process with MEA solutions, using ASPEN Plus with the RADFRAC subroutine, was performed. This optimization aimed to reduce the energy requirement for solvent regeneration, by investigating the effects of CO2 removal percentage, MEA concentration, lean solvent loading, stripper operating pressure and lean solvent temperature. Major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the lean solvent loading, the amine solvent concentration as well as the stripper operating pressure. A minimum thermal energy requirement was found at a lean MEA loading of 0.3, using a 40 wt.% MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa, resulting in a thermal energy requirement of 3.0 GJ/ton CO2, which is 23% lower than the base case of 3.9 GJ/ton CO2. Although the solvent process conditions might not be realisable for MEA due to constraints imposed by corrosion and solvent degradation, the results show that a parametric study will point towards possibilities for process optimisation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Since CO2-containing hydrates are considerably more stable thermodynamically than methane hydrates, if we find a way to replace the original hydrate-bound hydrocarbons by the CO2, two goals can be accomplished at the same time: safe storage of carbon dioxide in hydrate reservoirs, and in situ release of hydrocarbon gas. We have applied the techniques of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a tool to visualize the conversion of CH4 hydrate within Bentheim sandstone matrix into the CO2 hydrate. Corresponding model systems have been simulated using the Phase Field Theory approach. Our theoretical studies indicate that the kinetic behaviour of the systems closely resembles that of CO2 transport through an aqueous solution. We have interpreted this to mean that the hydrate and the matrix mineral surfaces are separated by liquid-containing channels. These channels will serve as escape routes for released natural gas, as well as distribution channels for injected CO2. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The action of tendons in storing and releasing energy is mainly seen in sports activities with stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs). The more intense the SSC movements are (jumping-like activities), the more frequently tendon problems are observed. High SSC movements impose high loads on tendons. Consequently, tendons that frequently deal with high SSC motion require a high energy-absorbing capacity to store and release this large amount of elastic energy. As the elasticity of tendon structures is a leading factor in the amount of stored energy, prevention and rehabilitation programmes for tendon injuries should focus on increasing this tendon elasticity in athletes performing high SSC movements.

In Melbourne, Australia, urban densities are planned to increase under a new strategic urban plan. Using the eddy covariance technique, this study aimed to determine the impact of increasing housing density on the surface energy balance and to investigate the relationship to Melbourne's local climate. Across four sites of increasing housing density and varying land surface characteristics (three urban and one rural), it was found that the partitioning of available energy was similar at all three urban sites. Bowen ratios were consistently greater than 1 throughout the year at the urban sites (often as high as 5) and were higher than the rural site (less than 1) because of reduced evapotranspiration. The greatest difference among sites was seen in urban heat storage, which was influenced by urban canopy complexity, albedo, and thermal admittance. Resulting daily surface temperatures were therefore different among the urban sites, yet differences in above-canopy daytime air temperatures were small because of similar energy partitioning and efficient mixing. However, greater nocturnal temperatures were observed with increasing density as a result of variations in heat storage release that are in part due to urban canyon morphology. Knowledge of the surface energy balance is imperative for urban planning schemes because there is a possibility for manipulation of land surface characteristics for improved urban climates. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Boundary layers; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Housing; Urban planning; Eddy covariance technique; Urban canyon morphology; Urban surface characteristics; Climatology; air temperature; boundary layer; Bowen ratio; energy balance; evapotranspiration; spatial variation; surface energy; surface temperature; temporal variation; urban climate; urban planning; Australasia; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249082079

Especially visceral adipose tissue has been implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Factors secreted by the stromal-vascular fraction contribute to the secretome and modulate adipokine secretion by adipocytes. Therefore, we aimed at the characterization of the adipose tissue secretome rather than the adipocyte cell secretome. The presence of serum proteins and intracellular proteins from damaged cells, released during culture, may dramatically influence the dynamic range of the sample and thereby identification of secreted proteins. Part of the study was therefore dedicated to the influence of the culture setup on the quality of the final sample. Visceral adipose tissue was cultured in five experimental setups, and the quality of resulting samples was evaluated in terms of protein concentration and protein composition. The best setup involved one wash after the 1st h in culture followed by two or three additional washes within an 8-h period, starting after overnight culture. Thereafter tissue was maintained in culture for an additional 48-114 h to obtain the final sample. For the secretome experiment, explants were cultured in media containing L-[13C6 15N2]lysine to validate the origin of the identified proteins (adipose tissue- or serum-derived). In total, 259 proteins were identified with ≥99% confidence. 108 proteins contained a secretion signal peptide of which 70 incorporated the label and were considered secreted by adipose tissue. These proteins were classified into five categories according to function. This is the first study on the (human) adipose tissue secretome. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of adipose tissue in whole body energy metabolism and related disease. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"cell protein; plasma protein; signal peptide; adipose tissue; adult; article; cell culture; cell damage; culture medium; energy metabolism; explant; female; human; human tissue; intraabdominal fat; liquid chromatography; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein determination; protein secretion; structural proteomics; surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; tissue culture; validation process; Adipose Tissue; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Lysine; Middle Aged; Proteins; Proteomics; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Tissue Culture Techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247352515

Adipose tissue not only acts as an energy store, but also behaves like an endocrine organ, synthesising and secreting numerous hormones and cytokines. Angiotensin II (ANG II) is the biologically active component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is present in adipose tissue and evidence suggests that ANG II is intimately linked to obesity. Indeed, ANG II increases fat cell growth and dif-ferentiation, increases synthesis, uptake and storage of fatty acids and triglycerides and possibly inhibits lipolysis. Evidence obtained using genetically modified animals has shown that the amount of body fat is directly related to the amount of ANG II, i.e., animals with low levels of ANG II have reduced fat stores while animals with ex-cessive ANG II have increased fat stores. In humans, epidemiological evidence has shown that body fat is corre-lated with angiotensinogen, a precursor of ANG II, or other components of the RAS. Furthermore, blocking the production and/or actions of ANG II with drugs or natural substances decreases body fat. The decrease in body fat caused by such treatments predominantly occurs in abdominal fat depots and appears to be independent of energy intake and digestibility. Clearly, ANG II has an important role in the accumulation of body fat and the possibility exists that treatment of obesity will be enhanced by the use of natural or synthetic substances that in-terfere with ANG II.","Adipose; Angiotensin; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Body fat; Obesity","angiotensin II; angiotensin receptor; adipose tissue; conference paper; drug antagonism; human; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Adipose Tissue; Angiotensin II; Humans; Obesity; Receptors, Angiotensin; Renin-Angiotensin System; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047154582

The astaxanthin (ASX) binding and structural stability of OR were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD). The apo-OR (without astaxanthin) shows a single, high affinity binding site for ASX (KD = 0.5 μM). The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by ASX indicates that about 22% are near the carotenoid-binding site in a non-polar environment, as indicated by tryptophan resonance energy transfer to the ligand. Secondary structure (α + β) was virtually not affected by cofactor removal. Holo-OR shows unusually high thermal stability. The removal of ASX does not affect the thermal or chemical stability of the quaternary structure. In conclusion, although subtle changes were observed, ASX is not essential for OR stability, unlike most invertebrate carotenoproteins.

Transfers in a rectangular cavity configuration translating hydrodynamic and thermal phenomena are numerically predicted by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in transient regime. The objective of this numerical study is to give a fine knowledge of the hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics during energy storage in an enclosure filled with water stratified by downward salinity gradient. The enclosure is divided into three zones with different salinity level such as salt gradient pond (SGP). Water is heated by a heating device at the bottom of the cavity. The Navier-Stokes, energy and mass equations are discretized using finite-volume method, and a two-dimensional analysis of the hydrodynamic and thermal behaviors generated in transient regime in the cavity are performed. The mathematical modelling has allowed the prediction of the storage performances by developing parametrical study in view to search the convective heat transfer coefficient at the bottom of the enclosure. Velocity vector fields show the presence of recirculation zones caused only in the lower region and permit to explain the increase of the temperature in the lower convective zone (LCZ). This study shows also the importance of the salinity in the preservation of the high temperature in the bottom of the cavity, and the important reduction of the phenomenon of thermal transfer across the non-convective zone (NCZ). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The major components of the dryer are biomass burner (with a rectangular duct and flue gas chimney), collector-storage thermal mass and drying chamber (with a conventional solar chimney). The thermal mass was placed in the top part of the biomass burner enclosure. The dryer was fabricated using simple materials, tools and skills, and it was tested in three modes of operation (solar, biomass and solar-biomass) by drying twelve batches of fresh pineapple (Ananas comosus), with each batch weighing about 20 kg. Meteorological conditions were monitored during the dehydration process. Moisture and vitamin C contents were determined in both fresh and dried samples. Results show that the thermal mass was capable of storing part of the absorbed solar energy and heat from the burner. It was possible to dry a batch of pineapples using solar energy only on clear days. Drying proceeded successfully even under unfavorable weather conditions in the solar-biomass mode of operation. In this operational mode, the dryer reduced the moisture content of pineapple slices from about 669 to 11% (db) and yielded a nutritious dried product. The average values of the final-day moisture-pickup efficiency were 15%, 11% and 13% in the solar, biomass and solar-biomass modes of operation respectively. It appears that the solar dryer is suitable for preservation of pineapples and other fresh foods. Further improvements to the system design are suggested. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Within a single year, long-distance migrants undergo a minimum of four cycles of fuel storage and depletion because their migrations have at least one stopover. Each cycle includes an almost twofold change in body mass (m b). Pervasive predation threats beg the question whether escape flight abilities keep up with such large changes in mb. 2. We derive aerodynamic predictions how pectoral muscle mass (mpm) should change with mb to maintain constant relative flight power. 3. We tested these predictions with data on red knot Calidris canutus, a long-distance migrating wader that breeds in arctic tundra and winters in temperate and tropical coastal areas. We focused on the subspecies C. c. islandica. 4. m pm varied with mb in a piecewise manner. In islandica knots with mb ≤ 148 g, the slope (1.06) was indistinguishable from the prediction (1.25). In heavy knots (mb &gt; 148 g) the slope was significantly lower (0.63), yielding a mpm 0.81 times lower than predicted at pre-departure weights (210 g). 5. Manoeuvrability tests showed that above 160 g, knots were increasingly unable to make a 90° angle turn. This is consistent with mpm being increasingly smaller than predicted. 6.

Due to the relatively low power output of piezoelectric materials, energy storage devices are used to accumulate harvested energy for intermittent use. Piezoelectric energy harvesting circuits have two schemes: one-stage and two-stage energy harvesting. A one-stage energy harvesting scheme includes a conventional diode bridge rectifier and an energy storage device. In recent years, two-stage energy harvesting circuits have been explored. While the results shown in previous research and development are promising, there are still some issues that need to be studied. Energy storage devices such as rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors have different cell voltages. Moreover, the storage cells can be connected in series to increase the voltage range. The storage device voltage is an important factor that influences the energy harvesting efficiency. This paper will study the efficiencies of the energy harvesting circuits considering the storage device voltages. For one-stage energy harvesting, expressions are derived to calculate the efficiencies towards different storage device voltages and verified by experiments. For two-stage energy harvesting circuits, theoretical efficiency expressions are derived and verified by PSPICE simulations. These two energy harvesting schemes are also compared. The results show that a one-stage energy harvesting scheme can achieve higher efficiency than the two-stage scheme towards a range of energy storage voltages. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer simulation; Electric rectifiers; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectricity; Secondary batteries; One-stage energy harvesting; Piezoelectric energy harvesting circuits; Storage device voltage; Voltage range; Networks (circuits)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947119725

Two kinds of forecasting may be performed: short term and medium to long term. This work is focused on monthly prediction, which is useful for the maintenance planning of grids and as market research for electricity producers and resellers. The timed series of monthly electric energy demands presents a rising tendency due to the influence of economic and technological evolution on the electric market. Embedded in this general trend is a fluctuation caused by the difference in demand from month to month. This paper proposes the extraction of that trend to perform separate predictions of both tendency and fluctuation with neural networks, which will be summed up to obtain the series forecasting.

Secondly, the ice-storage system was renovated, which is the main theme of this paper. Lastly, the completely renovated AC system was commissioned and fine-tuned to achieve system optimization. The benefits of this renovation process have been assessed technically and economically in order to justify its potential for wider engineering applications.

The most important stages during manufacturing of grinding tools are: the coverage of the abrasive by wetting agent and proper hardening. The fillers play a very important role during the work of the grinding tools-they collect the heat and prevent the melting of resin. The surface properties of the components of grinding tools influence the interactions between them and the properties of the final product. Surface properties of different kinds of the fillers were examined by means of inverse gas chromatography (IGC). Dispersive component of the surface free energy γSD at relative humidities: 30%, 60% and 90% and at various temperatures: 278, 283, 288 and 293 K was determined. It provided the data on stability of the fillers during their storage and/or weathering. The influence of the type of the filler on the hardening process by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also studied. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to search the influence of the temperature and humidity onto the γSD values for various fillers. This analysis showed that changes of the surface properties of fillers are significant at higher humidity close to 90%. Furthermore, PCA demonstrated that the type of filler does not influence meaningfully the hardening process. This approach has shown usefulness of IGC and calorimetric methods in studying the properties of abrasive articles as well as PCA in the interpretation of physicochemical characteristics of abrasive materials. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We have used path-integral grand canonical Monte Carlo and classical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for the investigation of the ""quantumness"" of hydrogen at 77 K adsorbed in slit-like carbon nanopores up to 1 MPa. We find that classical simulations overpredict the hydrogen uptake in carbon nanopores due to neglect of the quantum delocalization. Such disagreement of both simulation methods depends on the slit-like carbon pore size. However, the differences between the final uptakes of hydrogen computed from both classical and quantum simulations are not large due to a similar effective size of quantum/classical hydrogen molecules in carbon nanospaces. For both types of molecular simulations, the volumetric density of stored energy in optimal carbon nanopores exceeds 6.4 MJ dm -3 (i.e., 45 kg m-3; Department of Energy target for 2010). In contrast to the hydrogen adsorption isotherms, we found a large reduction of isosteric enthalpy of adsorption computed from the quantum Feynman's path-integral simulations in comparison to the classical values at 77 K and pressures up to 1 MPa. Depression of the quantum isosteric enthalpy of adsorption depends on the slit-like carbon pore size. For the narrow pores (pore width H ∈ [0.59-0.7] nm), the reduction of the quantum isosteric enthalpy of adsorption at zero coverage is around 50% in comparison to the classical one. We observed new phenomena called, by us, the quantum confinement-inducing polymer shrinking. In carbon nanospaces, the quantum cyclic polymers shrink, in comparison to its bulk-phase counterpart, due to a strong confinement effect. At considered storage conditions, this complex phenomenon depends on the size of the slit-like carbon nanopore and the density of hydrogen volumetric energy. For the smallest nanopores and a low density of hydrogen volumetric energy, the reduction of the polymer effective size is the highest, whereas an increase of the pore size and the density of hydrogen volumetric energy causes the polymer swelling up to a value slightly below the one computed from the bulk phase. Quantum confinement-inducing polymer shrinking is of great importance for realizing the potential of quantum molecular sieves. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Carbon; Computer simulation; Density of liquids; Enthalpy; Nanopores; Quantum chemistry; Quantum confinement; Thermodynamics; Carbon nanopores; Hydrogen volumetric energy; Quantum fluids; Quantum isosteric enthalpy; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147199935

Avenue, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand","A short history of the SIAM Photon Source in Thailand is described. The facility is based on the 1 GeV storage ring obtained from the SORTEC consortium in Japan. After a redesign to include insertion straight sections it produced the first light in December 2001 and the first beam line became operational in early 2002. Special difficulties appear when a synchrotron light facility is obtained by donation, which have mostly to do with the absence of human resource development that elsewhere is commonly accomplished during design and construction. Additional problems arise by the distance of a developing country like Thailand from the origin of technical parts of the donation. A donation does not provide time to generate local capabilities or include in the technical design locally obtainable parts. This makes future developments, repairs and maintenance more time consuming, difficult and expensive than it should be. In other cases, parts of components are proprietary or obsolete or both which requires redesign and engineering at a time when the replacement part should be available to prevent stoppage of operation. The build-up of a user community is very difficult, especially when the radiation spectrum is confined to the VUV regime. Most of scientific interest these days is focused on the x-ray regime. Due to its low beam energy, the SIAM storage ring did not produce useful x-ray intensities and we are therefore in the midst of an upgrade to produce harder radiation. The first step has been achieved with a 20% increase of energy to 1.2 GeV. This step shifts the critical photon energy of bending magnet radiation from 800 eV to 1.4 keV providing useful radiation up to 7 keV. A XAS-beam line has been completed in 2005 and experimentation is very active by now. The next step is to install a 6.4 T wavelength shifter by the end of 2006 resulting in a critical photon energy of 6.15 keV. Further upgrades are planed for the comming years. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Synchrotron radiation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947402632

The boost of such radioactive ions will generate an intense monochromatic directional neutrino beam when decaying at high energy in a storage ring with long straight sections.

Currently, the ultimate Critical Dimension (CD) of such components is rapidly approaching the 10 nm length scale, with a growing interest in integrating different components in complex systems. Advanced fabrication techniques are thus required to rapidly pattern substrates on the 10-100 nm length scale, and soft X-Ray Lithography (XRL) has proven its patterning ability down to 40 nm, with the possibility to be further extended. The construction and commissioning of the Australia Synchrotron, that will be operational in 2007, gives the possibility to build such a facility on a powerful third-generation synchrotron source.

The design takes advantage of (1) the highly stable operation of the SLS storage ring, (2) the reliable high harmonic operation of small gap, short period undulators to generate hard x-rays with energy 3-18 keV at 2.4 GeV beam energy, and (3) the progress in high power, high repetition rate fs solid-state laser technology to employ laser/e-beam 'slicing' to reach a time resolution of ultimately 100 fs. The source will profit from the inherently synchronized pump (laser I: 100 fs, 2 mJ, 1 kHz) and probe (sliced X-rays, laser II: 50 fs, 5 mJ, 1 kHz) pulses, and from the excellent stability of the SLS storage ring which is operated in top-up mode and controlled by a fast orbit feedback (FOFB). Coherent radiation emitted at THz frequencies by the sliced 100 fs electron bunches will be monitored as on-line cross-correlation signal to keep the laser-electron beam interaction at optimum. The source is designed to provide at 8 keV (100 fs) a monochromized flux of 104 ph/s/0.01% bw (Si crystal monochromator) and 106 ph/s/1.5% bw (multilayer monochromator) at the sample. It is operated in parasitic mode using a hybrid bunch filling pattern. Because of the low intensity measurements are carried out repetitively over many shots using refreshing samples and gated detectors.

The former beamline design was kept, especially the optical layout. The vacuum system was completely redesigned, except the mirror and slit chambers. For the beamline-setup at DELTA, the focusing mirror is mounted inside the radiation wall shielding, therefore a motorisation of the mirror movements was necessary. The thermal load on the optical elements at DELTA is much higher than the previous load at BESSYI because of the higher electron beam energy in the storage ring. Therefore a watercooling of the first mirror had to be integrated and a complete new design of the chamber for the focusing mirror was necessary.

These polymers contain aromatic ester groups which undergo a photo-Fries rearrangement from aryl esters to hydroxyketones. The polymers under investigation were poly(4-acetoxystyrene) and two derivatives of polynorbornene, poly(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid, phenyl ester) and poly(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl ester). The kinetics of the photoreaction was studied by FTIR spectroscopy. Ellipsometric measurements of thin films showed that the photo-Fries rearrangement causes a large increase of the refractive indices in these polymers (between +0.03 and +0.05). The modulation of the refractive index is of interest for applications in the field of optics and data storage. The photoreaction also leads to an increase in surface energy as evidenced by contact angle measurements with water and diiodomethane as test liquids. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we tested the applicability of managing the sludge by three options: (1) as a fuel supplement; (2) in solidification; (3) as a road material. Environmental testing included determination of heavy metals concentration; toxic organics concentration and radiological properties. The assessment of tank bottom sludge as a fuel supplement included various properties such as proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and energy content. Solidified sludge mixtures and road application sludge mixtures were subjected to leaching using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). Tank bottom sludge was characterized as having higher concentrations of lead, zinc, and mercury, but lower concentrations of nickel, copper and chromium in comparison with values reported in the literature. Natural occurring radioactive minerals (NORM) activity values obtained on different sludge samples were very low or negligible compared to a NORM standard value of 100 Bq/g. The fuel assessment results indicate that the heating values, the carbon content and the ash content of the sludge samples are comparable with bituminous coal, sewage sludge, meat and bone meal and petroleum coke/coal mixture, but lower than those in car tyres and petroleum coke. The nitrogen content is lower than those fuels mentioned above, while the sulfur content seems comparable with bituminous coal, petroleum coke and a petroleum coke/coal mixture. The apparent lack of leachability of metals from solidification and road material sludge applications suggests that toxic metals and organics introduced to these applications are not readily attacked by weak acid solutions and would not be expected to migrate or dissolved into the water. Thus, in-terms of trace metals and organics, the suggested sludge applications would not be considered hazardous as defined by the TCLP leaching procedure. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It is also not known whether the pc-n basis sets can compute second derivatives of energy, such as nuclear magnetic shielding tensors, efficiently. To address these questions, the pc-n (n = 1 -4), cc-pVxZ, and/or aug-cc-pVxZ (x = D, T, Q, 5, and 6) basis sets were used to compute the molecular and/or spectroscopic parameters of H2, H 2O, and NH3 at the RHF, B3-LYP, MP2, and/or CCSD(T) levels of theory. The results show that compared to the cc-pVxZ and/or aug-cc-pVxZ basis sets the pc-n basis sets yield faster convergence toward the basis-set limit but equivalent molecular and/or spectroscopic parameters in the basis-set limit at the RHF, DFT, MP2, and CCSD(T) levels. Because the pc-n basis sets show faster convergence, fewer basis-set functions are needed to reach the accuracy obtained with the aug-cc-pVxZ basis sets, enabling faster calculations and less computer storage space. The results also show that the pc-n basis sets, in conjunction with the ""locally dense"" basis-set approach, could be applied to predict accurate parameters; thus, they could be used to estimate accurate molecular or spectroscopic properties (e.g., NMR parameters) for larger systems such as the active site of enzymes. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Computation theory; Correlation theory; Magnetic shielding; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Polarization; Tensors; Computer storage; Nuclear magnetic shielding tensors; pc-n basis; Molecular dynamics; ammonia; free radical; hydrogen; water; article; chemistry; comparative study; prediction and forecasting; spectroscopy; Ammonia; Free Radicals; Hydrogen; Predictive Value of Tests; Spectrum Analysis; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047240017

In this study, we aimed to improve thermal characteristics of polyurethane rigid foams that have been widely used for thermal insulation as the ultimate energy savers due to their ability to form sandwich structures with various facer materials. Through a laboratory-scale work, two paraffin waxes acting as phase change materials, namely n-hexadecane and n-octadecane, each of which is capable of managing large heat storage/release, were directly incorporated into the polyurethane foams at different ratios. Polymerization modified by means of n-alkane addition could be achieved without any adverse effect. In order to determine both structural and thermal characteristics, seven types of foams produced were examined by FT-IR, SEM, DSC analyses, calorimeter bomb and mechanical tests.

The experimental recombination rate coefficients were measured in a merged-beam-type experiment at the heavy-ion storage ring CRYRING at the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory in Stockholm. Changing the electron-ion relative energy from 0 to 20 eV we covered the energy region from the first to the third ionization threshold. We find that even for the low-charged Si 2+ ion, a relativistic many-body perturbation theory calculation is necessary, to describe the recombination rate coefficients in the low-energy region, up to 1.5 eV, satisfactorily. Doubly excited states, forbidden to form in LS coupling, are responsible for the most prominent dielectronic recombination resonances at low energies and contribute with 40% to the strength. Several wide resonances give rise to a plateau-like formation in the recombination spectrum. A broader energy range, up to 6.7 eV, was covered with a non-relativistic many-body calculation. This range contains, in addition to 3pnℓ resonances, several resonances of the type 3dnℓ, with the LS-forbidden 3d23F states giving rise to a strong, isolated peak at 2.976 eV.

In this study, a novel modification on a tube-in-shell-type storage geometry is suggested. In the proposed geometry, the outer surface of the shell is inclined and it is the objective of this study to determine the optimum range for the inclination angle of the shell surface. Paraffin with a melting temperature of 58.06°C, which is supplied by the Merck Company, is used as the PCM. The PCM is stored in the vertical annular space between an inner tube through which the heat transfer fluid (HTF), hot water, is flowing and a concentrically placed outer shell. At first, the thermophysical properties of this paraffin are determined through the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis. Temporal behaviour of the PCM undergoing a non-isothermal solid-liquid phase change during its melting or charging by the HTF are determined for different values of the inlet temperature and the mass flow rate of the HTF. The new geometry is shown to respond well with the melting characteristics of the PCM and to enhance heat transfer inside the PCM for a specific range of the shell inclination angle.

Emission tests confirmed the increasing deactivation of the field-aged catalysts and measurements of CO oxidation, Pt dispersion and hydrocarbon storage capacity were used together with XPS, TEM, and SEM-EDS to compare the performance with lab-aged catalysts. The synthetic aging was designed to account for a combination of thermal and chemical deactivation. A similar degree of Pt sintering was observed for both real and synthetic aging conditions, whereas differences arose from various contributions to the chemical deactivation. XPS showed that pre-oxidation and pre-reduction at 700 °C was not sufficient to remove typical compounds of oil-derived catalyst poisons (P, Zn, Ca), which furthermore accumulated with mileage, on the vehicle-aged catalysts. The degree of sulfur poisoning of the lab-aged catalysts increased with the duration of low-temperature sulfur exposure and could not be recovered in atmospheres typical for normal driving conditions.

The C. gigas in the Bizert lagoon showed a clear cycle of energy storage and utilization. Total biochemical composition was about 6.50% ± 3.01 of dry weight in glycogen, 14.34% ± 3.60 of dry weight in protein and 6.67% ± 1.34 of dry weight in lipids. Lipid and glycogen concentrations in the gonad-visceral mass were inversely related: maximum concentrations of glycogen occurred between December and February and corresponded with minimum concentrations of lipids. High glycogen contents recorded in winter supported the processes of gamatogenesis and then decreased progressively to attain low values at maturity and during summer corresponded to the first emission of gametes (June) and the beginning of total spawning, however lipids are accumulated in gonads during the period of maximum ripeness (spring) and decrease in summer. During autumn, the increase of total fatty acids values appeared to be related to the available food in association with an increase in the chlorophyll a concentrations. Protein contents show many variations throughout the year. High protein levels occurred in May and in July which corresponded to oocyte maturation and then decreased in late summer (beginning of total spawning). At the expense of the available food in autumn, protein concentrations increase again to assure recovery of the tissue weight of the bivalve, which induced an increase in the condition indices values. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The FP is the main legal tool and financial instrument of EU RTD&amp;D policy. It sets the objectives, priorities and budgets for a period of several years. It has been complemented over time with a number of policy oriented initiatives and notably with the launch of the European Research Area. FP7 will cover the period 2007-2013 and will have a total budget of more than € 50 billion. Energy has been a main research area in Europe since the founding Treaties (European Coal and Steel Community, European Atomic Energy Community-Euratom and European Economic Community), and energy RTD&amp;D has always been a substantial part of common EU research. Nevertheless, when inflation and successive European enlargements are taken into account, over time the RTD&amp;D effort in the field of energy has decreased significantly in relative terms. In nominal terms it has remained relatively stable at about € 500 million per year. For the next year (FP7), it is expected that energy will still represent about 10% of total EU research effort but with an annual budget of more than € 800 million per year. This article presents a detailed review of the thematic areas and budget in both European nuclear energy research (fusion and fission) and non-nuclear energy research (energy efficiency/rational use of energy, fossil fuels, CO2 capture and storage, fuel cells and hydrogen, renewable energy sources, strategic energy research/ socio-economy).",,"Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Research; Societies and institutions; Energy research; Nuclear energy; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Nuclear energy; Research; Societies and institutions; energy budget; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; European Union; fossil fuel; fuel cell; inflation; renewable resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249747451

The effects of the dietary protein content and the feeding level on the utilisation of metabolisable energy (ME) and the rates of gain, protein, and fat deposition were studied with 81 Iberian castrates growing from 50 to 100 kg body weight (BW) by using the comparative slaughter technique. The animals were fed 4 diets providing 145, 120, 95, and 70 g ideal crude protein (CP) per kg dry matter (DM), and containing 13.94, 14.29, 14.56, and 14.83 MJ ME per kg DM, respectively. Three levels of feeding were evaluated: 0.60, 0.80, and 0.95 x ad libitum intake. Growth rate increased (linear and quadratic, P &lt; 0.001) as the dietary ideal CP content decreased. It also increased with the feeding level (linear, P &lt; 0.001; quadratic, P &lt; 0.05). Gain:feed and gain:ME intake improved by decreasing the ideal CP content in the diet (linear, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively; quadratic P &lt; 0.001 for both variables). Increasing the feeding level improved linearly gain:feed and gain:ME intake ( P &lt; 0.001). Protein deposition (PD):ME intake ranged between 1.23 and 1.44 g/MJ, and it showed a tendency to reach the maximum value when the diet providing 95 g ideal CP per kg DM was fed (quadratic, P = 0.078). When this diet was offered at 0.95 x ad libitum, PD reached a maximum value of 71 g/day. This dietary treatment resulted in average values for average daily gain and retained energy (RE) of 854 g/day and 21.4 MJ/day, respectively. The average rate of gain was 19.93 g/MJ increase in ME intake, equivalent to an energy cost of 50.2 kJ ME per g gain, irrespective of the dietary ideal CP content. Also, the overall marginal efficiency of protein deposition (ΔPD:ΔME; g/MJ) was 1.34. Increasing the feeding level led to increases in PD (linear, P &lt; 0.001) and RE (linear, P &lt; 0.001; quadratic, P &lt; 0.01) irrespective of the dietary ideal CP concentrations. Between 50 and 100 kg BW, the chemical composition of 1 kg gain averaged 78, 592, 28.7, and 284 g for CP, fat, ash, and water respectively. The net efficiency of use of ME for growth ( kg) and the maintenance energy requirements were 0.606 and 396 kJ/kg BW 0.75 per day, respectively. The results support earlier findings that the genotype has marked effects on protein and energy metabolism of growing pigs and underline important compositional differences of the Iberian pig compared with conventional or modern porcine genotypes. © 2007 The Animal Consortium.","Energy requirement; Energy retention; Pigs; Protein requirement; Protein retention","animal experiment; article; body growth; body weight; caloric intake; controlled study; energy metabolism; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nutritional requirement; priority journal; protein content; protein intake; swine; weight gain; Animalia; Suidae; Sus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247621198

This paper investigates the claim that LFS use less energy and emit less greenhouse gasses than mainstream food systems (MFS), such as supermarkets. We calculated the energy required during part of the lifecycle of a selected number of food items sourced by different food supply systems and their resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Data were collected from literature, interviews with producers and suppliers of food, experts, and internet. Our results show that in the base simulation of full summer season and only inland, open-air production, energy uses and carbon dioxide emissions are slightly higher in LFS compared to the MFS, but in the same order of magnitude. LFS can be more sustainable by optimizing their transport and storage through minimizing the transport distance and by increasing the stored and traded quantities. Supermarkets could be more sustainable through choosing in-season food products that are homegrown in open air as well and by minimizing distances and storage times. Also consumers could have a large impact through a consistent choice for these in-season, inland products and through their shopping trips. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy; Lifecycle analysis; Local food systems; Mainstream food systems; Transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247479988

Slovakia is the most hydro reliant country among the EU10. It remains to be seen if the country can create an investment climate that will encourage private sector companies to opt for hydro over thermal plants. The hydro sector is helping to improve grid reliability in Hungary, through the construction of a new 1000MW pumped storage hydroelectric power plant on the Tisza river. Pumped storage also dominates the Czech Republic's hydro sector. While some of the EU10 are approaching the end of their original power reform plans, one of the more recent additions to the EU fold is currently restructuring its entire stock of hydroelectric plants.

The research has mainly concentrated on voltage-source active filters, but some attention has also been paid to an alternative - to current-source active filters. Since voltage-source pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technology is widely used in industrial applications, this has also been more common in active filter use. In addition, current-source technology has been said to have drawbacks compared to voltage-source systems, such as high on-state losses in the PWM bridge and inefficient inductive energy storage element on the dc side of the bridge. In the paper, the two active filter topologies are compared. First, the main circuits and space-vector modulation techniques used are studied and the digital control systems are presented. The filtering performances of the systems with different kinds of nonlinear load are examined and finally the power losses of the active filters are studied. The comparison is based on measurements with the prototypes built. The results clearly show the properties of the active filters examined. In addition, the results prove that current-source active filters also offer a considerable choice for harmonic filtering. © 2007 IEEE.","Current-source active filters (CSAPFs); Pulse width modulation (PWM); Voltage-source active filters (VSAPFs)","Digital control systems; Electric currents; Electric losses; Electric potential; Pulse width modulation; Current-source active filters; Harmonic filtering; Space-vector modulation; Voltage-source active filters; Active filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047154441

These increased applications present a significant challenge to the existing connection policies of distribution network operators. In particular, nonfirm access to the network has been proposed as a method to increase the penetration of DG. The impact of the connection policies arising from nonfirm access are investigated in detail here. The Irish system is used as a case study, and with reference to the available energy resource and network parameters, the costs and benefits of DG are determined under a number of planning policies. The costs and benefits assessed include connection and cycling costs along with emissions, capacity value, and fuel bill saving. It is shown that a significant increase in the net benefits of DG is gained if the appropriate connection policy is utilized from the outset, and conversely, significant costs are incurred if ad hoc policies are employed. Furthermore, it is shown that nonfirm access has the scope to facilitate a significant extra amount of DG capacity. © 2007 IEEE.","Costs; Dispersed storage and generation; Energy resources; Linear programming; Power distribution planning; Power system economics; Wind power generation","Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Energy policy; Energy resources; Linear programming; Power generation; Dispersed storage and generation; Distributed generation (DG); Power distribution planning; Power system economics; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947706277

The bit stops rotating in the hole, in stick-slip drilling, because of excessive friction at the rock face or on some BHA components. There are ways to identify stick-slip during drilling, and one is through the use of monitoring devices on the surface. The sine wave of amperage versus time can show the stick-slip, if the monitoring device takes voltage readings frequently. Rotary tables can sometimes speed up and slow down in response to stick-slip with a growling sound which indicates increased rotary torque and an RPM counter can show a cyclic decrease/increase in rotary speed, which in turn indicates stick-slip.

With partners Choren and Iogen, the company is developing ways to produce second generation biofuels from residues like straw and wood chips. Solar and wind energy together provide ∼ 0.15% of the world's total primary energy consumption. Biofuels add 450,000 boe/day, or ∼ 0.2%. A major part of the remainder is made up of nuclear energy. If the UK would fit 20 million roofs each with 4 sq m of standard silicon-based solar panels, this would generate less full time equivalent power than a typical power station fired by gas or coal, or no more than 1% of UK electricity capacity. As for wind energy, the London Array offshore wind farm that Shell is a partner in, will have up to 341 wind turbines, generating the equivalent of about 1% of the UK's electricity demand. A more useful approach might be to invest in a combination of clean coal techniques, such as coal gasification and coal-to-liquids. Also included is the capturing and underground storage of CO2.

Hydrogen can be distributed continuously in pipelines or batch wise by ships, trucks, railway or airplanes. All batch transportation requires a storage system but also pipelines can be used as pressure storage system. Hydrogen exhibits the highest heating value per weight of all chemical fuels. Furthermore, hydrogen is regenerative and environment friendly. There are two reasons why hydrogen is not the major fuel of toady's energy consumption: First of all, hydrogen is just an energy carrier. And, although it is the most abundant element in the universe, it has to be produced, since on earth it only occurs in the form of water. This implies that we have to pay for this energy, which results in a difficult economic task, because since the industrialization we are used to consuming energy for free. The second difficulty with hydrogen as an energy carrier is the low critical temperature of 33 K, i.e. hydrogen is a gas at room temperature. For mobile and in many cases also for stationary applications the volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen in a storage system is crucial. Hydrogen can be stored by six different methods and phenomena: high pressure gas cylinders (up to 800 bar), liquid hydrogen in cryogenic tanks (at 21 K), adsorbed hydrogen on materials with a large specific surface area (at T < 100 K), absorbed on interstitial sites in a host metal (at ambient pressure and temperature), chemically bond in covalent and ionic compounds (at ambient pressure), oxidation of reactive metals e.g. Li, Na, Mg, Al, Zn with water. These metals easily react with water to the corresponding hydroxide and liberate the hydrogen from the water. Finally, the metal hydroxides can be thermally reduced to the metals in a solar furnace. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Hydrogen; Metal hydride; Storage; Synthetic fuel","distribution system; fuel consumption; gas pipeline; gas storage; gravimetry; hydrogen; industrialization; transportation system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847184608

These disorders highlight the application of new genetic tools for screening newborns for conditions managed by medical nutrition therapy. Early detection and dietary treatment have been crucial since the 1960s for patients diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The same concept of reducing the dietary substrate that accumulates in disease is applied today for some conditions difficult to diagnose a decade ago. More than 6,000 human single-gene disorders have been identified to date, including more than 100 protein-based metabolic disorders. Tandem mass spectrometry has facilitated newborn screening for more disorders at low cost and high speed. Presently, screening newborns for 29 disorders is recommended in the United States and many states are doubling or tripling the number of tests offered in their screening programs. Complex dietary therapies have evolved for rare disorders, such as fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, organic acid metabolism, glycogen storage, and energy production. Diagnosis-specific therapy may challenge routine dietary recommendations, such as encouraging fatty and sugary foods or avoiding fruits and milk, and treatment options have spawned a market in special formulas and substitute foods; recommended references and Web sites are provided to assist food and nutrition professionals in navigating this territory.

Thus, efficient use of energy and sustainability has become a key issue for the most energy policies. Sustainability and energy saving terms take place in building construction industry too since buildings are one of the most significant energy consumers. It is known that heating energy demand of a building has a great rate in building total energy consumption. In addition to that, the most of the heating energy has been lost from building envelope. TS 825, Heating Energy Conservation Standard for Buildings in Turkey, aims the reducing of heat loss in buildings through the envelope. But within buildings, one of the fastest growing sources of new energy demand is cooling and especially in hot-humid and hot-dry climatic parts of Turkey cooling season is much longer than the heating season. Moreover in hot-dry climate heat storage capacity of the envelope becomes more important issue than heat insulation for energy efficiency of the building. Since the Turkish standard is considering only heating energy conservation by using degree-day concept, Istanbul and Mardin are considered in the same zone, however those are in temperate-humid and hot-dry climatic zones, respectively. In this study energy efficient design strategies for these climatic zones have been explained and thermal performance of two buildings, which are constructed according to the TS 825 in Mardin and Istanbul cities were evaluated to show the importance of thermal mass in hot-dry climates. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The features of the building are unique where the air-conditioned 39,300 m2 zone is open to the atmosphere and the worshippers fully occupy the building five times a day, in addition hundreds of thousands of worshippers attend the blessed weekend's prayer at noontime, which escalates the peak electricity load. For economic analysis, the objective function is the daily electricity bill that includes the operation cost and the capital investment of the ice storage system. The operation cost is function of the energy imported for operating the plant in which the tariff structure, number of operating hours and the ambient temperature are parameters. The capital recovery factor is calculated for 10% interest rate and payback period of 10 years. Full and partial load storage scenarios are considered. The results showed that with the current fixed electricity rate (0.07 $/kWh), there is no gain in introducing ice storage systems for both storage schemes. Combining energy storage and an incentive time structured rate showed reasonable daily bill savings. For base tariff of 0.07 $/kWh during daytime operation and 0.016 $/kWh for off-peak period, savings were achieved for full load storage scenario. Different tariff structure is discussed and the break-even nighttime rate was determined (varies between 0.008 and 0.03 $/kWh). Partial load storage scenario showed to be unattractive where the savings for the base structured tariff was insignificant. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Rehydrogenated MgH2/graphite composite exhibits a desorption temperature that is lower by about 35 °C compared with that of the as-prepared composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and Raman and IR spectroscopy were used to investigate the possible origins of the noticeable enhancement in the desorption temperature. It is found that γ-MgH2, a by-product of ball milling, does not contribute to the enhancement of the hydrogen desorption. Carbon hydrogen bonding is not detected and it seems that the formation of classical C-H bonding is not feasible with this kind of milling mode.

The photochemical reaction leads to reduction of TCNQ to the TCNQ- monoanion. In the presence of Mx+(MeCN), reaction with TCNQ-(MeCN) leads to deposition of Mx+[TCNQ] X crystals onto a solid substrate with morphologies that are dependent on the metal cation. Thus, CuTCNQ phase I photocrystallizes as uniform microrods, KTCNQ as microrods with a random size distribution, AgTCNQ as very long nanowires up to 30 μm in length and with diameters of less than 180 nm, and Co[TCNQ]2(H2O)2 as nanorods and wires. The described charge-transfer complexes have been characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy and IR and Raman spectroscopy.

The current switching technique used in the generator is based on a resonance system. Opening switches for high currents are generally difficult to construct and the switch used here has proven to turn off 1.8 kA DC-current at a rate of 300 A/μs. The generator is equipped with a step-up transmission line transformer as intermediate magnetic energy storage and the primary and secondary energy storages are capacitive. An LC-resonance circuit is combined with 3 vacuum interrupters in series as an opening switch on the primary side of the transformer. Discharging the capacitor bank into the primary winding of the transformer introduces a 200 Hz sinusoidal oscillation on the primary current. The movable contacts in the vacuum interrupters are operated mechanically and stable arcs are formed as the gaps are opened. As the 200 Hz sinusoidal current reaches its first maximum, the small LC-resonance circuit is triggered and the current achieves a new frequency of 25 kHz. The large amplitude and high frequency generated by the LC-resonance circuit results in a zero crossing of the primary current. As the current crosses zero the arc deionises and the current is switched off. Pulse shaping with a 2 × 50 m Blumlein configuration on the secondary side of the transformer has been investigated. A rise-time of 40 ns and pulse duration of 700 ns were measured for a resistive load. The aim with this pulse generator is to get familiar with the challenges involved in scaling the system to higher performance. © 2007 FEI STU.","Current switch; High voltage; Pulsed power; Transformer; Transmission line; Vacuum interrupter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846892997

Obesity is often accompanied by excess fat storage in tissues other than adipose tissue, including liver and skeletal muscle, which may lead to local insulin resistance and may stimulate inflammation, as in steatohepatitis. In addition, obesity changes the morphology and composition of adipose tissue, leading to changes in protein production and secretion. Some of these secreted proteins, including several proinflammatory mediators, may be produced by macrophages resident in the adipose tissue. The changes in inflammatory status of adipose tissue and liver with obesity feed a growing recognition that obesity represents a state of chronic low-level inflammation. Various molecular mechanisms have been implicated in obesity-induced inflammation, some of which are modulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes, including lipid and glucose metabolism, and overall energy homeostasis. Importantly, PPARs also modulate the inflammatory response, which makes them an interesting therapeutic target to mitigate obesity-induced inflammation and its consequences. This review will address the role of PPARs in obesity-induced inflammation specifically in adipose tissue, liver, and the vascular wall.

For this purpose, a computer simulation program based on the mathematical model is developed by means of MATLAB software. In this simulation program, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the energy balance equations numerically. The desalination unit is configured by a double-pass flat plate solar air heater with two glass covers, humidifying tower, storage tank and dehumidifying exchanger. The system used in this work is based on the idea of closed water and open air cycles. Air is heated by using a double-pass solar air heater whereas water is not heated. The system productivity is increased up to 8% by using a double-pass solar air heater compared to a singlepass solar air heater and decreased about 30% without double-pass solar air heater under the same operating conditions. Significant development on the productivity of the system is achieved by increasing the humidifier inlet water and air mass flow rates. At a constant water mass flow rate, however, the productivity of the unit increases with the increasing of air mass flow rate to an optimum value and decreases after that value. In addition, theoretical results indicate that there is a significant improvement on the system performance as the inital water temperature and water mass in the storage tank is increased. Moreover, increasing the cooling water mass flow rate and decreasing its temperature lead to appreciable improvement on the unit productivity. It is also found that, the system performance is strongly affected by the double-pass solar air heater area and slightly influenced by the bottom heat loss coefficient of the solar air heater and storage tank (especially, when its temperature is lower than the ambient air temperature). Finally, the productivity of the unit that consists of a double-pass solar air heater with two glass covers is not influenced by the wind speed variations as much as double-pass solar air heater with one glass cover. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of PVAc content on reaction induced phase separation, cure kinetics, morphology and dynamic-mechanical properties of cured blends at 180°C is reported. Epoxy/PVAc blends (5, 10 and 15 wt % of PVAc content) are initially miscible but phase separate upon curing. DMTA α-relaxations of cured blends agree with Tg results by DSC. The conversion-time data revealed the cure reaction was slower in the blends than in the neat system, although the autocatalytic cure mechanism was not affected by the addition of PVAc. ESEM showed the cured epoxy/PVAc blends had different morphologies as a function of PVAc content: an inversion in morphology took place for blends containing 15 wt % PVAc. The changes in the blend morphology with PVAc content had a clear effect on the DMTA behavior. Inverted morphology blends had low storage modulus values and a high capability to dissipate energy at temperatures higher than the PVAc glasstransition temperature, in contrast to the behavior of neat epoxy and blends with a low PVAc content. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Glass transition; Morphology; Phase separation; Thermoplastic; Thermoset","Curing; Epoxy resins; Glass transition; Morphology; Phase separation; Polyvinyl acetates; Reaction kinetics; Thermoplastics; Thermosets; Blend morphology; Cure kinetics; Cured epoxy; Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA); Polymer blends; epoxy resin; glass transition temperature; mechanical property; morphology; phase separation; polymer blend; polyvinyl acetate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845995853

The tank was internally inspected for the first time after six years of service. Paint blisters and rust spots were observed on the bottom plates and first to third course shell plates. Sand blasting and repainting of the bottom plates and first course shell plates was to be used as a remedial measure. However, during the sand blasting, holes and deep pitting were observed on the bottom plates. On-site visual inspection, magnetic flux leakage (MFL) inspection, ultrasonic testing (UT), and evaluation of the external cathodic protection (CP) system were used in the failure analysis. The corrosion products were analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The failure is attributed to the ingress of water and its impoundment under the tank bottom along the periphery inside the ring wall and failure of water side epoxy coating. Various measures to prevent such failures in the future are recommended. © ASM International 2007.","Coating thickness; Corrosion failure analysis; EDS; Nondestructive examination","Epoxy coating; Magnetic flux leakage inspection; Paint blisters; Storage tank; Cathodic protection; Corrosion; Failure analysis; Inspection; Magnetic flux; Plate metal; Ultrasonic testing; Tanks (containers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447510978

Dietary fatty acids do not stimulate their own oxidation and a surplus of fat is stored in white adipose tissue, liver, heart and muscle. In these organs intracellular lipids serve as a rapidly-available energy source during, for example, physical activity. However, under conditions of elevated plasma fatty acid levels and high dietary fat intake, conditions implicated in the development of modern diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, fat accumulation in liver and muscle (intramyocellular lipids; IMCL) is associated with the development of insulin resistance. Recent data suggest that IMCL are specifically harmful when combined with reduced mitochondrial function, both conditions that characterize type 2 diabetes. In the (pre)diabetic state reduced expression of the transcription factor PPARγ co-activator-1α (PGC-1α), which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, has been suggested to underlie the reduced mitochondrial function. Importantly, the reduction in PGC-1α may be a result of low physical activity, consumption of high-fat diets and high plasma fatty acid levels. Mitochondrial function can also be impaired as a result of enhanced mitochondrial damage by reactive oxygen species. Fatty acids in the vicinity of mitochondria are particularly prone to lipid peroxidation. In turn, lipid peroxides can induce oxidative damage to mitochondrial RNA, DNA and proteins. The mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein 3, which is induced under high-fat conditions, may serve to protect mitochondria against lipid-induced oxidative damage, but is reduced in the prediabetic state. Thus, muscular lipotoxicity may impair mitochondrial function and may be central to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2007 The Author.","Insulin resistance; Intramyocellular lipids; Mitochondrial function; Oxidative damage; Type 2 diabetes","fatty acid; mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; adipose tissue; biogenesis; conference paper; energy resource; fatty acid blood level; heart; human; insulin resistance; lifestyle; lipid diet; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; liver; mitochondrion; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxidation; oxidative stress; physical activity; protein expression; adipose tissue; article; chemistry; exercise; fat intake; lipid metabolism; metabolism; muscle mitochondrion; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; skeletal muscle; Adipose Tissue; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dietary Fats; Exercise; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscle, Skeletal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248140740

A secondary aim was to study the effects of the decontamination process and the storage procedure on dentin components. Background Data: There are no spectroscopy reports relating the effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation as an alternative to acid etching and the manipulation process on the dentin structure. Methods: Twelve non-carious human third molars were divided in two main groups: stored in thymol solution (group A, n = 6) or autoclaved (group B, n = 6). The specimens were either etched with 37% phosphoric acid (control subgroup) or irradiated with Er:YAG laser. Irradiated samples were divided into the following subgroups: I, II, and III (80 mJ, 3 Hz, 30 sec; 120 mJ, 3 Hz, 30 sec; and 180 mJ, 3 Hz, 30 sec, respectively). Samples were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. Results: The mineral and organic dentin contents were more affected in autoclaved teeth than in the specimens stored in thymol. Peak area reduction in group A specimens treated with phosphoric acid and pulse energy of 80 mJ were the most conservative surface treatments regarding changes in the peak area of organic and inorganic dentin components. Conclusion: The autoclaving process and pulse energies of 120 and 180 mJ produced greater reduction of organic and inorganic contents in dentin, associated with greater reduction in the areas of 968, 1077, 1460, and 1670 cm-1 Raman peaks. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Etching; Laser beam effects; Laser pulses; Raman spectroscopy; Surface treatment; Dentin structure; Organic components; Thymol solution; Laser surgery; phosphoric acid; thymol; article; autoclave; dental laser etching; dentin; device; erbium YAG laser; molar tooth; Raman spectrometry; Dental Etching; Dentin; Humans; Lasers; Molar, Third; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Tissue Culture Techniques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947401949

The research was conducted during a period of three years (1998-2001). Seven different types of drainage systems were built on pseudogleyic-gleyic soil (various spacings of drainage pipes with gravel used or not used in the drainage trench above the pipes). Based on soil moisture measurement data (to a soil depth of 60 cm), acquired by means of the gravitational method in the period of vegetation, it is clear that the most favourable humidity occurred on soil with spacing of drainage pipes being 25 m, gravel used, with both cultures. The yield gained also shows that this drainage type is the most favourable. The process of drying the kernels to the storage humidity value took the shortest time with this type of drainage. Results of this research contribute to energy savings in the process of drying wheat and corn crops. Additionally, the results can be used for selecting systems of drainage in dealing with excess water on hydromorphic soil types.

According to the patent, the technology will overcome problems with solar energy production, geothermal energy production, and low-cost supercritical steam for efficient secondary and tertiary hydrocarbon recovery programs. It can be used to convert depleted oil/gas fields to store solar energy. The stored heat can then be used to generate electricity through routine processes. It provides a use for oilfield brine and can be used to produce water for drier regions. SAGE uses parabolic troughs to gather radiant solar energy, concentrate it, and use it to heat oilfield brine to a supercritical level (734°F, above the 705°F critical point for brine).

Extending previously published ideas, we present an efficient method for estimating multiple, linearly time-varying motions. It is shown that the estimation of accelerated motions is equivalent to the parameter estimation of superpositioned chirp signals. From this viewpoint, one can exploit established signal processing tools such as the chirp-Fourier transform. It is shown that accelerated motion results in energy concentration along planes in the 4-D space: Spatial frequencies-temporal frequency-chirp rate. Using fuzzy c-planes clustering, we estimate the plane/motion parameters.

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, open trial, stratified by viral load and CD4 cell count, conducted January 2001 to July 2004. Two hundred thirty-seven adult patients with HIV infection initiating antiretroviral therapy were assigned to receive abacavir (n = 115) or stavudine (n = 122), both combined with lamivudine and efavirenz. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with lipoatrophy as assessed by physician and patient observation at 96 weeks. RESULTS: A lower proportion of patients assigned to abacavir developed clinical signs of lipoatrophy (4.8% vs. 38.3%; P < 0.001). These observations were confirmed by anthropometric data. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans performed in 57 patients showed significantly greater total limb fat loss in the stavudine arm (-1579 vs. 913 g; P < 0.001). The lipid profile in abacavir patients presented more favorable changes in the levels of triglycerides (P = 0.03), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc; P < 0.001), and apolipoprotein A1 (P < 0.001) as well as in the ratio between total cholesterol and HDLc (P = 0.005). Throughout the study, a higher proportion of patients in the stavudine group received lipid-lowering agents as compared to the abacavir group (17% vs. 4%; P = 0.002). Similar virologic and immunologic responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the limitations inherent to clinical assessment, this study shows a notably weaker association of abacavir with lipoatrophy than stavudine. DEXA scans and anthropometric measurements supported the clinical findings. In addition, the lipid changes that occurred were more favorable in patients receiving abacavir. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Abacavir; Avudine; Cholesterol; HIV; Lipids; Lipoatrophy; Lipodystrophy","abacavir; apolipoprotein A1; cholesterol; efavirenz; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lamivudine; lipid; stavudine; triacylglycerol; acute heart infarction; anthropometric parameters; article; CD4 lymphocyte count; central nervous system disease; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastrointestinal symptom; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hyperlactatemia; hypersensitivity reaction; immune response; limb; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoatrophy; liver cirrhosis; lung adenocarcinoma; metabolic acidosis; mitochondrial toxicity; multicenter study; observation; peripheral neuropathy; physician; priority journal; prospective study; random sample; randomized controlled trial; rash; sepsis; side effect; skin allergy; statistical significance; sudden death; treatment duration; triacylglycerol blood level; virus load; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Densitometry, X-Ray; Dideoxynucleosides; Drug Therapy, Combination; Extremities; Female; HIV Infections; HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy Syndrome; Humans; Lamivudine; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Oxazines; Stavudine; Viral Load",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847126560

In the paraffin/HDPE blend, the paraffin (P) dispersed into the HDPE serves as a latent heat storage material when the HDPE, as a supporting material, prevents the melted paraffin leakage thanks to its structural strength. Therefore, this type composite is form-stable and can be used as a PCM without encapsulation for thermal energy storage. In this study, two paraffins with melting temperatures of 48°C-50°C and 63°C-65°C were used. The mass percentages of paraffins in the composites could go high as 76% without any seepage of the paraffin in melted state. The dispersion of the paraffin into the network of the solid HDPE was investigated using scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The melting temperatures and latent heats of the form-stable P1/HDPE and P2/HDPE composite PCMs were determined as 44.32°C and 61.66°C, and 179.63 and 198.14 Jg-1, by the technique of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs were improved as about 33.3% for the P1/HDPE and 52.3% for the P2/HDPE by introducing the expanded and exfoliated graphite to the samples in the ratio of 3 wt%. The results reveal that the prepared form-stable composite PCMs have great potential for thermal energy storage applications in terms of their satisfactory thermal properties, improved thermal conductivity and cost-efficiency because of no encapsulation for enhancing heat transfer in paraffin.","Form-stable; Paraffin/HDPE composite; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Composite materials; High density polyethylenes; Melting; Paraffins; Scanning electron microscopy; Specific heat; Melting temperatures; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847119790

We here sketch a scenario for how its various modules, such as maintenance, storage dynamics, development, differentiation and life stages could have evolved since the beginning of life. We argue that the combination of homeostasis and maintenance induced the development of reserves and that subsequent increases in the maintenance costs came with increases of the reserve capacity. Life evolved from a multiple reserves - single structure system (prokaryotes, many protoctists) to systems with multiple reserves and two structures (plants) or single reserve and single structure (animals). This had profound consequences for the possible effects of temperature on rates. We present an alternative explanation for what became known as the down-regulation of maintenance at high growth rates in microorganisms; the density of the limiting reserve increases with the growth rate, and reserves do not require maintenance while structure-specific maintenance costs are independent of the growth rate. This is also the mechanism behind the variation of the respiration rate with body size among species. The DEB theory specifies reserve dynamics on the basis of the requirements of weak homeostasis and partitionability. We here present a new and simple mechanism for this dynamics which accounts for the rejection of mobilised reserve by busy maintenance/growth machinery. This module, like quite a few other modules of DEB theory, uses the theory of Synthesising Units; we review recent progress in this field. The plasticity of membranes that evolved in early eukaryotes is a major step forward in metabolic evolution; we discuss quantitative aspects of the efficiency of phagocytosis relative to the excretion of digestive enzymes to illustrate its importance. Some processes of adaptation and gene expression can be understood in terms of allocation linked to the relative workload of metabolic modules in (unicellular) prokaryotes and organs in (multicellular) eukaryotes. We argue that the evolution of demand systems can only be understood in the light of that of supply systems. We illustrate some important points with data from the literature. © 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","Dynamic energy budget; Evolution; Homeostasis; Maintenance; Reserves; Supply and demand systems","enzyme; adaptation; animal anatomy; body size; breathing rate; cost; differentiation; down regulation; energy conservation; enzymuria; eukaryote; eukaryote evolution; gene expression; growth rate; homeostasis; intraspecific variation; microbial metabolism; molecular dynamics; molecular evolution; nonhuman; partition coefficient; phagocytosis; plant development; plant evolution; plant growth; plant taxonomy; plasticity; population density; prokaryote; quantitative analysis; review; temperature sensitivity; workload; Animals; Biomass; Body Temperature Regulation; Cell Physiology; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Homeostasis; Humans; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Thermodynamics; Animalia; Eukaryota; Prokaryota; Protoctista",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847013807

Comparisons of model predictions with natural behavior help researchers understand the selection pressures that underlie migration strategies. We give examples of typical migration speeds and distances for animals using different locomotion models. Successful migration also requires accurate orientation and/or navigation between distant areas for reproduction and survival.

This work analyses the effect of temperature and added lactic acid on the growth of different beef muscle-isolated bacteria: Pseudomonas sp. and two enterobacteria identified as Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli, in a liquid model system. Inoculation levels between 104 and 106 CFU mL-1 in a culture medium of meat extract broth at 2% were studied, with addition of lactic acid in concentrations of 0.29, 0.39 and 0.58 M, which allowed to reach pH values of 6.1, 5.8 and 5.6 respectively. Culture media inoculated with each micro-organism were incubated at three temperatures: 0,4 and 10 °C in aerobiosis; bacterial counts as a function of time were mathematically modelled by applying Gompertz equation. Derived parameters: lag phase (LPD), specific growth rate (μ) and maximum population density were calculated. When the observed effect was bacteriostactic a linear regression was used. Results were compared with a meat extract broth control at pH = 7. At 10 °C added lactic acid produced a higher variation in μ values for Klebsiella sp. and E. coli, whereas LPD values were modified between six and three times for each micro-organism. The highest LPD values were observed for E. coli, followed by Pseudomonas and finally by Klebsiella.

Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inlet conditions of secondary fluid and validate the numerical model predictions on ice-on-coil thermal energy storage system. The total thermal storage energy and the heat transfer rate in the system were investigated in the range of 10 1 min-1 ≤ V̇ ≤ 60 1 min-1. A new numerical model based on temperature transforming method for phase change material (PCM) described by Faghri was developed to solve the problem of the system consisting of governing equations for the heat transfer fluid, pipe wall and PCM. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effect of working conditions of secondary fluid and these were compared with the experimental results. The numerical results verified with experimental investigation show that the stored energy rises with increasing flow rate a decreasing tendency. It is also observed that the inlet temperature of the fluid has more influence on energy storage quantity than flow rate.

The objective of this scenario study was to compare energy turnover in a life cycle perspective, recycling potential and expected reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions for three upgraded small-scale wastewater systems based on local recycling of plant nutrients. The systems studied were urine separation, blackwater separation and chemical precipitation in the septic tank. The urine was sanitised through storage, the blackwater through liquid composting and the precipitated sludge through chemical treatment with urea before reuse in agriculture. The system boundaries included the operational phase as well as investment in capital goods required for upgrading the existing on-site systems. The urine separation system used least energy. The potential recycling and reduction of phosphorus was lower than for the other two systems, while that of nitrogen was higher than for the chemical precipitation system but lower than for the blackwater separation system. The blackwater separation system reduced both nitrogen and phosphorus to a high extent and also enabled a large proportion of both nitrogen and phosphorus to be recycled to arable land. However, a major drawback with this system was its significantly higher use of electricity, related to the aeration and stirring required when sanitising the blackwater by liquid composting. When urea treatment replaced liquid composting, the use of electricity decreased substantially in the blackwater separation system. The chemical precipitation system was efficient in reducing and recycling phosphorus, while inefficient for nitrogen. The use of fossil fuels was significantly higher than for the other two systems, primarily due to the production of the precipitation chemical. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Premature infants do not immediately tolerate full enteral feedings, yet they retain high nutritional needs for both growth and metabolic maintenance. Parenteral nutrition should therefore be initiated as quickly as possible after premature birth, thereby reducing the dependence on endogenous substrates. Intrauterine studies show very high amino acid uptake, clearly exceeding accretion rates. Studies covering the early neonatal period demonstrate that the initiation of high-dose amino acid administration directly after birth is safe and effective, even at low energy intakes.

The motivation of this study is to design and construct a novel storage unit responding to the melting/solidification characteristics of the paraffin. The PCM is stored in the vertical annular space between an inner tube through which the heat transfer fluid (HTF), here water, is flowing and a concentrically placed outer shell. This study focuses on the possibility of the heat transfer enhancement in the heat storage geometry. Enhancement is achieved by tilting the outer surface of the storage container, i.e. the surface of the outer shell with a tilting angle of 5°. The paraffin (P1) is used as the PCM because of its low cost, high energy storage density and large scale availability. At first, the thermophysical properties of the paraffin used are determined through differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis.

However, such studies are biased towards northern species and there is little information on Mediterranean species and/or populations. The reproductive ecology of Vipera latastei in the Iberian Peninsula was studied by analysing a large sample of specimens from collections, to better understand the conservation status of this Mediterranean viper. Males and females matured at small and similar body sizes (240 and 265 mm snout-vent length, respectively) and reproductive cycles in both sexes were seasonal. Spermatogenesis peaked in August, vitellogenesis developed in spring and the timing of the mating period was puzzling, with populations mating in autumn, spring, or in both seasons. The most striking finding was that adult females reproduced triennially on average. Lataste's viper is currently in continuous decline in the IP, and most of its populations are isolated in Mediterranean mountains. We hypothesize that prey scarcity and the brevity of the activity period in mountain habitats diminishes the ability of vipers to recover over the short term the energy expended in reproduction. The species needs 2 years for the acquisition and storage of energy (""capital breeder""), and a third year for the expenditure of this energy (in vitellogenesis and embryogenesis), a year during which females feed consistently (""income breeder""). Thus, this viper combines both strategies to supply the reproductive energy cost. Current decline in population and distribution, together with a poor capacity to renew populations, renders Lataste's viper vulnerable to environmental stochasticity. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The gelation time was found to decrease with increasing synthesis temperature and decreasing R/C ratio. The apparent activation energy of the reactional system leading to the gelation, calculated from the gelation times obtained between 50 and 90 °C, was found to be close to 80 kJ mol-1 and independent of the R/C ratio. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of initial crack lengths and storage temperature profiles on cladding failure are discussed in detail. The results show that the initial crack length and the storage temperature profile play an important role in the interim dry storage. When the storage temperature remains at a constant temperature of 400 °C, it will be safe for the cladding which stores in the interim dry storage.

The problems of seasonal repeatability and method of data scattering were examined. From that, a standard performance test method is proposed. The test method suggests that only the measurement of instantaneous solar incident radiation on horizontal surface, ambient temperature, hot water temperature in the storage tank, total mass of water in the storage tank and total power input to the ISAHP are required. It is suggested to select the value of COP at Tf - Ta,ave = 15 °C as the characteristic COP for performance comparison of ISAHP.

Fuel cell buses fuelled by hydrogen appear to be a promise solution to environment, energy and public health problems that we face today. Studies worldwide point towards the technical feasibility of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the transport and stationary sectors, but several non-technical barriers need to be overcome or removed before hydrogen can be deployed in energy systems. This paper expounds a previous country-specific analysis by contrasting the challenges arising at EU level and those faced by transition economies, using China and Brazil as case-studies to identify the key barriers and potential impact on hydrogen fuel cell buses applications. The evaluation criteria used are described. Lessons on the critical conditions for a successful introduction of fuel cell buses and hydrogen into society and the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure arise from the above analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The early models where purely mechanical consisting of only a stone wheel attached to an axle. Nowadays flywheels are complex constructions where energy is stored mechanically and transferred to and from the flywheel by an integrated motor/generator. The stone wheel has been replaced by a steel or composite rotor and magnetic bearings have been introduced. Today flywheels are used as supplementary UPS storage at several industries world over. Future applications span a wide range including electric vehicles, intermediate storage for renewable energy generation and direct grid applications from power quality issues to offering an alternative to strengthening transmission. One of the key issues for viable flywheel construction is a high overall efficiency, hence a reduction of the total losses. By increasing the voltage, current losses are decreased and otherwise necessary transformer steps become redundant. So far flywheels over 10 kV have not been constructed, mainly due to isolation problems associated with high voltage, but also because of limitations in the power electronics. Recent progress in semi-conductor technology enables faster switching and lower costs. The predominant part of prior studies have been directed towards optimising mechanical issues whereas the electro technical part now seem to show great potential for improvement. An overview of flywheel technology and previous projects are presented and moreover a 200 kW flywheel using high voltage technology is simulated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Golden spiny mice (Acomys russatus) inhabit rock crevasses and do not dig burrows nor store food. When kept under 50% food restriction most, but not all, golden spiny mice defend their body mass by physiological means. We tested the hypothesis that these rodents use two different behavioral strategies, i.e., increasing activity level and searching for food or decreasing activity level and conserving energy to cope with food shortage. Twelve golden spiny mice were fed ad libitum for 14 days, followed by 40 days of 50% food restriction, and 14 days of refeeding. Body mass, food consumption and general activity were monitored. Seven mice significantly reduced activity level, concentrating their activity around feeding time, lowering energy expenditure and thus keeping their body mass constant (""resistant""), while five (""non-resistant"") significantly increased activity level (possibly searching for food) and thus energy expenditure, thereby losing mass rapidly (more than 25% of body mass). The non-resistant golden spiny mice were active throughout many hours of the day, with high variability both between and among individuals. The use of two strategies to cope with food shortage as found in the golden spiny mice may be of evolutionary advantage, since it allows a more flexible reaction to food restriction at the population level. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The photosensitized degradation of both vitamins followed first-order kinetics, and the temperature effect on the observed photodegradation rate constant allowed the determination of the activation energy Ea as being 4 and 16 kcal/mol for vitamins A and D3, respectively. The addition of lycopene microencapsulated by spray-drying with a gum arabic-sucrose (8:2) mixture (MIC) produced a reduction of ca. 45% in the photosensitized degradation rate of both vitamins. Front-face fluorescence experiments showed the same photoprotection factor in the degradation of Rf itself, indicating that the photodegradation mechanism involved Rf-mediated reactive species, such as the excited triplet state of Rf, 3Rf*, and/or singlet molecular oxygen, 1O 2. The interaction of both 3Rf* and 1O2 with MIC was evaluated in aqueous solutions by using laser-induced time-resolved absorption or emission spectroscopy, and the contribution of an inner-filter effect in the presence of MIC in skimmed milk was evaluated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The main operating mechanism of photoprotection is due to the deactivation of 3Rf* by the proteic component of gum arabic; thus, gum arabic based microcapsules could be used to improve the photostability of milk during its storage and/or processing under light. © 2007 American Chemical Society.","Lycopene-gum arabic microcapsules; Milk; Photooxidation; Riboflavin; Singlet oxygen; Triplet states; Vitamins","Acacia senegal; carotenoid; colecalciferol; gum arabic; lycopene; retinol; water; animal; article; chemistry; drug stability; light; microcapsule; milk; oxidation reduction reaction; photochemistry; radiation exposure; solubility; Animals; Capsules; Carotenoids; Cholecalciferol; Drug Stability; Gum Arabic; Light; Milk; Oxidation-Reduction; Photochemistry; Solubility; Vitamin A; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047225838

This period corresponds to the normal time that juvenile shrimp starve during molting, since they can not eat. Glucose, glycogen, total soluble protein, total lipids, sterols, and acylglycerides were measured in plasma and hepatopancreas. The same metabolic substrates were measured in organisms that were fed after 96 h of starvation. It is widely accepted that protein is the main energy reserve used by shrimp to deal with starvation. However, under short-term starvation a rapid decrease of plasma and hepatopancreas glucose and an important decrease in hepatopancreatic glycogen were detected. Additionally, acylglycerides content in hepatopancreas decreased significantly at later times, while protein in plasma and hepatopancreas remained fairly constant during the experiment. This study may help understand some aspects of the nutrition physiology of the Pacific white shrimp related to its biology. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The calcium-regulated serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin has been implicated in the transduction of motor neuron signals to alter gene expression programs in skeletal muscle. We utilized transgenic mice that overexpress an activated form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle (MCK-CnA*) to investigate the impact of calcineurin activation on metabolic properties of skeletal muscle. Activation of calcineurin increased glucose incorporation into glycogen and lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Activated calcineurin suppressed skeletal muscle glucose oxidation and increased lactate release. The enhancement in lipid oxidation was supported by increased expression of genes for lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In a reciprocal fashion, several genes of glycolysis were down-regulated, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 was markedly induced. This expression pattern was associated with decreased glucose utilization and enhanced glycogen storage. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) are transcription regulators for the expression of metabolic and mitochondrial genes. Consistent with changes in the gene-regulatory program, calcineurin promoted the expression of PPARα, PPARδ, and PPARγ coactivator 1α in skeletal muscle. These results provide evidence that calcineurin-mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming induces the expression of several transcription regulators that coordinate changes in the expression of genes for lipid and glucose metabolism, which in turn alters energy substrate utilization in skeletal muscle. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Calcineurin; Lipid metabolism; Motor neuron; Physiological demand; Skeletal muscle; Enzyme activity; Gene expression; Metabolism; Phosphorylation; Redox reactions; Musculoskeletal system; calcineurin; glucose; lactic acid; lipid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; pyruvate kinase; unclassified drug; calcineurin; glucose; glycogen; heat shock protein; oxygen; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; PPARGC1A protein, human; protein kinase; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; transcription factor; animal tissue; article; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; female; gene expression profiling; gene overexpression; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose utilization; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease; inhibition kinetics; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; mitochondrial gene; mitochondrial respiration; molecular dynamics; mouse; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; skeletal muscle; transcription regulation; transgenic mouse; upregulation; animal; gene expression regulation; metabolism; Mus musculus; Animals; Calcineurin; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Glycogen; Heat-Shock Proteins; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen; PPAR gamma; Protein Kinases; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847265875

Changes in both the critical micelle concentration and the degree of counterion binding of the surfactant upon the addition of glycerol across a temperature range (20-40 °C) were examined by using the conductance method. The equilibrium model of micelle formation was applied to obtain the thermodynamic parameters of micellization. An enthalpy-entropy compensation effect was observed in all the solvent systems, but whereas the micellization of the surfactant in the medium with 20% glycerol occurs under the same structural conditions as in pure water, in glycerol rich mixtures the results suggest that the lower aggregation in these media is due to the minor cohesive energy of the solvent system in relation to water. It was also observed that the micellar aggregation number, as obtained by the static quenching method, decreases with the glycerol content. This fact was attributed to an increase in the surface area per headgroup of the surfactant as a consequence of an enhanced solvation, probably induced by the incorporation of some glycerol molecules in the micellar solvation layer. Although the pyrene 1:3 ratio index does not indicate significant changes in the micropolarity at the micelle-bulk interface, the data of fluorescence anisotropy of coumarin 6 and fluorescein are compatible with the formation of a more compact solvation layer. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Odum reduced ecological phenomena to storages, fluxes and transformations of energy and by doing so he undermined the autonomy of ecological science. To surmount this situation, Patten and coworkers offer an alternative framework, namely environ analysis. Resulting in novel ontological perspectives, environ analysis attempts to represent phenomena that are characteristically biological in nature, rather than purely physical or chemical. However, Patten and coworkers do not assign autonomy to ecosystem processes related to these phenomena and lead themselves to the ""reductionist trap"". In an effort to escape this trap they throw off the traditional ecosystem models and proceed to methodological reforms. This way, they finally achieve to partly outmatch the reductionism associated traditionally with Systems Ecology, although the holding to a framework which overrates prediction probably jeopardizes the whole enterprise. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we demonstrated an approach to largely increasing the EC of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) by bridging the OMC particles with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Infiltration of the pores of ordered mesoporous SBA-15 silica with a carbon precursor yielded a carbon/mesoporous silica composite, which was further used as a support for Ni catalyst. Subsequently, catalytic growth of CNTs on the Ni-supported composite surface was carried out using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with benzene as the carbon precursor. Removal of the silica framework and the metal catalyst left behind OMC particles bridged with CNTs. The EC of the OMC was increased from 138 S/m (before bridging) to 645 S/m (after bridging). Because of the significant enhancement of EC and the availability of mesopores, the cyclability of the hybrid carbon materials as a negative electrode used in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries was significantly improved. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The net result would be that Europe would need to import double the amount of gas that it does now - in other words, imports would need to increase from 300 billion cu m/yr to 0.6 trillion cu m/yr. Europe's staggering dependence on imports means action is needed to mitigate the risk of a shortage. To satisfy Europe's incremental electricity demand using nuclear power, around 70 new plants or around 115 Gw of nuclear capacity will be needed by 2020. To satisfy incremental demand using wind and solar power would require 15,000 new turbines and 50,000 football fields of solar panels to be installed each year. However, alternative energy sources will not even be able to cover just Europe's incremental electricity demand from here to 2020. Much of this growth will inevitably be satisfied by gas. The second set of proposals involved reducing the importance of gas in Europe's energy mix by resurrecting nuclear power, boosting research into renewables, and developing efficient and effective carbon capture and storage technologies. The third proposal is focused on energy efficiency.

Hydrogen is an important alternative energy source for the growing energy demand and the answer to the present need of a clean, efficient, and environmentally-friendly fuel. While the proved hydrocarbon reserves in Mexico will last for just some more decades, hydrogen, in counterpart, is the most abundant element in the universe and the third one in the earth’s surface. Burning hydrogen in a combustion engine produces water and a small amount of nitrogen oxides, which can be eliminated in proton exchange membrane fuel cells or in alkaline fuel cells. Fuel cells working with hydrogen are electrochemical devices where the recombination of hydrogen with oxygen produces electricity, heat and water in a silent manner. In the seventies, most countries started in hydrogen research and development due to the petroleum crisis; being Germany, Canada and Japan the most advanced countries in the area. USA announced in 2003 a $1.2 billion Hydrogen Fuel Initiative to develop technology for commercially viable hydrogen-powered fuel cells. Iceland, one of the countries with large contaminant emissions, is working to become the first hydrogen based economy. In the other hand, two hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium, could produce energy for the future through thermonuclear reactions. Mexico needs to include in its energetic program research and development in hydrogen for its use as an energy carrier of the renewable and still non renewable energy sources. Mexico should also explore the possibility of becoming a member of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ITER project, like other countries (e.g. India), to develop a clean energy future. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Direct Methanol Fuel Cell; Fuel Cell; Hydrogen Production; Hydrogen Storage; Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell","Alkaline fuel cells; Experimental reactors; Fossil fuels; Gas fuel purification; Nitrogen oxides; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Renewable energy resources; Tokamak devices; Alternative energy source; Contaminant emissions; Environmentally friendly fuels; Hydrocarbon reserves; Hydrogen-based economy; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Non-renewable energy sources; Research and development; Hydrogen economy",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108428638

Regarding this last issue, there are doubts concerning stability of geological sites to storage nuclear waste as well as possible leakage and migration of radioactive waste from containers, which potentially could contaminate underground aquifers. Technical explanations about safety designs of those nuclear waste storages do not convince general public because of the thousand of year half-life of the radioactive generating material from uranium fuel. Nature has contributed to present us a wonderful example concerning immobility of nuclear waste, not in a period of thousand of years, but thousands of million of years. This paper describes the discovery of several Nuclear Reactors (NRs) that operated two thousand of million years ago, in the Republic of Gabon, Africa. The discovery of at least 17 NRs in Oklo uranium mine in Gabon was possible from the analysis of the nuclear waste that remaining undisturbed in that mine for nearly two thousand of million years. The reactors were very small of about ten centimeters in diameter and had a power of around 100 kilowatts and were intermittently operating during 150,000 years. Xenon gases generated from the reactors were kept in the crystalline matrix of aluminium phosphate glasses. Recent analysis of the whole production and trapping process of xenon gasses permitted to know that reactors were intermittently operating in cycles of about 30 minutes and additionally aluminium phosphate glasses showed the capability of trapping xenon gasses in its crystalline matrix for nearly two thousand of millions years. This paper presents the “design”, functioning and safety storage of nucl waste of NRs that were performed by interdisciplinary work by nature in Oklo, long before man appeared on earth. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Crystalline Matrix; Nuclear Waste; Phosphate Glass; Radioactive Waste; Safety Storage","Aluminum compounds; Aquifers; Glass; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Nanocrystalline materials; Nuclear energy; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Radioisotopes; Uranium; Xenon; Aluminium phosphates; Crystalline matrices; General publics; Interdisciplinary work; Nuclear accidents; Nuclear waste storage; Public acceptance; Uranium fuels; Radioactive waste storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108414385

Efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the past few years, offering promising alternatives in power generation and better fuel efficiency. However, the incorporation of these new technologies to our daily lives represents a big challenge to be solved in the mid- to long-term, leaving separation and CO2 sequestration to be an immediate priority for researchers. CO2 capture and storage can support the transition of our fossil fuel based energy supply towards a sustainable energy system, based upon nuclear and renewable sources. Our present energy infrastructure will largely remain the same during this transition period. For example, electric power plants will be equipped with CO2 capture units, but will produce the same electricity, transported and distributed over the same grid. The first step in the CO2 capture and storage chain is to capture carbon in a high concentration. This can be done before or after combustion of the fuel. Capture is best carried out at large sources of emissions, such as power stations, refineries and other industrial complexes. There are several ways to capture CO2, some of the main methods are absorbents using solvents or solid sorbents, which have been used in industry for several years and seems to be the most feasible solution at this time; membranes have also become an interesting alternative and although extensive research is in progress, new materials for membranes have yet to be discovered. Other methods like pressure- and temperature-swing adsorption using various solid sorbents, cryogenic distillation and new emerging technologies show promising results in the bench testing scale. This report presents a comparison between these different methods. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Energy Penalty; Hydrate Formation; Integrate Gasification Combine Cycle; Pressure Swing Adsorption; Solid Sorbent","Adsorbents; Carbon dioxide; Distillation; Electric power systems; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Membranes; Atmosphere pollution; Cryogenic distillations; Emerging technologies; Energy infrastructures; Industrial complex; Pressure and temperature; Renewable sources; Sustainable energy systems; Electric power plants",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108411626

In the literature, development and testing were conducted for prototypes of PCM wallboard and PCM concrete systems to enhance the thermal energy storage (TES) capacity of standard gypsum wallboard and concrete blocks, with particular interest in peak load shifting and solar energy utilization. The idea studied here was to integrate a PCM in construction materials and test them in real buildings to check improvements in thermal performance. The first experiment was the inclusion of a microencapsulated PCM in concrete and the construction of a small house-sized cubicle with this new PCM-concrete. A second cubicle with the exact same characteristics and orientation, but built with standard concrete, was located next to the first one as the reference case. The thermal behavior of such cubicles was tested during the years 2005 and 2006. In autumn 2006 a Trombe wall was added in both cubicles and its influence was investigated.

To successfully model a TWC, it is critical that the oxygen storage function in the catalyst be adequately represented. The original oxygen storage model (a simple ""bucket"" model) included in one of Ford's TWC models, SIMTWC, was developed for vehicle programs meeting LEV emission standards. Application of SIMTWC to test data from vehicles targeting more stringent emission standards, such as ULEV and PZEV, revealed limitations in the accuracy of the original bucket model. To address these limitations, an improved kinetic model of oxygen storage is being developed. This new model is more kinetically-detailed than the old model. Kinetic parameters, i.e., reaction constants and activation energies, are generated from laboratory flow reactor data with low frequency air-fuel ratio changes and validated using laboratory test data with high frequency air-fuel ratio fluctuations. Post-catalyst air-fuel ratio predictions are very close to actual measured values and demonstrate the model capability to handle air-fuel ratio switches typical of real vehicle control strategies.

Superfluous calories are stored as triglycerides (TGs), ready to satisfy future needs. To perform this seemingly simple task, the adipose tissue needs to be well connected. It needs to know the general energy status of the organism, including present demand, storage capacity, size of present energy store, etc. At yet another level of integration, energy, in the form of free fatty acids (FFA), can be redistributed, for example, from adipose tissue to meet the demands of other cell types (e.g., myocytes). An elaborate system of endocrine and paracrine functions as well as neuronal signaling makes sure that the adipose tissue is well integrated into the general energy network described in greater detail elsewhere in this book. The importance of adipose tissue in this context is illustrated by the dramatic metabolic consequences that are induced by lack of it. Lipodystrophy both in man and mouse leads to, among other things, steatosis, hepatomegaly, and insulin resistance. In mice, transplanting adipose tissue back to lipodystrophic mice has been used as a way to treat this condition (1). This approach leads to a more or less complete reversal of the metabolic disturbances. Thus, supplying ample TG storage capacity to mice that lack it can cure many obesitylinked symptoms such as fatty liver and insulin resistance. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056686887

Regarding this last issue, there are doubts concerning stability of geological sites to storage nuclear waste as well as possible leakage and migration of radioactive waste from containers, which potentially could contaminate underground aquifers. Technical explanations about safety designs of those nuclear waste storages do not convince general public because of the thousand of year half-life of the radioactive generating material from uranium fuel. Nature has contributed to present us a wonderful example concerning immobility of nuclear waste, not in a period of thousand of years, but thousands of million of years. This paper describes the discovery of several Nuclear Reactors (NRs) that operated two thousand of million years ago, in the Republic of Gabon, Africa. The discovery of at least 17 NRs in Oklo uranium mine in Gabon was possible from the analysis of the nuclear waste that remaining undisturbed in that mine for nearly two thousand of million years. The reactors were very small of about ten centimeters in diameter and had a power of around 100 kilowatts and were intermittently operating during 150,000 years. Xenon gases generated from the reactors were kept in the crystalline matrix of aluminium phosphate glasses. Recent analysis of the whole pro- duction and trapping process of xenon gasses permitted to know that reactors were intermittently operating in cycles of about 30 minutes and additionally aluminium phosphate glasses showed the capability of trapping xenon gasses in its crystalline matrix for nearly two thousand of millions years. This paper presents the “design”, functioning and safety storage of nuclear waste of NRs that were performed by interdisciplinary work by nature in Oklo, long before man appeared on earth. © 2007, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

Efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the past few years, offering promising alternatives in power generation and better fuel efficiency. However, the incorporation of these new technologies to our daily lives represents a big challenge to be solved in the mid- to long-term, leaving separation and CO2 sequestration to be an immediate priority for researchers. CO2 capture and storage can support the transition of our fossil fuel based energy supply towards a sustainable energy system, based upon nuclear and renewable sources. Our present energy infrastructure will largely remain the same during this transition period. For example, electric power plants will be equipped with CO2 capture units, but will produce the same electricity, transported and distributed over the same grid. The first step in the CO2 capture and storage chain is to capture carbon in a high concentration. This can be done before or after combustion of the fuel. Capture is best carried out at large sources of emissions, such as power stations, refineries and other industrial complexes. There are several ways to capture CO2, some of the main methods are absorbents using solvents or solid sorbents, which have been used in industry for several years and seems to be the most feasible solution at this time; membranes have also become an interesting alternative and although extensive research is in progress, new materials for membranes have yet to be discovered. Other methods like pressure- and temperature-swing adsorption using various solid sorbents, cryogenic distillation and new emerging technologies show promising results in the bench testing scale. This report presents a comparison between these different methods. © 2007, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

Because index structures require intensively fine-grained updates/modifications, block-oriented access over flash memory could introduce a significant number of redundant writes. This might not only severely degrade the overall performance, but also damage the reliability of flash memory. In this paper, we propose a very different approach, which can efficiently handle fine-grained updates/modifications caused by B-tree index access over flash memory. The implementation is done directly over the flash translation layer (FTL); hence, no modifications to existing application systems are needed. We demonstrate that when index structures are adopted over flash memory, the proposed methodology can significantly improve the system performance and, at the same time, reduce both the overhead of flash-memory management and the energy dissipation. The average response time of record insertions and deletions was also significantly reduced. © 2007, ACM.

Rovisco Pais, Lisbon, 1049-001, Portugal","The islands’ high energy costs make them excellent test beds for introduction of new technologies. Some islands are trying to become so called renewable islands, to satisfy their energy demand mainly or entirely from indigenous and renewable sources, thus increasing the security of supply, and employment opportunities, without necessarily increasing the costs. Advanced energy planning must consider different intermittent and constant resources, to satisfy the demand for energy, water and fuel for transport, taking into account security of supply on different time scales and necessary supply storage. Such studies cannot be done with traditional methods (LDC and Weibul curves) therefore time series analysis methodology is a requirement. The most promising energy storing technologies are reversible hydro (where geography allows) and storing hydrogen, making possible in the first case integration of the water system, and in the second case integration of the future hydrogen based power and transport systems. This paper describes the new developments in H2RES model, and its application on the example of an isolated island in Madeira archipelago, Porto Santo. HzRES is based on time series analysis that includes wind, precipitation and solar as renewable resources and presents reversible hydro, batteries and hydrogen as energy storages. It also allows for deferrable and hydrogen loads. Considering the present situation and the expected energy needs in Porto Santo by 2010, 7 possible cases of evolution of renewable energies in the island are presented, considering the power and road transport systems. The renewable sources available are wind and solar. In some of the cases, storage is introduced: the excess renewable energy can be used to electrolyze water and the produced hydrogen is stored for later use by fuel cells, either for supplying the power system or for transport needs. Renewable sources can be limited to 30% or to 100% of load, on hourly basis. It is seen that it is possible to significantly increase the penetration of renewable energy sources, albeit at a relatively high cost, with hydrogen storage technology. The H21ZES model can serve as a valuable tool for island energy planning. © 2007 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

In order to identify the potential for such MH/TEG-units, a TEG-model has been developed that is currently being verified based on laboratory experiments. Over the past several years hydrogen energy system experts at IFE have developed and managed a collection of hydrogen energy models (HYDROGEMS) that is increasingly being used to develop renewable-hydrogen (RE/H2) projects in countries all around the world. By interfacing the developed TEG-model with the HYDROGEMS library we will be able to virtually connect the TEG-technology to various other technologies, such as metal hydrides, electrolysers, fuel cells, photovoltaics, and wind energy conversion systems, in order to n odeling the design and control of such RE/TEG/Hz-systems.

Producing marketable recycled oil with a sufficiently low content of water, sulphur, heavy metals and other trace elements requires energy-intensive processing of oil/water mixtures containing up to 90% water. This paper addresses the energy economy of a processing plant that suffers from significant heat losses as a result of electricity use for heating and the time-delays between receiving the raw material and its actual processing. An assessment is made of the scale of the energy dissipation and how these can be reduced, for example, by replacing input of electricity by a heat source; by reducing on the heat losses to the environment during product and raw material storage; by making better use of the heat of the incoming raw material when it is delivered; and by using heat storage volumes for ""hot"" streams of raw material, product oil and water separated from the oil/water mixtures. Exergy analysis is used to calculate the energy losses to the environment and the efficiency of the heat exchange steps. Minimising the use of electricity and fuel oil for heating purposes is the main target in this work. Also included in the analysis are seasonal effects. An example shows how batch-wise receiving of raw material could be integrated with a continuous process where hot water is one of the by-products.","Heat optimisation; Recycled oil; Waste oil processing","Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heavy metals; Mixtures; Recycling; Time delay; Trace elements; Water conservation; Continuous process; Material storages; Oil/water mixtures; Optimisations; Processing plants; Recycled oil; Seasonal effects; Waste oil; Water recycling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930985868

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) remains an important tool in Dutch waste management policies. In 2002 the new National Waste Management Plan 2002-2012 (NWMP) became effective. It was supported by some 150 LCA studies for more than 20 different waste streams. The LCA results provided a benchmark level for new waste management technologies. Although not new, operational techniques using combined pyrolysis/gasification are still fairly rare in Europe. The goal of this study is to determine the environmental performance of the only full scale pyrolysis/gasification plant in the Netherlands and to compare it with more conventional techniques such as incineration. The results of the study support the process of obtaining environmental permits. Methods. In this study we used an impact assessment method based on the guidelines described by the Centre of Environmental Science (CML) of Leiden University. The functional unit is defined as treatment of 1 ton of collected hazardous waste (paint packaging waste). Similar to the NWMP, not only normalized scores are presented but also 7 aggegated scores. All interventions from the foreground process (land use, emissions, final waste) are derived directly from the site with the exception of emissions to soil which were calculated. Interventions are accounted to each of the different waste streams by physical relations. Data from background processes are taken from the IVAM LCA database 4.0 mostly originating from the Swiss ETH96 database and adapted to the Dutch situation. Allocation was avoided by using system enlargement. The study has been peer reviewed by an external expert. Results and Discussion. It was possible to determine an environmental performance for the pyrolysis/ gasification of paint packaging waste. The Life Cycle Inventory was mainly hampered by the uncertainty occurred with estimated air emissions. Here several assumptions had to be made because several waste inputs and two waste treatment installations profit from one flue gas cleaning treatment thus making it difficult to allocate the emission values from the flue gasses. Compared to incineration in a rotary kiln, pyrolysis/gasification of hazardous waste showed better scores for most of the considered impact categories. Only for the impact categories biodiversity and life support the incineration option proved favorable due to a lower land use. Several impact categories had significant influence on the conclusions: acidification, global warming potential, human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The first three are related to a better energy efficiency for pyrolysis/ gasification leading to less fossil energy consumption. Terrestrial ecotoxicity in this case is related to specific emissions of mercury and chromium (III). A sensitivity analysis has been performed as well. It was found that the environmental performance of the gasification technique is sensitive to the energy efficiency that can be reached as well as the choice for the avoided fossil energy source. In this study a conservative choice for diesel oil was made whereas a choice for heavy or light fuel oil would further improve the environmental profile. Conclusions. Gasification of hazardous waste has a better environmental performance compared to the traditional incineration in rotary kilns mainly due to the high energy efficiency. As was determined by sensitivity analysis the differences in environmental performance are significant. Improvement options for a better performance are a decrease of process emissions (especially mercury) and a further improvement of the energy balance by decreasing the electricity consumption for shredders and oxygen consumption or making more use of green electricity. Recommendations and Perspectives. Although the life cycle inventory was sufficiently complete, stillsome assumptions had to be made in order to establish sound mass balances on the level of individual components and substances. The data on input of waste and output of emissions and final waste were not compatible. It was recommended that companies put more emphasis on data storage accounted to particular waste streams. This is even more relevant since more companies in the future are expected to include life cycle impacts in their environmental performance. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Avoided burden; Hazardous waste; Life cycle assessment; Paint waste; Pyrolysis/gasification; Waste management","chromium; diesel fuel; fossil fuel; mercury; paint; acidification; article; ecotoxicity; energy conservation; energy resource; flue gas; gasification; greenhouse effect; hazardous waste; incineration; intermethod comparison; land use; life cycle assessment; Netherlands; oxygen consumption; paint industry; peer review; priority journal; pyrolysis; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930480662

This wind power plant operates CEZ company within a wind farm about general site rated power 1,165 MW in locality Mravenecnik above Kouty nad Desnou. The farm is situated in Medvedi mountain not far from pumped storage hydro plant Dlouhe Strane in Jeseniky at the level of 1160 m above sea. This wind power plant belonged to the highly situated wind power plant in Europe. Basic for evaluation is measuring, which run on wind power plant in phase from 11.10.2005 to the 23.5.2006. Analysis has been carried out in light of average rate wind, instantaneous power and produced energy. Further there are analyzed types and failure frequency, that occurred during running. Measured data was viewed, how long the power station was able to supply electric energy, how long was in failure and what was time of single failures. The policy of renewable sources set very ambitious purposes for integration of wind power plants into the network power system all over the world. Problem in use of wind energy is, however, variability of power wind power plants - wind speed is accidental (stochastic). Output power of wind power plant changes dependence on time and it is not dirigible in the same way as it is convention power plants. Power control (secondary, tertiary) is impacted, inclusive dispatch control. Because at running electricity sector system pays that the production must stow consumption, it is always need to ensure reserve power for even up departures that the wind power plant implicate. During period of calm, energy must be replaced by other sources - energy (kWh) is then more expensive. For preservation of right reliability is necessary, at high rate wind power plant in system, to ensure not only needed reserve power, but also it is necessary to strengthen transmission line.","Analysis wind power plant; Reliability","Balloons; Electric utilities; Reactive power; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Stochastic systems; Electric energies; Electricity sector; Failure frequency; Instantaneous power; Network power; Power station; Pumped-storage hydro; Renewable sources; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904768339

This work deals with different ways of design systems of accumulation of electric energy in parks of wind power plants. There were described these five options of accumulation of electricity in parks of wind power plants: Supply of Peak Energy, Minimal Supply, Prediction of Supply of Power, Cover of Own Consumption and Overdesign of Accumulation. Analysis of these five variants related to specific wind power plant pointed to that there are necessary large accumulation capacities to supply reliable wind energy (variants Supply of Peak Energy and Minimal Supply). In case of options Prediction of Supply of Power and Cover of Own Consumption can be used any size of accumulation. Option Prediction of Supply of Power looks like the most economical one of these five variants. There are also mentioned fuel cells their advantages and disadvantages. Fuel cells use clean hydrogen (or hydrogen containing fuel) and oxygen to produce electricity during electrochemical process. Fuel cell consists of two electrodes - negative anode and positive cathode which surround electrolyte. Anode is supplied by hydrogen and cathode is supplied by oxygen. Hydrogen atoms are then activated by catalyst and divide into protons and electrons. Electrons go throw external electric circuit producing electricity while protons go throw the electrolyte to the cathode where they join up with oxygen and electrons producing water and heat. Advantage is that fuel cells (PEM type) use only clean hydrogen. They work without polluting matters. They have high efficiency. Fuel cells are suitable for cogeneration because as it was mentioned they produce also heat and water. Their overall efficiency rise when they are use in cogeneration. Fuel cells don't require charging up. If fuel is supplied they work consecutively. Main disadvantage is that the hydrogen is difficult to produce and to storage and is often made from fossil fuels. His energy density is low. Fuel cells are very sensitive to impurities in fuel which can damage expensive catalyst. Fuel cells were compared with other sources of electric energy - batteries and internal combustion engines in terms of efficiency and number of energy conversion. In case of appliance fuel cells as electricity generators they demand less energy conversion than heat engine. There is presumption that this work will be developed with purpose of choose an optimal storage system with the help of multicriterial analysis method.","Accumulation of electric energy; Fuel cell; Wind power plant","Atoms; Catalysts; Cathodes; Energy conversion; Forecasting; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Internal combustion engines; Oxygen; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Protons; Reactive power; Solid electrolytes; Wind power; Analysis method; Electric energies; Electric supply systems; Electricity generators; Electrochemical process; Hydrogen-containing fuels; Negative anodes; Overall efficiency; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904722741

The rooms, whose envelopes are made from light-weight materials, often don't execute requirements on the thermal stability in summer time. Increase of the thermal storage capacity of the building materials has a major effect on the thermal stability of indoor climate. Common massive structures, like masonry, concrete walls or floor slabs, can store thermal energy by their own thermal storage capacity. It depends especially on the mass of each structure. Low-energy building with light-weight envelopes has small thermal storage due to a low mass of load-bearing and non-bearing structures. In case of storing energy, e.g. from solar radiation, designers have to design a special bulky storage equipment. We can reduce volume of these containers by using Phase Change Materials. Installation phase change materials is one of the ways how to improve thermal storage properties of the light-weight envelopes. The principle is that instead of increase the mass of the envelopes is used latent heat of the phase change materials with low melting point.","Light-weight structures; Phase change materials; Thermal heat storage","Building materials; Intelligent buildings; Light weight structures; Phase change materials; Sun; Sustainable development; Thermodynamic stability; Energy demands; Internal structure; Lightweight materials; Low energy buildings; Low melting point; Massive structures; Thermal heat; Thermal storage; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902596818

The thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of LPPS/HPPS blends were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The results show that the melting point, crystallization temperature and crystalline growth rate of the blends decrease; while crystalline activation energy increases with the increasing of HPPS content. DMA shows higher value of storage modulus (E′) and glass transition temperature (Tg). There may be some strong interactions between HPPS and LPPS, which hinder the motion of LPPS chains.","Hyperbranched; Poly(phenylene sulfide); Polymer composite; Thermal property","Activation energy; Crystalline materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Molecular mass; Polymers; Thermodynamic properties; Crystalline growth; Crystallization temperature; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Dynamic mechanical property; Hyperbranched; Poly(phenylene sulfide); Polymer composite; Strong interaction; Mechanical properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902504744

The main scientific objective is the study of the antimatter component of cosmic rays over a wide range of energies. PAMELA is mounted on the Resurs DK1 satellite that was launched on June 15th 2006 and is orbiting the Earth on a semipolar (70) elliptical (350 600 km2) orbit. The experiment has a foreseen lifetime of at least 3 years. PAMELA is built around a permanent magnet silicon spectrometer, surrounded by a plastic scintillator anticoincidence shield. An electromagnetic calorimeter is used for particle identification and energy measurements. If PAMELA data exceed the storage allowance on the satellite or the daily downlink quota (now 20 GB), a second level trigger may be activated by uplink from ground. Information from the anticoincidence system and from the calorimeter will be included in the second level trigger condition, providing a selective reduction of data. The data reduction and the systematic uncertainties in the proton and electron spectra are evaluated with in-orbit data and compared to simulations.",,"Data reduction; Digital storage; Experiments; Particle detectors; Anticoincidence shield; Anticoincidence systems; Electromagnetic calorimeter; Particle identifications; Plastic scintillator; Satellite-borne experiment; Scientific objectives; Systematic uncertainties; Cosmic rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899495976

Shunt controllers, as shown in Chap. 6, are recommended mainly for mitigation of the causes of disturbances, and not their effects in distanced nodes of a power-electronics system. In the case when reduction of disturbances effects is required, which leads to protection of sensitive loads from the deterioration in the supply-side voltage, we should rather apply dual arrangements - static series voltage PE quality controllers. Such controllers, operating as a synchronous voltage source, are included in the feeder in series between the supply voltage and the load, which is illustrated in Fig. 8.1 [1]. Series voltage controllers through inserting a voltage uC of a required waveshape maintain the required quality in the load-side voltage uL in case of various disturbances in terminal voltage uT. The type and allowable value and duration of mitigated disturbances in voltage uT, they depend on arrangement of the series voltage controller, its control system and capacitance of possible additional energy storage. In a distribution system we must maintain the energy balance, in which the following are taken into account: disturbance duration and instantaneous active powers pT, pC, pL, absorbed from the power source, energy storage and by the load. This chapter mainly discusses the most important responses and characteristics of static series controllers, designed on the basis of distribution static synchronous series compensator (D-SSSC) and AC/AC voltage regulators (VR). In addition, we also shall outline selected static shunt-series controllers, preserving a sensitive load from deterioration of supply voltage and at the same time protecting an electrical system from load impact.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883815247

Various PE devices and their combinations are addressed for particular or a range of voltage disturbances. A particular solution is applied taking into account demands for voltage quality and network configuration. In general, there are three types of static shunt PE voltage-quality controllers: The distribution static var compensator (D-SVC), distribution static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM) and various hybrid arrangements. From the viewpoint of device topology D-SVC and D-STATCOM are identical with SVC and STATCOM, respectively. The difference between them results from place of installation (distribution network or transmission system) and, in consequence, the rated power and control methodology. The SVC and STATCOM are flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices and are used to enhance controllability and increase the power transfer capability in transmission systems [1], whereas D-SVC and D-STATCOM are custom power-compensating shunt controllers used in distribution systems [2]. Their main purpose is voltage regulation, load compensation, but also voltage profile improvement.

This paper focuses on the integration of a 'combined waste (wastewater)/energy system' for an urban neighbourhood (the deep green district 'EVA Lanxmeer' in Culemborg, the Netherlands) integrated in a semi-public building: the 'EVA Centre'. The district consists of 250 houses (partially under construction), offices and a 'City farm'. The district is situ- ated in an ecologically sensitive area, because it concerns a drinking water extraction and retention area. Essential is the integrated approach, closing cycles of nutrients, water and carbon and integrating energy generation and waste manage- ment through cascading qualities and use of the concept of exergy. An innovative mixture of 'red and green' development is presented (urban agriculture). The design of the district and the EVA Centre is mainly based on permaculture and or- ganic design principles. Principally, the concept of combined decentralized systems is based on anaerobic digestion (with treatment of 'black waste water' and organic waste/garden &amp; park waste), Combined Heat Power (CHP). An accompanying closed green- house, designed as a four storey high double skin façade of the semi-public building, with integrated wastewater treat- ment for parts of the wastewater flows based on the Living Machine concept is added for educational purposes. In this vertical green house with 'hanging gardens' heat (and water) recovery and use of the surplus CO2 of the biogas plant takes place, together with heat/cold storage in an underlying aquifer. The concept is called 'Sustainable Implant' (or in short: S.I.). The S.I. will be realized as a part of the EVA Centre and has an interconnecting role between both residential district and EVA Centre, inhabitants and visitors. Especially the social context concerning the people living in this urban neighborhood, the role of the S.I. and the City- farm(er) will be explained. Besides, the system layout and dimensioning backgrounds, maintenance, conservation and administration of the integrated whole, and the possible consequences for the district and its inhabitants are explained.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953203255

For electricity chains, the performance is dominated by the impact of CO2 capture, increasing electricity production costs with 10-40% up to 4.5-6.5 €ct/kWh. CO2 transport and storage in depleted gas fields or aquifers typically add another 0.1-1 €ct/kWh for transport distances between 0 and 200 km. The impact of CCS on hydrogen costs is small. Production and supply costs range from circa 8 €/GJ for the minimal infrastructure variant in which hydrogen is delivered to CHP units, up to 20 €/GJ for supply to households. Hydrogen costs for the transport sector are between 14 and 16 €/GJ for advanced large-scale coal gasification units and reformers, and over 20 €/GJ for decentralised membrane reformers. Although the CO2 price required to induce CCS in hydrogen production is low in comparison to most electricity production options, electricity production with CCS generally deserves preference as CO2 mitigation option. Replacing natural gas or gasoline for hydrogen produced with CCS results in mitigation costs over 100 €/t CO2, whereas CO2 in the power sector could be reduced for costs below 60 €/t CO2 avoided. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

But oil and gas operators have to develop fields requiring much more processing and energy - i.e. very sour gases or extra heavy oils - while reducing the Green House Gases (GHG) emissions to mitigate the climate change consequences. Among the possible options, carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) appears to be a promising option in addition to power efficiency increase or renewable energies use. Total launched end 2006 an integrated CCS project in the South-West of France. It entails the conversion of a steam boiler into an oxy-fuel combustion unit, oxygen being used for combustion rather than air to obtain a more concentrated CO2 stream easier to capture. The pilot plant, which will produce some 40 t/h of steam for use other facilities, will emit up to 150,000 tons of CO2 over a 2-year period, which will be compressed and conveyed via pipeline to a depleted gas field, 30 kilometers away, where to be injected into a deep carbonate reservoir. CO2 injection is scheduled to begin end 2008. The paper presents the characteristics of the 30MWth oxy-boiler, one of the world first industrial oxy-combustion units. Then, it focuses on the critical issues that can be addressed with an integrated project of combustion CO2 injection into a geological formation: CO2 purity level required by each element of the CCS chain, validation of CO2 injection and migration models, and validation of the methodologies put in place to assess well and storage integrity.

One strategy for carbon dioxide capture in power plants that has not been extensively studied so far, is capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas at pressurized conditions prior to the expansion. Such a strategy could decrease the cost of CO2 captured or avoided compared to working under atmospheric conditions. In this paper, simulations of two different hybrid combined cycles with pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) and carbon dioxide capture are presented. The term ""hybrid cycle"" denotes the fact that they are dual-fuel cycles that use natural gas in a topping gas turbine cycle and supplementary firing of coal in a bottoming PFBC cycle. Carbon dioxide is captured from the pressurized flue gas by means of chemical absorption after the PFBC boiler but before expansion in the turbine. The results show a CO2 capture penalty of approximately 8 percentage points (including 90 % CO2 capture rate and CO2 compression to 110 bar), which makes the efficiency for the best performing cycle 44 %, compared to 52 % without CO2 capture. The largest part of the loss is the volume loss due to the CO2 capture and the subsequent lower mass flow through the turbine. To compensate somewhat for this loss, the CO2-lean flue gas is humidified. Also, there is a thermal loss associated with the lower mass flow of the CO2-lean flue gas, resulting in less available energy for feed water heating. Finally, there is a loss caused by the regeneration of CO2 absorbent. It is however quite low, since potassium carbonate is used, which requires less regeneration heat than for example the more commonly proposed monoethanolamine. The studied cycles are compared to conventional cycles, primarily on technical grounds. The comparison shows that the hybrid cycles have slightly higher net electrical efficiencies, but similar CO2 capture penalties.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Hybrid power cycles; PFBC","Boilers; Carbon capture; Climate change; Coal combustion; Expansion; Flue gases; Flues; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Gas plants; Gases; Mass transfer; Natural gasoline plants; Potash; Atmospheric conditions; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Hybrid power; Net electrical efficiency; PFBC; Pressurised fluidised-bed combustions; Pressurized fluidized bed combustion; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64449088619

This paper addresses these problems by introducing a mobile sink based routing scheme for congestion avoidance and energy efficient routing in wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme utilizes the sink mobility and an in-network storage model that is used to set up mini-sinks along the mobility trajectory of the sink. Mini-sinks are responsible for collecting data from the sensor nodes located in their vicinity, thus avoiding data flow to a single data collection point, e.g., a static sink that is the major cause of congestion, data loss and reduced lifetime of the sensor network. Also, in the proposed scheme data only has to travel a limited number of hops to reach the nearest mini-sink which helps to improve the energy consumption of the sensor nodes. Through simulation we show the effectiveness of the given routing scheme in terms of congestion avoidance and increased lifetime of the wireless sensor network. © 2007 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Congestion avoidance; Energy efficient routing; Mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Congestion avoidance; Data collection; Energy efficient routing; Energy efficient routing protocol; In-network storages; Mobile sinks; Number of hops; Routing scheme; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049115673

They use it mainly because the price of kerosene is cheaper than the other source of energy. The price of kerosene is still being subsidized by the Government but due to the increasing world oil price, the Government has decided to cut out the subsidy by replacing kerosene into other source of energy. One of the alternatives is natural gas. Actually natural gas has been used in the household sector through a distribution pipeline. However, due to the difficulties in developing the infrastructure, the experts try to modify the form of natural gas into a more transportable manner. They invented that natural gas can be transformed into its hydrate form which is solid and easy to be transported. This form is called Synthetic Natural gas Hydrate (SNGH). SNGH is the hydrate form of natural gas. It is formed by reacting natural gas and water in moderate pressure, 30-50 barg in a small tubular-bubble reactor and then cooled to -25 °C in a refrigeration storage. The product then is depressurized and packed in a plastic bag and after that put into a cold box for keeping the temperature below -10 °C to prevent the hydrate melt. The hydrate is transported via truck to the users. The user can use it by simply placing the hydrate in a storage and let the hydrate dissociate. The selling price of SNGH has to be set around US $ 8/MMBTU in order to compete with other alternative energy such as LPG and CNG. The production cost is roughly the same as LPG and CNG but the transportation cost can be reduced significantly.

Shell's strategy: to expand our alternative energies portfolio, while investing in advanced CO2 solutions in order to improve oui ability to manage emissions from our hydrocarbon business. Measures to manage future emissions will include developing new technologies to capture and store CO2 underground. The pursuit of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies allows Shell to play an important and leading role towards addressing the need for an increasing worldwide demand for energy, while at the same time dealing with the need to reduce global emissions. No single universal policy or technology will solve the CO2 challenge. Therefore, various CCS solutions will need to be considered within a portfolio of measures to reduce global CO2 emissions while assisting a transition towards a low-carbon energy future. Shell seeks to position itself as part of the solution to the climate change issue. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified C02 capture and storage (CCS) as the most promising for the rapid reduction of global emissions - by up to 55% by 21002. As the bridge to a more sustainable energy system, it is therefore a key solution for combating climate change - among a portfolio of solutions, including renewable energies, energy efficiency and biofuels In order to achieve deeper reductions in CO2 emissions there will need to be new technologies brought to the market to enable a 'Kyoto 2' type-agreement. Authorities such as the International Energy Agency, the European Union Commission for Research and the US Department of Energy predict that new technologies will include hydrogen fuels cells, clean coal technology, and storage of CO2 below ground - in deep saline formations or redundant reservoirs, or for enhanced oil recovery. Considerable attention is being focused on CO2 storage with the desire to reduce the cost of capture and storage below 25 $/t CO2. Shell has a special team working on the CO2 Capture Project (CCP) Joint Industry Project. For the CCP Shell carries out studies, manages projects and the team is involved evaluating opportunities for deployment of the technologies within Shell. Shell also provides the Vice Chairman for this initiative and has several key-players working on this project. CCP is an international collaboration among industry, governments, academics and environmental interest groups focused on developing technology for CO2 capture and geological storage. The CO2 Capture Team (CCT) conducts Shell's participation in the CO 2 Captare Project (CCP) and other external programs. CCT also works internally to apply external learnings and technologies within Shell businesses. Additionally, Shell's research and development funds and manages a separate CO2 storage program. Our goals are to: reduce the cost of capture by 60 to 80%, and demonstrate that geological storage can be secure. In addition to the CCP, Shell is involved in many other CO2 collaborations . A few of these are mentioned below: CO2CRC is a leading regional collaboration for capture and storage technology. Participants include international energy companies plus others from Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government helps with funding and organizational support. WESTCARB is a leading regional collaboration for infrastructure and demonstration. Participants include international energy companies plus others from the US West Coast. The US DoE helps with funding, including capital for an integrated demonstration. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme is a unique collaboration of governments and industry. It produces definitive reports for the participants, and sponsors the premier conference on capture and storage. The reports provide primary input to the IPCC. Participants include 18 governments and 17 multi-national companies. CCT participates on the executive committee.

A LED array with eight high-brightness LED units is adopted as the LED heat source in our study. The cooling enhancement system is composed of a heat sink with fins attached to our LED heat source and an array of electrodes connected to a high-voltage DC power supply. The electric field generated by parallel electrodes results in forced convection of air due to ionized particles between fins of heat sink, which significantly enhances the heat transfer from the heat source to outer atmosphere. Two different types of electrodes, i.e. line-type and needle-type, are employed in our experimental measurements. Different operation parameters, such as the number of electrodes, the pitch of electrodes, the input power and the distance between the heat sink and electrodes are systematically studied to evaluate their influences on the cooling enhancement of our LED source. For the purpose of comparison, a traditional cooling fan is also tested in our experiments. The needle electrode is proven more effective than the linear electrode.

In principle, sparse matrix converter is constructed by connecting a front-end bi-directional rectification stage to a conventional two-level inversion stage with no bulky capacitive or inductive energy storage connected to their intermediate dc-link. Through proper modulation and compensation of the resulting converter, sinusoidal input current and output voltage can be achieved with minimized rectification switching loss, rendering the sparse matrix converter as a competitive choice for interfacing the utility grid to (e.g.) defense facilities that require a different frequency supply. As an improvement, sparse matrix converter assembled using a three-level energy processing stage has briefly been mentioned in the literature, but has neither been tested in simulation nor experimentally because its operational principles, pulse-width modulation (PWM) control and index compensation have not yet been discussed in the existing literature. Addressing the afore-described issues, this paper focuses on the operational mode analysis of a three-level sparse matrix converter implemented using a neutral-point-clamped inversion stage, and the design of a number of PWM and modulation ratio compensation schemes for controlling the converter with improved waveform quality. Performances and practicalities of the designed schemes are verified in simulation and experimentally using an implemented laboratory prototype with some representative results captured and presented in the paper. © 2007 IEEE.","Matrix converters; Neutral-point-clamped inverters; Pulse-width-modulation; Rectifiers","Matrix converters; Pulse width modulation; Quality control; Stages; Voltage control; Compensation scheme; Different frequency; Inductive energy storage; Industry applications; Neutral point clamped; Neutral point clamped inverters; Operational principles; Pulse width modulation control; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949107407

Dissipative is first explained in the classical setting of input/state/output systems. In the context of linear systems with quadratic supply rates, the construction of a storage leads to a linear matrix inequality (LMI). It is in this context that LMI's first emerged in the field. Next, we phrase dissipativity in the setting of behavioral systems, and present the construction of two canonical storages, the available storage and the required supply. This leads to a new notion of dissipativity, purely in terms of boundedness of the free supply that can be extracted from a system. The storage is then introduced as a latent variable associated with the supply rate as the manifest variable. The equivalance of dissipativity with the existence of a non-negative storage is proven. Finally, we deal with supply rates that are given as quadratic differential forms and state several results that relate the existence of a (non-negative) storage to the two-variable polynomial matrix that defines the quadratic differential form. In the EC presentation, we mainly discuss distributed dissipative systems described by constant coefficient linear PDE's. In this setting, the construction of storage functions leads to Hilbert's 17th problem on the representation of non-negative polynomials as a sum of squares. © 2007 EUCA.","Dissipation inequality; Dissipative; LMI; Quadratic differential forms; Storage; Supply rate","Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Linear matrix inequalities; Linear systems; Constant coefficients; Dissipation inequality; Dissipative; Dissipative systems; Non-negative polynomials; Quadratic differential forms; Supply rate; Two-variable polynomial matrices; Dynamical systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749139841

During CO2 injection, increasing fluid pressure, temperature variations, and chemical reactions between fluids and rocks inherently affect the state of stress inside the reservoir and in its surroundings. Besides, the mechanical properties of the rocks exposed to CO 2 may be altered. The impact of the resulting deformations on seal integrity must therefore be assessed in order to properly manage containment performance and leakage-incurred risks. The analysis starts with the construction and the calibration of a Mechanical Earth Model of the site, through joint analysis of geologic, seismic, logging, drilling, and laboratory test data. Such a model consistently describes ambient stresses, fluid pressures, and poro-mechanical and strength properties of the formations. It is linked to a reservoir model to achieve initial equilibrium and also to further simulate the coupled transport, chemical and mechanical processes occurring during CO2 injection operations and the subsequent re-equilibration. The predicted stress path allows the evaluation of the mechanical stability of both cap-rock and faults (which may bound the reservoir, penetrate the cap-rock or intercept wells). The stability of wells in formations experiencing strain is also investigated. In addition, an accurate Mechanical Earth Model contributes to optimizing well construction and stimulation operations. Profiles of stresses and mechanical properties along a planned-well trajectory allow designing a drilling operation that will maximize subsequent hydraulic isolation of the well by optimizing the wellbore condition. Similar information along existing wells helps to control hydrofracture propagation when injectivity enhancement is required. The Mechanical Earth Model can be used to develop operating envelopes for well placement, hydraulic fracturing, and CO2 injection that best ensure containment while achieving injectivity and capacity requirements.

This paper describes a concept for a market-oriented efficiency optimisation and service platform for electricity systems by using a consistent communication infrastructure to exchange necessary data, the project Integral Resource Optimisation Network (IRON). The future needed, higher requirements for communication will be covered by the new infrastructure and the basis for utilisation of the unused, potential and virtual energy storages will be created. Without influencing the behaviour of the user directly and promoted by economic incentives, the energy consumption will be adapted to the existing resources of supply by using the available, virtual energy storages via a market platform. Occurring, expensive spikes of consumption can be reduced, and the partner of the IRON market concept can share the thereby resulting economisation of costs. In this way the market platform leads to a more efficient use and contributes to reliability and stability of the electricity system. ©2007 IEEE.","Automation; Demand side management; Energy systems; Load management","Automation; Communication systems; Electric power systems; Energy utilization; Marketing; Demand side management; Energy systems; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749110649

Chemical treatment by coagulants and flocculants removed heavy metals most efficiently; they were transferred to the solid fraction in the order Zn > Cu > Cd by all three types of equipment. With centrifugation the heavy metal load on land where the solid fraction was applied was very low, whereas on land where the liquid fraction was applied it was only slightly less than that from un-separated manure. Conversely, chemical treatment resulted in a heavy metal load similar to that from un-separated manure with the solid fraction, while with the liquid fraction it was reduced to 20% of that from un-separated manure. Incineration of the solid fraction produces bottom ash and fly ash containing high levels of P. Most of the P and less than 10% of Cd is present in the bottom ash, producing an ash low in Cd content and a fly ash high in Cd. However, Cu and Ni tend to accumulate in the bottom ash. Chemical extraction procedures revealed that P-availability was high in all liquid and solid fractions except the bottom ash from incineration where -80% of the P was transformed into a form of apatite. Since more bottom ash than fly ash is being formed, significant amounts of P may be immobilized by incineration of solid fractions. © Selper Ltd, 2007.","Animal manure; Heavy metals; Incineration; Mechanical separators; Phosphorus","Ash handling; Ashes; Chemical equipment; Fertilizers; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Incineration; Liquids; Mammals; Phosphate minerals; Phosphorus; Separation; Animal manure; Chemical extractions; Chemical treatments; Liquid fraction; Manure treatment; P availabilities; Phosphorus contents; Separated manure; Manures; heavy metal; nitrogen; phosphorus; Apatite; Centrifuges; Extraction; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Incineration; Manures; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Waste treatment; centrifuge; chemical method; heavy metal; immobilization; incineration; manure; phosphorus; separation; article; ash; biomass; centrifugation; chemical composition; digestion; energy; fermentation; fertilization; incineration; manure; solid waste management; storage; Animalia; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39349114622

DTC is a high performance motor control scheme with fast torque and flux responses. However, the main disadvantage of conventional DTC is electromagnetic torque ripple. Besides, the matrix converter is a single-stage ac-ac power conversion device without dc-link energy storage elements. Due to the properties of the matrix converter, the pseudo dc-link will provide with three different types of voltage: the high, middle, and low voltages. Therefore, based on space vector modulation generated by a matrix converter, there are three states on each space vector location. By suitably selecting switching pattern, the electromagnetic torque ripple of the motor is effectively reduced. Using this switching strategy, the advantages of the DTC schemes and the benefits of the matrix converters can be combined. As a result, a satisfactory servo drive can be achieved. © 2007 IEEE.","Direct torque control; Matrix converter; Pseudo DC-link; Space vector","Energy storage; Magnetic flux; Magnetoelectric effects; Power converters; Torque control; Direct torque control; Electromagnetic torque ripple; Induction motor drive systems; Matrix converter; Space vector modulation; Induction motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049104709

Ground temperature gradients were established to a depth of 1.8m by measuring temperature at up to seven different vertical depths. Temperature gradients are presented for five different locations that include one reference location outside the collector region and four locations within the collector region. These highlight the impact of diurnal and seasonal factors, as well as ground cover and composition and heat pump operation on ground temperature. These results will support the development of optimised collector design and collector ground composition for maritime climates, as well as providing important input data for the validation of numerical models.","Ground source heat pump; Ground/soil temperature gradient; Horizontal collector; Maritime climate; Renewable energy; Thermal storage","ground conditions; ground cover; model validation; numerical model; optimization; pump; renewable resource; soil temperature; temperature gradient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849188515

The process of changing the interrelated public and private services, systems and infrastructures is becoming more and more complicated and less predictable. Together with the increased scaling, the convergence of utilities and the growing number of parties and techniques involved, the end users (consumers) subjective dependence (heteronomy) has increased. This asks for a simplification of the processes, products (or rather, services). A larger concentration on integral provision of services, or, in other words, the supply and management of integral packages, offers possibilities. This seems to be reinforced by the ongoing liberalization processes. This paper will focus on an innovative concept of integrated decentralised technologies for wastewater and organic waste treatment with energy and nutrients recovery. The concept is called Sustainable Implant (SI). Principally, the concept is based on a small-scale biogas installation (with treatment of blackwater and organic waste), Combined Heat Power (CHP) and accompanying closed glasshouse with hanging gardens. These hanging gardens are situated in a non-ventilated space with heat (and water) recovery, heat/cold storage (in an underlying aquifer) and with injection of the surplus CO2 of the biogas plant. The SI will be realized as a part of this semi-public building and has an interconnecting role between both district and building, inhabitants and visitors. The system layout and the dimensioning backgrounds are explained in this paper. Additional emphasis is put on maintenance, conservation and administration of the integrated whole, and the possible consequences for the district and its inhabitants.","Anaerobic waste treatment; Decentralisation; Local reuse","biogas; combined heat and power; convergence; decentralization; liberalization; recovery; recycling; service provision; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849185252

About 30-40 of world energy is used in the built environment. In the past, energy-saving efforts were aimed on the one hand at reducing energy demand (e.g. improved insulation) and improving energy efficiency (e.g. high-performance gas heaters). On the other hand, effort has been put into the development and implementation of sustainable energy technology. Innovations on energy systems at a scale surpassing that of individual buildings have received relatively little attention. The current system of energy supply and use under-utilises the local and regional potential for self-sufficiency. High-quality energy is still often used for energy conversion processes requiring only low-quality energy. Instead of aiming for low energy losses in such processes, it may be more effective in terms of sustainability, to minimise exergy losses. A key objective of a low-exergy approach in a cascade of energy conversion processes is to minimise the amount of primary energy used by minimising exergy losses at each stage. Until now the low-exergy approach has been studied at the level of individual appliances or at most at single-building scale. However, given the potential of the total energy chain, exergy use should be implemented on a regional scale. This creates new opportunities for energy-savings. This paper gives examples and possibilities of a low-exergy approach at a regional scale that can lead to further energy-saving gains.","Cascading; Energy; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Energy transport; Exergy; Local potentials; Regional planning; Waste energy","energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy flux; energy planning; exergy; innovation; regional planning; sustainable development; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849161450

The trapping energy level of SiNx films with different composition ratio deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) were first characterized by photoluminescence (PL) measurement. Moreover, using F-N/CHE program and charge pumping techniques, the vertical location and the lateral distribution of programmed charges are investigated in the nitride films with different composition ratio. The study offers strong evidence that the density of charge-trapping levels in the Si-rich nitride is higher than the standard nitride. A simple qualitative model and calculation explains that the trapping level distributions in the SiNx films are shallower by increasing relative Si-content. Furthermore, we have observed the nitride trap vertical location was changed by adjusted Si/N composition ratio. And the lateral distribution of hot electron programmed charges in the modified nitride is broader than that in the standard nitride because it offered more charge-trapping sites and shallower charge-trapping levels. In summary, the study can help researchers to understand the nitride charge-trapping mechanism and the analysis of optical/electrical characteristics. © 2007 Materials Research Society.",,"Charge distribution; Chemical vapor deposition; Electron traps; Nitrides; Photoluminescence; Polysilicon; Charge pumping; Composition ratio; Electron programmed charges; Flash memory devices; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549110044

These storage cells are present in liver, spleen and bone marrow resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia and bone complications. Metabolic abnormalities in Gaucher patients include hypermetabolism, possibly caused by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nonthyroidal illness (NTI) is a combination of changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels (decreased T(3), elevated rT(3), normal or mildly depressed TSH) present in different illnesses and might be an adaptation to protect the organism from harmful catabolic effects of hypermetabolism. The hypermetabolism and the elevated cytokine levels in Gaucher disease led us to hypothesize that the alterations in thyroid hormone levels as seen in NTI might also occur in Gaucher patients. We studied thyroid hormone levels before and during treatment in 22 adult type I Gaucher patients and resting energy expenditure (REE) and correlations with thyroid hormone levels in 12 patients. Baseline thyroid hormone levels were normal in the majority (17) of patients. No cases of nonthyroidal illness were detected. Baseline REE (kcal/kg per 24 h) was not correlated with circulating levels of T(3), rT(3) or fT(4). Treatment of Gaucher disease with enzyme replacement therapy for several years resulted in a decrease in circulating fT(4) levels. After several months of treatment most patients showed a decrease in REE.

As such, desalination technologies have been implemented to meet growing demands for fresh water. Among the desalination technologies, thermal desalination, including multi stage flash (MSF) and multi effect evaporation (MEE), is the current leading desalination process. Reverse osmosis (RO) is also being increasingly used. Despite technological improvements, thermal desalination and reverse osmosis continue to be intensive fossil-fuel consumers and contribute to increased levels of greenhouse gases. As energy costs rise, thermal desalination by solar energy and/or low cost waste heat is likely to become increasingly attractive. As part of a project investigating the productive use of saline land and the development of sustainable desalination systems, the feasibility of producing potable water from seawater or brackish water using desalination systems powered by renewable energy in the form of low-temperature solar-thermal sources has been studied. A salinity-gradient solar pond and an evacuated tube solar collector system have been used as heat sources. Solar ponds combine solar energy collection with long-term storage and can provide reliable thermal energy at temperature ranges from 50 to 90°C. A visual basic computer model of the different multi-stage flash desalination processes coupled with a salinity-gradient solar pond was developed to determine which process is preferable in regards to performance and greenhouse impact. The governing mathematical equations are derived from mass balances, heat energy balances, and heat transfer characteristics. Using the results from the modelling, a small-scale solar-powered desalination system, capable of producing up to 500 litres of fresh water per day, was designed and manufactured. This single-stage flash system consists of two main units: the heat supply and storage system and the flash desalination unit. Two different condenser heat exchanger materials were investigated: copper-nickel and a commercially available plastic. The modelling and design of a three effects MEE system is also discussed. The effects of the important design and operating parameters (recovery ratio, thermal energy, parasitic electrical energy, distillate production and solar collection area) controlling the cost of fresh water determined both from the computer simulation and experimental results are presented and analysed in this paper. Future work in the overall research program is also outlined. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Evacuated tube solar collectors; Modelling and simulation; Multi effect evaporation; Multi stage flash; Renewable energy; Solar desalination; Solar pond",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849073555

Renewable energy driven desalination systems have been extensively discussed as an innovative approach to desalinate water economically and in an environmentally friendly manner. The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RES) which results in the use of expensive energy storage systems usually limits the penetration of RES to the power generation system of a region. Desalination systems can utilise in a more economically efficient way the available RES potential. The energy produced is consumed for potable water production which can be stored economically for a large period of time before consumption. An integrated model for the use of renewable energies (wind, solar) in the desalination of seawater has been developed in the context of REDDES project. In this work, a model is developed where desalination technologies are coupled with RES power systems to produce potable water at the lower possible cost.

For electricity chains, the performance is dominated by the impact of CO2 capture, increasing electricity production costs with 10-40% up to 4.5-6.5 €ct/kWh. CO2 transport and storage in depleted gas fields or aquifers typically add another 0.1-1 €ct/kWh for transport distances between 0 and 200 km. The impact of CCS on hydrogen costs is small. Production and supply costs range from circa 8 €/GJ for the minimal infrastructure variant in which hydrogen is delivered to CHP units, up to 20 €/GJ for supply to households. Hydrogen costs for the transport sector are between 14 and 16 €/GJ for advanced large-scale coal gasification units and reformers, and over 20 €/GJ for decentralised membrane reformers. Although the CO2 price required to induce CCS in hydrogen production is low in comparison to most electricity production options, electricity production with CCS generally deserves preference as CO2 mitigation option. Replacing natural gas or gasoline for hydrogen produced with CCS results in mitigation costs over 100 €/t CO2, whereas CO2 in the power sector could be reduced for costs below 60 €/t CO2 avoided. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A lab-scale EBPR culture with Accumulibacter representing over 85% of the entire bacterial population as quantified with fluorescence in-situ hybridization was used in the study. Cell decay rates were found to be negligible under anaerobic and anoxic conditions and may be ignored in activated sludge models. The decay rate under aerobic conditions was determined to be 0.03/d at 22 °C, considerably lower than the values commonly used in activated sludge modeling. Polyphosphate and glycogen were utilized simultaneously under anaerobic and anoxic conditions for maintenance energy production, with glycogen being the primary energy source until the glycogen content reached very low levels. Glycogen was used by Accumulibacter as the primary source of energy for maintenance under aerobic conditions in the absence of polyhydroxyalkanoates. However, Accumulibacter did not seem to use polyphosphate for energy production during aerobic starvation, clearly contrasting the anaerobic and particularly the anoxic case. Intermittent aerobic-anaerobic storage resulted in not only negligible cell decay rate, but also slower rates of glycogen and polyphosphate utilization, and may therefore be an effective strategy for long-term storage of EBPR sludge. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

At any given absorption temperature, hydrogen absorption rate and storage capacity are found to increase with supply pressure. Cooling fluid temperature is found to have a significant effect on hydrogen storage time and higher values of the overall heat transfer coefficient yields better rates of absorption and desorption.

Hydrogen is thought to be an ideal energy source because of causing no pollutants or greenhouse gases during combustion unlike the fossil fuels. In this study, sorption characteristic of H2 and N2 gases in activated carbon having three different particle sizes were investigated in a temperature range of 303-473 K using a dynamic technique. The experimental procedure consist of introducing a pulse of H2 and N2 on the inlet of a column packed with activated carbon samples and measuring the concentration versus time response peak leaving the other end of the column. Adsorption equilibrium constants were evaluated using the moment analysis of the chromatographic peaks. At 473 K, the adsorption equilibrium constant for H2 on activated carbon having 4.76-0.85 mm particle size (ACI) was found to be 7.92 × 10- 4, whereas it has value of 1.83 × 10- 3 m3 / kg at 303 K.

In continuance of our previous work, three models were constructed for the depiction of the microporous carbonaceous structure. The first one (SSM) consisted of only two parallel sheets, being the lightest one used. The second (IHM) and third (HWM) models comprised structural imperfections in the form of pits and holes into their structure. Structural imperfections seemed to have a slight augmentative effect on the adsorption process. It was concluded that the addition of extra sheets to the walls did not result to any enhancement of the adsorption efficiency of the solid model. On the contrary, the lightest model exhibited superb results for the % weight-by-weight adsorption of hydrogen, approaching the highest value reported. Finally, a couple of suggestions on the development of a material for the storage of hydrogen were derived, based on the above conclusions. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Adsorption; Carbonaceous solids; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Molecular hydrogen; Simulation","Carbon; Computer simulation; Hydrogen storage; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Adsorption efficiency; Carbonaceous solids; Microporous carbons; Molecular hydrogen; Gas adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248832083

A surface modification technique enabled different Ni particle densities to coat onto the CNT surface, which was chemically oxidized by nitric acid. It was found that each nickel nanoparticle has an average size of 30-50 nm, and the Ni-attached CNTs still possessed a similar pore size distribution. Cyclic voltammetry measurements in 6 M KOH showed that the electrochemical adsorption and desorption amount of hydrogen is a linearly increasing function of the Ni loading. This enhancement of electrochemical activity was ascribed to a fact that Ni particle acts as a redox site for hydrogen storage, thus leading to a greater specific peak current. According to our calculation, the electrochemical capacitance of nickel nanocatalyst in KOH electrolyte was estimated to be the value of 217 F/g.

Depending on the absorbed dose of radiation, various effects can be achieved resulting in reduced storage losses, extended shelf life and/or improved microbiological and parasitological safety of foods. The most common irradiated commercial products are spices and vegetable seasonings. Spice irradiation is increasingly recognised as a method that reduces post-harvest losses, ensures hygienic quality, and facilitates trade with food products.

To by-pass the electrical grid stability constraints arising from an extensive RES utilization, the adaptation of an appropriate energy storage system (ESS) is essential. In the present analysis, the cost effect of introducing selected storage technologies in a large variety of autonomous electrical grids so as to ensure higher levels of RES penetration, in particular wind and solar, is examined in detail. A systematic parametrical analysis concerning the effect of the ESSs' main parameters on the economic behavior of the entire installation is also included. According to the results obtained, a properly sized RES-based electricity generation station in collaboration with the appropriate energy storage equipment is a promising solution for the energy demand problems of numerous autonomous electrical networks existing worldwide, at the same time suggesting a clean energy generation alternative and contributing to the diminution of the important environmental problems resulting from the operation of thermal power stations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This digital signature generation device (SGD) was developed especially for RFID tags. The design parameters were low energy consumption, small chip area, robustness against cryptographic attacks, and flexibility. The SGD was designed to work as digital processor in an RFID tag requiring the tag to provide the secret key storage and a PRNG. The SHA-1 calculation needs to be included into the SGD to avoid a microcontroller on the tag. The asymmetric cryptosystem allows authentication of the tag to untrusted third parties without revealing the secret key. The ECDSA functionality was implemented using a prime field GF(p) and affine coordinates, an alternative way to reduce the die size and the costs of the tag. The standard-cell based implementation of the device is fully scalable for different prime fields sizes. The GF(p192) version will need 23k gate equivalents or 1.3 mm2 for a 0.35μm process. 502k clock cycles are used for signature generation.

The mesoscale model is run on a single column using atmospheric data and radiation recorded above roof level as forcing. Here, the authors validate Martilli's urban boundary layer scheme using measurements from two mid-latitude European cities: Basel, Switzerland and Marseilles, France. For Basel, the model performance is evaluated with observations of canyon temperature, surface radiation, and energy balance fluxes obtained during the Basel urban boundary layer experiment (BUBBLE). The results show that the urban parameterization scheme represents correctly most of the behavior of the fluxes typical of the city center of Basel, including the large heat uptake by the urban fabric and the positive sensible heat flux at night. For Marseilles, the model performance is evaluated with observations of surface temperature, canyon temperature, surface radiation, and energy balance fluxes collected during the field experiments to constrain models of atmospheric pollution and transport of emissions (ESCOMPTE) and its urban boundary layer (UBL) campaign. At both urban sites, vegetation cover is less than 20%, therefore, particular attention was directed to the ability of Martilli's urban boundary layer scheme to reproduce the observations for the Marseilles city center, where the urban parameters and the synoptic forcing are totally different from Basel. Evaluation of the model with wall, road, and roof surface temperatures gave good results. The model correctly simulates the net radiation, canyon temperature, and the partitioning between the turbulent and storage heat fluxes.",,"air temperature; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; emission; measurement method; model validation; pollutant transport; urban area; Bouches-du-Rhone; Eurasia; Europe; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548378652

Three different side-inlet geometries; namely wedged, perforated, and slotted pipe-inlets; were tested using two 50 L capacity EWHs of aspect ratios 1 and 2 and two discharge rates 5 and 10 L/min. The three inlet designs are successful in promoting good thermal stratification inside the storage tanks of the EWHs. However, the degree of mixing produced by each design is found to have a significant impact on the performance. Thermal performance is quantified in terms of discharge efficiency, extraction efficiency, and fraction of heat recoverable. The results show an excellent performance for the slotted inlet. Although performance measures of perforated inlet are slightly less, the slotted inlet is attractive as it is simpler to manufacture and the extra cost associated with adopting it inside the existing EWH models is justified by the substantial savings in electricity and water consumptions, which ultimately concern the users. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrogen can be directly produced from solar energy and is considered a promising technology for temporary storage of electrical energy from wind turbines and photovoltaic systems. The generation of electrical energy from stored hydrogen requires highly efficient systems such as the so-called H2-Graz-Cycle, which is discussed in this paper. The H2-Graz-Cycle is a closed steam process based on the stoichiometric combustion of oxygen and hydrogen. It is shown that efficiencies of up to 51% can be achieved with the H2-Graz-Cycle even with small output powers in the range of 1.35 MWe1. The process is thus particularly suitable for decentralised applications. It is further shown that the cycle efficiency can be significantly increased to a level of 75% by integrating a high temperature fuel cell into the cycle.

Palmira, 62490 Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico","The scope of this article is to show the initial results obtained in the interconnection of a 2.7 kW solar panel system with a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyzer. The Non-Conventional Energies Department (ENC) at the Electrical Research Institute (IIE) considers that the storage of this intermittent energy by a chemical element such as hydrogen can be advantageous for certain applications. One of the arguments is that unlike traditional battery systems, hydrogen presents the great advantage of not discharging its energy content as long as it is not used. The solar-hydrogen (S-H) system proposed consists of a commercial electrolyzer stack by Proton Energy Systems and a photovoltaic (PV) solar system of 36 panels (75 W each) of monocrystalline silicon (Siemens) interconnected in a configuration for 2.7 kW power at 48 VDC. The complete electrolyzer (stack plus auxiliaries) has a maximum capacity of 1000 lN / h of hydrogen with a power energy consumption of 8 kVA (220 VAC, 32 A) and uses a stack of 25 cells of SPE with an energy consumption of 5.6 kW. We present voltage, current and energy consumption of the electrolyzer as a whole system and of the stack alone, as well as hydrogen quantification for the Hogen 40 operating in laboratory. These results allowed us to estimate the possibilities of coupling the electrolyzer stack alone, i.e. no auxiliaries nor power conditioning, with the solar PV system. Results such as I-E curves of the solar PV system obtained at different irradiances and temperatures, as well as I-E curve of SPE electrolyzer stack, gave direction for confirming that PV system configuration was sufficiently good to have the electrolyzer stack working near the maximum power point at a good range of irradiances (∼600-800 W / m2). © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Electrolyzer; Hydrogen; Photovoltaic; Solar hydrogen; Solid polymer electrolyte","Electrolytic cells; Energy utilization; Hydrogen; Photovoltaic cells; Polyelectrolytes; Solid electrolytes; Electrolyzers; Hydrogen quantification; Monocrystalline silicon; Solar hydrogen; Solar cell arrays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548206352

Irradiation experiments were conducted on NC MOS capacitors using protons of 1.5 MeV and 6.5 MeV and on NC nMOS transistors using protons of 1.5 MeV. The range of doses investigated was ∼1 to ∼ 100 Mrad(SiO2). A 2-D layer of Si NCs with ∼ 3 nm mean diameter and 1012 cm-2 surface density was successfully achieved by low-energy (1 keV) ion-beam-synthesis in thin SiO2 layers. After irradiation, programmed capacitors are found to undergo bit flip while programmed transistors are not Charge retention measurements at room temperature for the write and erase states of irradiated and non-irradiated samples reveal that a significant memory window exists at an extrapolated time of ten years even after an irradiation dose as high as 120 Mrad (SiO2). The flat-band decay rate of the erase state in NC MOS capacitors does not depend on the irradiation-dose while the opposite occurs for the write state which is found to be directly dependent on Dit values after irradiation. These results clearly indicate that NC Non-Volatile Memories (NVM) are promising radiation tolerant devices. © 2007 IEEE.","Data retention; Nanocrystal memories; Nonvolatile memory (NVM); Proton radiation effects","Irradiation; MOS capacitors; MOSFET devices; Nanocrystals; Nonvolatile storage; Protons; Radiation effects; Silica; Charge retention; Data retention; Ion-beam-synthesis; Proton radiation effects; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548074904

Thus, now seems an appropriate time for the scientific community and energy producers to exchange their knowledge in this debate far away from the magic solutions provided by mass media prophets, in an attempt to arrive at realistic guidelines that may help society to understand the important issues involved in the move towards a cleaner energy system. In this essay a description of the potential paths that may make it possible to change from the current energy sources to a cleaner energy production system is provided, the main focus being placed on how the so-called hydrogen economy might eventually be implemented. The milestones that the international agencies expect to emerge during the transition will be described, taking into account the issues of hydrogen production, distribution, storage and use. Additionally, the potential exploitation of the different hydrogen sources, both renewable and non-renewable, will be evaluated taking into account their availability and the efficiency of the processes used to transform them into hydrogen. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Biomass; Economy; Electricity; Energy; Hydrogen","Carbon dioxide; Gas fuel storage; Hydrogen; Nuclear energy; Particulate emissions; Cleaner environment; Energy supply; Mass media; Nuclear disaster; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547850134

The system consists of a strong-pinning type-II superconductor square loop subjected to a constant external, force and to magnetic fields. The loop oscillates in the upright position at a frequency that can be tuned in the range 10-1000 Hz, and has induced in it a rectified electrical current. The emphasis of this paper is on the evaluation of the major remaining sources of losses in the oscillations. We argue that such losses should, be associated, with the viscous vibration of pinned flux lines in the superconductor Nb-Ti wire, provided the oscillator is kept under vacuum and the magnetic field is sufficiently uniform. Losses of similar or greater magnitude would be associated with dragging of the loop against the He atmosphere remaining in the evacuated cryostat. We discuss how other different sources of loss would become negligible for such operational conditions, so that a very high quality factor Q exceeding 1010 might in principle be reached by the oscillator. The prospective utilization of such oscillator as a low-frequency high-Q clock is analyzed.","Energy storage systems; Superconductor devices; Type-II superconductivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547422232

One way to utilize the lipid sources better, could be to find ways to stimulate fatty acid (FA) oxidation so that Atlantic salmon use more energy for muscle growth and less for storage in perivisceral adipose tissue. We have previously shown that dietary inclusion of the thia FA tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) promoted hepatic β-oxidation and reduced total body lipid levels. However, dietary TTA also had some negative effects, leading to accumulation of sulfone and sulfoxide metabolites of TTA in the kidney and increasing mortality rates, particularly at low water temperatures. Therefore we also wish to investigate the effects of TTA on kidney function at high and low temperatures, including some immune system parameters. The production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) immunoreactive material from exogenously added arachidonic acid in isolated head kidney macrophages was affected by both diet and temperature. The phagocytic activity in these cells was reduced by DTA in the 12 °C group and there was significantly higher protein degradation in head kidney macrophages at 12 °C compared to 5 °C in all dietary groups. Interestingly, the incorporation of thia FAs in the kidney was higher at 5 °C (0.3% TTA and 0.6% DTA) than at 12 °C (0.1% TTA and 0.5% DTA). Additionally, there were lower levels of saturated FAs, while higher levels of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in the kidney of TTA fed fish at 5 °C. We also observed temperature-independent tubular dilatation and a reduction in the density of melanomacrophages of the kidney in salmon fed TTA. Nevertheless, the mRNA expression of some immune-relevant genes in head kidney tissue was not affected by TTA-inclusion in salmon diets. In conclusion, it is clear that 0.6% TTA-inclusion in the feed leads to changes in the kidney function particularly at low water temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The interactions of pharmaceutical powders (active ingredient(s) and excipients) with liquids and vapors (particularly aqueous solutions and their vapors) occur almost always during the production process. From the physical point of view, the interactions among individual components may differ from the expected because chemically identical substances obtained from different producers vary very much. These differences influence either the production process and/or the pharmaceutical form properties. In order to overcome these problems it is necessary to establish a control over the physico-chemical properties of the used materials. The aim of this work was to determine physico-chemical properties of three powder clindamycin phosphate samples (labeled as sample S(1), S(2) and S(3)) acquired through different suppliers. All the analysis were made for the purpose of establishing possible differences among the tested samples that showed variable physical stability in the solution: recrystallization of the S(3) sample in the aqueous solution has been established during storage under standard conditions. On the basis of the obtained data it was possible to recognize the differences among the tested clindamycin phosphate samples and to explain the anomalous behavior of one sample. The surface free energy components for the investigated clindamycin phosphate samples were determined using Wu and Good- van Oss method. The investigated clindamycin phosphate samples exhibit certain differences in surface free energy values as well as in surface morphology and thermal behavior. Comparison of alpha + and alpha - values leads to the conclusion that all three clindamycin phosphate samples perform as monopolar, more electron acceptors, i.e. Lewis acids. However, an important difference exists between samples S(1) and S(2) on one and S(3) on the other side. Sample S(3) exhibits stronger acidic behavior, what could be connected with its recrystallization during the storage. The samples S(1), S(2) and S(3) have different melting points e.g. ""onset"" temperatures. When the melting points move towards 200 (o ) C, the width of the ""onset"" temperature peak is especially important. In the case of wider peak, the potential for recrystallization seems to be higher. According to the stated, the sample S1 would be the ""sample of choice"" for the formulation of the stable pharmaceutical dosage form and has not shown any recrystallization tendencies during the storage period.",,"antiinfective agent; clindamycin; clindamycin phosphate; clindamycin-2-phosphate; drug derivative; unclassified drug; article; chemistry; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; drug stability; drug storage; methodology; pH; powder; surface property; transition temperature; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Clindamycin; Crystallization; Differential Thermal Analysis; Drug Stability; Drug Storage; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Powders; Surface Properties; Transition Temperature; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447509783

All the ZnS-SiO 2/PtO x/ZnS-SiO 2 multilayers exhibited a steep reflectivity drop at the temperature range between 265 and 350 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of PtO x. The decomposition temperature of the 4-nm-thick PtO x ultrathin film protected by ZnS-SiO 2 layers was much lower than those obtained in thick PtO x films without protection. The activation energy for thermal decomposition was ∼1.3 eV. Both the decomposition temperature and activation energy for thermal decomposition were unaffected by the constituent phases of PtO x. Carrier to noise ratios (CNR) of over 40 dB for mark size of 150 nm were achieved in all super-resolution near-field structure (super-RENS) disks, while the super-resolution readout was limited to 2.5 × 10 3 ∼ 4.5 × 10 4 cycles. The effect of constituent phases of PtO x on the super-resolution capability of super-RENS disk with a PtO x mask layer was minimal. However, as the constituent phases of PtO x mask layer transformed from a mixture of Pt and PtO, to pure PtO, and then to a mixture of PtO and PtO 2, the readout stability of super-RENS disk increased dramatically since less heat was absorbed by the PtO x mask layer composed of PtO and PtO 2 during the readout process, prohibiting the diffusion of materials inside the bubble to the GeSbTe phase change layer.

We present three complements to the standard model, i.e., (i) magnetotransport calculations based on ohmic conduction in the presence of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect, (ii) magnetotransport calculations based on spin-dependent tunneling in the presence of single charge tunneling (Coulomb blockade) effect, and (iii) stochastic micromagnetics, which incorporates the effects of thermal fluctuations via a white-noise thermal field in the LLG equation. All three complements are of practical importance: (i) magnetotransport model either in the ohmic or tunneling transport regimes, enables the conversion of the micromagnetic results to the measurable quantity of magnetoresistance ratio, while (ii) stochastic modeling is essential as the dimensions of the micromagnetic system reduces to the deep submicron regime and approaches the superparamagnetic limit.

Structural, morphological and magnetic properties exhibited by nanowire arrays have been studied for several nanowire compositions, different ordering degree and for different nanowire aspect ratios. The magnetic behaviour of nanowires array is governed by the balance between different energy contributions: shape anisotropy of individual nanowires, the magnetostatic interaction of dipolar origin among nanowires, and magnetocrystalline and magnetoelastic anisotropies induced by the pattern templates.

In this work, the influence of this type of freezing method and of the frozen storage of samples on the viscoelastic behavior of Mozzarella cheese was studied. Slabs (2 × 10 × 10 cm3) were immersed in 23% w/w NaCl solutions (control samples: 4°C, 90 min; frozen samples: -15°C, 180 min). Half of the frozen samples were immediately thawed at 4°C. The other half was stored at -20°C for 2 mo and then was thawed at 4°C (frozen-stored samples). Samples were stored at 4°C and assayed at 1, 7, 14, 20, 27, 34, and 41 d. Rheological tests were carried out in oscillatory mode (parallel-plate geometry, diameter: 20 mm, gap: 1 mm, frequency: 1 Hz). Strain sweeps were run (0.001 ≤ γ0 ≤ 0.1) at 20, 40, and 60°C, and temperature sweeps were run from 20 to 65°C (1.33°C/min, γ0 = 0.005). Similar crossover temperatures were observed after 20 d of ripening. The influence of temperature on complex viscosity was studied by an Arrhenius-type equation. Activation energy values of 15.9 ± 0.4, 14.1 ± 0.5, and 13.8 ± 0.6 kcal/mol were obtained at 41 d for control, frozen, and frozen-stored samples, respectively. Although the immersion freezing of Mozzarella cheese affects some of the studied parameters, the differences observed between frozen and frozen-stored samples with control samples were small. Therefore, it was considered that the immersion freezing might be useful for the manufacture and commercialization of Mozzarella cheese. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists.","Immersion freezing; Mozzarella cheese; Rheology; Salting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250842544

Lemon juice is a high-quality source of vitamin C or ascorbic acid which may be lost during storage and processes such as pasteurization. In Iran, both pasteurized and un-pasteurized juices have been used with less attention to the storage conditions. Presence of light, time and temperature affect the ascorbic acid retention in citrus juices. Single strength fresh lemon juice was stored at refrigerated condition in dark, as well as room condition with and without presence of normal daylight for a period of 12 weeks. Brix, pH and total acidity of the samples didn't change considerably throughout this investigation. Kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation in the juice during 12 weeks at various storage conditions (light, time and temperature) was investigated. Final vitamin C content of the juice in all samples was reduced to about 36% of initial values over this period. Loss of ascorbic acid for the single strength juice followed the first-order kinetic model. The activation energy for the deteriorative reaction of vitamin C in the lemon juice for these storage conditions was 137.9 cal mol-1. Storage condition predominates as a deteriorative/retention factor at the first storage period, in un-pasteurized samples, but as storage time increases, the importance of storage condition decreases.","Ascorbic acid; Degradation; Kinetics; Lemon juice; Storage condition","Citrus; Citrus limon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250771674

In the blends, the fatty acids, which are dispersed in the solid network of the polymer, act as latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) material during its solid-liquid phase change when the polymer (PVA) has function of supporting material because of its structural strength. Therefore, the shape-stabilized fatty acids can keep the same shape in a solid shape without leakage of liquid fatty acids by aid of PVA in solid state. The maximum mixture ratio for all fatty acids in the shape-stabilized form was found as 50 wt%.

Specific attention is paid to fossil energy technologies, nuclear and renewable energy technologies (RETs), as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy storage systems. Analysing up- and downstream processes and their associated GHG emissions, which arise upstream and downstream of the power plant (i.e., electricity generation stage), is important; otherwise, the GHG emissions resulting from electricity generation of the various fuel options are underestimated. For fossil fuel technology options upstream GHG emission rates can be up to 25% of the direct emissions from the power plant, whereas for most RETs and nuclear power upstream and downstream GHG emissions can account for way over 90% of cumulative emissions. In economies where carbon is being priced or GHG emissions constrained, this may provide an advantage to technologies with trans-boundary upstream emissions over technologies without significant life-cycle emissions arising outside the legislative boundaries of GHG mitigation policies. It is therefore desirable for GHG emissions under national, regional and international mitigation policies to be accounted for over its entire life-cycle. The results presented here indicate that the most significant GHG avoidance (in absolute terms) can be made from technology substitution. The introduction of advanced fossil fuel technologies can also lead to improvements in life-cycle GHG emissions. Overall, hydro, nuclear and wind energy technologies can produce electricity with the least life-cycle global warming impact. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficiency of night cooling ventilation is determined by three main factors: the external airflow rate in the room, the flow pattern and the thermal mass distribution. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of the enclosure shape and the situation of inlet/outlet openings on the total cooling energy stored in the structure. This analysis presents a comprehensive sample of typologies to generate guidelines which can help the designer with the distribution of the thermal mass and inlet/outlet openings in the enclosure. The approach combines a theoretical analysis which characterizes the enclosure charge/discharge time constants and storage efficiencies with simulation studies based on computational fluid dynamics software (CFD).","Computational fluid dynamics software (CFD); Heat transfer coefficients; Night cooling ventilation","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Flow patterns; Flow rate; Heat transfer coefficients; Airflow rate; Night cooling ventilation; Thermal mass distribution; Ventilation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249983891

Amylase was present through the gut; acid protease was detected in stomach; maltase, trypsin and chymotrypsin were found in pyloric caeca and proximal and distal intestine sections. Increase of cornstarch levels from 40 to 50% in the diet resulted in an increase in amylase and maltase. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were unresponsive to starch levels. Acid protease follows the protein/carbohydrate ratio decrease. The increase of dietary cornstarch resulted in liver glycogenesis and the increase in plasma triglycerides is suggestive of lipogenesis.

The methodology developed can be applied for both solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy. Here the focus of the results is on penetration of wind electricity in the electricity system as simulated in a long-term model experiment in which the electricity demand is kept constant over time. All important parameter are included in a sensitivity analysis. With increasing penetration levels the cost reduction of wind electricity caused by upscaling and technological learning is counteracted by the cost increase due to (1) the need for additional back-up capacity, (2) the need to generate wind electricity at less favourable sites, and (3) discarded wind electricity because of supply-demand mismatch. This occurs after about 20% wind electricity production as percentage of current electricity production. At this level about 500 (OECD Europe) and 750 (USA) TWh yr-1 wind electricity is absorbed in the system with the electricity demand of the year 2000. Wind electricity is found to be discarded when the production is about 55 (USA) to 10 times (OECD Europe) the present electricity produced from wind power. Beyond 30% of present electricity production, cost increases most significantly because of discarded wind electricity, excluding storage. In both regions the use of wind electricity would mainly avoid use of natural gas. The CO2 emissions abatement costs range from 14 (OECD Europe) to 33 (USA) $ per ton CO2 differ in both regions due to a faster wind electricity cost increase in OECD Europe. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Si-NCs were formed by low-energy (1 keV) ion-beam-synthesis within a 9 nm thick SiO2 layer. A 2-D layer of Si-NCs with 3 nm mean diameter and 1012 cm-2 surface density was successfully achieved. After fabrication of Al capacitors, samples with and without Si-NCs were 1.5 and 6.5 MeV proton were irradiated at doses ranging from 1 Mrad (SiO2) to 120 Mrad (SiO2). Significant irradiation-dose-dependent shifts are detected in the C-V curves of the NC-MOS cells and programmed cells are found to undergo bit flip. Despite the above, the attainable memory windows after write/erase operations remain unchanged. Retention time characteristics at room temperature for the write and erase states of irradiated and non-irradiated samples reveal that even after an irradiation dose as high as 120 Mrad (SiO2) the devices still exhibit long time charge storage behavior. We observe that the erase state flat-band voltage decay rate does not depend on the irradiation-dose while the opposite happens for the write state flat-band voltage decay rate which is found to be directly dependent on Dit values giving insight to the physics of the discharging mechanisms. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

From the results the fraction of the stored energy of cold work and the free energy change related to the strain-induced γ→α'-martensite transformation were determined. The fraction of stored energy varied around 0.4. With the metastable steel grades the free energy change related to the γ→α'- martensite transformation was found to vary between -98 MJ/m3 and -206 MJ/m3 depending on the austenite stability of the steel. Furthermore, the magnitude of the mechanical driving force was estimated by comparing the results with the free energy change of thermally induced transformation.","Austenitic stainless steel; Free energy change; Stored energy; Strain-induced martensite","Energy storage; Free energy; Martensitic transformations; Plastic deformation; Strain; Energetics; Energy changes; Strain induced martensite; Uniaxial tensile deformation; Austenitic stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047243859

In Hungary, most detached houses are not equipped with mechanical ventilation systems. Because the thermal comfort needs are continuously grown, in more and more houses air conditioning systems are installed. The scope oi our research was to analyse the internal temperature variation in detached houses having different structures of the external walls and then, to see, which is the influence of building structure and glazed area on the energy consumption if air conditioning systems are installed. Based on the Hungarian standard for cooling load calculation a simulation program was developed. Three different structures (SD brick, brick with vertical cavities and a light structure) were compared. The best results in the summer period were given by SD brick which is specific for oldest detached houses. Considering the same comfort level in the summer, the energy class of the light structure house became worse. Measurements on one hand have proven the results obtained by simulations and have shown that with proper design the situation at light structure is not so bad.","Energy consumption; Glazed area; Heat storage; Indoor climate","Air conditioning; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Temperature; Thermal comfort; Ventilation; Building structure; Energy consumption; Energy requirements; External walls; Glazed area; Hungarian standard; Indoor climate; Internal temperature variation; Mechanical ventilation systems; Oldest detached houses.

Our goal is to show that by distributing network intelligence and control functions using the IPR, we will be capable of achieving improved survivability, security, reliability, and reconfigurability. Each IPR has embedded intelligence into it allowing it to switch power lines, shed load, and receive/broadcast local state-variable information to and from other IPRs. The information exchange capability of the routers will provide coordination among themselves to reconfigure the network when subject to a natural or man-made disaster. In this paper, we report our progress on six different activities around the creation of the IPR: IPR architecture; Communication Protocols among IPR; distributed controls; risk assessment of a system operated with and without IPR; power system reconfiguration based on a controlled islanding scheme using IPR; and the definition of the power routing as an ancillary service, since the IPR may provide improved efficiency and security in the context of a realistic market structure, such as Standard Market Design with LMP pricing algorithm. Finally, we present our effort to link this new concept to an education plan that addresses the socio-technical nature of power systems and the education needs of the new workforce.

Four groups of rats received isocaloric diets containing 170 g protein/kg or 60 g protein/kg from pregnancy until the 14th day of lactation: control non-lactating, control lactating (both fed a control diet), low-protein non-lactating and low-protein lactating. Energy intake, body composition, energy balance, serum insulin and leptin concentrations and the relationship between these hormones and several factors related to obesity were analysed. Low-protein-intake lactating rats exhibited hypoinsulinaemia, hyperleptinaemia, hypophagia and decreased energy expenditure compared with control lactating rats. The protein level in the carcasses was lower in the low-protein lactating group than in the control lactating group, resulting in a higher fat content in the first group compared with the latter. Body fat correlated inversely with serum insulin and positively with serum leptin level. There was a significant negative correlation between serum leptin and energy intake, and a positive relationship between energy intake and serum insulin level in lactating rats and in the combined data from both groups. Energy expenditure was correlated positively with serum insulin and negatively with serum leptin in lactating rats and when data from control non-lactating and lactating rats were pooled. Lactating rats submitted to protein restriction, compared with lactating control rats, showed that maternal reserves were preserved owing to less severe negative energy balance.

In order to use fuel gas in an economically viable way, optimization of gas distribution for covering consumption must be introduced. In this paper, a mathematical model of the electric utility system which is used for optimization of gas distribution over electric generators is presented. The utility system comprises installed capacity of 1500 MW of thermal power plants, 400 MW of combined heat and power plants, 330 MW of a nuclear power plant and 1600 MW of hydro power plants. Based on known demand curve the optimization model selects plants according to the prescribed criteria. Firstly it engages run-of-river hydro plants, then the public cogeneration plants, the nuclear plant and thermal power plants. Storage hydro plants are used for covering peak load consumption. In case of shortage of installed capacity, the cross-border purchase is allowed. Usage of dual fuel equipment (gas-oil), which is available in some thermal plants, is also controlled by the optimization procedure. It is shown that by using such a model it is possible to properly plan the amount of fuel gas which will be contracted. The contracted amount can easily be distributed over generators efficiently and without losses (no breaks in delivery). The model helps in optimizing of fuel gas-oil ratio for plants with combined burners and enables planning of power plants overhauls over a year in a viable and efficient way. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The first model (EnergyPLAN) has been designed for national and regional analyses. It has been used in the design of strategies for integration of wind power and other fluctuating renewable energy sources into the future energy supply. The model has been used for investigating new operation strategies and investments in flexibility in order to utilize wind power and avoid excess production. The other model (H2RES) has been designed for simulating the integration of renewable sources and hydrogen into island energy systems. The H2RES model can use wind, solar and hydro as renewable energy sources and diesel blocks as backup. The latest version of the H2RES model has an integrated grid connection with the mainland. The H2RES model was tested on the power system of Porto Santo Island, Madeira, Portugal, Corvo and Graciosa Islands, Azores Islands, Portugal and Sal Island, Cape Verde.

Structurally complex inorganic materials for the successful fabrication of alkaline and lithium-based microbatteries, micro-ultracapacitors, and dye-sensitized micro solar cells are shown on various low-processing-temperature and flexible substrates using LDW+. In particular, the ability to deposit thick layers while maintaining pattern integrity allows devices produced in this manner to exhibit higher energy densities per unit area than can be achieved by traditional thin-film techniques. We then focus on more complex systems of living and biologically active materials. Patterns of biomaterials such as proteins, DNA, and even living cells can be printed using LDW+ with high spatial and volumetric resolution on the order of a picoliter or less, without compromising the viability of these delicate structures. These results provide for highly selective sensor arrays or cell seeding for tissue engineering.

Copper wires of 0.8-6 mil diameter have been successfully bonded to different bond pad metallized and plated substrate materials such as Al, Cu, Ag, Au and Pd. The three metallurgical related factors; solid-solubility and diffusion of dissimilar contact metals, oxide film breakage and plastic deformation of asperities play a critical role in the bonding. Plastic deformation of an asperity is the most significant factor one has to consider to attain good bonding. Soft aluminum metal (30-40 VHN), with a lower % asperity threshold deformation is easier to wire bond than harder metallic surfaces (Ni, W, Mo, Cr, Co, Ta) of 150-500 VHN. Good adhesion of wire bonding is achieved for the surface roughness (Ra) of 0.01-0.15 μm and 0.02-0.6 μm of bare and plated surfaces respectively. It is rationalized that the application of ultrasonic energy principally breaks the oxide film and deform the asperities, while a compressive force increases the proximity of asperities. Hence wire welds to bond pad surface by molecular attraction and inter diffusion. Storage of copper ball bonds at 175 °C for 100-1,000 h forms copper aluminide at the interface. EDAX and Auger analysis reveal 22 at% Al + 78 at% Cu composition of the aluminides and Cu3Al2 empirical formula is calculated, which, does not match with any of the reported copper aluminides. Hardness of the copper ball bonds and stitch bonds are higher than wire exhibiting work hardening of the bonds on processing. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.",,"Diffusion; Electronics packaging; Interconnection networks; Microelectronics; Plastic deformation; Thin films; Electrical interconnections; Oxide films; Solid solubility; Thermosonic copper wire bonding; Copper metallurgy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846786811

To analyse the benefits of distributed generation, the whole electrical generation system of Europe has been modelled including varying penetrations of wind power. The model is chronologically simulating the scheduling of the European power plants to cover the demand at every hour of the year. The wind power generation was modelled using wind speed measurements from 60 meteorological stations for 1 year. The distributed wind power also displaces fossil-fuelled capacity. However, every assessment of the displaced capacity (or a capacity credit) by means of a chronological model is highly sensitive to single events. Therefore the wind time series was shifted by integer days against the load time series, and the different results were aggregated. The same set of results is shown for two other options, one where the pump storage plants are used more aggressively and the other where all German nuclear plants are shut off. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data have been used to recreate the same averaged time series from a data set spanning 34 years. Through this it is possible to set the year studied in detail into a longer-term context. The results are that wind energy can contribute more than 20% of the European demand without significant changes in the system and can replace conventional capacity worth about 10% of the installed wind power capacity. The long-term reference shows that the analysed year is the worst case for wind power integration.

This method integrates the point-source/point receiver scheme with the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) process to achieve the effect like scanning with a phase array system. This method also is equipped with large functioning depth because of the high-energy feature that elastic waves usually possess over traditional ultrasound. Both numerical simulations and experimental tests were carried out to explore the capabilities of this method in revealing single or multiple defects implied in a matrix material. The results from numerical simulations indicate that this method can clearly reveal the number of the voids or defects, their locations, and front-end profiles. The influence of the accuracy of the wave velocity determination on the resultant image also was evaluated in this study.

Solar-powered cooling is one of the environmentally-friendly techniques which may help alleviate the problem. A promising solar cooling method is through the use of a liquid desiccant system, where humidity is absorbed directly from the process air by direct contact with the desiccant. The desiccant is then regenerated, again in direct contact with an external air stream, by solar heat at relatively low temperatures. The liquid desiccant system has many potential advantages over other solar air conditioning systems and can provide a promising alternative to absorption or to solid desiccant systems. Earlier work by the authors included theoretical simulations and preliminary experiments on the key components of the liquid desiccant system. The objective of the present study has been to construct a prototype system based on the knowledge gained, to monitor its performance, identify problems and carry out preliminary design optimization. A 16 kWt system was installed at the Energy Engineering Center at the Technion, in the Mediterranean city of Haifa. The system comprises a dehumidifier and a regenerator with their associated components operating together to dehumidify the fresh (ambient) air supply to a group of offices on the top floor of the building. LiCl-water is employed as the working fluid. The system is coupled to a solar collector field and employs two methods of storage - hot water and desiccant solution in the regenerated state. The performance of the system was monitored for five summer months under varying operating conditions.

In this study a process is described in which boron is used as a means to store and transport solar energy from a production site to motor vehicles, where it is used to generate hydrogen and heat. The proposed multi-step fuel cycle includes no carbon as a reducing agent and, therefore, no release of CO2 to the atmosphere. This process is safe, mostly involving harmless materials and well-understood technologies. It eliminates the distribution, storage, and pumping of hydrogen at the refueling station, and diminishes the amount of hydrogen stored on the vehicle to a minimum. It is shown that the boron reaction with water, performed on-board of a vehicle, has high hydrogen storage capacity based on both volume and mass, compared with other candidate technologies. An energy balance of the entire process predicts that the overall efficiency of converting solar energy to work by the vehicle engine can be about 11%. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we formulate the index and data allocation problem and propose a solution that can adapt to any number of broadcast channels. We first restrict the considered problem to a scenario with no index/data replication, and introduce an optimal solution and a heuristic solution to the single-channel and multichannel cases, respectively. Then, we discuss how to replicate indexes on the allocation to further improve the performance.

This helium is appropriately replenished to the power cycle as the energy demand increases. Helium mass transfer between the power cycle and the storage facility, henceforth known as the inventory control system (ICS), is carried out by way of the pressure differential that exists between these two systems. In presenting the ICS concept, emphasis is placed on storage effectiveness; hence the discussion in this paper is centred on those features which accentuate storage effectiveness, namely:•Storage vessel multiplicity;•Unique initial pressures for each vessel arranged in a cascaded manner; and•A heat sink placed in each vessel to provide thermal inertia. Having presented the concept, the objective is to qualitatively justify the presence of each of the above-mentioned features using thermodynamics as a basis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Slags from iron and steel works are potential raw materials for carbonation due to their high contents of calcium silicates. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is used as filler and coating materials in paper. If slag could be used instead of limestone for producing PCC, considerable energy savings and carbon dioxide emissions reductions could be achieved. In this paper, the leaching of calcium from iron and steel slags using acetic acid was investigated. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations at atmospheric gas pressures showed that extraction of calcium is exothermic and feasible at temperatures lower than 156 °C, while the precipitation of calcium carbonate is endothermic and feasible at temperatures above 45 °C. The formation of calcium- and magnesium acetate in the solution was found to be thermodynamically possible. Laboratory-scale batch experiments showed that iron and steel slags rapidly dissolve in acetic acid in a few minutes and the exothermic nature of the reaction was verified. While silicon was successfully removed by filtration using solution temperatures of 70-80 °C, further separation methods are required for removing iron, aluminum and magnesium from the solution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that the shelf-life of tempe starters was not limited by the death of spores, but by sublethal damage to spores as well as by dormancy which can be overcome by resuscitation, respiratory activation. During storage, the number of dormant and sublethally damaged spores increased: the longer the starter cultures were stored, the less dormant spores could still be activated. In contrast, the transition from sublethally damaged (spores that are not able to transform cFDA and emit green fluorescence except by activation treatment) to activated spores did not decrease with longer storage. However, after very long (30 months) storage, sublethally damaged spores could still be activated but could not germinate anymore.

This program couples a molecular dynamics code to a Graphical User Interface and runs on a UNIX-X11 Window System platform with the MOTIF library, which is contained in many standard Linux releases. ALINE is written in C, thus giving the user the possibility to modify the source code, and, at the same time, provides an effective and user-friendly framework for numerical experiments, in which the main parameters can be interactively varied and the system visualized in various ways. We illustrate the main features of the program through some examples of detection and dynamical tracking of point-defects, linear defects, and planar defects, such as stacking faults in lattice-mismatched heterostructures.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:449 559. Distribution format:tar.gz. Nature of physical problem:Some phenomena involving defects take place inside three-dimensional crystals at times which can be hardly predicted. For this reason they are difficult to detect and track even within numerical experiments, especially when one is interested in studying their dynamical properties and time evolution. Furthermore, traditional simulation methods require the storage of a huge amount of data which in turn may imply a long work for their analysis. Method of solution:Simplifications of the simulation work described above strongly depend also on the computer performance. It has now become possible to realize some of such simplifications thanks to the real possibility of using interactive programs. The solution proposed here is based on the development of an interactive graphical simulation program both for avoiding large storage of data and the subsequent elaboration and analysis as well as for visualizing and tracking many phenomena inside three-dimensional samples. However, the full computational power of traditional simulation programs may not be available in general in programs with graphical user interfaces, due to their interactive nature. Nevertheless interactive programs can still be very useful for detecting processes difficult to visualize, restricting the range or making a fine tuning of the parameters, and tailoring the faster programs toward precise targets. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem:The restrictions on the applicability of the program are related to the computer resources available. The graphical interface and interactivity demand computational resources that depend on the particular numerical simulation to be performed. To preserve a balance between speed and resources, the choice of the number of atoms to be simulated is critical. With an average current computer, simulations of systems with more than 105 atoms may not be easily feasible on an interactive scheme. Another restriction is related to the fact that the program was originally designed to simulate systems in the solid phase, so that problems in the simulation may occur if some particular physical quantities are computed beyond the melting point. Typical running time:It depends on the machine architecture, system size, and user needs. Unusual features of the program:In the program, besides the window in which the system is represented in real space, an additional graphical window presenting the real time distribution histogram for different physical variables (such as kinetic or potential energy) is included. Such tool is very interesting for making demonstrative numerical experiments for teaching purposes as well as for research, e.g., for detecting and tracking crystal defects. The program includes: an initial condition builder, an interactive display of the simulation, a set of tools which allow the user to filter through different physical quantities the information-either displayed in real time or printed in the output files-and to perform an efficient search of the interesting regions of parameter space. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Superconducting devices are also proposed for DG because of their high efficiencies as well as smaller size and more stable operation during peak loads. This study concentrates on the environmental benefits of superconducting machinery by comparing suitable devices with their competitors in DG-networks. Exploitable superconducting devices in DG include superconducting magnetic energy-storage (SMES), flywheels and cable systems. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool in comparisons of energy-storage devices suitable for DG: SMESs, flywheels and batteries.

Renewable Energy 2005;30(10):1471-1487] proposed a wind turbine(WT)-fuel-cell hybrid as a means to store wind energy and increase penetration in these islands. The effect of network restraints was, however, not included in that study. Simulation results including network restrictions prove that when network restrictions are relatively ""strict"", hybridizing a WT using the scheme presented in the same paper will indeed increase the WT's energy output. However, in the case of ""lenient"" network restrictions, that hybridization scheme will in fact decrease the WT's energy output. Moreover, the system configurations presented that paper could not achieve financial viability at current electricity prices due to high capital costs. Two alternative operating principles for the hybrid system are presented in this study. These operating principles significantly improve the hybrid system's energy performance even under ""lenient"" network restrictions. In some cases, these operating principles manage to yield hybrid systems that are financially viable assuming current electricity prices. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper has addressed voltage support in distribution systems by energy injection from a battery storage distributed energy system. An operation strategy for an inverter interface battery energy storage DER has been developed for maximum improvement in feeder voltage with minimum energy injection from the DER. A control strategy has been proposed for inverter based battery storage DER to regulate network voltage effectively, through operating the DER to generate real (P) and reactive (Q) power with Q priority. The implementation of the inverter interface DER with battery energy storage will save fuel cost of DER but be of much higher capital cost than using a rotary generator. The proposed technique has been evaluated by simulation on a three-phase distribution system with time varying loads. Test results indicate that DER operating with Q priority offers the best solution for maximum voltage improvement. The results also confirm that DER injecting P and Q at the ratio of maximum voltage sensitivity of line presents better solution for power loss reduction than the solution offered by the DER operating with Q priority. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For blanched samples, the activation energies of colour loss determined on the basis of a and b values were 15.7 ± 2.81 kcal mol-1 and 21.7 ± 4.13 kcal mol-1, while those for unblanched samples determined as 10.5 ± 0.62 kcal mol-1 and 14.7 ± 1.30 kcal mol-1, respectively. Nonenzymatic browning of dehydrated carrots was also investigated and this reaction fitted to zero-order kinetic model. Activation energies of nonenzymatic browning occurred in blanched (25.3 ± 2.30 kcal mol-1) and unblanched (25.9 ± 2.61 kcal mol-1) dehydrated carrots was found similar. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
