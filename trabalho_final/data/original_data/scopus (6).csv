The detector has an S20 photocathode, a low resistivity Z-plate electron multiplier and a 10 × 10 square array anode configuration. The Z-plate has a diameter of 25 mm, a resistance of 8.8 MΩ (at 20 °C) and is made of MCPs rated for operation at a DC strip current density in excess of 100 µA/cm2. Once inside the vacuum tube the Z-plate must be operated with pulsed high voltage, to avoid overheating. For this reason this PMT is suitable for the detection of fast bursts of light pulses, occurring at a repetition rate sufficiently low to permit the heat dissipation between successive bursts. The thermal behaviour of the detector has been investigated. First the thermal coefficient of the resistance was measured giving a value of -6.00 ± 0.04 × 104 Ω/°C (around 20 °C); then the temperature increase of the Z-plate due to a single high voltage square pulse was measured as a function of the pulse energy. The heat capacity and the thermal time constant were found to be 0. 93 J/°C and 175 s respectively. The PMT electrical behaviour has also been studied in pulse current mode. At 900 V/plate and with 25 ns FWHM input light pulses, the maximum output charge density was found to be 8.2 × 10-10 C/cm2 in linear regime and 4.9 × 10-9 C/cm2in saturated gain mode. The Z-plate recovers from the maximum linear pulse in about 50 µs. © 1989 SPIE.",,"Electron multipliers; HVDC power transmission; Laser diagnostics; Light transmission; Photomultipliers; Plasma diagnostics; Pulse repetition rate; Specific heat; Micro channel plate; Orders of magnitude; Pulsed high voltage; Short recovery time; Temperature increase; Thermal behaviours; Thermal coefficients; Thermal time constants; Image storage tubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041706686

Cells were harvested in the stationary phase and cell density and biochemical composition determined. Biomass production at the end of the stationary phase, expressed as cell density, was affected by the concentration of ammonium-N in the medium but not by the ammonium compound used. Optimal growth conditions for obtaining maximum cell density, between 1.86×106 and 2.81×106 cells/ml, were 2, 4 and 8 mg.atom N/l. The compound and concentration of ammonium-N had little effect on the growth velocity of D. tertiolecta cultures in the logarithmic phase, with values of 0.35±0.06 doublings/day under all the conditions assayed. The ammonium compound and the concentration of nitrogen affected the concentration of different cellular constituents such as protein, carbohydrate, lipid and chlorophyll a, although these changes were not necessarily related to cell density in the culture. Protein, the most affected fraction, tended to increase with an increase in the nitrogen concentration for all the ammonium compounds used. Maximum protein/ml was obtained with ammonium carbonate at all the nitrogen concentrations used. Maximum protein/cell occurred at the higher nitrogen concentrations (16 and 32 mg/atom N/l) for all the ammonium compounds. Considering the optimum growth interval (2-8 mg.atom N/l), maximum protein/cell concentrations were also obtained in the cultures with ammonium carbonate. Carbohydrate and lipid concentrations varied less than protein concentration. Maximum values of carbohydrate/ml were also found in the ammonium carbonate cultures. Maximum lipid/cell concentrations occurred at the lowest nitrogen concentrations, in contrast to protein values. As a percentage of the total organic matter, protein increased and lipid decreased with the nitrogen concentration, whereas carbohydrate remained constant. Consequently, lipid seemed to be the storage product in this marine microalga. Gross energy values in the different cultures were a function of nitrogen concentration, maximum differences occurring in the ammonium carbonate cultures. The biochemical variability of this microalga must have a marked effect on its value as a source of single-cell protein, as chemicals or as feed in mariculture. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249025762

The azimuthally symmetric superconducting storage ring Siberia-AS at an energy of 600 MeV is a superconducting analog of VEP-1, one of the earliest storage rings in the world intended for the purposes of high-energy physics. Unlike the conventional design, no iron yoke is used in the storage ring under consideration to form the magnetic field at the equilibrium orbit and to close the return magnetic flux - this is performed by some inner and outer superconducting windings. Such a scheme enables the size of the storage ring to be substantially reduced (a cylinder of 2 m in diameter and 2 m long), and as a result, its weight decreases, too (about 10 tons). The eight-magnet storage ring Siberia-SM is of four-order symmetry so that the periodicity element comprises two rectangular magnets and three lenses. Its basic component is a superconducting bending rectangular magnet at a 6-T magnetic field. Two variants of such magnets have been proposed: in the first, the iron yoke is utilized to form the magnetic field and to close the return flux, while the second is an ironless C-shaped magnet manufactured on the basis of original wedgelike coils.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549096848

Compared to ordinary insertion devices, whose period λu is typically ≥1 cm, micropole devices have periods smaller by a factor f≤10. Therefore, the first-harmonic radiation emitted by a micropole undulator will have its photon energy Eγ increased by f and its spectral purity Δλ/λ by f, provided the total length of the undulator lu stays unchanged, and magnetic field errors, as well as the electron-beam emittance, are sufficiently small. Furthermore, to generate photons of the same Eγ as from the conventional device, the electron-beam energy Ee can be reduced by f 1/2, resulting in significantly lower construction and operating costs. Radiative energy losses can be correspondingly diminished for the associated storage rings.

In particular, when the generation of soft x rays on a storage ring such as the Stanford Positron Electron Project (PEP) is considered, its straight sections, which exceed 100 m, may be shown to be naturally amenable to low-to-medium K undulators with a large number of relatively long periods. This in turn allows for the establishment of relatively weak on-axis fields in such devices. In this paper it is shown that these conditions permit the use of electrostatic fields, as well as the concomitant development of fixed-gap, variable-period undulators. Such devices are shown to be superior in many respects to the variable-gap magnetostatic undulators currently in vogue. Two novel variable-period undulator designs, one for a transverse electrostatic undulator and the other for a helical device (HEU) are described.

The origins of these levels are probably loosely associated iron-related complexes such as iron-acceptor pairs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343686651

Alternatively, this gain factor can be used instead to reduce the sample volume for a fixed exposure time. In the latter case especially, there is a critical need to control parasitic scatter in the Laue camera. The use of Laue geometry as a means of quantitative data acquisition required the solution of some fundamental problems. The so-called ""overlapping orders problem"" has been found not to be limiting. It can be shown that the bulk of the Laue spots are single order, provided dhkl&lt;2dmin where dhkl is the interplanar spacing and dmin is the resolution limit of the data. In addition, empirical wavelength normalization is required. This can be achieved by using the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The fact that different equivalents occur at different wavelengths means that the differences in these intensities can be used to establish the ""λ curve."" Successful wavelength normalization to date has used a relatively broad-band pass. The multiplicity distribution is the histogram of the number of spots of a given order. This distribution is determined by the ratio λmax/ λmin (λmax =maximum wavelength, λmin =minimum wavelength in the beam). λmax is determined by the use of any filters in the beamline. λmin is determined either by the spectral curve or a critical cutoff if a mirror is used. A mirror can be usefully introduced to enhance the multiplicity distribution in favor of single wavelength spots or to focus the white beam; so far only vertical focussing has been used. The detector options used to date have been photographic film, Fuji image plate (at Photon Factory)/Kodak storage phosphor (at Cornell) and charge coupled device (CCD) (at Daresbury). It is useful to consider the joint theoretical spatial and energy distribution of spots in defining the detector specification and geometry. To date, we have processed Laue film data successfully. The attraction of using the CCD, even to look at a small portion of the Laue pattern, is to view the diffraction in real time. This will allow tight control of parasitic scatter for microcrystal Laue diffraction and real-time monitoring for time-resolved work. We performed initial experiments using a direct detection CCD imager, and have obtained satisfactory diffraction data on a 40 ms time scale. Results of this work will be presented. In order to assess the efficacy of the Laue method for quantitative crystallography, we have used Laue data from the protein pea lectin and compared it in detail with monochromatic pea lectin data. To assess the use of a vertically focussing mirror, we have successfully used a mercury derivative protein crystal to yield isomorphous and anomalous differences suitable for phase determination. In both the pea lectin and mercury derivative cases, doublet Laue spots were deconvoluted. In the latter case, the data were used in a difference Fourier calculation which showed the mercury peak.

The former system consists of 16 independent feedback loops; each of them corrects the energy deviation of one of 16 bunches. Although the system can suppress the instability, critical adjustment is required, i.e., the feedback loops have to be finely adjusting according to parameters such as the electron energy, the beam current, and the RF acceleration voltage. The latter system spreads synchrotron frequencies of individual bunches by the modulation of the effective acceleration voltage to decouple these synchrotron oscillations. The instability is damped by this method when the beam current is not high (less than 100 mA). The limitation of this method is in the maximum modulation index available in the experiment.

Rehabilitation of Shoshone Powerplant involves replacing Unit 3 with a new 3 MW vertical francis-type generating unit. The new powerplant will house three 6 MW vertical francis-type generating units.",,"Dams--Modification; Hydraulic Turbines--Francis; Irrigation--Water Supply; Power Plants--Wyoming; Buffalo Bill Dam; Bureau of Reclamation; Shoshone Powerplant; Hydroelectric Power Plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024940437

The magnetically suspended flywheel energy storage system, currently under development at the University of Maryland, consisting of a family of interference assembled rings, is presented as an integrated solution for energy storage. There are no spokes or shaft attachments to the system; the rotor is magnetically suspended using two pancake magnetic bearings. The pancake magnetic bearings use a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets, thereby providing for a net control force on the flywheel which is a linear function of the electromagnet coil current. In addition, the permanent magnets carry a major portion of the axial loading, and because of the permanent magnets the power consumption of the magnetic bearing is exceptionally low.",,"Bearings--Magnetic; Electric Energy Storage; Electromagnets; Magnets; Electromagnet Coil Current; Interference Assembled Rings; Pancake Magnetic Bearings; Permanent Magnets; Rotating Flywheels; Stack Energy Storage System; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024931080

In December 1987, an experimental plant for proof tests was constructed in Hokkaido. Around the storage facility, heat pipes were installed into the ground at the intervals of 0.5 meter and the condensing sections were installed in atmosphere. In winter of the year, frozen soil was smoothly formed. At the end of January, 2 m thick frozen soil layer was completed. Even in July, the soil temperature was kept about -1°C and the storeroom temperature was also kept about 3 to 4°C.

Initial tests indicate that mission duration capabilities will be doubled, and mission turn-around times decreased. The fuel cell stack, reactant storage, support systems, and microprocessor controls have been designed to occupy the same volume as the existing battery system, and to meet existing weight and thermal specifications. Thus, mechanical and electrical modifications to the vehicle are minimal. For relatively short mission durations or small vehicles, the PEM fuel cell can exceed the performance of most battery systems. For long duration missions or larger vehicles, the energy density of a fuel cell (ampere-hours per unit mass, and per unit volume) significantly outperforms battery systems. As the energy capacity (ampere-hours) is increased, the size of the fuel cell stack will remain constant; only the volume of fuel increases. Thus, the energy density per available volume of the fuel cell system improves as the system is scaled up. It is concluded that when cost/availability, load cycle degradation, shelf life, and ease/speed of refueling are considered, the PEM fuel cell is the preferred power source for underwater vehicles.",,"Fuel Cells - Evaluation; Ocean Engineering; Deep-Ocean Observation Vehicle; Load Cycle Degradation; Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Technology; Silver-Zinc Batteries; Submersibles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024920217

The major area of technical uncertainty is associated with shell stresses during heating, when the melting (and expanding) LiH at the shell surface is trapped between the encapsulating shell and the solid LiH core. A series of feasibility tests demonstrated that the LiH cracks during cooldown and that the LiH uses these paths to communicate with the central void during charging. The feasibility of the concept was proved conclusively in a reliability demonstration test series, when the 50-mm-diameter encapsulated LiH test article completed 50 thermal cycles (twice the application lifetime).

Consequently the SST has an extremely high switch gain.",,"Cryogenics; Electron Tubes, Thyratron; Semiconducting Gallium Arsenide; Semiconductor Devices--Switching; Superconducting Materials--Energy Storage; Semiconductor-Switched Thyratron; Superconducting Inductive Energy Storage Systems; Thyratron Inverter; Electric Inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024911548

The aim was to obtain some hints on the lifetime of heavy ion beams in a good cooling ring vacuum and to test cooling and stacking of ions. Stochastic cooling was used to compensate the beam decay due to multiple scattering on the residual gas, which is the most important effect on lifetime. An equilibrium momentum spread of less than 5 × 10-4 was measured, thus proving the efficiency of stochastic cooling for multiply charged ions. With the vacuum conditions of LEAR (2.6 × 10-12 torr gauge reading with a residual gas of 90% H2), measured beam lifetimes are 25 min for O6+ at 7.2 MeV/u and 600 min for O8+ at 11.5 MeV/u.

Hercules Incorporated manufactures and uses NG mostly in rocket propellants and gunpowder. One of the earliest tests for stability was the potassium iodide-starch paper (or 'KI') test. Although the method detects decomposition, it has been criticized as invalid. Besides its questionable value, there are other reasons to eliminate the KI test. Reduction of storage time of batches of NG and reduction in sample handling both are desirable safety practices. What was needed was other evidence of process stability to substitute for the KI test. Statistical Process Control (SPC) can be useful in this case. SPC also promotes continuous improvement, which is a high priority in NG production. The production process was examined for possible SPC applications. An SPC plan might be acceptable as a substitute for the KI test, to verify that the process has not changed over time.

An efficient way to integrate ice storage into HVAC functions is to ice-chill and distribute supercold air (40°F; 4.4°C). It is demonstrated that the supercold air/water systems reduce the size of the primary air distribution system (air handler, ductwork) by 60-80% (and the cost by 40-50%) compared with a conventional all-air VAV system. This first cost savings offsets the cost of ice thermal storage equipment for medium-to-large commercial buildings. The ice plant, in turn, can reduce the annual energy operating cost for cooling by 30-50% in many regions (where the electric demand charge is high) by producing ice at night for day cooling. The author has developed and applied several supercold air/water systems integrated with ice storage and sprinkler piping. Systems include all-electric or partial-gas options.

It is concluded that the three main candidates, the closed-cycle diesel, the Stirling, and the fuel cell, are viable systems and that all three could find potential uses in the underwater environment. It is found that the Stirling can achieve an overall system energy density of between 150 and 170 kWh/m3 when installed in medium-sized vessels. The closed cycle diesel using chemical scrubbers cannot achieve these densities, but, using the water management system of scrubbing, it appears that energy densities approaching 200 kWh/m3 are possible. Equivalent data for fuel cells are not available as far as it is known, but if gaseous hydrogen is used as a fuel, then the above energy densities cannot as yet be achieved because of the hydrogen storage problem.

The current configuration uses a silver-zinc secondary battery to demonstrate the propulsion, structures, electronics, and mission systems of the UUV. An eightfold improvement in energy capacity can be realized, within the same volume, through various fuel cell and metal anode semicell options. A systems-level analysis has been conducted to determine the overall energy capacity enhancement, vehicle performance, safety, cost/availability, and logistic considerations of these alternative electrochemical sources. The lithium/seawater semicell is closely competitive in size with the hydrocarbon fuel cells, but it has a much greater logistic burden in terms of fuel cost and refueling difficulty due to the solid lithium. The APEM (advanced proton exchange membrane) cell is found to be the most suitable for a compact, mobile application like the UUV. The cell can be made to run with very few moving parts, offering quiet, reliable operation. Wide utility with logistically available liquid hydrocarbon fuels depends greatly on the development of a compact reformer and waste disposal mechanisms. Liquid oxygen (LOX) is found to be the most volumetrically efficient means of oxidant storage for mission durations of at least six months. The combination of a chemical hydride and LOX can offer as much as eightfold to ninefold improvement in UUV mission time over the baseline silver-zinc system, but the combination of hydrocarbon fuel and LOX is found to be the best overall performer in terms of enhancement of mission capability and minimization of logistic burden.",,"Electric Batteries - Evaluation; Fuel Cells - Evaluation; Ocean Engineering; Submarines - Power Supply; Advanced Proton Exchange Membrane (APEM); Electrochemical Power Sources; Silver-Zinc Secondary Battery; Underwater Power Systems; Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV); Submersibles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024897218

Therefore, even for a machine without imperfections, the orbits of electrons and positrons are different: the maximum orbit separation scales with the cube of the particle energy and is inversely proportional to the number of RF stations. Some tracing results are presented showing the consequent reduction of dynamic aperture in the case of LEP (Large Electron Positron collider) for different combinations of particle energy and numbers of RF stations. The conclusion is that, with four RF stations symmetrically installed around the ring, there is no appreciable reduction of dynamic aperture and, therefore, no deterioration of the machine performance up to a particle energy of 100 GeV. With only two RF stations, however, the aperture of the standard LEP lattice with 90° phase advance per cell is reduced by nearly 50% above 70 GeV. The strong dependence of this reduction of dynamic aperture on the choice of machine tunes is analyzed, and the example of a modified 90° lattice whose aperture is reduced only by 20% at 100 GeV with two RF-stations is discussed.",,"Electron Beams; Synchrotron Radiation; LEP (Large Electron Positron Collider); RF Stations; Accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024891940

The TSR is a low-energy cooler storage ring for heavy ions with energies up to 30 MeV/amu at a charge-to-mass ratio q/A = 0.5. Phase space cooling for coasting beams as well as for bunched beams is routinely done by electron cooling. As the ring is fed by a tandem linac combination, stored intensities of up to 1 × 1010 particles are obtained by combined stacking into transversal and longitudinal phase space (multiturn injection and RF stacking). This stacking method gives 800 times the number of stored ions compared to single-turn injection. Cooling oxygen and carbon beams resulted in a typical emittance of 0.3 π mm-mrad and a momentum spread of Δp/p = 10-4. The equilibrium was mainly determined by intrabeam scattering, and the heating in the residual gas was mainly determined by multiple scattering. An overall increase of phase space density by 6 orders of magnitude was observed, similar to cooling results at proton machines.

XPS valence band spectra of ultrahigh vacuum deposited rare earth - Fe50Co50 alloys are correlated to magneto-optic and reflectivity spectra measured ex-situ in the photon energy range 0.5 ≦Eph ≦ 5.5 eV. It is found that 4 fn →4 fn-15 d1 optical transitions contribute to room temperature Kerr spectra in Pr-FeCo and Nd-FeCo, but only in the UV spectral region (λ≦300 nm). Eu is found to enter Eu-FeCo intermetallic alloys with a 4 f7 ground state at -2 eV binding energy. However, no substantial contribution to the Kerr effect from excitations of this electronic state has been observed n either at room temperature n or at 100 K. We present a general argument that 4 f excitations of RE ions in typical intermetallic alloys can never be expected to contribute more than some tenths of a degree to θk in contrast to the well known huge rotations in RE-chalcogenides. For Yb-FeCo we have observed in XPS a mixed valence behavior of Yb showing a discontinuous transition from divalent Yb2+ in the pure metal to mixed valent Yb2.55+ in amorphous Yb-FeCo films. No f→d contributions to the room temperature MO spectra have been detected. Strong optical enhancement effects are presented for metallic bilayer and multilayer structures of the type MO-layer/reflector. The total thickness of an optimized structure corresponds to about two times the penetration depth of light. Enhancement occurs predominantly at photon energies below the plasma frequency of the reflector material and is caused by low values of the optical constants n and k of the reflector. In storage materials like Tb-FeCo the read-out performance can be improved by about a factor of 2 with a bilayer of 30 nm Tb-FeCo on Cu.

Various approaches and their drawbacks are discussed. These include use of a homopolar DC/AC inverter and use of conventional storage batteries.

The tests demonstrate that the heat-pipe-thermal storage element is not limited under conditions corresponding to emergence from eclipse during normal orbital operations and that the heat pipe will start from the frozen condition with the full input power at the outset.",,"Solar Energy--Storage; Spacecraft--Power Supply; Rankine Cycle; Solar Receiver; Space Power; Test Procedures; Thermal Storage; Transient Performance; Heat Pipes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024880289

After measuring salt transport in the pond, which initially averaged approximately 60 kg per square meter per year, it was evident that the original evaporation pond system was undersized.

After verification, the GTPROFILE simulation has been used to investigate the effects on pnod performance that result when gradient (nonconvective zone) thickness is increased at the expense of storage zone (lower convective zone) thickness in an operational salt gradient solar pond of fixed depth. In the study, the upper convective zone of the pond is held fixed at 0.50 meters (approximately the average annual upper convective zone depth experienced at the El Paso solar pond), while the thickness of the gradient and storage zone are varied such that the total depth of the two layers remains constant at 2.55 meters. The study investigated monthly and annual performance for a 55 to 65 degree C temperature difference between the storage zone and upper convective zone and showed significant increases in energy delivery, especially in the winter months, as gradient thickness increased.",,"Computer Simulation; Mathematical Techniques--Finite Element Method; Computer Applications; Gradient Zones; Salt Gradient Solar Ponds; Software Package GTPROFILE; Software Package SOLPOND; Solar Radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024866958

High heat-of-fusion salts are particularly suited to fulfill this function. A characteristic of salts that must be accommodated in such usage is the density change accompanying phase change. This density difference results in void formation in a closed container during the shade part of the orbit. A void immediately adjacent to a high heat flux area of the container as the spacecraft emerges into the sun, can cause burn-out. In the other extreme, where such an area is filled with solid salt, the melting salt seeking to expand can deform the container. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been contracted to NASA-Lewis to analyze three-dimensionally, the process of heat transfer, energy storage, fluid movement and void location under microgravity conditions. The results will form the basis for comparison with the test results to be obtained from a Lewis In-Reach flight program.

There are two aspects to the development: first, the new Cortes II power plant which, with an output of 323GWh annually, will have twice the capacity of the old 1920s plant which it is now replacing; and secondly, the new pumped storage scheme of La Muela, which is currently just being completed. Both projects depend on the lake created by the new arch-gravity concrete dam. Both elements are connected hydraulically through the reservoir, and electrically through the 400KV switchyard.

One major problem with almost all human studies is that other micro- and macronutrient deficiencies are inadequately controlled for and thus it is often unclear as to whether reported abnormalities of immune function can be attributed specifically to iron deficiency. Even when anbnormalities of immune function have been detected it is often uncertain as to the biological and clinical relevance that these may have for the host. Within these restraints the available studies suggest that iron deficiency may at least contribute to impaired T lymphocyte function as judged by DTH responses in skin and impaired mitogen-induced proliferation. As in protein energy malnutrition, humoral immunity is largely spared in humans, the balance of evidence suggesting that immunoglobulin production and function is normal, as are serum concentrations of complement. The only other abnormality of non-specific immunity which has been reported consistently to be abnormal is that of reduced bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The clinical relevance of these abnormalities remains to be established. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that individuals with iron deficiency suffer the devastating infective complications of well defined immunodeficiency syndromes either congenital or acquired. It seems likely therefore that despite the fundamental importance of iron in maintaining the integrity of immune function, humans can tolerate the extremes of deficiency and excess and survive in a relatively healthy state.","immune function; iron status; nutrition.","iron; article; bactericidal activity; human; immunity; infection; iron deficiency; iron storage; priority journal; theoretical study; animal; immunity; physiology; review; Animal; Human; Immunity; Iron; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024848727

Rats were fed 40, 100, or 160% of normal intake, via gastric intubation, for 3 wk. Another group of rats were starved until body weight loss was equivalent to weight loss in 40%-fed rats. Groups of rats were killed at the conclusion of tube feeding or fasting and at specific periods during recovery of body weight. Brain sites examined were the ventrolateral hypothalamus (VLH), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a caudal brain stem site encompassing the area postrema-nucleus of the solitary tract (AP-NTS), and cortex. During recovery, rats previously fed 160% of normal intake (anorectic) maintained low rates of VLH fatty acid oxidation and were hypophagic until most excess fat was depleted. Conversely, rats previously fed 40% of normal intake (hungry) maintained high rates of VLH fatty acid oxidation and were hyperphagic until most deficient fat was repleted. Rats previously starved maintained high rates of VLH fatty acid oxidation during hyperphagic recovery, although levels of VLH fatty acid oxidation and food intake were initially low on refeeding. Rates of glucose oxidation in the brain sites examined did not relate well to energy balance status and the needed adjustments in food intake. The results indicated that the level of glucose oxidation in the VLH and AP-NTS responded to the level of energy immediately coming into the system (food intake). These data support the concept that the level of VLH fatty acid oxidation is inversely proportional to the level of peripheral fat storage and that high or low rates of VLH fatty acid may be a component of the mechanism that elicits the compensatory hyperphagic or hypophagic response, respectively.","body weight regulation; brain metabolism; food intake control","radioisotope; animal cell; animal experiment; anorexia; article; brain; energy metabolism; female; food intake; hunger; hyperphagia; hypophagia; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; satiety; tube feeding; zona incerta; Animal; Anorexia; Body Weight; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Eating Disorders; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Glucose; Hyperphagia; Palmitic Acid; Palmitic Acids; Radioisotope Dilution Technique; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Reference Values; Satiation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024836135

The fundamental principal behind this technology is the storage of relatively inexpensive off-peak energy from base load plants, and the subsequent use of this energy when it is needed at on-peak time periods when electricity is relatively more expensive. The energy is stored by compressing air into underground storage reservoirs, and then withdrawing the air, heating it, and expanding it through an expansion turbine-generator when needed. Although new to the United States, a 290 MW CAES facility has been operating in Huntorf, Federal Republic of Germany since 1978. Alabama Electric Cooperative has contracted with the Joint Venture of Gibbs & Hill, Inc. and Harbert International, Inc. for the design and construction of the first CAES plant to be built in the United States. The 110 MW plant, to be located in McIntosh, Alabama, approximately 40 miles north of Mobile, is scheduled for operation in 1991. This paper will discuss the concept of CAES plants in general, as well as its application to the Huntorf, Soyland, and McIntosh plants. For the McIntosh facility, the paper will address specific design details as well as the evolution of the design since the detailed engineering commenced.

Inelastic spectra were measured for six hydrogen concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 hydrogens/metal atom, the first five in the alpha and alpha + beta phases and the last in the beta phase. The spectra consisted of two groups of peaks, the first from 70 meV to 110 meV and the second from 110 to 180 meV. The intensity of the former was independent of the hydrogen content and could be associated with a precursor region in the isotherm while that of the latter rose linearly with hydrogen content. Peak shape analysis of the high energy peaks show them to be consistent with occupation of first Ti3Mn and then Ti2Mn2 sites and with changes between the alpha - and beta -phases. The identification of the precursor sites is not easy if based entirely on the IINS spectra as both-OH and near surface interstitial sites could be involved.

In 1979, 1981, and 1983, three different OK magnetic systems based on SmCo permanent magnets undulators were installed at the VEPP-3 straight section at 6300-A wavelength. The following gains per pass have been obtained: 0.5% in 1980, 1% in 1982, and 2%-2.5% in 1984. In late 1985, we decided to improve the storage ring VEPP-3 and develop a dc bypass, a special straight section dedicated for OK operation. The bypass allowed us to install an OK magnetic system of 7.8 m length and significantly increase the gain per pass in March of 1988. The bypass was installed at the storage ring VEPP-3 on 3 June 1988. We obtained lasing in the red and yellow light spectral range from 5800 to 6900 A with 5%-10% gain per pass. After changing mirrors for new ones with minimum losses at 4150 A, lasing in the violet and near UV spectral range with 3%-6% gain per pass from 4500 to 3750 A was obtained on 8 July.

The +35°C band probably corresponds to the artefact glow peak resulting from a pigment-protein-detergent interaction in subchloroplast preparations (Rózsa Zs, Droppa M and Horváth G (1989) Biochim Biophys Acta 973, 350-353). © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","charge recombination; D1/D2/cytochrome b-599; Photosystem II; thermoluminescence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005649677

We first review the minimal assumptions needed to account for the carrier emission under high-field conditions and its subsequent feedback on the field strength; it opens the way to a quantitative description of the field variation with time and the conduction current under arbitrary low-frequency drive conditions and without using any adjustable parameter. The charge-voltage relationships are also examined in detail. Conduction in the phosphor layer is assumed to originate from deep levels (traps) in the phosphor forbidden band gap, located at the insulator-phosphor interface. These levels act for charge storage, too. When a discrete trap level is considered, field clamping in the active layer is obtained; when a smooth interface-state energy density is assumed, deviations from the field clamping are possible and simply related to the interface parameters. Most of the work is analytical and the model is shown to exhibit the main qualitative features of nonmemory devices.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000754628

The instruments will achieve high energy resolution and high efficiency in the combined first and second order of diffraction in the wavelength range between 5 and 35 Å. The design incorporates an array of reflection gratings placed in the converging beam at the exit from the X-ray telescope. The grating stack picks off roughly half of the X-ray light and diffracts it to the array of charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors offset from the telescope focal plane. The remaining light passes undeflected through the grating stack where it can be utilised by instruments located in the focal plane. Both the gratings and the detector are placed on the Rowland circle. The reflection gratings diffract first, second and third order at high to moderate efficiency. The separation of the spectral orders is accomplished using the energy resolution of the CCD detectors. A set of ten CCD-chips (nine for spectroscopy, one for wavelength calibration) are arranged in a strip oriented tangentially to the Rowland circle. Since the optical design is nearly stigmatic, the spectrum of an on-axis point source will appear as a line image along the detector array. In order to reduce noise and dark current an operational temperature of -80°C is adopted for the CCD’s. The cooling is provided through a passive radiator. The chips are read out sequentially with a common electronics chain. Each chip is configured in an “image and store” mode in which the image is first acquired over half the chip and transferred to the other half for storage prior to read out. © 1989 SPIE.",,"Atomic physics; Charge coupled devices; Diffraction gratings; Focusing; Gamma rays; Optical design; Space flight; Spacecraft equipment; Spectrometers; Telescopes; X rays; Charge coupled device detectors; European Space Agency; High-energy resolution; Operational temperature; Reflection grating spectrometers; Reflection gratings; Spectroscopic investigations; Wavelength calibration; X ray detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887427353

The short range order remained with a distorted hexagonal bipyramid as a unit structure. Further grinding resulted in the crystallization into the rhombic phase. The change in the structural units from monoclinic to rhombic phase via a non-crystalline state was almost identical with that observed in Nb2O5. However, the crystallization of mechanically amorphized Ta2O5 was more difficult than Nb2O5. This is attributed to the higher lattice energy, which does not allow significant energy storage.

The processes that need to be examined include Ion Implantation, X-ray, E-Beam and Ion Beam lithography, Electron Beam metal evaporation, Sputtering, Reactive Ion Etching, and even SEM examination. The paper discusses the effects of synchrotron X-radiation in the energy range 300-100 eV, as well as Al Ka exposures which simulate the effective wavelength of storage rings planned for X-ray lithography. It will describe such effects in the context of preliminary studies dealing with varying rad exposure level at constant gate insulator thickness, as well as the behavior at several rad exposure levels as a function of gate insulator thickness. Data will be presented indicating that despite prevailing beliefs, damage in the synchrotron range follows a linear relationship over the thickness range from less than 10 nm to 50 nm, indicating strongly that damage resides near the interface and is constant with increasing insulator thickness. It will be shown that such behavior is consistent with a simple model. Even if such damage can be annealed completely using normal techniques, which is questionable, there are wide-ranging implications concerning the rad hardness of scaled devices. © 1989 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.","process damage; radiation damage; X-ray induced insulator damage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249177797

Galvani in 1786, followed by Volta's element in 1800, leading to the present-day lead acid accumulator and natrium sulphur battery. Secondly, there was indirect storage, whereby the electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy for storage. Examples are storage systems for potential energy thermal energy or compressed air stored in caverns. A further differentiation of electrical storage devices is whether they are used in mobile or in stationary systems. The mobile applications can further be divided into small accumulators as used in calculators, watches or portable radios, or accumulators of medium capacity as used mainly in road vehicles or shunting locomotives.

Thus it is very important that any comparison of the reaction kinetics of metal hydrides should also include information about the temperature intervals used and the activation energies of each sample, as well as quantitative expressions showing how the reaction rates change with the imposed pressure ratio. At 25 °C and a pressure ratio of 2, reaction rates were found to be in the following order: MmNi5 &gt; MmNi4.5Al0.5 ≈ LaNi5 &gt; MmNi4.85Fe0.15. Thus it was concluded that aluminum and iron substitution has a deleterious effect on the reaction kinetics of MmNi5 hydride. Of the materials studied, MmNi4.5Al0.5 seems to be the most practical material for hydrogen storage. This is because it has thermodynamic and kinetic properties similar to those of LaNi5 but at a cheaper price. © 1989.",,"Chemical Reactions--Reaction Kinetics; Hydrogen Inorganic Compounds; Hydrogen--Storage; Hydrogen Absorption-Desorption; Metal Hydrides; Mischmetal Nickel Compounds; Nickel Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024767440

The relationship between slowing of relaxation and changes of intracellular pH and phosphorous metabolites has been examined in human skeletal muscle during the development of fatigue and subsequent recovery. Results obtained with normal subjects have been compared with those from a subject with myophosphorylase deficiency (MPD) who produced no H+ from glycolysis during exercise and therefore afforded the opportunity of assessing the role of H+ in the slowing of relaxation. 2. Subjects fatigued the first dorsal interosseous muscle in a stepwise fashion under ischaemic conditions, with intervals between the fatiguing contractions during which the relaxation rate was measured from brief tetanic contractions and the muscle phosphorous metabolites and pH were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 3. After 21 s maximal voluntary contraction under ischaemic conditions, relaxation in the MPD subject slowed to approximately 50% of the rate in the fresh muscle at a time when the intramuscular pH had not changed. This demonstrates that there is a mechanism causing slowing of relaxation that is independent of H+ accumulation. 4. The normal subjects showed a slow recovery of relaxation compared to the MPD subject when the circulation was restored. The main difference in the intracellular metabolite concentrations between MPD and normal subjects at this time was that, for the latter, the pH remained low (around 6.5) for at least 60 s after the circulation was restored. The results suggest that the slow recovery is a consequence of continuing acidosis, i.e. the existence of a pH‐dependent mechanism of slowing. 5. The existence of a pH‐dependent mechanism was further indicated by the fact that for the normal subjects, for a similar intracellular concentration of phosphocreatine, relaxation of the recovering muscle was approximately half that of the fatiguing muscle. This was at a time when the pH of the recovering muscle was 0.3‐0.4 units less than in the partially fatigued muscle. 6. The results show that in normal muscle there are at least two processes that lead to slow relaxation in fatigued muscle: one due to H+ accumulation, the other being independent of H+. © 1989 The Physiological Society",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; cell ph; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; glycolysis; human; human cell; human experiment; ischemia; male; metabolism; muscle disease; muscle fatigue; normal human; priority journal; skeletal muscle; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adult; Energy Metabolism; Fatigue; Female; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Intracellular Fluid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Relaxation; Phosphocreatine; Phosphorus; Phosphorylases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024441807

However, within experimental error, tg was constant and independent of clay concentration. A plot of G* (complex modulus), G′, and G′' (loss modulus) (at.1 Hz) versus Gelwhite H concentration (pH 8.8-8.9) showed a rapid increase in G* and G′ (which were identical) above a clay concentration of 30 g liter-1. G′' remained very low and showed a slight increase with an increase in clay concentration. Similar trends were obtained in the variation of shear modulus G∞ and the extrapolated yield stress τB. This means that the ""gel point"" for this clay sample is about 30 g liter-1, above which the elasticity increases very rapidly with a further increase in clay concentration. The cohesive energy, Ec, in the gel structure was obtained by measuring the viscoelastic parameters as a function of applied strain amplitude (at constant frequency). The results showed that G′(t), Ec, and the critical stress σc increase rapidly with an increase in Gelwhite H concentration. The results could be fitted to a power law with an exponent n in the concentration. This exponent was in the region 3.1-3.7 and was lower than that obtained previously with another commercial bentonite sample. The results confirmed the previously held view that gel formation in these commercial samples is most likely due to a face-to-edge association mechanism. This mechanism is favorable at intermediate to high electrolyte concentrations (usually present in commercial clay suspensions) whereby the double layers are compressed, thus obtaining close approach of the edges to the faces. Plots of G*, G′, G′', G, and τb versus pH showed a primary maximum at pH 7, indicating maximum interaction at this pH. At this pH, the edges are most likely positively charged and hence edge-to-face association is possible. The reduction at pH &gt;7 is due to the reduction of positive charges on the edges. However, the reduction at pH &lt;7 may also be due to the reduction in the number of units available for the build up of the double-T junctions. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002671583

The host materials included in this study were YVO4, YAG, BEL, Cr:GSGG, and LNA. Measurements were limited to laser performance on the 4F3/2 -&gt; 4I11/2 transition. The predictive quality of traditional modelling was examined by generating detailed theoretical performance curves for all the materials. The best theoretical fit to the data was obtained by using cross section values determined by the Birnbaum laser method and quantum efficiencies (QE) greater than 94% for all the materials except BEL and Cr:GSGG. The low QE for Cr:GSGG can be traced to excited state absorption into the Cr3+ bands. Uncertainty in the fit relates to the tradeoff between QE and loss. A performance comparison between coated and uncoated YAG suggests that surface losses contribute more than expected. The data and the model indicate that all materials studied here (except for Cr:GSGG) should display approximately a 55? or greater slope efficiency (optical-to-optical) above 1 watt of pump power if fabricated with a monolithic high reflector and antireflective coating at the appropriate faces. Based on projections from the model and data from the literature LNA has the potential to be a high efficiency and energy storage laser. Utilizing a new 2 watt 20 stripe diode laser array, 1.22 watts at an optical efficiency of 61? was obtained at 1064 nm in the TEM00 from a Nd:YVO4 crystal. © 1989 SPIE.

The intense flux of low energy photons acts as a clean ""pulse generator"" calibration signal equivalent to 20 GeV or more. This calibration technique has been demonstrated with a bismuth germanate (BGO) detector array, as well as with several barium fluoride detector crystals, to provide a calibration accuracy of 0.5% within two minutes. The SSC calibration has resulted from the development of this novel technique by Caltech over the past five years for the L3 BGO electromagnetic calorimeter, which uses a lithium target for the production of 17.6 MeV low energy photons for the calibration source. Proven techniques have been developed to provide an in situ calibration for all 11 000 BGO detector crystals, with an accuracy of 0.8% obtainable in 1-2 h. The result of the experimental test by using the AccSys RFQ accelerator is reported, as is the preliminary concept of a small storage ring that can be used to compress the output beam pulse from the RFQ accelerator into a target beam pulse of 100 ns or less. © 1989.",,"Accelerators; Physics--High Energy; Barium Fluoride; Radio Frequency Quadrupole; Superconducting Supercollider; Calorimeters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024738586

However, the spatial resolution of the devices is a function of the write-pulse energy density and saturates at about 100 μJ/cm2. In the case of multiple-pulse writing of a static image, the optical output is a function of the write-pulse energy repetition rate, the spatial frequency of the image, and the write-beam energy density per pulse.

The ESR in this case is of a type having no straight sections. In this system, synchrotron radiations are reflected back by the mirror to intersect the electron orbit again, and are consequently accumulated within the mirror. The PhSR functions like an undulator having an infinite number of periods, and thus specific wavelengths are enhanced. The wavelength is selected by the mirror radius regardless of the electron energy as long as the electron orbit curvature is kept unchanged. The generated synchrotron radiations are fully extracted through a simple opening on the mirror surface. A strong magnetic field can be introduced without any deterioration of the interference effect, which allows the radiation yield to be increased. A conceptual design of such a PhSR is described in this article. © 1989 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Free-electron laser; Synchroton; Undulator","Electron Optics; Lasers, Free Electron; Mirrors; Photons; Electron Storage Rings; Photon Storage Rings; Accelerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024734328

It is shown that these can give over-optimistic energy targets which are not practically achievable. A time-dependent analysis, the Cascade analysis, is then presented. The process is broken down into time intervals analogous to the temperature intervals used in conventional pinch technology methods. Time-temperature cascade tables are developed which show how much heat can be recovered by direct heat exchange between streams, and how much heat can be transferred between different time intervals by heat storage systems. A three-dimensional cascade plot is introduced to aid visualisation of heat flows. The effects of using different types of heat storage are discussed briefly. Algorithms for generation of the cascades are also presented. Targets are obtained for maximum heat recovery maximum direct heat exchange and heat storage.",,"Chemical Plants--Heat Exchangers; Mathematical Models; Mathematical Techniques--Algorithms; Batch Processes; Cascade Analysis; Pinch Technology; Time Average Model; Heat Exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024733968

The design of this low-cost MAgnetic Calorimeter was optimized for electron and muon identification, as well as for the measurement of hadronic energy flow. Muon identification is available over 96% of the solid angle, and MAC was the first detector to make large-scale use of gas-sampling calorimetry. Electromagnetic calorimetry in the central section employs alternating layers of lead and proportional wire chambers (PWCs), and hadron and the remaining electromagnetic calorimetry is accomplished with iron plate and PWC layers. A relatively small central drift chamber in an axial magnetic field provides pattern recognition and modest momentum determination. An outer blanket of drift tubes completes the muon identification system. During the latter two years of operation an innovative ""soda straw"" vertex chamber made more precise lifetime measurements possible. With an evolving trigger system and highly automated data acquisition system, this modest detector has exceeded most of its designers' expectations and has produced a gratifying spectrum of physics results. © 1989.",,"Accelerators, Linear--Storage Rings; Calorimeters; Electron-Positron Colliders; MAC (MAgnetic Calorimeter) Detector; Radiation Detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024732923

Thermal stability of jet fuels is determined by ASTM Method D 3241, using the Jet Fuel Thermal Oxidation Tester (JFTOT). The Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) experienced thermal stability problems with JP-4 jet fuel at one of its fuel terminals, and the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER) was requested to assist in determining the cause of the problems. The thermal stability problems were typically characterized by situations in which various suppliers' fuels passed all tests, including thermal stability, prior to shipment, but blended fuels in some storage tanks failed the thermal stability test. In many cases, the failures were evidenced primarily by high pressure drop across the test filter; however, in some cases heavy tube deposits were also obtained. Various other instances of similar problems have been reported but not documented. This paper describes the results of blending studies to identify the problem fuels and their characteristics. The results indicate that the incompatibility between fuels which gives rise to off-spec JFTOT test results is a transient phenomenon which apparently only occurs with occasional shipments of fuel and not with all fuel from certain suppliers.",,"Fuels--Stability; Blended Fuels; Jet Fuels; Thermal Stability; Aircraft Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024731784

In this case, the problem of optimal design reduces to a nonlinear programming problem, where the random values of the objective function and limitations are calculated on the basis of the Monte Carlo method. The requirement of fulfilling the prescribed level of reliability of the CF is the condition of optimal design, which makes it possible to take into account the variation of the load-bearing capacity of the structure, variation of the energy-storing capacity, and conditions of the planned purpose. The effect of the structural parameters was analyzed for the example of the optimal design of a FGRP CF and the interrelation and difference of the stochastic and deterministic solutions was shown.

Bluefin tuna myoglobin (Mb) was dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.5-7.4) with or without 0.2 M NaCl and quickly frozen in dry ice-acetone, followed by a 2-h storage at -80 °C and subsequent thawing at 20 °C. The “frozen/thawed” Mb solution thus prepared, along with unfrozen (intact) Mb, was examined for the free energy for unfolding, helical content, and autoxidation rate. In 50 mM phosphate buffers, the free energy for unfolding (AGD) was generally lower in frozen/thawed Mb than in unfrozen Mb, with the highest value (7.3 kcal/mol) at pH 6.5. Similar tendency was observed in 50 mM phosphate buffers containing 0.2 M NaCl, although ΔGDH2° values were generally lower. Helical contents of frozen/thawed Mb were practically the same as those of unfrozen Mb, regardless of pH. Frozen/thawed Mb showed a higher autoxidation rate than unfrozen Mb. It was concluded that, during freezing and thawing, Mb suffered some conformational changes in the nonhelical region, resulting in a higher susceptibility to both unfolding and autoxidation. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

The new detector components include the central drift chamber, the time-of-flight system, the coil, the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters and the beam energy and luminosity measuring devices. There have also been improvements in detector hermeticity. All of the major components were installed for a test run at the PEP storage ring (√s = 29 GeV) in 1985.

There are presently two main options available to deal with the wastes generated by spent nuclear fuel unloaded from reactors and containing most of the radiotoxicity produced all along the nuclear fuel cycle. Since the end of Word War II, spent-fuel reprocessing technology has gone through three different stages, ending up with considerable technical achievements and large investments (construction of large facilities, UP3 in France and THORP in the UK). However, having to face spent-fuel risings and lack of reprocessing capacities, since the mid-seventies some countries are considering the possibility of direct spent-fuel disposal without reprocessing. These two options are discussed in terms of long-term waste management. Because of the types of waste conditioning and packaging adopted with present reprocessing technology, in that case long-term safety, after a few centuries, relies completely on the geological barriers. On the other hand, long-term safety with the second option is based essentially on the retention properties of uranium oxide with respect to actinides. Finally, alternatives such as chemical partitioning of minor actinides followed by their transmutation, either in reactors or using high-energy particle accelerators, are under discussion. Apart from the standard reprocessing (after a cooling period of 3-5 years), all the other options called for a long period (50 years) of interim storage, preventing the adoption of irreversible, costly and not well proved waste management solutions, and leaving time to develop and assess these alternative methods. © 1989.",,"Industrial Wastes--Radioactive Materials; Nuclear Fuels--Reprocessing; Nuclear Reactors--Spent Fuels; Nuclear Waste Management; Radiotoxicity; Radioactive Wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024716184

Approximate expressions are derived for the evolution of pressure and saturation profiles, and boundary-layer changes in saturation are identified. The existence of a similarity variable implies that the saturation conditions for the reservoir tend with time either to having both phases flowing; or to a single phase vapour. In particular, the nonlinear nature of the governing equations implies that infinitesimal changes in pressure can produce finite changes in saturation. The two mechanisms responsible for saturation changing with time involve local changes in energy storage in rock and fluid; together with spatial variations in flowing enthalpy. The latter mechanism occurred relatively slowly in the examples treated, and was responsible for boundary-layer formation when one phase was initially immobile. Dimensional analysis reveals that when a boundary layer develops, the underlying equations involve essentially only one dimensionless parameter which is typically small, being associated with the ratio of the energy density of the mobile phase relative to the total energy density. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","fluid withdrawal; porous; pressure; saturation; similarity variable; steam; theory; Two-phase boundary layer; water",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144474678

For instance, new classes of superconductors based on Tl-Ca-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O have been found. As a result, the maximum verified critical temperature reached 125 K, and the problem of chemical instability (oxygen stoichiometry) were reduced at the same time. The discovery of a copperless superconductor - Ba0.6K0.6BiO3, with a Tc of 30 K - unsettled several new theoretic models of superconductivity once again. Furthermore, it was found that the well-known Meissner effect is not limited to levitation of the superconductor above a magnet but also alongside and beneath it. Major advances have been made in the filament, tape and thin-film technologies, so that critical current values, required for application, can now be approached. There is thus growing optimism that conductors suitable for use at the temperature of liquid nitrogen will be developed.",,"Electric Generators; Electric Motors; Electrical Engineering--Research; Energy Storage; Superconducting Devices; Copper Oxide Based Superconductors; Copperless Superconductors; High Temperature Superconductors; Liquid Nitrogen Temperature; Meissner Effect; Thin Film Technology; Superconducting Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024715656

The devices considered are: generators, electromotors, transformers, energy-storage devices, power-transmission equipment, current limiters and switches, power-regulation devices, magnets and transportation (maglev). Several arguments are identified and compared for their desirability and for the technical-economical barriers that their realization will meet. Economic break-even points are indicated for some cases. It is stressed, however, that fixed local factors and choices of the dimensions of the components highly influence the considerations.

There were also differences between cruises, where the percentage of the larvae judged to be in poor condition varied from 8 to 27%. Canonical correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship in most cases between the larval fish parameters and the physical and biological data collected from each occupied station.

The lasers are typically fired with a 100 μs spacing to freeze the atmosphere. The IR receiver uses a 16-in. f/2.5 telescope and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe quadrant detector. The scanner allows pointing over a full hemisphere. The lidar data system features two DEC PDP-11/73 microcomputers and a computer automated measurement and control (CAMAC) data acquisition system for real-time data collection, signal averaging, data analysis, color graphics display, and storage on magnetic tape. The multiwavelength DIAL system has demonstrated path-integrated measurements to a range of 9 km and range-resolved measurements to 4 km.

The gas permeability was determined as a function of the weight fraction of the aluminium matrix, f{hook}. A correlation between the microstructure, morphology and porosity of the PMH compacts and the coefficient of permeability α′ was found. A tri-dimensional aluminium matrix was found to form in compacts having fractional aluminium contents in the range 0.15-0.22, and to be followed by a steep decrease of α′. On the other hand, the effective thermal conductivity keff of the PMH compacts is known to increase with the increasing aluminium content. Major requirements from PMH compacts are high hydrogen and thermal yields, which are contingent upon high heat and mass transfer rates prevailing simultaneously. As the heat and mass transfer rates depend on keff and α′ respectively, it is concluded that these quantities must be optimized in a range where keff as well α′ are sufficiently high. The permeability results were interpreted also in terms of dimensionless parameters, such as the friction factor Cf and Reynolds' number Re. From the results it is seen that the transition from the D'Arcy region to the high-velocity region is quite smooth and graduai as expected of porous materials. © 1989.",,"Energy Storage; Heat Transfer; Lanthanum Nickel Alloys--Thermal Conductivity; Mass Transfer; Powder Metallurgy--Lanthanum Nickel Alloys; Friction Factor; Hydrides; Hydrogen Storage; Permeability; Porous Metallic Matrix Hydride Compacts; Reynolds Number; Lanthanum Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024701957

Paralinear rate equations fit the kinetic behaviour over a pressure range of 30-450 Torr H2 and temperatures of 100-250 °C. The reaction rate is controlled by the diffusion of hydrogen through the protective thickening product layer which finally reaches an apparently constant thickness for diffusion as a result of cracking on the outer surface. This maximum thickness is temperature dependent and increases abruptly above approximately 150 °C.

In both the absorption and desorption processes, the sample was maintained at approximately isothermal conditions by mixing it with a heat buffer. In addition, the hydrogen pressure in the system was adjusted such that the ratio of the equilibrium plateau pressure to the opposing pressure was the same for both the hydriding and dehydriding processes. Pressure ratios of 2, 3, 4 and 5 were used in each case. Since these factors, as well as the number of times that the sample had been subjected to hydriding-dehydriding cycles, were kept constant, it was possible to make valid comparisons of the intrinsic rates of hydriding and dehydriding. The rates of hydriding and dehydriding were found to differ substantially under the conditions used. In the case of hydriding, the reaction rate started out slowly, increased to a maximum, then decayed exponentially. In the case of dehydriding, the reaction rate decreased exponentially throughout. This suggests that in the early stages, absorption proceeds by a nucleation and growth process in which β-phase nuclei form on the surface. Once the nuclei have grown to the extent where overlapping occurs, the β phase forms a contracting envelope around the α phase and grows inwardly with a corresponding decrease in the α-β interface area. Dehydriding, however, can best be described throughout the entire reaction by a shrinking core model in which α-phase forms on the surface and grows inwardly. In both processes, the reaction rate seems to be controlled by phase transformation at the α-β interface.

Using two cw diode pumped Nd:BEL lasers operating at 1.070 and 1.079 μm, the small signal gain was measured. This measurement was done for X, Y, Z, and athermal rods for both polarizations. The same procedure was done for Nd:YAG and Nd:Cr:GSGG for comparison tests. Using spectroscopic data for all materials, the stored energy was calculated as well as the pumping efficiency. Efficient, high quality beam, operation of the laser also requires prior knowledge of the thermal distortions induced by the flashlamp pumping. This information was obtained by operating the pump chamber in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer at flashlamp powers up to 600 watts at 20 Hz. This procedure can show a large degree of non-isotropic lensing and wedging. In order to help deconvolve the pump induced wedge terms, the rods were also rotated 90. These measurements were made for both polarizations showing strong polarization dependent thermal distortion for Nd:BEL. Moire' deflectometry was also used to characterize the lensing. These results will be compared to the pumped interferometry. Knowledge of the thermal distortion profiles can lead to the design of straight through slabs with low thermal lensing terms. Long Pulse and Q-switched laser tests were conducted for the different axis rods and compared to Nd:YAG and Nd:Cr:GSGG in the identical optical arrangement. These results confirm the higher storage of Nd:BEL compared to Nd:YAG. © 1989, SPIE.",,"Digital storage; Neodymium lasers; Polarization; Q switched lasers; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Comparison test; Optical arrangement; Prior knowledge; Pumping efficiency; Small signal gain; Spectroscopic data; Thermal distortions; Thermal lensing; Pumping (laser)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958493199

The photothermal deflection technique allows one to rapidly estimate the gross efficiency of photochemical energy storage by comparing the heat emission signal with and without an additional strong, photosynthetically saturating, non-modulated light. In pea leaves, the maximal storage efficiency at low light intensities was shown to approach 55%. The general utility of this simple photothermal method is illustrated by examining the variation of the deflection signal under different conditions. The spectral resolution of this new method is shown to be much higher than that of the photoacoustic method. © 1989.","Intact leaf; Mirage effect; Photoacoustic technique; Photosynthesis; Photothermal deflection technique",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042495542

Splines are easily constrained and well suited to modeling smooth, man-made objects. Fractals, while difficult to constrain, are suitable for generating various irregular shapes found in nature. This paper develops constrained fractals, a hybrid of splines and fractals which intimately combines their complementary features. This novel shape synthesis technique stems from a formal connection between fractals and generalized energy-minimizing splines which may be derived through Fourier analysis. A physical interpretation of constrained fractal generation is to drive a spline subject to constraints with modulated white noise, letting the spline diffuse the noise into the desired fractal spectrum as it settles into equilibrium. We use constrained fractals to synthesize realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.","Constraints; Deformable models; Digital terrain models; Fractals; Physically based modeling; Scattered data interpolation; Splines","Computer graphics; Digital storage; Fourier analysis; Interactive computer graphics; Interpolation; Splines; Stochastic systems; White noise; Constraints; Deformable models; Digital terrain model; Physically based modeling; Scattered data interpolation; Fractals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022126034

As a result, we have observed unambiguous magnetic and optical signatures characteristic of polarons in P3HT in CH2C12at the lowest doping levels. The relative fraction of polarons and bipolarons has been analyzed in the context of various proposed statistical models.

Measurements were carried out in the temperature range 20–160 °C for specimens with draw ratios of about 100. The measured crystal lattice modulus was in the range 40.6-41.4 GPa, and the values were independent of temperature. In contrast, the storage modulus of the films decreased with increasing temperature. This discrepancy was related to an increase in the amorphous content with increasing temperature, and this tendency became enhanced at temperatures above 130 °C. Furthermore, in terms of relative molecular orientation, the relaxation mechanism was discussed as a function of draw ratio by using master curves constructed by shifting horizontally and then vertically. Thus the Arrhenius plots of log shift factor versus reciprocal of the absolute temperature indicate that there exist two mechanical dispersions corresponding to the a and β mechanisms for drawn specimens with draw ratios >100. The values of activation energies associated with the a and β mechanisms decrease accordingly as the draw ratio increases. Incidentally, the values, 129 and 82 kJ / mol, of the a and β mechanisms for the undrawn films are lower than those reported already. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

PHA was produced by S. wolfei during the exponential phase of growth under both of these cultural conditions. S. wolfei in pure culture also produced PHA in stationary phase when the medium was supplemented with high concentrations of the substrate crotonate. In S. wolfei, PHA levels decreased after growth stopped and most of the substrate was depleted. Altering the C to N ratio of the medium did not affect the amount of PHA made per mg of protein. The incorporation of labeled butyrate but not acetate into PHA during the early stages of growth of S. wolfei and the fact that some of the PHA in a pure culture of S. wolfei grown with trans-2-pentenoate was a polymer of 5-carbon monomer units indicated that a pathway exists for the synthesis of PHA without degradation of the substrate to acetyl-CoA. During the later stages of growth, PHA was made by a pathway which was in equilibrium with the acetate pool.

The devices tested were V-channeled structures mounted with the junction side down. These lasers came from a single production run to eliminate the statistical variances associated with multilot tests. Cumulative failure plots for cells at 30 mW stressed at 65°C and 40 mW stressed at 55 and 65°C show that two failure mechanisms are present, which we designated as intrinsic and wear-out failure regions. Using the data from the wear-out region and assuming an Arrhenius model for the temperature dependence of the reliability function, we found that the activation energy for this lot of lasers is 0.37 eV. From this evaluation, we project a median lifetime of 3.4 khrs for 40 mW operation at 35°C, and a median lifetime of 36.7 khrs at 30 mW and 35°C, which is an order of magnitude greater. Fot:4 power model where the median lifetime is proportional to power raised to the -n, we calculated that n is 4.3 for powers between 30 and 40 mW. Other data to be discussed was accumulated from low-power continuous-wave and pulsed stress cells. In addition, failure analysis results correlated with the various failure regions will be presented. All the devices were fully characterized prior to stressing, and throughout the stress period they were periodically characterized for changes in operating current at 7 mW and 30 mW, for parallel and perpendicular far-field distributions, and for astigmatic length. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental data that tracks these optical properties over the life of a laser diode. With the exception of the drive current to maintain a given optical power, all other electro-optic properties exhibit stability throughout the diode lasers' lifetime. The data also shows that there is no precursor to failure. Our results show that acceptable reliability targets can be met for high-performance optical storage applications as long as the operating temperature is maintained below 35°C and the optical power is limited to 30 mW. © 1989 SPIE.",,"Activation energy; Digital storage; Diodes; Failure (mechanical); Laser applications; Optical properties; Outages; Reliability; Semiconductor lasers; Temperature distribution; Wear of materials; Electro-optic properties; Far field distribution; Operating condition; Operating currents; Operating temperature; Reliability functions; Statistical variance; Temperature dependence; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958486380

The electrons are injected at 15 MeV and stored in the ring after acceleration up to 550 MeV. It is shown that the beam size is very large at low energy because of multiple collisions between electrons. This is effective to reduce the tune shift given by the trapped ions in the corresponding energy. Assuming that the species desorbed from the wall under photon irradiation is CO with a yield of 10-5 molecule/photon and a single set of ion clearing electrodes is installed, the maximum tune shift is 5.5 × 10-3 in the process of acceleration.

The Mössbauer spectral and X-ray diffraction data imply that the γ-TiCu and CsCl structure phases coexisted in the X=0.1 and X=0.2 alloys. The Mössbauer spectrum of X=0.1 is a sum of two components, one quadrupole doublet with larger quadrupole splitting and one with smaller quadrupole splitting. Mössbauer spectra for alloys other than X=0.1 are simple doublet. By comparison, Ti1Cu0.5Fe0.5 has smaller linewidth and higher isomer shift than Ti1Co0.5Fe0.5.

Onshore winds were associated with a nearly saturated atmosphere whereas offshore ones were quite dry. Surface albedo was twice as great for low tide as for high tide. The ratio net/solar radiation was 13% less at low tide owing to both the larger albedo and the stronger long‐wave radiation loss. Heat fluxes into the bottom sediments were small with net gains in August and net losses in September. During the day, heat storage in the water was large and positive. This occurred even with the tide out, when the ponded water continued to warm. At night the water gave up heat, both for low and high tide, and especially late in the season. The latent heat flux was always positive and was largest by day during low tide and by night during high tide. The sensible heat flux was positive for onshore winds and often negative for offshore winds.

Two models describing buffer conveyance capacity are introduced. The first assumes that pollutant transport through the buffer depends on the energy of overland flow and is based on Bagnold's stream power concept. The second assumes that the buffer effectiveness is a function of total contact time of both surface runoff and throughflow and is based on Darcy's law and the Manning equation. The hydraulic and detention models, respectively, are applied to the problem of estuarine shoreline buffer zone delineation in Carteret County, North Carolina. Results show that where solid-phase pollutants transported as suspended or bedload in overland flow are the major concern, slope gradient is the most critical factor, followed by soil hydraulic conductivity. Where dissolved pollutants that are transported by both surface and subsurface flow are of concern, buffer width is by far the most important factor, with soil moisture storage capacity also playing a role.

Thylakoids stored in low salt media showed localized energy coupling. A related thylakoid membrane property is the occurrence of sequestered, metastable, acidic domains, associated with pKa≈7.5 amine groups. For low salt-stored membranes the domain protons appear to be in the direct (localized) diffusion pathway of protons involved in energizing ATP formation, whereas in thylakoids stored in high KCl, domain protons equilibrated with the lumen during the development of the ATP energization threshold (Theg et al. 1988). This work tested whether the 100 mM KCl storage treatment did or did not cause the dissipation of the metastable acidic domain protons in the dark, storage period. By three criteria, it was found that the 100 mM KCl storage treatment had only a slight tendency to dissipate the acidic domain protons into alkaline media under dark conditions. Storage in KCl does not cause the dissipation of the acidic domains in the dark, but allows domain protons to equilibrate with the lumen after the redox system begins turning over, but before the ATP energization threshold ΔpH is reached. These results must be considered in models of how the thylakoid structure can accommodate metastable acidic domains and how such domain protons diffuse to the CF0-CF1 complexes in energy coupling. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","energy coupling; localized protons; membrane domains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646310510

So, the results reported here are for the Prandtl number Pr ≈0.7. It was found that while the presence of fins usually decreases the heat transfer coefficient, the resulting increased surface area due to fins is so significant that the fins of both arrangements increase the rate of heat transfer, with the staggered one being more efficient. The normalized rate of heat transfer Qi/Q1 was found to be independent of Rayleigh number, and for each fin arrangement, correlations were obtained to express Qi/Q1 as a function of fins length.

Telescope leakage model calculations using BRDF values of ~2-4 × 10−3at 10 are in adequate general agreement with much of these flight data and indicate inflight rejection performance 20-40 times worse than model predictions based on pre-flight laboratory measurements. Laboratory measurements on a number of IR telescopes after many months of vacuum storage indicate an average degradation factor of approximately 35 in excellent general agreement with these rocketborne measurements. However, both laboratory and flight measurements indicate degradation factors which are a function of the off-axis angle with a performance at small angles (&lt; 2°) which can be significantly poorer than these average factors, and can result in a major portion of the leakage energy originating from the lower atmosphere. In at least one case, the off-axis rejection performance at small angles was found to be poor enough for non-rejected radiation from the lower atmosphere to become the dominant source of leakage energy in several IR bands. In this example, the clear presence of anomalous atmospheric spectral features in the data for high tangent heights can only be interpreted in this context. Modelling of the spectra from these experiments throughout the IR region requires proper inclusion of the effects of the atmosphere (both in emission and absorption). Results to date indicate that high-resolution line-by-line calculations may be required to fully explain the detailed structure of the spectra from these measurements. © SPIE.",,"Research laboratories; Stray light; Telescopes; Atmospheric emission; Degradation factor; Flight measurements; Laboratory measurements; Limb-viewing geometry; Line-by-line calculations; Lower atmosphere; Rejection performance; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957464501

Routine catabolic requirements for carbohydrate are probably met by translocated photosynthate. Substrate-specific absorption efficiencies were greater than 95% for protein and lipid, but considerably lower (10 to 60%) for carbohydrate. This pattern of absorption is directly related to very low levels of dietary carbohydrate compared to the other substrates. High-intertidal anemones absorbed more lipid than low-intertidal anemones. Integrated budgets for organic nitrogen, the first reported for any cnidarian, indicate that low-intertidal anemones require larger daily rations than high-intertidal anemones to meet their higher metabolic demands for protein.

By using the slab geometry, solid state laser systems can be scaled to higher repetition rates without sacrificing beam quality. Ndiglass is a laser material available in large sizes and with high energy-storage capacity. The goal of our slab laser design is a high peak and average power Ndiglass laser with a polarized, low-divergence output that can be focused on to solid targets to produce x-ray emitting high-temperature plasmas. We have built a Ndiglass laser with a slab of dimensions (325 × 64 × 6) mm3 pumped by four xenon flashlamps. The optical pumping and water cooling are controlled to produce a uniform temperature distribution within the Ndiglass slab and minimise thermo-optic distortions. The slab is cooled by conduction through a thin helium gap and sapphire windows placed over the slab faces to protect the slab's total internal reflection surfaces from contamination. The laser is used as an oscillator and multipass amplifier and was designed to operate in a Q-switched mode at 10 joules per pulse and 10 pulses per second.

Sombre Lake is clear and oligotrophic with little phytoplankton and a bottom sediment low in organic content. By contrast Heywood Lake is turbid and mesotrophic; a substantial phytoplankton develops in summer and the bottom sediments are comparatively rich in organics. Both lakes freeze over for much of the year, forcing the copepods to adopt a benthic feeding strategy over winter. Adult Pseudoboeckella feed on phytoplankton when this is available, but also on detritus, diatoms and short algal filaments stirred up from the sediment. In Heywood Lake, male copepods show a smooth seasonal trend in lipid content with lipid being synthesised in early summer and utilised in late summer and winter. The summer increase in lipid content is associated with an increase in dry weight. Female lipid contents show evidence of two peaks of egg production. In Sombre Lake both male and female copepods increase in size during summer and show a wider range of lipid contents than in Heywood Lake; it is likely that this is due to the poorer winter feeding conditions which necessitate the synthesis of a much larger store of reserves during the summer. In contrast to marine calanoid copepods, lipid stores are exclusively triacylglycerol with no trace of wax ester. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Antarctic lakes; copepod; lipid; phytoplankton; triacylglycerol; wax ester",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249968890

We use the GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) zonal mean data to compute the storage rate, divergence, and poleward flux of MSE. Surface eddy fluxes are determined based on an empirical formula developed from available climatological data. Radiative fluxes at the TOA and surface are computed from a radiation model. A number of significant features are illustrated by the present analysis in regard to the global annual and seasonal energy balance of the earth-atmosphere system. The storage/release rate of MSE is greater in spring and autumn than in summer and winter. The rate of poleward transport of MSE has a maximum at ~40°N and ~35°S with a value of ~3 × 1015 W. In terms of the radiation budget, the persistent ITCZ minimum and subtropical maxima of the IR flux distribution are reproduced well in the radiation parameterization program. The incoming solar flux maximum shifts from ~20°N in spring to ~40°N in summer due to the poleward increase in the fraction of daytime. Finally, an examination of the global surface energy balance reveals that the surface net fluxes derived from parameterizations for eddy and radiative fluxes agree well with values derived from observations. This agreement appears to imply that on the global mean, the physical parameterizations used in the present study are reliable in modeling the seasonal surface flux components. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",,"energy balance; seasonal cycle; surface flux component; zonally averaged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024795484

Paraffin wax was used as the PCM and a black dye was added to vary its absorption coefficient. Samples composed of the PCM layer and an insulating layer with an adiabatic rear side were tested using a solar simulator with constant incident radiation. A theoretical analysis was carried out by applying the concept of overall specific heat. The numerical results agreed fairly well with the experimental results within the range of the present experimental conditions thus validating the theoretical analysis. It became clear that the optical thickness of the PCM has a strong influence on the temperature distribution and the efficiency of thermal energy storage. It was found that a PCM with small optical thickness has greater efficiency of thermal energy storage because of inner (back) melting.",,"Solar Radiation--Spectrum Analysis; Phase Change Material; Solar Thermal Energy Storage; Spectral Distribution; Energy Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024628090

By using a rotating wheel with low profile arms and a patented curvature, these rotary discharge machines remove material from the pressure zone, thereby considerably reducing the possibility of materials-bridging. Also, as only a slow rotary speed is required, the discharge distance from the shelf to the main collector or belt conveyor can be kept to a minimum and there is no further compaction of the stored material, as can often occur with a plough reclaimer. A typical installation using LOUISE block model rotary discharge machines is the Superior Midwest Energy Terminal for coal trans-shipment, located in Wisconsin, USA. Six such machines arranged in two groups of three are under a large coal stockpile. The stockpile is needed for high capacity ship loading and for coal storage during the winter months when shipping is not possible. Each group of three machines discharge a combined total of 10,000 tonnes per hour onto a 2.4 metre wide reclaim belt conveyor leading to a ship loader.",,"Coal Handling; Machinery; Portal Model; Rotary Discharge Machines; Materials Handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024627188

Apart from storage problems it is causing adverse environmental impacts and pollution to surrounding areas. Presently, the major portion of this waste remains unutilized. Earlier experiments were carried out to make building bricks from this material, but due to high manufacturing costs the project was not commercially viable. There is a shortage of building materials, particularly that of cement, which can be partly met by the use of red mud cement. This paper summarizes the investigation of a binder from red mud, which can be effectively utilized in the building industry. From the above analysis it is concluded that cementitious binder from red mud can be economically prepared (without the expenses of additional energy) similar to lime pozzolana mixes for masonary mortars, plasters and nonstructural concrete, ie. concrete for mass foundation, terracing, subflooring, etc. Further work to optimize the conditions and testing and evaluation as per relevant Indian Standards is in progress.",,"Cement--Raw Materials; Red Mud; Aluminum Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024626820

Our results show that red cell capability to regain a normal discoid shape after chemical crenation decreases during storage but is not lost over a five week period. Moreover there is a significant but weak correlation between red cell ATP content and both shape recovery capability and viscosity. Our results confirm suspicious that red cell shape perturbations following blood bank storage are widely reversible. Two different mechanisms may be involved in reducing shape recovery capability during storage, namely an ATP-dependent mechanism and an energy-independent one. The energy dependent mechanism may be preserved by the previous addition of solutions which maintain higher energy levels during storage. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Additive solutions; ATP; Erythrocyte; Shape control; Storage","adenosine triphosphate; sorbitol; blood storage; cell shape; erythrocyte; human; priority journal; Adenine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Preservation; Blood Viscosity; Cell Separation; Dinitrobenzenes; Erythrocyte Aging; Erythrocyte Deformability; Glucose; Guanosine; Human; Phosphates; Sodium Chloride; Solutions; Sorbitol; Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024594191

The limiting factor is the growth of beam emittance and energy spread by small angle Coulomb scattering and energy loss straggling. The corresponding probability density distributions are derived for proton energies ≳ 1 GeV and target thicknesses ≲ 10-6 radiation length. It is very important to take the low intensity single scattering tails of those distributions into account as the beam distortions result from on the order of 106 passes through the target. The beam emittance, energy spread and survival probability are calculated as a function of turn number.

Such devices are invariably tuned by varying the field strength in the region encompassing the trajectory. As a consequence, the highest first harmonic frequencies generated by such structures are limited by their period lengths, while the generation of lower first harmonics quickly leads to the production of excessive amounts of out-of-band radiation. In the spontaneous emission regime, this superfluous power varies directly with the length of the device. In view of this, recent access to straight sections in high energy storage rings exceeding lengths of 100 m has raised the undesirable prospect of unmanageable power levels limiting the utility of such facilities. In this article a general study of a set of major types and classes of transverse insertion devices operating on storage rings of arbitrary energy and current is made and the results are represented with a set of universal performance curves. The graphical tabulation enables easy identification of optimum undulator types and operating parameters for any storage ring environment; in particular, optimal devices which do not suffer from excessive power generation on high energy storage rings are defined. © 1989.",,"Magnetic Fields; Insertion Devices; Synchrotron Radiation; Transverse Undulators; Undulators; Accelerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024606208

Investigations into the metabolic role of mannitol have led to the discovery that a mannitol cycle is present in this parasite. Prior to these studies the mannitol cycle was found exclusively in fungi. The parasite cycle is similar to that in the fungi although there are distinct differences in coenzyme requirements. The enzymes involved in the parasite pathway include mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.17), mannitol-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.22), mannitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.67), and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1). Kinetic studies were conducted to determine the Km and specific activities of these enzymes at both ambient temperature (where sporulation occurs) and the chicken's body temperature (41°C). The data suggest that mannitol is produced during oocyst formation in the chicken gut and accumulated as an energy reserve for sporulation. The apparent lack of mannitol kinase in the organism and the Km values for the dehydrogenases in the reverse direction all indicate that the cycle only proceeds in one direction. In addition to serving as an energy storage system the cycle may also function as an electron 'sink' for the parasite which must survive in the anaerobic environment of the gut. © 1989.","Carbohydrate metabolism; Eimeria tenella; Hexokinase; Mannitol; Mannitol cycle; Mannitol dehydrogenase; Mannitol-1-phosphatase; Mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase; Polyols","aldehyde reductase; hexokinase; mannitol; mannitol 1 phosphate dehydrogenase; mannitol dehydrogenase; mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase; phosphatase; animal; article; Eimeria; enzymology; metabolism; Animal; Eimeria; Hexokinase; Mannitol; Mannitol Dehydrogenase; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024969288

Frequency domain finite-difference solutions are readily generated by using this technique. Input models can be described either by specifying velocities or appropriate media parameters on a two or three dimensional grid of points. For heterogeneous models, transmission and reflection coefficients are determined at structural boundaries within the media. The direct forward scattered waves sre modeled with a single pass of the extrapolator operator in the paraxial direction for each frequency. The first-order back scattered energy can then be modeled by extrapolation (in the opposite direction) of the reflected field determined on the first pass. Higher order scattering can be included by sweeping through the model with more passes. The chief advantages of the paraxial approach are 1) active storage is reduced by one dimension as compared to solutions which must track both upgoing and down-going waves simultaneously, thus even realistic three dimensional problems can fit on today's computers, 2) the decomposition in frequency allows the technique to be implemented on highly parallel machines such the hypercube, 3) attenuation can be modeled as an arbitrary function of frequency, and 4) only a small number of frequencies are needed to produce movie-like time slices. By using this method a wide range of seismological problems can be addressed, including strong motion analysis of waves in three-dimensional basins, the modeling of VSP reflection data, and the analysis of whole earth problems such as scattering at the core-mantle boundary or the effect of tectonic boundaries on long-period wave propagation. © ACM 1988.",,"Digital storage; Forward scattering; Frequency domain analysis; Geometry; Wave propagation; Finite-difference solution; Heterogeneous models; Higher-order scattering; Three-dimensional grids; Three-dimensional problems; Transmission and reflection coefficient; Wave propagation problems; Wavefield propagation; Data flow analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849083692

It is argued that electric vehicles can play a role. Recognizing the limitations of electrochemical energy storage technology, it is noted that non-contact energy transfer to automobiles would be advantageous. An open E-core transformer, as used in the Santa Barbara bus project is considered to be a favourable transfer mechanism. A spread-sheet based design study is reported. This approach was validated by comparing experimental results from a 75% scale model of the energy transfer device and finite element numerical analysis. A preferred design is presented, and is shown to be technically feasible by meeting a set of reasonable specifications and guidelines for automobiles. The problems are shown to be associated with high frequency excitation and the large (5 cm) airgap, requiring high magnetizing current for effective power transfer. Some means of improving the design are suggested. © Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobiles; Energy transfer; Highway engineering; Inductive power transmission; Crisis situations; E-core transformers; Electrochemical energy storage; Finite element numerical analysis; High-frequency excitation; Inductive power transfer; Magnetizing current; Transfer mechanisms; Finite element method",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072432746

Fueled by oxygen and hydride stored hydrogen, the FCESS is being considered as an alternative to the EMU zinc-silver oxide battery. Superior cycle life and quick recharge are its main attributes. Design and performance of a non-venting 28V, 34 Ahr system with 7 amp rating are discussed. The FCESS is comprised of a 32-cell proton exchange membrane (PEM) stack, a metal hydride storage vessel and a control subsystem. The stack design incorporates passive product-water removal and thermal integration with the hydride vessel. The hydride vessel stores enough fuel for 5 hours.

Important faults dipping 607deg; West affect the thick (1400 m) sedimentary cover and the granitic horst underneath. The seismic network, set up by IMRG to monitor the microseismicity induced in the granite by the stimulation, is made up of three-directional probes (especially designed to stand the rough temperature and corrosion conditions) cemented at the bottom of three observation boreholes. Once the seismic signals digitized in the computing system, an automatic detection and storage of the seismic events is performed in real time. To get a precise idea of the tectonic context at depth, a VSP seismic survey has been carried out. During the 3-day stimulation experiment, despite a rather low water flow-rate (3.3 1/s), 58 seismic events have been recorded on the network. Results show a general trend of magnitudes decreasing with time, and a spectral content within the frequency range 50-250 Hz for geophones sited 700 to 1200 m away from the stimulated zone. Seismic activity starts 2 hours after the beginning of the stimulation.

The objective of the design is to find the shape of the bar for which, in the presence of constraints on the geometry and strength of the bar, the Specific Kinetic Energy (SKE) is maximal. An upper bound for the SKE of a finite length bar is derived and a discrete formulation is presented by which an approximate optimal profile for arbitrary design parameters and rotational speeds can be obtained numerically. Applying a parametric study, in which optimal designs for a sequence of rotational speeds were observed, a general configuration of the exact optimal profile was concluded. The parametric study reveals the existence of three speed intervals, each characterized by a common type of optimal design. The optimal SKE corresponding to the ultimate rotational speed reaches a value very close to the theoretical upper bound, namely, that of a thin ring. The model gives insight into the nature of optimal designs and serves as a simple and rapid computational tool for finding the optimal profile for arbitrary bar parameters and rotational speeds. © 1989 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024582810

A fasting test was carried out for 48 hours. Blood glucose and insulin levels were found to be markedly decreased 12 hours after the commencement of testing. Subsequently, ketone body levels gradually increased throughout the remainder of the test period. Ketone bodies as well as blood glucose were found to be elevated 30 and 60 min after administration of glucose. An insulin tolerance test (0.2 U/kg) demonstrated that the lowest levels of both ketone bodies and glucose occurred at 90 min. A steep rebound phenomenon for ketone bodies was observed from 150 min to 240 min, while blood glucose was not restored to its basal value even 240 min later.

One major issue that needed to be addressed is that most phase-change materials (PCMs) with high energy storage density have an unacceptably low thermal conductivity. Several enhancement techniques are proposed in this paper. The baseline case utilizes LiH encapsulated in a thin SS304 container. The first enhancement technique uses LiH encapsulated in smaller containers of various shapes contained in a bigger cylindrical container filled with Ii. The total volume of LiH is the sage as the baseline case. The second enhancement technique focuses on a metal/phase-change material (M/PCM) composite. Specifically, 5% Ni is added uniformly to LiH so that the mixture has the same volume as the baseline storage unit. The enhancement techniques are analyzed numerically and their effectiveness is assessed for both constant surface heat flux and constant surface temperature conditions. Results shown include the amount of PCM melted as a function of time and the maximum temperature within the storage units.

These state-to-state transition rates-were fed into the master equation, which was numerically solved to determine the rotational and vibrational population densities as well as the bulk thermodynamic properties. Our results show that (i) the vibrational transition rates of H2 increase monotonically with the vibrational levels, faster than the Landau-Teller model, (ii) the rotation of the molecules helps relax the low vibrational levels, serves as a temporary storage of vibrational energy during the relaxation, and thereby delays the dissociation process, (iii) the dissociation and re-combination rates can be approximated within an order of magnitude using equilibrium formulations and Park’s two-temperature model for temperature averaging, (iv) lower vibrational levels tend to over-relax, and (v) the average energy loss due to the dissociation is about 80-90%of the dissociation energy. © 1989 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

For the series of polypropylenes, the molecular weight distribution at high molecular weight range, as expressed by Mz/Mw, was broader as the melt flow index was higher or the molecular weight was lower. Following relations were obtained for the zero-shear viscosity η0, the characteristic relaxation time λ0, and the ratio λ0/η0: η0∝Mw3.1, λ0∝Mz3.3, λ0/η0∝(Mz/Mw)2.7, λ0/η0∝Mz·Mz+1/MwMn. The temperature dependence of η0, λ0, and λ0/η0 was of the Arrhenius type and the activation energies were 10.0 kcal/mol, 5.7 kcal/mol, and -4.3 kcal/mol, respectively: Contrary to the common knowledge, the ratio λ0/η0 increased as temperature increased. The storage modulus G′(ω) and loss modulus G″(ω) increased more slowly as the molecular weight distribution was broader, and the modulus at which G′(ω) is equal to G″(ω) was lower as the molecular weight distribution was broader. Irrespective of the kind of sample and temperature, the plots of log G′ against logG″fell on a curve approximated by a straight line, and hence it was conjectured that the elasticity at fixed value of viscosity does not change over the range of samples and temperatures studied in this experiment. © 1989, The Society of Rheology, Japan.

During swimming and manoeuvring, the fins are bent upward and downward in undulatory waves. The fin musculature is arranged in three mutually perpendicular planes. Transverse muscle bundles extend parallel to the fin surface from the base of the fin to the fin margin. Dorso‐ventral muscle bundles extend from dorsal and ventral connective tissue fasciae to a median connective tissue fascia. A layer of longitudinal muscle bundles is situated adjacent to both the dorsal and ventral surface of the median fascia. The muscle fibres are obliquely striated and include a core of mitochondria. A zone of muscle fibres with a more extensive core of mitochondria is present in both the dorsal and the ventral transverse muscle bundles. It is hypothesized that these muscle masses include two fibre types with different aerobic capacity. A network of connective tissue fibres is present in the transverse and dorso‐ventral muscle masses. These fibres, probably collagen, are oriented at 45 to the long axes of the transverse and dorsoventral muscle fibres in transverse planes. A biomechanicayl analysis of the morphology suggests that support for fin movements is provided by simultaneous contractile activity of muscles of specific orientations in a manner similar to that proposed for other ‘muscular‐hydrostats’. The musculature therefore provides both the force and support for movement. Connective tissue fibres may aid in providing support and may also serve for elastic energy storage.

The role of the intrinsic Zn ions of E. coli RNA polymerase (RPase), Xenopus oocyte transcription factor 111A (TFIIIA), and E1A protein of adenovirus were investigated. Various paramagnetic‐metal substituted RPases obtained by in vivo and in vitro methods were used to elucidate the spatial relationship between the metal and other active sites of RPase. Two Zn ions of RPase were involved in the substrate and template binding, in maintaining the proper conformation of active RPase, and may be coordinated with histidine and cystidine. Thus, Zn ions of RPase play catalytic, regulatory and structural roles. Two Zn ions of TFIIIA also play multiple roles in the regulation of 5S RNA synthesis; binding TFIIIA to 5S RNA and its gene, essentiality for 5S RNA gene transcription and DNA‐activated ATPase activity of TFIIIA. CD studies of apoTFIIIA, TFIIIA and its storage 7S particle, and 5S RNA indicated (1) Zn ions may not involve in the stabilization of TFIIIA, (2) substantial confomational changes of 5S RNA upon binding to TFIIIA. Two major proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids (aa), of E1A gene contain 1 and O Zn, respectively.

The cows were offered grazed herbage only (G), or grazed herbage with a straw/concentrate supplement offered either for 45 min after each milking (B), or overnight (P). The overnight treatment involved housing the cows between afternoon and morning milking. The straw/concentrate mixture contained 0·33 long barley straw, 0·28 barley, 0·12 soya bean meal, 0·25 molaferm and 0·02 minerals. During the first 8 weeks of the experiment an average of 2·25 kg of concentrate were fed, and from weeks 9–24, 2·0 kg of concentrate were fed. The feeding of the straw/concentrate mixture led to a decrease in estimated herbage dry matter (DM) intake, particularly for treatment P. Estimated total DM intakes were increased throughout the experiment by offering the straw/concentrate mixture. However, total metabolizable energy (ME) intakes were only increased in mid‐and late season. Milk yield was higher in early season for treatment G; 28·1 kg d−1 compared to 26·8 kg d−1 and 25·5 kg d−1 for treatments B and P respectively. In late season the cows in treatment G had lower milk yields; 13·3 kg d−1 compared to 15·5 kg d−1 and 16·8 kg d−1 for treatments B and P respectively.

The ring has a circumference of 46.8 m, a bore diameter of — 15 cm, and requires a vacuum of 10-12Torr to decelerate highly charged, very heavy ions down to low energies. To be able to test components and procedures to achieve this pressure, a test stand approximately modeling 1/16 of the ring vacuum chamber has been built. The 3.5-m-long test stand has been fabricated from 10-cm-diam components, with 316LN stainless-steel flanges. Prior to assembly, these components were vacuum fired at 950 °C at a pressure of 10-4Torr. The test stand is bakable in situ at 300 °C. Pumping is achieved with two 750 1/s titanium sublimator pumps and one 60 1/s ion pump. Pressure is measured with two extractor ion gauges and a 10-4partial pressure residual gas analyser. The roughing for the test stand consists of cryosorption pumps followed by a cryopump. A pressure of 4 X 10-12Torr has been achieved. © 1989, American Vacuum Society.

The temporal evolution of ρ&gt;e is governed by a single system parameter α containing the loading conditions and structural parameters respectively. Below a critical value α = α* = ρ&gt;e(α) is a single and above α* a multi-valued function of α. Correspondingly, depending of loading conditions, ρ&gt;e(α) reveals bifurcations. These are suggested to generate instabilities of steady state deformation structures which macroscopically may reveal as instabilities in plastic flow. This behaviour is typical for the phenomenon of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). In the present paper α is connected with the ratio λW/W&gt;s (expended to stored energy). λ is an increasing function of strain for α = α* approaching a critical value λ&gt;m*. λ is proportional to the stationary cell size d&gt;s. The experimental λ&gt;ex* values associated with DRX of Cu- and Ni-single crystals – in strong support of the present model – turned out to be independent of temperature and these, within the accuracy of the model prediction, agree with the model value λ&gt;m*. By means of the rate of energy storage W&gt;s’ equivelence dW&gt;s/dW a stability criterion is derived according to which the instability of plastic flow in DRX can be suggested as the consequence of insufficient entropy export by the deforming material. © 1989 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913929418

One problem concerns the chemical conclusions that can be drawn from intercomparison of the structures of a family of related molecules. For such a study, relatively low-level computational methods can be employed, because residual errors for a given structural parameter due to neglect of electron correlation and use of only a mediumsized Hartree-Fock basis set are nearly invariant to minor changes in the rest of the molecule. Such a study is illustrated by a set of structural evaluations of oxirane (ethylene oxide) and of all its possible fluorinated derivatives. The other class of problems consists of situations in which absolute values of structural parameters are required, either because the molecule under study has no close chemical relatives or because the chemically interesting question requires knowledge of the absolute value of one parameter for its resolution. Such a problem is illustrated by a study of the barrier inhibiting torsion about the CC bond of tolane (diphenylacetylene). The structural effects of successive fluorination of oxirane are found to parallel very closely those previously reported for fluorinated cyclopropanes. Even minor effects, such as the greater shortening of a C-F bond when it is cis to another C-F group compared to the shortening when it is in a trans configuration, are reproduced. The large-scale calculations on tolane, C6K5-CC-C6H5, made using a 6-311G** basis set and MP2 treatment of electron correlation would have exceeded the storage capacity of our Cray computer without use of a new ""direct correlation"" method which makes unnecessary the storage of two-electron integrals over atomic basis functions. The equilibrium geometry of tolane is found to have the two phenyl rings coplanar.

This system produces the continuous electric power of 2.5 kW, 330 V a.c. using 4.3 m dia solar collector. The output power is fed to the MPD thruster experiment. This experiment is proposed for the second SFU mission called ""Energy Mission"" in the mid 1990s. As a preliminary experiment, the ballistic flight experiment using sounding rocket is also planned. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149143393

Based on H2 O2-technology, the first step into a regenerative EMSS could be the integration of the subsystems energy supply, environmental control and life support (ECLS) as well as attitude and orbit control (AOC). Further extension of such a system may also comprise the nutrition system including then further elements as N2 and C. Electrolyser and fuel cell systems play an important role within EMSS as energy converter while solar dynamic energy supply systems may offer thermal energy in parallel to electricity. Simultaneous availability of thermal and electric energy including adequate storage facilities will form an optimum basis to a variety of different chemical recycling processes as well as media and energy conversion. The motivation for such a technology is presented, the technical characteristics of subsystems technology are summarized and the first approaches of possible concepts are developed. Step by step solutions seem possible so that pilot test plants of low degree of integration may be investigated already in the course of the planned Space Station. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149142703

To achieve this, a detailed theoretical model for such a system was developed. To check its validity, experimental work was carried out for the system under both no-draw and hot water withdrawal conditions. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results was very good. The analysis is then extended in order to study the methods of supplying auxiliary energy (inside the storage tank, in series or in a mixed way) to meet the loald requirements for a certain temperature hot water setting as well as hot water draw profile patterns. For this simulation a typical sequence of hourly values of solar radiation and ambient temperatures, based on meteorological data, are used (sunny, partly cloudy, hot, cold days, etc.). The results presented in terms of various performance parameters indicate the best method for maximizing the solar energy gain, and so minimizing the auxiliary power supply. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249025273

The principal goal is to explore the photophysical origins of the controversy concerning the primary quantum yield. The ratio of the forward to reverse quantum yields (ϕ1/ϕ2) of bR is observed to equal 0.45 ± 0.03 at 77 K in glycerol/water solution. Thus, ϕ1 must be less than 0.48 under these experimental conditions. The mole fraction of K (xk500) in the 77 K, 500-nm photostationary state is observed to equal 0.46 ± 0.04. The calculated absorption spectrum of K at 77 K has a maximum absorbance at 620 nm and a molar absorptivity at max of 63 900 M-1 cm-1. The oscillator strength associated with excitation into theλmax band fK is determined to be 0.95 on the basis of log-normal regression analysis. The corresponding values for bR at 77 K are λmax = 577 nm, ∊max = 66 100 M-1 cm-1, and Fbr= 0.87. The observation that fK &gt; fbR is consistent with the displacement of the C15=NH portion of the retinyl chromophore away from a negatively charged counterion as a consequence of the all-trans to 13-cis photoisomerization. It is difficult to reconcile the observation that fK&gt; fbR with the proposal that the primary event involves an all-trans to 13-cis, 14-s-cis photoisomerization, because the latter geometry is predicted to have a significantly lower λmax band oscillator strength relative to that of the all-trans precursor. Experimental and theoretical evidence is presented which suggests that two distinct forms of light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin may exist. We propose that these two forms have characteristic photocycles with significantly different primary quantum yields. INDO-PSDCI molecular orbital procedures and semiempirical molecular dynamics simulations predict that one ground-state geometry of bR undergoes photochemistry with a quantum yield ϕ1 of ~0.27 and that a second ground-state geometry, with a slightly displaced counterion, yields ϕ1 ~ 0.74. This theoretical model may explain the observation that literature measurements of ϕ1 tend to fall into one of two categories—those that observe ϕ1~ 0.33 or below and those that observe ϕ1 ~ 0.6 or above. The observation that all photostationary-state measurements of the primary quantum yield give values near 0.3 and all direct measurements of the quantum yield result in values near 0.6 suggests that photochemical back-reactions may select the bacteriorhodopsin conformation with the lower quantum yield. We conclude that the primary photoproduct K has an enthalpy 15.9 ± 3.2 kcal mol-1 larger than that of bR at 77 K in agreement with our previous assignment (Birge, R. R.; Cooper, T. M. Biophys. J. 1983, 42, 61–69). However, we anticipate that this energy storage measurement is not necessarily valid for those environments yielding much higher quantum yields (e.g., ϕ ≥ 0.6), and we suggest that energy storage in the latter situation is not only smaller but is likely to be insufficient to pump two protons under nominal in vivo conditions. The two photocycles may have developed as a natural biological requirement that Halobacterium halobium have the capacity to adjust the efficiency of the photocycle in relation to the intensity of light and/or membrane electrochemical gradient. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

Computations of ignition processes are performed by solving the corresponding conservation equations (i.e. conservation of total mass, energy, momentum, and species mass) using a detailed reaction mechanism for the ozone - oxygen system (consisting of six elementary reactions) and a multispecies transport model. Thermal ignition is simulated by an additional source term in the energy conservation equation. Spatial discretization on a two-dimensional grid that is adapted statically in one spatial direction leads to a differential-algebraic differential equation system which is solved numerically by an implicit extrapolation method to overcome stiffness problems caused by the multiscale character of the system considered. Results are presented for the simulation of a laser-induced thermal ignition of an ozone - oxygen mixture in a cylindrical reaction vessel.

These systems consist of a one-electron core [nucleus and 1s electron (e-)] and a Rydberg e-. Recent experiments on the n=10 states of singly excited helium have given a weak confirmation for the presence of Casimir shifts ""Eret(n,l). High-precision confirmation is likely to come from measurements on helium, as experiments improve. Nevertheless, though probably not suitable for high-precision confirmation, a retardation effect could be very large for a system with a many-e- core, and it might then be important to be able to at least estimate that effect. It is shown that the same formalism that was previously developed for the evaluation of ""Eret(n,l) for a one-electron (He-like) core can often be used for the many-electron core. In particular, with the core property characterized by a function F(k) (where k is the wave number of a virtual photon) related to the electric dipole polarizability, if the multi-e- core is in an S state, we obtain essentially the same result as for helium; formally, one need merely replace the F(k) of He+ by the F(k) of the ion under consideration. The extension described is largely notational. Furthermore, we show that as long as the core electrons have a spherically symmetric charge density, for a given core state or for an average over a set of core states which differ only in their angular momentum projections, the result for ""Eret(n,l) is very similar to the heliumlike result. Thus, we give several methods to estimate core properties and ""Eret(n,l) for a variety of systems and use these methods to obtain rough estimates of ""Eret(n,l) for some representative Rydberg levels of Li and Na.

In these experiments macroplasmodia showed a modulation of their contraction rhythm followed by regulation phenomena. Until now the perception mechanism for the gravistimulus is unknown, but several findings indicate the involvement of mitochondria: A) During the impediment of respiration the Og-reaction is inhibited and the regulation is reduced. B) The response to a light stimulus and the following regulation phenomena strongly resemble the behavior during exposure to Og, the only difference is that the two reactions are directed into opposite directions. In the blue-light reaction a flavin of the mitochondrial matrix seems to be involved in the light perception. C) The contraction rhythm as well as its modulations are coupled to rhythmic changes in the levels of ATP and calcium ions, involving the mitochondria as sites of energy production and of Ca++-storage. - So the mitochondria could be the site of the regulation and they possibly are the receptor sites for the light and gravity stimuli. - Also the observation of a morphologic polarity of the slime mold's plasmodial strands has to be considered: Cross-sections reveal that the ectoplasmic wall surrounding the streaming endoplasm is much thinner on the physically lower side than on the upper side of the strand - this applies to strands lying on or hanging on a horizontal surface. So, in addition to the mitochondria, also the morphologic polarity may be involved in the perception mechanism of the observed gravisensitivity and of the recently established geotaxis. - The potential role of the nuclei and of the contractile elements in the perception of gravity is also discussed. © 1989.",,"adenosine triphosphate; calcium; animal; article; cell motion; chemistry; gravity; light; locomotion; mitochondrion; perception; Physarum polycephalum; physiology; rotation; space flight; ultrastructure; weightlessness; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Calcium; Cytoplasmic Streaming; Gravitation; Gravity Perception; Light; Locomotion; Mitochondria; Physarum polycephalum; Rotation; Space Flight; Weightlessness; Weightlessness Simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024959024

In the present work, an attempt was made to determine the stiffness of the SEC for tensions greater than PQ, using the sartorius muscle of the frog. For this purpose, rapid releases and stretches of different amplitudes were given during maximal isometric contractions. Plotting normalized tension (P/Po) against normalized length changes (negative or positive extensions, ΔL/L.102) produced a tension-extension curve. The slopes of the linear part of each relationship on both sides of Po indicated an increase in SEC stiffness when the muscle was rapidly stretched. Furthermore, the transient character of the increase in stiffness was studied by measuring SEC stiffness during rapid releases applied at various time intervals after stretches : the muscle was found to be stiffer as the time interval was shorter.

It consists of two closed loops: in the outer loop hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water and later burned to give water again. In the inner loop the hydrogen is combined with toluene to give methyl cyclohexane. In this form the energy can be easily stored, transported and finally used throughout the year. At the moment of end use the hydrogen is liberated by splitting the methyl cyclohexane into hydrogen and toluene, and the toluene is recharged with hydrogen later. The most appropriate application of the seasonally stored hydrogen seems to be its use as fuel for heavy vehicles in combustion engines of fuel cells. The exhaust gas of a combustion engine powered by hydrogen consists of water vapour, N2 and NOx. There are no emissions of carbohydrates, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide or dust particles. The system thus constitutes an important contribution to the protection of the environment. The on-board splitting reaction of methyl cyclohexane to toluene and hydrogen as well as its combination with the hydrogen-fueled combustion engine have been realized and investigated in full scale at our institute.

The favored site locations have been near an abundant source of constant temperature water (i.e. river or ocean). Sites close to rivers and the ocean, and close to consumers are difficult to find. Future sites for new power plants will likely be in remote locations and depend on atmospheric air cooling as a heat sink. One of the major drawbacks to these new sites is the daily and monthly fluctuations of the atmospheric temperature affecting the conversion efficiency of heat into electricity. The present study examines the performance improvement vs economic cost of using heat storage reservoirs to maximize the net energy output of these power plants using dry cooling towers. A case study is presented for an HTGR (high temperature gas-cooled reactor) operating on a Brayton direct closed cycle (He coolant) and located on a desert site (Blythe, California). The capacity of the HTGR in the desert environment on average is 1060 MWe without reservoir cooling. When provided with the reservoir cooling system, the capacity of the HTGR is increased to an average value of 1090 MWe. During the hottest summer month, the efficiency of the HTGR is increased from 34.24 to 35.20 during the hottest hour of the day. For this same period, the capacity is 977 MWe without reservoir cooling and is increased by 6% to 1034 MWe with reservoir cooling. Generally, the direct cycle HTGR with natural draft dry cooling towers and a reservoir cooling system is economically feasible if the future worth of the capital investment of the additional components does not exceed the revenues from the sale of the increased output. Assuming that the worth of electricity, at the bus bar, is 2 cents kWh-1 the value of the additional capital investment in equipment and maintenance could be as high as $3.6 million at a 10% return on the investment. © 1989.",,"Nuclear Reactors, Gas Cooled; Reservoirs; Brayton Cycles; Heat Storage Reservoirs; Thermal Discharge; Nuclear Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024944232

Two-dimenional surface discharges are considered, with an outflow located at the far end of a water body, which is simulated in the laboratory by a tank of rectangular cross section. Energy loss occurs at the sides and at the top of the water body largely by convective transport and at the bottom by conduction to the ground. The study initially considers the transient behavior of the water body due to the input of thermal energy. A rapid transient, followed by a very gradual variation to an essentially steady-state temperature distribution, is observed. Experimental results are obtained in this steady regime for a water body of large extent, simulated by allowing a gradual outflow far from the inflow. The effects of the inflow conditions, aspect ration, and the position of the outflow on the resulting thermal stratification are then studied in detail. Several interesting trends are observed and related to the basic mechanisms that arise in such energy storage systems. These flows are of interest in the storage and the extraction of energy, as sensible heat, in systems such as salt-gradient solar ponds. The thermal field is important in the design of such storage systems, particularly with respect to the selection of inlet conditions and the location of the outflow. © 1989.",,"Flow of Water--Jets; Temperature Distribution; Enclosed Water Body; Mixed Convection Flow; Thermal Field; Thermal Stratification; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024943738

Box 160789, Irving, TX 75016, United States","The minimum cost, multiperiod network flow problem is an optimization model that is frequently used to assist decision makers in the areas of resource planning, scheduling and distribution. This model describes network structured decision making problems over time. Important problems in the areas of production/distribution systems, economic planning, communication systems, material handling systems, traffic systems, railway systems, building evacuation systems, energy systems, economic systems, etc. can be described by this model. Usually, standard network codes are used to solve such problems because of their availability and perceived efficiency. To date, few researchers have considered the multiperiod structure in devising efficient solution methods. The forward network simplex algorithm of Aronson and Chen is one such method. It is a forward algorithm that exploits the natural decomposition of the problem by limiting its pivoting activity to later time periods. A forward algorithm is an approach to solving dynamic problems by solving successively longer finite subproblems, terminating when a stopping rule can be invoked or a decision horizon found. Such procedures are available for the multiperiod linear programming problem, some of its specializations and generalizations and a large number of specially structured models. The forward network simplex algorithm solves multiperiod network flow problems efficiently. Encouraging computational results indicate that the forward network simplex implementation is significantly more efficient than standard network optimization codes that do not exploit the multiperiod structure. Even though the forward network simplex method is efficient, there are still limitations to the size of problems that can be solved in-core. In this paper, we discuss a primary/secondary storage implementation of the forward network simplex method and report computational results. This implementation is capable of solving much larger problems than the in-core code and is more efficient than standard codes. Problems having 700 time periods for a total of 3500 nodes and 9095 arcs were solved in less than one third the time of the standard code on which the forward network implementation is based. Furthermore, problems up to about double this size, which the standard code could not solve, were solved by the primary/secondary implementation. © 1989.",,"Data Storage, Digital; Decision Theory and Analysis; Mathematical Models--Optimization; Forward Network Simplex Algorithm; Primary Storage Implementation; Secondary Storage Implementation; Mathematical Programming, Linear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024935614

Favorable host rocks under consideration for permanent high-level radioactive waste disposal sites are thick shales and mudstone, metamorphosed rocks of Mesozoic basement, silicified quartzite, and Mesozoic granitic gneiss. Preliminary engineering analyses of heat transfer are conducted by using HEATING-5 computer code, and the results are well below the temperature limits of the proposed maximum admissible temperatures in the repository systems. The calculation shows that significant temperature drop would occur between the surface of waste container and the host rock. The temperature rise is found to reach the maximum within the first two years after fuel emplacement and then drop to the background level after 1000 years. The size of the spent fuel repository for the six nuclear reactors is then estimated to be 1.4 km2 for shaly host rocks after a 60-year storage and 0.7 km2 for granitic rock subsequent to a 30-year storage, respectively. A probabilistic risk analysis is performed to evaluate the underlying hazards threatening the long-term safety of a repository. The study utilizes the fault tree model as a tool and the presence of faulting and potential magmatic activity characterize Taiwan's disadvantage for spent fuel disposal. A hypothetical configuration of the repository, exhibiting a crossed Z shape and extending the waste allocation arrays into various depth of a repository, is thus proposed to counteract the possible earthquake damage to the repository integrity. © 1989.",,"engineering analysis; radioactive waste disposal; risk analysis; Taiwan; Nuclear Engineering--Taiwan; Nuclear Fuels--Waste Disposal; Nuclear Reactors--Spent Fuels; Risk Studies--Assessment; Waste Disposal--Deepwell Disposal; Clay; Earthquakes; Geology; Granite; Probabilistic Risk Analysis; Spent Fuel Management Programs; Radioactive Wastes; nonhuman; nuclear energy; nuclear waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024927293

A good thermal storage should allow minimum thermal energy losses while permitting the highest possible extraction efficiency of the stored thermal energy. Despite the many available examples of successful designs of solar thermal storage tanks, the static behavior of the solar thermal storage is not fully understood. Among the many factors influencing such behavior are heat losses, tank geometry, dead zones, and tank wall material. In this study laboratory-scale models with different geometries were built for the purpose of examining thermal behavior during the period after charging. During this period, called the thermal diffusion period, the extraction efficiency was temporarily decreased until natural stratification was achieved. After the thermal diffusion period, the extraction efficiency decreased primarily as a result of thermal losses to the environment and thermal degradation caused by the storage tank walls. Increasing the ratio of length to diameter up to 3 or 4 significantly increases the extraction efficiency. Storages with length-to-diameter ratios larger than 4 are not desirable because the added cost does not result in improvement of the thermal extraction efficiency. © 1989 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Solar storage; Thermal storage; Thermal stratification","Heat Transfer; Hot Water Supply Systems; Thermal Diffusion--Liquids; Static Stratification; Thermal Storage; Thermal Stratification; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024925038

We carry out the ab-initio SCF for the entire system, then transform the canonical delocalized molecular orbitals to localized orbitals and include explicitly in the MRD-CI only the localized occupied and virtual orbitals in the region of interest, folding the remainder of the occupied localized orbitals into an ""effective"" CI Hamiltonian. The advantage is that the transformations from integrals over atomic orbitals to integrals over molecular orbitals (the computer time-, computer core- and external storage-consuming part of the CI calculations) only have to be carried out for the localized orbitals included explicitly in the MRD-CI calculations. The challenge arose to extend our MRD-CI technique based on localized/local orbitals and ""effective"" CI Hamiltonian to the breaking of a chemical bond in a molecule in a crystal (or other solid environment). This past year we have derived, implemented and used successfully a procedure for doing this. Our technique involves solving a quantum chemical ab-initio SCF explicitly for a system of a reference molecule surrounded by a number of other molecules in the multipole environment of yet more further out surrounding molecules. The resulting canonical molecular orbitals are then localized and the localized occupied and virtual orbitals in the region of interest are included explicitly in the MRD-CI with the remainder of the occupied localized orbitals being folded into an ""effective"" CI Hamiltonian. The MRD-I calculations are then carried out for breaking a bond in the reference molecule. This method is completely general. The space treated explicitly quantum chemically and the surrounding space can have defects, deformations, dislocations, impurities, dopants, edges and surfaces, boundaries, etc. We have applied this procedure successfully to the H3CNO2 bond dissociation of nitromethane with extensive testing of the number of molecules that have to be included explicitly in the SCF and how many further out molecules have to be represented by multipoles. To check the goodness of the model cluster approximation for crystalline nitromethane, we carried out ab-initio crystal orbital (XTLORB) calculations using our POLY-CRYST program. The difference in the XTLORB total energies between the 4 nitromethane molecules/unit cell and the 3 nitromethane molecules/unit cell, ER = E4 - E3 = - 48.0609079 a.u., corresponds very closely to the reduced energy per nitromethane molecule, ER = - 48.06057 a.u., calculated from explicit SCF calculations on the model nitromethane cluster in the multipole field of farther out nitromethane molecules for the model cluster. Thus, the multipole approximation for describing the effect of further out molecules on the SCF cluster energies is quite good. © 1989.",,"Crystals--Calculations; Solids--Calculations; AB-Initio MRD-CI Calculations; Bond Breaking; Molecular Orbitals; Nitrocompounds; Nitromethane; Software Package Poly-Cryst; Molecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024920272

An open loop chemical reaction for generation-storage of hydrogen-the formate-bicarbonate cycle (FBC)-is proposed as an efficient energy storage-delivery system. Thermodynamics and kinetics results related to the above chemical system are presented. Yields of 98% have been attained for the cyclic transformation formate-carbonate. A preliminary techno-economic analysis demonstrates that FBC is compatible with the technical state of art and with the magnitude of financial resources involved in power plants.

We model two types of structures of GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs; first, with symmetric barriers ranging from 3 to 8 nanometers in thickness separated by a 5 nanometer well, and second with a well varying from 3 to 8 nanometers between 3 nanometer barriers. Experimental variation of the barrier thickness and height changes the peak-to-valley ratio in the I-V curve, as predicted by elementary models of tunneling structures. This stems directly from the changes in tunneling probabilities. For the DC studies, we show that the peak-to-valley ratio in the I-V curve is a function of the resonance width, which depends both on the well and barrier thickness. The location of the peak on the I-V curve depends on the location of the resonant energy, which is a function of the well width. Transient switching behavior is compared to earlier numerical studies of tunneling times of wave packets. Charge storage stabilizes the position of the resonant state, thus damping the transients. Consequently, wider barriers yield faster transient settling times, in agreement with the tunneling time results which predicted longer charge storage times for thicker barriers. © 1989.","resonant tunneling diode; Wigner function","Semiconductor Materials - Physical Properties; Resonant Tunneling Diode; Tunneling Probabilities; Tunneling Time; Wigner Function; Semiconductor Diodes, Tunnel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024914520

Sombre Lake is clear and oligotrophic with little phytoplankton and a bottom sediment low in organic content. Heywood Lake is turbid and mesotrophic; a substantial phytoplankton develops in summer and the bottom sediments are comparatively rich in organics. Both lakes freeze over for much of the year, forcing the copepods to adopt a benthic feeding strategy over winter. Adult Pseudoboeckella feed on phytoplankton when this is available, but also on detritus, diatoms and short algal filaments stirred up from the sediment. In Heywood Lake, male copepods show a smooth seasonal trend in lipid content with lipid being synthesised in early summer and utilised in late summer and winter. The summer increase in lipid content is associated with an increase in dry weight. Female lipid contents show evidence of 2 peaks of egg production. In Sombre Lake both male and female copepods increase in size during summer and show a wider range of lipid contents than in Heywood Lake, probably due to the poorer winter feeding conditions which necessitate the synthesis of a much larger store of reserves during the summer. -from Authors",,"copepod; energetics; Antarctica; Heywood Lake; Signy Island; Sombre Lake; South Orkney Islands; Pseudoboeckella poppei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024911753

Basic physical processes, detailed literature survey and current state-of-the-art on open cycle absorption cooling are described. The authors have studied the feasibility of an open cycle absorption cooling system both theoretically and experimentally. Various investigations on heat and mass transfer processes in solar regenerators and thermodynamic modelling and thermal design aspects of open cycle absorption solar cooling systems are summarized. A comparative study of open cycle absorption cooling with closed cycle absorption cooling has also been presented, and it is found that the former is better in performance, less expensive and simpler in technology. A closed cycle vapour absorption cooling system is known to be a casual alternative of conventional vapour compression systems. However, a more promising open cycle absorption cooling system (OCACS) is proved to be a better alternative for solar cooling/air conditioning applications by various researchers from the U.S.S.R., U.S.A., Australia, India and Japan. This review also highlights the importance of open cycle absorption solar cooling system possible applications, and some innovative concepts relevant to open cycle absorption cooling are also mentioned.

It has previously been shown by Davis et al. (1986) that the hydrodynamic pressure which builds up in the thin fluid layer must become large enough to elastically deform the spheres near the axis of symmetry, if they are to rebound subsequent to colliding. Under these extreme pressures, however, it is expected that the fluid may also compress and that its viscosity may increase by several orders of magnitude. It is shown that these pressure-dependent effects may significantly alter the minimum separation reached during approach of the spheres, as well as the maximum separation and relative velocity attained during rebound of the spheres. In particular, the pressure buildup during the collision process is predicted to become sufficiently large under some conditions so that the corresponding viscosity increase causes the fluid in the gap between the colliding spheres to behave nearly as a solid and to limit the close approach of the opposing surfaces. Also, the storage of energy via the compression of the fluid in the gap allows rigid spheres to bounce as this energy is released subsequent to their collision. However, it is found that this rebound is very weak relative to that which is predicted for elastic spheres. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

The transmissivity and the apparent thermal diffusivity changed their value due to the clogging of the ferric colloidal dam in the vacant of the aquifer, preventing the natural flow of groundwater around the well. 2. The clogging of the ferric colloidal dam was destroyed and washed out by back wash till 1.6 meters in diameter around charge well, but ferric colloid remained farther than 1.6 meters, improving aquifer thermal energy storage ability. 3.

Temperatures of small succulent plants, such as species in the genera Haworthia and Lithops, are highly influenced by temperatures of the surrounding soil. Indeed, the minimum and the maximum temperatures of the upper leaf epidermis of Haworthia retusa. H. turgida. Lithops leslei, and L. turbiniformis were generally within 1°C of the accompanying soil surface temperatures. An energybudget model closely predicted such soil‐to‐plant temperature differences as well as the effect of the greater convective exchange for the protruding Haworthia species compared with the Lithops species, which were flush with the soil surface. Although a lower shortwave absorptance would reduce maximum shoot temperatures, the shortwave absorptances of all four species were similar to those of the soil in their respective native habitats in South Africa. Tolerances of the four species to low and to high temperatures at three different day/night air temperatures (15°C/5°C, 30°C/20°C, and 45°C/35°C) were analysed using cellular accumulation of a vital stain, neutral red. Chlorenchyma cells were slightly more tolerant of extreme temperatures than were cells of the water‐storage parenchyma. In this regard, H. retusa survived low and high temperatures that killed the water‐storage parenchyma but not the chlorenchyma. Acclimation to low temperatures and to high temperatures, which was exhibited by all four species, led to estimated tolerances to 1 h at −16°C and 68°C. Although the low temperature tolerance is not particularly noteworthy, very few vascular plants are reportedly able to tolerate such high temperatures. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

The complete drying of rapeseed having moisture contents of 20 and 18 %(d.b.) to a safe moisture content of 11.11 %(d.b.) was achieved at depths of 1 and 2 m, respectively, with both solar and solar-natural air drying at all the harvesting dates in all the years studied, except for the rapeseed harvested on 10 February 1974. Both total and actual drying times are increased with increasing depth and initial moisture content. The study of drying parameter profiles has shown that a faster and more complete drying is observed using solar-natural air drying. This is also reflected in the width of drying front being greater when solar-natural drying than when using solar drying alone. The solar-natural air drying regime appears to be superior to that of solar drying alone in respect of the required total drying time and in achieving complete drying within the safe storage time.

The amount of mass to employ has been a subject of debate. Existing passive solar design manuals in the United States give recommendations for the amount of mass to employ in different building types, and establish optimum levels for different designs. However, an evaluation of the maximum benefits of building mass on energy consumption has not been performed. In this paper, two limits for the effect of building mass on energy consumption are formulated. The limit for maximum energy consumption is based on there being no mass available in the building for energy storage. The limit for minimum energy consumption is based on there being sufficient mass present to allow excess energy gains to be used at any time during the time period of interest. These limits allow the maximum economic benefit of building mass to be determined. Examples of the application of these limits are presented. © 1989.",,"Buildings--Space Heating; Solar Energy--Energy Storage; Building Mass; Energy Consumption; Excess Energy Gains; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024876028

The life-cycle cost model compares hydrogen vehicles to similar baseline gasoline vehicles, and includes estimates of the total retail cost of liquid and gaseous hydrogen from coal and solar-powered electrolysis, the cost of fuel storage equipment, the cost of pollution control equipment, maintenance costs, other ownership and operating costs, and the external costs of hydrogen use. While there is considerable uncertaintly about several important parameters, I conclude that under certain plausible (though not necessarily likely) conditions-low hydrogen fuel and vehicle costs, high nonmarket costs of gasoline use, and moderately strong efforts to avoid a Greenhouse warming-hydrogen vehicles could be the socially preferred highway transportation option. © 1989.",,"Hydrogen Fuels--Storage; Clean Energy; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrogen Vehicles; Liquid Hydrogen; Refueling; Automotive Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024866731

Its storage and transportation is handled in various ways. Liquid hydrogen is usually stored in standard storage tanks at many industrial sites. A storage tank, otherwise safe, can explode due to a fast process of vaporizing the liquid hydrogen and thus over-pressurizing the storage tank to the point of rupture. The vaporization of liquid hydrogen faster than desired can be caused by a good thermal link between the inner container and the outer jacket of the storage tank. The amount of heat and the heat flux needed to vaporize the amount of liquid hydrogen to produce the required amount of rupture pressure of the inner container and outer jacket can be predicted from the specifications of the storage tank. A theoretical model for these predictions will be presented with appropriate assumptions made and detailed calculations. A case study of liquid hydrogen explosion will be discussed for illustration.

Muscle strips obtained from rectus abdominus during elective abdominal surgery were clamped at resting length, and adenosine triphosphate/total adenosine nucleotide ratios remained constant for 3 hours ex vivo. Leakage of enzyme markers of muscle damage was minimal, and electron microscopy showed preserved myofibril ultrastructure. Insulin stimulation brought about a dose-dependent increase in rates of glycogen synthesis with a half-maximal effect at 9 × 10-10 mol/L insulin. In 15 consecutive studies, basal rates of glycogen synthesis were 4.1 ± 0.5, 3.2 ± 0.7, and 3.0 ± 0.3 nmol glucose/25 mg/h in the absence of palmitate, with 1.4 mmol/L and 2.8 mmol/L palmitate, respectively. Insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis were 8.6 ± 1.2, 6.0 ± 1.8, and 5.8 ± 0.8 nmol glucose/25 mg/h. Thus, increasing fatty acid concentrations decreased rates of glycogen synthesis both basally and with insulin stimulation. The insulin signal itself was not affected as the percentage stimulation over basal rates remained approximately constant in the presence or absence of fatty acid (2.1-, 1.9- and 1.9-fold, respectively). Insulin sensitivity in vivo is usually expressed as absolute rates of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, and if plasma fatty acid elevation were to be studied in vivo an erroneous conclusion may be reached of resistance to hormone action per se. These observations show that increased fatty acid availability brings about decreased rates of glucose storage in human muscle, not solely decreased rates of glucose oxidation as previously hypothesized. The precise mechanism underlying this metabolic interaction requires further study. Therapeutic manipulation of fatty acid metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is likely to modulate overall rates of glucose disposal. © 1989.",,"fatty acid; glycogen; insulin; palmitic acid; radioisotope; adult; article; female; glucose utilization; human cell; male; metabolism; normal human; priority journal; skeletal muscle; Adult; Aged; Creatine Kinase; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucose; Glycogen; Human; In Vitro; Insulin; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Middle Age; Muscles; Palmitates; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024851469

The computed amounts of zonal mean and transient eddy available potential energy and the amount of kinetic energy present in the oceans are found to be much smaller (at least 1 order of magnitude) than those in the atmosphere.

Heat storage and the rate of heat storage change are calculated for the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Heat transports on a monthly basis are calculated using surface energy flux data from a previous study together with the computed heat storage change. There is a large annual cycle in heat storage change at almost all latitudes with the largest amplitude in latitudes where the western boundary currents dominate. There is also a considerable annual cycle in the heat transport estimates. The heat transport in the Atlantic is northward most of the year except in January when there is significant southward transport. The largest northward transport is found at 5°N during March with a magnitude of about 2.0PW (1 PW =1015W). In the Pacific Ocean, northward transport dominates north of 20°N with a maximum of about 1.5PW at 25°N in July‐September. South of 20°N, there is significant southward transport in July through September with a maximum of 1.5PW at 10°S in August. Overall, the largest northward transport in the Pacific is about 2.1 PW in March at 10°N. Heat transport in the Indian Ocean is mostly southward with a maximum of about 2.5 PW in May at 20°S except for a small northward transport in January‐February north of 5°S. Although the uncertainties involved with the transport estimates are large, the transport values presented here compare rather well with direct estimates and with model results.

To begin with, there is at present no coherent model that accounts, through the process of partial phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of enzymes or other proteins, for all of the manifold actions of insulin on cells. It is known that insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose most effectively in fat cells in which mitochondria are close to the plasma membrane. Also, much evidence has accumulated to show that insulin reverses the net catabolism of protein, glycogen, and fat and promotes their build up and storage. Furthermore, insulin stimulates the incorporation into protein of primarily those pyruvate carbons that are converted to glutamic acid through the Krebs cycle. Insulin has a far greater stimulatory effect on the incorporation into protein of the methylene carbons of succinate than the carboxyl carbons. This can be attributed to the fact that carbons 2 and 3 of succinate either reenter the cycle as acetyl-CoA or remain in the mitochondrial Krebs cycle for a second or third opportunity to be converted to glutamate by the transamination of α-KG. © 1989 ACADEMIC PRESS, INC.",,"carbon dioxide; glucose; glycogen; hexokinase; insulin; protein; adipose tissue; animal; biological model; biosynthesis; citric acid cycle; energy metabolism; metabolism; mitochondrion; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; rabbit; rat; review; transport at the cellular level; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biological Transport; Carbon Dioxide; Citric Acid Cycle; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen; Hexokinase; Insulin; Mitochondria; Models, Biological; Oxidation-Reduction; Proteins; Rabbits; Rats",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024821546

The hypothesis holds that dissipative and elastic processes within lung tissue are coupled at the level of the stress-bearing element. Such a description leads naturally to consideration of a readily measured attribute of organ-level dissipative behavior called lung tissue hysteresivity, η. On preliminary analysis this attribute is found to be nearly frequency independent and numerically conserved across species. To the degree that the numeric value of η might be conserved during an intervention in which tissue dynamic elastance changes, such behavior would be consistent with the notion that elastic energy storage and dissipative energy loss reside within the very same stress-bearing element and, moreover, that those processes within the stress-bearing element bear an approximately fixed relationship. Tissue hysteresivity is closely related to the parameter K used by Bachofen and Hildebrandt (J. Appl. Physiol. 30: 493-497, 1971) to describe energy dissipation per cycle, and both lend themselves directly to interpretation based on processes ongoing at the levels of microstructure and molecule. Intraparenchymal connective tissues, surface film, and contractile elements appear to submit individually to this description and, in doing so, yield respective hysteresivities that are relatively well matched; this suggests that such hysteretic matching may be a necessary condition for synchronous expansion of the alveolar duct. The overriding simplicity with which this description organizes diverse observations implies that it may capture some unifying attribute of underlying mechanism.","Dissipation; Elastance; Hysteresis; Resistance; Structural damping","article; lung compliance; lung mechanics; priority journal; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024807197

The energy released as the flywheel velocity (FV) decreases during the course of a Wingate test is used to accomplish mechanical work. The subject should not be 'credited' with this work since the energy storage occurred prior to the start of the 30-s test. The total KE (ke(total) in the flywheel of a Monark ergometer was determined using the formula KE(total) = 1/2 Iω2. The KE available to do work (KE(work)) was measured by loading the ergometer with 1 Kp (9.8 N), spinning it at predetermined rates, and observing the number of revolutions completed as it coasted to a stop. The difference between KE(total) and KE(work) was attributable to friction. The mechanical power supplied by the flywheel in any 5-s period of the Wingate test was found to be: Flywheel power (W) = ·00185 (FVstart2 -FV(end)2)/5s, where FV is expressed in rpm. This indicates that Wingate test scores should be corrected by subtracting the flywheel power output from the total power output. The correction lowers peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and fatigue index (% fatigue) by 6.2%, 3.0%, and 6.6% in active male subjects (P &lt; 0.05).",,"adult; article; bicycle ergometry; ergometer; exercise; human; human experiment; male; normal human; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024801256

There are major additions to the neuroanatomic basis for control of insulin secretion in response to nutrient intake. It is recognized that brain peptides act as both stimulators and inhibitors of feeding. The response of the autonomic nervous system to food intake and deprivation and the role this plays in the regulation of obesity is reviewed. The adrenalectomy is known to attenuate the development of all types of experimental obesity. The regulation of body fat stores and the development of obesity are viewed as problems of disturbed nutrient ingestion, disturbed energy expenditure, and disturbed internal balancing of these two processes. The models of experimental obesity provide insight into the control systems regulating body nutrient stores in humans.

The scheme proved to be stable and second-order accurate spatially and temporally. Comparisons are made with experimental data. A modification is carried out on the model to incorporate actual turbulence mixing that occurs in the inflow region of any storage tank due to the effect of the diffuser design. A proper spatially dependent diffusion term is added to modify the energy model to account for turbulent mixing. The predictions are in agreement with experimental data. The effect of inter-mixing on the reduction of storage tank efficiency has been evaluated. The complete model can be used in applications that involve a component for energy storage, such as in solar energy systems and in air-conditioning systems with load management. © 1989.",,"Heating--Solar; Solar Energy; Temperature Distribution--Mathematical Models; Liquid Stratification; Thermal Storage Tanks; Tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024776657

Utilization of natural heating and cooling systems which essentially consist of collection, storage, distribution, and control of thermal energy flow can save 2.35% of the world energy requirement. The basic methods of heating and cooling of buildings are: solar radiation, out-going longwave radiation, water evaporation, and nocturnal radiation cooling. Trombe-Michel wall consists of large concrete mass, exposed to sunlight through large, south facing windows, is used for heating the buildings. Solar absorption cooling and solar dehumidification and evaporative cooling are two approaches which utilizes solar energy for generation of working fluid and cooling the dwellings. Longwave radiations emitted by the surface of the earth to the atmosphere and outer space is very strong in a desert climate and is effective from a roof surface. Water evaporation by desert coolers is the method of cooling in arid regions. Nocturnal radiation both heats in winter and cools in summer, in suitable climates, and does so with no non-renewable energy other than a negligible amount required to move the insulation twice a day. The difficulty encountered in the utilization of natural energies is the large area exposed with suitable orientation for collection of energy and large space requirement for the storage of thermal energy. This paper reviews these passive systems for natural heating and cooling of buildings. © 1989.",,"Humidity Control; Solar Energy--Energy Storage; Natural Cooling; Natural Heating; Trombe-Michel Wall; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024774403

This paper presents a method to augment the transient stability by using a superconducting magnetic energy storage system. A conventional Graetz bridge converter provides an ideal interface between the three-phase power system and the superconducting coil. This makes power exchange in the superconducting coil fast and controllable. With appropriate gating to the thyristors of the converter, power can be drawn and stored in the magnetic field or vice versa. A mathematical model for the superconducting magnetic energy storage coil with a converter interface is presented. The developed model is integrated with an AC power system by using diakoptical techniques. Two types of control schemes with the generator rotor speed deviation as an input signal to the controllers have been studied on three different power systems. Finally, a comparative study between the dynamic shunt braking resistor method and the superconducting magnetic energy storage method was carried out on a 4-generator, 6-bus system. The computer simulation results reveal that the transient stability enhancement with the superconducting coil is superior to that of the dynamic braking resistor. © 1989.",,"Electric Networks - Stability; Electric Power Plants - Energy Storage; Energy Storage - Mathematical Models; Superconducting Magnets - Applications; System Stability - Computer Simulation; Graetz Bridge Converter; Superconducting Coil Application; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES); Thyristor Controlled Reversible Converter; Transient Stability Enhancement; Electric Power Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024771517

The alkaline nature of concrete makes it unsuitable for use with many PCM's so the choice of an appropriate impregnant is important. Three PCM's were selected and tested: butyl stearate, dodecanol and polyethylene glycol 600. All three were found to be compatible with autoclaved concrete block which as a low alkalinity.

Such devices require solution of serious storage, phasing, and distribution problems and usually must be of large scale for satisfactory economy. Alternatively, an ocean wave energy system under development since 1976 directly links ocean wave power with the production of freshwater from seawater using reverse osmosis (RO) technology. The device, referred to as DELBOUY, utilizes no motors, generators or electronics and makes extensive use of engineering polymers for constructing major system components. The DELBUOY combines with a wave driven buoy, linear pump and an anchor system with well-proven single-pass seawater RO membranes to produce potable water. The systems are modular in nature, allowing arrays to be sized to suit specific site requirements, from as little as 6 m3/D. Unlike many of the other wave energy devices currently under development, the DELBUOY is an economic alternative to conventional desalination systems in wave fields as small as one meter. The DELBUOY system is especially useful in areas that are remote, have insufficient or unreliable power supplies or have high power costs. The research and development of the device, performed at the University of Delaware, USA, encompassed wave tank testing, mathematical modelling, materials testing and system sea trials. Starting in 1985 the commercialization of the DELBUOY was undertaken by ISTI Delaware, Inc. Since that time the system has undergone production engineering, supported by five full-scale sea trials and commercial installations. Operating experience obtained to date indicate that with only a five year amortization period, the DELBUOY system is an economic alternative to conventionally powered desalination systems in areas where power costs are high. This paper describes the system's design and operating principle, sea trial results, site selection and deployment considerations, the economics of direct wave-powered desalination, and the commercial status of the technology. © 1989.",,"Economics; Osmosis, Reverse; Water Waves--Wave Energy Conversion; Delbuoy Device; Kvaerner-Brug Prototype; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024770485

Five families of intercalates give high electrical conductivity to GIC's: Pentafluorides leading to high conductivity, 108 S/m (higher than metallic copper); metal chlorides; fluorine and alkali metals with bismuth giving relatively high conductivity of the order of 107 S/m plus stability in air; and residual halogens showing extremely high stability under severe conditions, though the conductivity is only of the order of 106 S/m. Electrodes of different GIC's have been tried in primary and secondary batteries, where their characteristics are high electrical conductivity and easy diffusion of electrochemically active species between the graphite layers. Primary lithium batteries of a covalent graphite fluoride are now widely used commercially. Secondary batteries using different host graphites and intercalates give interesting results. Large amounts of hydrogen can be stored in the functional space in alkali metal-GIC's. The same GIC's show high coefficients of isotope separation of hydrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature. The structure and texture of the host graphite play a decisive role in the absorption and separation behaviors of GIC's. Exfoliated graphite prepared by rapid heating of GIC's or their residue compounds leads to flexible graphite sheets which have great industrial applications.

The potential energy cost savings are substantial. In some U.S. locales (e.g., within the districts served by Oklahoma Gas and Electric, Arkansas Power and Light, and Wisconsin Electric Power), the difference between the peak and off-peak energy charges are >$0.100/kWh. This savings potential is the primary driving force for developing cool-storage systems for residential applications. This study establishes the current cost and performance requirements that make residential cool-storage technologies economically competitive with conventional residential air-conditioning systems. The results are based on the characteristics of conventional air-conditioning equipment and residential TOD rate structures existing during 1986-1987. Initial capital cost and annual coefficient of performance requirements for cool-storage systems were calculated for three U.S. cities with different climates and utility-rate structures.

Conduction and convection heat-transfer modes in the axial direction together with conduction in the radial direction were neglected, since these were considered to be small in comparison with the axial conduction and convection diffusion terms, which in turn were considered small relative to the energy stored. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental prediction was verified. The radial direction temperature dependency disappeared for axial lengths greater than one quarter of the tank depth for most practical operating conditions especially for low inflow velocities and low inlet to outlet temperature ratios. The axial conduction term in the governing equation can be dropped out for inflow velocities greater than a certain critical value without distorting the theoretical consequences.

Subsurface damage was determined on silicon wafers using modulated optical reflectance (MOR) measurements. The chemical state of silicon wafers prepared by different cleaning procedures was characterized by X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements. It is shown that chemo-mechanical polishing and subsequent epitaxy produce very smooth surfaces. The existence of atomic steps is proved by electron and photon diffraction. During semiconductor device processing steps (see fig. 1), however, the smoothness of the polished surface deteriorates in most cases again. It is demonstrated that thermal oxidation of silicon leads to pronounced roughness at the SiSiO2 interface. This roughening depends on the virgin silicon surface morphology and its chemical state due to different cleaning procedures, on ulk properties, on storage time prior to oxidation, and on the parameter of oxidation. The extent of the roughness increase may be used to monitor the process performance. Besides the influence of the interfacial structure on mobility, interface states, and fixed oxide charges the impact of interface degradation on the dielectric breakdown behaviour will be demonstrated. By plasma treatments and oxidation on purpose roughened Si wafers the determination of a threshold in terms of interface degradation is made possible. Beyond this limit the dielectric breakdown field will be affected severely. © 1989.",,"Silica--Electric Properties; Surfaces--Morphology; Dielectric Breakdown; Dynamic Random Access Memory; Gate Oxides; Semiconducting Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024754783

Both intrinsic and parasitic effects have been studied, and their relationship to the design of the device is discussed. For conventional dopings and high current densities, the heterojunction grading potential causes a barrier in the base-emitter junction, which results in a large increase in the dynamic resistance. In heterojunction collectors, a similar barrier leads to a large increase in base charge storage and to spreading of collector current. It is shown that increased doping levels can successfully suppress these barrier effects. The capacitance and transport phenomena at the base-emitter junction are also analyzed under conditions of large forward bias, where the junction space-charge region is shorter than the alloy grading length. Recombination is analyzed in the limit of high surface recombination velocities using Shock-ley-Read-Hall theory in the presence of Fermi-level pinning due to surface states. The pinning results in a potential energy saddle point, at the edge of the base-emitter junction, which largely determines the surface recombination behavior of the transistor when the recombination velocity is high. The characteristics of this behavior are found to agree with the experimentally observed recombination behavior of conventional devices. Finally, the design and scaling of heterojunction bipolars is discussed in the light of these results. © 1989 IEEE",,"Electric Space Charge; Semiconducting Gallium Arsenide; Current Densities; Heterostructure Bipolar Transistors; Parasitic Effects; Recombination Effects; Transistors, Bipolar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024754238

A peaking storage tank is used for storing water that is pumped from wells or other sources of supply during off‐peak periods when energy costs are less for use during periods of on‐peak water demand. The optimal size of a peaking storage tank is that which results in the minimum total cost, which includes both the storage construction cost and the cost of operation of the pumps. The operational cost for a given time‐of‐use rate is determined by help of a pipe network simulation model solved by the Newton‐Raphson technique and a dynamic programming optimization model. A more simplified method is also introduced. Analyses show that low off‐peak energy costs make the construction of peaking storage tanks economically attractive and reduce on‐peak energy use, which results in electrical load leveling.

A recent application where quasilinear theory has been successfully applied concerns the study of lower hybrid current drive, i.e., the description of the mechanisms by which a steady current can be maintained in thermonuclear plasmas by injecting electromagnetic waves from the exterior with no assist of any applied ohmic voltage or even in opposition to it. In this paper we describe the main features associated with the implementation of the quasilinear model of lower hybrid current drive into a numberical code. Our study is based on ADLER, a finite element code designed to solve the quasilinear equations in two dimensions in velocity and wave number space. Special attention is paid to the algebraic solver, which was found to be the computationally most intensive section of the code. In particular we have compared the direct Gauss elimination technique with a series of vectorized iterative solvers developed at ECSEC. This comparison shows that the iterative solvers do perform successfully and, apart from the obvious savings of storage, they also prove advantageous from the viewpoint of CPU costs especially when the grid resolution is augmented. Finally, some new application of ADLER in the domain of unsteady lower hybrid current drive are presented. A good qualitative agreement with the experimental result is found, showing once more that quasilinear theory is an appropriate tool for the description of the current drive physics. © 1989.",,"Mathematical Techniques--Finite Element Method; Nuclear Energy--Fusion Reactions; Algebraic Solver; Quasilinear Theory; Weak Plasma Turbulence; Plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024752679

Such controls are affected by hormonal and neural mediators, often interacting both at peripheral and central sites. The role of the autonomic nervous system in regard to these functions has been widely investigated in vitro and in vivo in animals and man. The effects of classical sensory or motor components of the nervous system on adipose tissue are less clearly established. For example, pain is a feature of many disorders of fat tissue and the possible role of the autonomic nervous system versus sensory nerves in mediating pain must be considered. The sensory nervous system has been believed to be of little importance to adipose tissue, but the recent finding of sensory nerves within adipose tissue raises issues of interest to dermatologists. In addition to a potential role in pain sensation, neuropeptides released by antidromic stimulation of sensory nerves have been shown to have an important role in cutaneous inflammation, and it is possible that they might also initiate or perpetuate inflammation within adipose tissue. The autonomic nervous system may also play a trophic role in maintaining adipose tissue. In conditions such as scleroderma where autonomic control is deranged, there are profound changes in the subcutaneous tissues. Factors that predispose individuals to local or generalized hypertrophy of adipose tissue are still poorly defined, but there is evidence that the autonomic nervous system may not be functioning fully in obese subjects, either as a primary or secondary phenomenon. The finding that many peptide hormones known to exist within the gastrointestinal tract also act as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system raises the possibility that these hormones may regulate appetite and satiety. © 1989.",,"adipose tissue; adiposis dolorosa; adrenergic system; animal; brown adipose tissue; human; innervation; metabolism; obesity; panniculitis; pathophysiology; physiology; review; vascularization; Adipose Tissue; Adiposis Dolorosa; Animal; Brown Fat; Human; Obesity; Panniculitis; Sympathetic Nervous System",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024747276

Heat production in response to cold, known as cold-induced thermogenesis, is maximal in newborns who at 24 °C increase their thermometabolic ratio by 60-80%.1 Though less in adults, it can be shown to occur in men,2-4 and in normal young women.5 Some obese subjects exposed to an environmental temperature of 20 °C for 2 hours show a fall in core temperature.6,7 It is now well established that lean persons are more efficient heat producers.8 The presence of brown fat is an explanation for the increased response to cold in some individuals, while clothing, housing, and sophisticated heating techniques make heat production by the adipose tissue an unnecessary or an unrequired response to cold in others. Poverty, disease, and accidents do nevertheless expose men to cold environments. Foreign travel makes all of us aware that some degree of adaption occurs seasonally, so that if we arrive in a cooler environment unprepared, we feel disproportionately cold. Immersion in cold water largely eliminates the value of external thermal insulation such as clothing. Such exposure causes vasocontriction in the presence of which most insulation depends on subcutaneous fat in the area of the trunk and on fat and muscle in the limbs. At 12 °C, fat people can maintain core temperature, while at 25-29 °C some thin people cool progressively. A relative increase in surface area to size makes children do badly in cold water.9. In addition to its role in heat production, subcutaneous adipose tissue also forms an insulating barrier around the shell of the body and is therefore an important means of regulating heat loss. As an organ of substrate storage, heat production and heat conservation adipose tissue plays a major role in body temperature regulation. © 1989.",,"adipose tissue; cold; functions of the skin and its appendages; human; physiology; review; thermoregulation; ultrastructure; Adipose Tissue; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold; Human; Skin Physiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024746535

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 10598, United States","Films of CoPd with weak perpendicular anisotropy have been shown to exchange couple to square loop TbCo films on both the Tb and Co sides of compensation. The exchange is sensitive to reactive impurities at the interface and is broken under conditions that produce as little as one monolayer of paramagnetic compound. Even when the coupling at the interface is strong, we show that only a limited thickness of the CoPd layer is spin oriented perpendicular. Many materials with high magnetooptic rotation are not suitable as a storage medium because they do not have perpendicular anisotropy, high coercivity and good square loop properties. By exchange coupling such a low anisotropy but high MO rotation material, the read-out layer (RO), to an appropriate storage layer (ST) it may be possible to obtain stable storage bits in the exchange coupled system with improved carrier to noise ratios (CNR). It has been shown that in the system Nd(FeCo)/Tb(FeCo) that exchange coupling can produce films with high rotation and good square loop properties1. Furthermore, this system has been shown to follow the model of Kobayashi et al2 with respect to the thickness dependence of the switching field1. One of the assumptions of the model is that there is a wall at the interface between the layers when any subnetwork moments are opposing across the interface. This wall energy tends to prevent the subnetworks from aligning in opposition. The interlayer wall energy, σwcan be expected to depend on the exchange stiffness (A) and the anisotropy energy (Ku) as for an ordinary Bloch wall, σw = AKu. In the CoPd/TbCo system, the wall energy is expected to be lower in the CoPd layer because of its relatively low anisotropy energy. The anisotropy depends somewhat on deposition conditions and microstructure as with many Co alloys3,4. Since the wall energy is lower in the CoPd layer we can expect the wall to form in this layer. Also the wall width is given by δ= A/Ku so we can expect the wall to be wider in the CoPd than in the previously studied high anisotropy RETM alloys. CoPd is of interest for short wavelength MO applications because it has been shown to have a broad peak in Kerr rotation at 450 nn5. In many respects, the CoPd/TbCo system can be considered as a model for the study of exchange coupling. Because of its low anisotropy it is similar to the more technologically interesting system of PtMnSb/ThFe6. The CoPd/TbCo system however is easily prepared in a three source evaporator by sequential deposition of the binary alloys onto room temperature substrates. We have studied CoPd films coupled to TbCo films on both sides of compensation. We have also studied the effects of deposition sequence on the strength of the coupling. © 1989 IEEE",,"Data Storage, Optical; Magnetooptical Devices; Faraday Rotation; Magnetooptic Recording; Magnetooptic Storage Films; Paramagnetic Compound; Perpendicular Anisotropy; Data Storage, Magnetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024739662

Both were demonstrated in special single-layer magneto-optical media with a compensation point of 125-130oC and a Curie temperature of about 310oC. One of these methods uses two laser beams at different power levels. The first laser beam is set at a low power level which is adequate for erasure, but not for writing. This is possible since the laser energy required for erasure of written domains does not overlap with that for writing. The second beam can then be fired at a higher pulse power required for writing to put in the new data. The second method uses only a single laser beam. Since the pulse energy required to erase data is less than that required to write new data, a single beam, in which the pulse energy of the laser is modulated between a low level for erasure of previously written domains and a higher level for writing of new domains, may be used to directly overwrite old data. Both methods have been experimentally demonstrated for variable-length domains so that the use of pulse width modulation codes is possible. Scanning speeds as high as 15 m/sec have been demonstrated. © 1989 IEEE",,"Laser Beams; Magnetooptical Devices; Pulse Width Modulation; Direct Overwrite; Magnetooptic Recording; Written Domains; Data Storage, Magnetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024738129

(1) Such HPG's have been used for many years as power supplies for research in pulsed processing of metal alloy components and systems. Most of these processes rely on extremely rapid thermal excursions in the workpiece(s) caused by resistive heating during the current pulse. A new application of pulsed HPG's that carries great promise is homopolar pulse consolidation (HPC) of powder metal alloys or components.(2) In HPC, powder metal constituents are loaded into a thermally and electrically insulated die, then precompacted to an initial pressure. the ""rams"" of the compaction press are also the electrodes for homopolar discharge current. While in single residency, the powder compact is heated uniformly by HPG discharge current, sintering occurs, and consolidation is accomplished by hydraulic control of the consolidation press. The process is completed in approximately one sec, with unaided cooling to room temperature on the order of 100 sec, depending on compact mass. Microstructural control is closely tied to beginning particle size and distribution. Traditionally unsinterable alloys have been consolidated using HPC. Novel intermetallic alloys and phases have been produced. Cermets and other composites can be produced, as long as the continuous matrix is conductive. New tooling designs allow for controlled atmospheres, near-net shapes, and automated manufacturing. © 1989.",,"Composite Materials--Sintering; Intermetallics--Sintering; Homopolar Pulse Consolidation; Pulsed Homopolar Generator Discharge; Single Residency Sintering; Powder Metal Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024733590

The flat band voltage shifts measured from high frequency capacitance versus voltage curves of these devices were used to study the accumulation of charge in the off-stoichiometric SiO2 layer induced by applied voltage pulses. The width of these pulses was in the range of 10 ms to 100 μs and the amplitude was in the range of 0 to 80 volts. The role of the SiO2 layer in the (B) type structures is to inhibit or reduce charge injection to or from the Si substrate at low applied voltage amplitudes. This effect originates initial shifts of the flat band voltage of opposite polarity to those observed in the case of (A) type structures. The relaxation of the stored charges was monitored by measuring the shifts of the flat band voltage as a function of time when both electrical contacts were connected to ground potential. © 1989, Materials Research Society.

The relations are quasi-linear up to a current density of a few Acm−2. The limiting current continues for a few volts to a few hundred volts, depending on the metal. A glow develops at the electrode and becomes continuous at the end of the plateau, where the current density increases irregularly (breakdown). The breakdown potential does not depend on the field in the water. It occurs at about the same current density for most of the metals. When electrolytes are added, the cell potential at the breakdown is decreased. Adsorbed layers and organic coatings increase the breakdown potential. Electrical energy storage in water is increased by ~10 times by coatings. The breakdown potential decreases with increase of log of rate constant for hydrogen evolution on the various electrodes and with the corresponding work function. The cell potentials for breakdown correspond to fields in the dielectric below that needed to dissociate it. The limiting current is caused by the formation of a H2-steam layer at the interface, which causes increase in the electrode potential at constant current. The H2-steam layer plasmolyzes. When the Fermi level in the cathode reaches the conduction band of water, electrons enter the water and remain stable therein. They interact nonadiabatically with water and are the head of streamers. An analogous model holds for holes in the valence band. “Dielectric breakdown” depends on the Fermi level of the electrons in the condenser plate and the semiconductor characteristics of water. It can be eliminated by modifying the electrode surface. © 1989, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The viabilities and fecundities of these same lines were determined by a segregation test using the SM5 balancer chromosome. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences among lines in quantities of stored triacylglycerols and glycogen, as well as in activities of the assayed enzymes. Significant broad-sense genetic correlations were detected for a number of enzyme pairs.

In the storage and release processes, water changes phase between liquid and solid, and the working medium circulates naturally with phase changes between vapor and liquid.

There are numerous applications, both military and commercial. These include: energy storage devices, pulsed power transformers, and electromagnetic launchers. The time scales of interest may range from a magnetic field pulse of a microsecond in an electromagnetic launcher, to hundreds of seconds in an energy storage magnet. The problem can be dominated by either the magnetic field or heat diffusion, depending on the temperature and the material properties of the conductor. In general, heat diffuses much more rapidly in high electrical conductivity materials at cryogenic temperatures. The magnetic field takes longer to diffuse, since screening currents can be rapidly set up which shield the interior of the material from further magnetic field penetration. Conversely, in high resistivity materials, the magnetic field diffuses much more rapidly. A coupled two-dimensional thermal/magnetic model has been developed using the General Dynamics “Thermal Analyzer” code.1The results of this model, showing the time and spatial variation of the magnetic field and temperature. will be discussed for the projectile of an electromagnetic launcher. © 1989 IEEE",,"Electric Conductors; Electric Transformers; Magnets; Rocket Engines--Electromagnetic Propulsion; Rockets and Missiles--Launching; Electromagnetic Launchers; External Fields; Large Magnet; Magnetic Field Pulse; Magnetic/Thermal Model; Power Transformers; Magnetic Fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024704121

Two models of flow, hydrodynamically fully developed and developing, of the HTF were proposed in this study. A two-dimensional enthalpy method was used for the computation of the phase change heat transfer in the PCM. A fully implicit finite-difference scheme was utilized for the calculation of convective heat transfer in the HTF. The unknown time-dependent boundary condition between the HTF and the PCM was found iteratively. The predictions were substantiated by their fair agreement with experimental data. Factors affecting the heat-transfer rates between the HTF and the PCM were studied numerically for both the hydrodynamically fully developed and developing flows. It was found that the Nusselt number is significantly increased by the developing temperature profiles. The developing velocity profiles also increased the Nusselt number. However, the influence on Nusselt number due to the developing velocity profiles was less significant than that due to the developing temperature profiles. Other factors affecting the Nusselt number are discussed.

Negative and positive charging of the free SiO2-surface was performed by means of liquid-contact, corona, and electron-beam methods. Partially penetrating electrons have been used to charge the volume of 2.5 µm thick SiO2 layers. The good charge stability of negatively charged SiO2 is demonstrated in isothermal measurements at room temperature and at 350°C as well as in TSD experiments. In the isothermal measurements, positively charged samples showed a somewhat faster decay than negatively charged ones. The decay curves of negatively charged samples at elevated temperature, can be interpreted with a simple theory based on carrier drift and compensation by conductivity. In the measured TSD spectra the differences between differently charged samples are: The main peak of a positively charged sample appears at a much lower temperatures than the peak of a negatively charged one. Samples positively charged with the corona or liquid contact method also show lower peak temperatures than samples positively charged with the electron beam method. In addition the TSD spectrum of a 2.5 µm thick volume-charged sample is significantly broadened and has no clear peaks. Finally the Initial Rise Method is applied to some characteristic TSD peaks in order to estimate activation energies. © 1989 IEEE",,"Electrostatics--Electric Charge; Semiconducting Silicon--Coatings; Silica--Electric Properties; Charge Decay; Charge Stability; Charge Storage; Silicon Wafers; Electrets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024685761

Phase change materials have previously been successfully impregnated in gypsum wallboard. During the present research, certain aggregate and filler materials were selected after detailed laboratory study as possible constituents of the proposed composite. Absorption of PCM and retention there-of in materials like expanded shale, volcanic rock, activated charcoal, gypsum and vermiculite was determined. Composite specimens were prepared using coarse aggregates, gypsum, cement, sawdust and vermiculite and sand with water. Several mix compositions with different proportions of these materials were prepared. These gypsum/cement concrete specimens were cured, dried and impregnated with PCM. The absorption capacities of PCM in the specimens were determined and compressive strength tests, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, infrared spectroscopy and thermal conductivity tests performed. The composite, depending on the mix composition, is capable of storing up to 30 wt% of PCM. In order to ensure complete encapsulation of PCM, the composite specimens were coated with a film of polyester resin. This, however, resulted in lowering of the heat transfer capability of the composite. Thermal conductivity tests showed great improvement on introduction of aluminum or lignin powders in the resin. The composite can be produced in the form of floor, wall or ceiling tiles capable of storing energy up to 766 kJ/m2. © 1989.",,"Acids--Organic; Composite Materials--Nonmetallic Matrix Composites; Esters--Phase Transitions; Gypsum; Solar Energy--Storage; Butyl Stearate; Emery 2325; Organic Phase-Change Material; Palmitic Acid; Sawdust; Vermiculite; Tile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024683904

Chips have been collected and studied under the Scanning Electron Microscope and specific grinding energy values compared. An important difference between chips from ductile and brittle workpieces is that long ribbon-like chips tend to form with ductile materials but small powder-like particles with hard brittle materials such as ceramics. At high removal rates there tends to be a chip storage problem relative to forces and energy required, particularly with metal or resin-bonded superabrasive (diamond or cubic BN) wheels. An important consequence of this difference in chip types for ductile and brittle materials is that brittle materials tend to exhibit a smaller chip storage problem than ductile materials and hence allow a greater removal rate for the same available chip storage volume between bond and work. © 1989.",,"Abrasives--Materials; Microscopic Examination--Scanning Electron Microscopy; Brittle Material Grinding; Dry Surface Grinding; Ductile Material Grinding; Grinding Chip Accommodation; Grinding Chip Microscopy; Grinding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024680822

In the nonindustrial arena, numerous programs have evolved, each intending to harness some of this promise in hopes of solving some particular application need. Most of these efforts are government-sponsored, aimed at the development of systems for fighting fires, handling ammunition, transporting materials, conducting underwater search and inspection operations, and patrolling warehouses and storage areas, to name but a few. Many of the resulting prototypes, which were initially perceived as logical extensions of the traditional industrial robotic scenarios, have met with unexpected difficulty due to an insufficient supporting technology base. One such problem area common to many of these efforts arises from the need of a mobile system to interact with the physical objects and entities in its environment. The platform must be able to navigate from a known position to a desired new location and orientation, at the same time avoiding any contact with fixed or moving objects while enroute. There has been quite a tendency in many cases to oversimplify these issues, and assume that the natural growth of technology will provide the needed solutions. While this ultimately will come to pass, it is important to pace the development of the platform with a parallel development of the needed collision avoidance and navigation technology. Fundamental in this regard are the required sensors with which to acquire high resolution data describing the robot's physical surroundings, in a timely yet practical fashion in keeping with the limited onboard energy and computational resources of a mobile vehicle. This document is intended to provide some basic background on the various noncontact distance measurement techniques available, with related discussion of their implementation in the acoustical, optical, and electromagnetic portions of the energy spectrum.

To our best knowledge, our measurement sensitivity is more than an order of magnitude better than prior art, and is adequate for measuring magnetostriction smaller than 10-7 in magnitude for a film as thin as 30 nm on a glass wafer of thickness 20 μm. To make a measurement, the sample wafer in the form of a rectangle is clamped near an edge, and a rotating magnetic field of constant amplitude (sufficient to saturate the film) is applied to the film in its plane; this rotating field causes the film to expand/contract in the direction of magnetization for positive/negative magnetostriction, and results in a periodic “warpage” of the sample at a frequency that is twice the rotation frequency of the field. A continuous helium-neon laser beam suitably incident onto the sample is used to sense this small periodic warpage; the reflected laser beam is incident onto a position sensor, whose output is normalized to the laser beam intensity (to reduce intensity fluctuation effects) and then fed to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier that is locked to twice the field rotation frequency. This sample vibration frequency is selected at a value where the vibration-noise spectrum is relatively quiet, and below the first mechanical resonance frequency of the sample-holder assembly to avoid complications in the signal analysis. To provide longterm reproducibility, a “deflection calibration” signal can be produced by translating the position sensor by small amounts (using a piezoelectric transducer) at a different frequency and lock-in detection of the sensor signal at the fundamental of this translation frequency.

Employed as a regenerator, a packed bed is subject to the flow of a heat transfer fluid, which alternately stores and recovers energy from a packing of discrete particles. The flow direction reverses during the addition and removal of energy. The nature of a packing of discrete particles in a container is such that variations in the resistance to flow and in the void fraction occur across the cross section of the packing. Particularly, the region of the bed near the boundary of the container has a markedly reduced resistance to flow. In addition, the wall effect on the packing geometry changes the void fraction in the near-wall region. The purpose of the present study is to quantify the two-dimensional effects of nonuniform void fraction, velocity, and temperature distributions in a packed bed regenerator on the dynamic and steady periodic behavior. A two-dimensional numerical model of the transient response of a packed bed subject to the flow of a heat transfer fluid has been developed and verified through comparison with measured responses. The model includes the effects of nonuniform velocity and porosity in the bed, and the effects of axial and radial thermal dispersion. The results of the present computations are compared with one-dimensional transient periodic results to demonstrate the twodimensional effects on the transient response of a packed bed regenerator to a step change in fluid temperature.

Earlier theoretical models did not consider temperature distribution in the radial direction within the capsules, an assumption that limits their applications for small diameter capsules. The mathematical model developed in this work is based on solving the heat conduction equation in both melt and solid phases in cylindrical coordinates, taking into account the radial temperature distribution in both phases. Heat flux was then evaluated at the surface of the first row of the capsules to determine the temperature of the air leaving that row by a simple heat balance. It was found that such computation may be carried out for every few rows rather than for a single row to minimize computer time. The simulation study showed a significant improvement in the rate of heat transfer during heat charge and discharge when phase change materials with different melting temperatures were used.

The importance of correct biochemical diagnosis and subsequent localization of the responsible lesion(s) lie in the fact that many of these syndromes occur in younger patients, may exhibit familial patterns of inheritance, and are frequently amenable to surgical cure. The radiopharmaceuticals 131 1-6β-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59), a marker of adrenocortical cholesterol uptake, and 1311-and 1231-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a norepinephrine (NE) analog and marker of energy-dependent NE storage vesicle accumulation, can be shown to accurately localize adrenal cortex and sympathoadrenal dysfunction, respectively. In Cushing's syndrome (CS) not only does the pattern of NP-59 uptake depict the adrenal dysfunction and its pathophysiologic basis, but the level of NP-59 accumulation reflects the degree of adrenocortical hyperfunction. Adrenocorticotrophin-independent CS is uniformly and accurately localized, especially in bilateral cortical nodular hyperplasia where even high resolution computed tomography (CT) may fail to depict the often subtle, asymmetric anatomic abnormalities. Dexamethasone suppression NP-59 adrenal scintigraphy has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific, and exceeds the efficacy of CT in the differentiation of adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia in primary aldosteronism. MIBG is useful as a sympathoadrenal imaging agent whose clinical utility has been demonstrated in the localization of pheochromocytoma, especially as a modality to screen the body for multiple and extraadrenal, recurrent, or metastatic lesions. Moreover, the extent of metastatic involvement from neuroblastoma can also be accurately depicted using MIBG. In this review we will examine the role of adrenal scintigraphy in the characterization of hypersecretory disorders of the adrenal cortex, medulla, and related conditions that produce hypertension as part of their symptom(s) complex.

This process involves the growth of the larger crystals at the expense of the smaller ones, being the interfacial energy, the driving force of the phenomenon. In the present work recrystallization was analyzed using direct microscopic observation of ice crystals in a model solution (0.28 N NaCl) and indirect observation of frozen muscle tissue. The model solution allowed visualization of the interface behavior; from the analysis of the ice crystal frequency distributions, relationships between shape and size of the grains were established. A kinetic model based on the average system curvature was proposed obtaining a satisfactory fitness of the experimental data. Values of the kinetic constants determined at different temperatures allowed the estimation of the process activation energy. In muscle tissues isothermal freeze-substitution was used to observe the holes left by the ice in frozen semitendinous beef muscle stored at -5, -10, -15, and -20 °C during long periods of time. A different evolution of the mean ice crystal diameter was observed with respect to the model system.

The original concept of the production of potable water from seawater and brackish water now describes only one area in which desalination technology may be applied to the supply of safe drinking water. Reverse osmosis membrane manufacturers are becoming adept at tailor-making membranes to fill other water treatment applications. Ultra-low pressure nanofiltration is a new tool for removal of hazardous organic contaminants in preference to low molecular weight salts. Demands for water quality are becoming increasingly more stringent. In 1986, the USEPA targeted 83 contaminants for which regulations will be developed. Maximum contamination levels MCL's) have already been set for certain constituents which have been identified as possible carcinogens, such as trihalomethanes (THMs). THMs are reaction products from chlorination of water containing natural substances such as humic and fulvic acids, called THM Precursors (THMPs). MCLs for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) have been set at 100 ppb and will probably be lowered to 50 ppb in the near future. Because of the number of components which are being considered for regulation and because of the diversity of their physical and chemical properties, their removal presents a formidable challenge to the water treatment/desalination engineer. Because of their ability to reject high percentages of many dissolved components, nanofiltration membranes offer a single treatment alternative for removing many of these contaminants. Recent developments in membrane technology have created a new generation of membranes which are much more cost-competitive for treating lower TDS waters for removal of specific contaminants. These new membranes are classified as nanofiltration or ultra-low pressure membranes, typically providing 90-95% rejection of THMPs, 85 to 95% rejection of hardness and over 70% rejection of monovalent ions when operated at only 70 to 100 psi driving pressure. Field testing is now underway in Florida, where substantial THMPS are found in the shallower aquifers. This new technology should be of particular interest where water resource conservation procedures involve blending of desalted water product with untreated groundwater, surface water and/or catchment storage, followed by chlorine disinfection. © 1989.",,"Desalination; Membranes; Water Supply--Water Quality; Drinking Water; Low-Energy Membrane Nanofiltration; Trihalomethanes (THM); Water Treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024647287

The physiology of anaerobic acetone degradation was studied with strain BunN, which was originally enriched with butanone. Bicarbonate was essential for growth with acetone under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, but not if acetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate were used as substrates. An apparent Ks value of 5.6 mM-bicarbonate was determined for growth with acetone in batch culture. The molar growth yield was 24.8-29.8 g dry cell matter (mol acetone consumed)-1, with nitrate as the electron acceptor in batch culture; it varied slightly with the extent of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) formation. During growth with acetone, 14CO2 was incorporated mainly into the C-1 atom of the monomers of the storage polymer PHB.

Improvements to current control abilities of the cycloconverter, applying modern control and information theories, are discussed. To obtain good current follow characteristics, both deadbeat control and prediction control are applied. The deadbeat scheme possesses one sample delay in its controlled signal which can compensate by predicting reference signals of the next sample time. To predict the load currents at the next sample time, two prediction methods are employed. One of the predictions, which has learning ability for repetitive waves using correlation functions of the current, is composed of 256 digital filters. The weighting coefficients of the filters are determined instantaneously to minimize rms errors. The other prediction, which has a high-frequency response, is applied to compensate random components and high-frequency components. The system is controlled by two digital signal processors, for prediction of the currents, and a 16-bit microprocessor, for control of the cycloconverter. Experimental results show excellent compensation abilities, not only for repetitive harmonics but also for high-frequency random components. © 1989 IEEE",,"Control, Mechanical Variables; Electric Converters--Control; Electric Energy Storage; Energy Storage; Flywheels; Cycloconverter; Deadbeat Control; Flywheel-Synchronous Machine; Power Distortion Compensation; Prediction Control; Electric Machinery, Synchronous",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024629502

The model is based on the numerical solution of the coupled heat and magnetic flux (current) diffusion equations in a slab geometry. The model is used to calculate stability margins for large monoliths; relatively low margins are predicted. Normal zone propagation velocities are also calculated. It is shown that for large monolithic conductors, when current diffusion times are long, a propagating normal zone can be established even in a conductor designed under the traditional cryostability criterion. Examples are given to illustrate the fact that for large monoliths, “cryostability” must be assigned a new meaning (or lack of). © 1989 IEEE",,"Diffusion; Electric Conductors; Electric Energy Storage; Heat Transfer; Mathematical Models; Cryostability; Heat/Magnetic Flux Diffusion Equations; Large Monolithic Conductors; Slow Current Diffusion; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage; Superconducting Cables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024628493

During normal operation, the amount of stabilizer must be large enough either to make the coil unconditionally stable or to give a certain desired stability margin. Once a dump occurs, the amount of stabilizer must be large enough to carry the current without generating excessive dump voltages or allowing the winding to exceed a certain maximum temperature (and maximum pressure, in the case of force-cooled coils). The voltage criterion often dominates for very large coil systems, but it is frequently ignored in initial design studies. This paper gives some simple relations between the dump voltage and the stored energy, temperature rise, and coil geometry that are useful in scoping the required amount of stabilizer. Comparison with some recently proposed fusion magnet system designs indicates that excessive dump voltages could result in some cases. High-temperature superconductors may require more stabilizer than the conventional alloys. Calculations with simple model coil systems indicate how trade-offs between various coil parameters affect the dump voltage. © 1989 IEEE",,"Electric Coils--Windings; Electric Energy Storage; Nuclear Reactors, Fusion; Solenoids; Dump Voltage Effect; Fusion Magnet System; Superconducting Coils; Toroidal Coils; Superconducting Magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024627362

Energy Dispersive Analysis by x-ray confirmed the presence of silver in the stained zone. The width and shade of staining varied in different materials. After 90 days, layers of different shades could be seen within the stained zone.

In this study, the method of differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the transition temperatures and latent heat of transition of the fatty acids and their binary mixtures. These properties are of prime importance in the design of a latent heat thermal storage system. The melting range of the fatty acids (capric, lauric, palmitic and stearic) was observed to be approximately from 30°C to 65°C. Their heat of transition was observed to have a range from approximately 153 to 182 J/g. The eutectic points were determined for the binary mixtures of the fatty acids. The melting points of the eutectics for the binary systems of capric-lauric, lauric-palmitic, lauric-stearic and palmitic-stearic acids were found to be 18°C, 32.7°C, 34°C and 51°C respectively.

The concepts examined include the power and energy needs of this mission. It is shown that solar energy is not especially attractive. Use of radioisotopic power generators and a Rankine cycle are seen to be viable options. Quantitative estimates, taking into consideration state-of-the-art and projected technologies, indicate that the power/energy per se are not critical to the mission, but the reliability is. Hence, various modern options for the components of the power generation and utilization are discussed. The dramatic savings in shuttle (or other) vehicle launches are quantitatively plotted. The basic system here is the production of hydrocarbon (methane) fuel and oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. For the simplest mission, it is seen that Earth-carried methane burned with oxygen produced on site provides the best system. This conclusion results from the fact that cryogenic storage of hydrogen (despite the higher specific impulse (Isp) is avoided, and because a large portion of the propellant is really the oxidizer and not the fuel.

Its potential to produce novel copolymers was investigated. Recently, it has become of industrial interest to evalute these polyesters as potentially biodegradable plastics for a wide range of possible applications. On an industrial scale, the use of photosynthetic bacteria could harness sunlight as an energy source for the production of these materials. R. rubrum was grown an aerobically in the light on different linear and branched β-hydroxycarboxylic acids and various n-alkanoic acids. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions a PHA content of up to 45% of cellular dry weight was detected. When R. rubrum was grown on different concentrations of various n-alkanoic acids, intracellular PHA production was detected on all acids used. In most of the cases, the storage polymer contained β-hydroxybutyrate (HB) and β-hydroxyvalerate (HV) monomer units. Grown on n-alkanoic acids with a chain length of four carbon atoms and more, R. rubrum produced a copolymer containing the β-hydroxyhexanoate (HC) repeating unit in addition to the HB and HV monomer. Using β-hydroxyheptanoic acid as the carbon source, a polyester which contained HB, HV, HC, and β-hydroxyheptanoate was formed. These copolyesters represent a novel class of biodegradable thermoplastics. The results demonstrate the metabolic flexibility of R. rubrum to form many different types of polyesters which might substitute plastics synthesized from petrochemicals. © 1989.","bacterial polymers; Biodegradable plastics; poly(β-hydroxyalkonates); Rhodospirilhum rubrum","ammonia; hydroxybutyric acid; nitrogen; phosphate; plastic; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; sulfate; anaerobic growth; article; biodegradation; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Rhodospirillum rubrum; Ammonia; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation; Hydroxybutyrates; Nitrogen; Phosphates; Plastics; Polyesters; Rhodospirillum rubrum; Sulfates; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024612917

Since chemical reactors are usually operated with toxic and explosive fluids, the discharged liquid which vaporizes on the ground around the vessel may reach dangerous concentrations, causing explosions or accidents with the poisonous gas. During a research project, some fundamentals were developed for the design of separation systems which separate liquid from vapour and store it in a receiver. The requirement for a separation efficiency of a least 80% is related to the condition that the separated liquid should flow back into the reactor still during the pressure relief phase. For safety reasons, both separation and re‐storage are to be carried out without the supply of external energy. Theoretical and experimental investigations of pressure distribution within the piping to the relief valve and in an integrated separator show that re‐storage of the separated liquid in the vessel can be achieved under certain flow conditions. Therefore, the separator must be integrated in the pipe at a certain height above the vessel, so that the hydrostatic pressure of the separated liquid, corresponding to the difference in height, is sufficient to lead it back through another pipe against the internal pressure of the vessel. First, several separators were tested with air‐water mixtures. A swirl separator and a reversing separator have been developed to such an extent that they appear suitable for the set task. Experimental results with air‐water mixtures and refrigerant R12 upon pressure relief show separation efficiencies of between 90 and 100% at low pressure drops within the whole operating range. As an alternative to separation outside the vessel, a rotary separator was also developed which is fixed to the outlet opening in the vessel. A centrifugal field is produced by the separator rotor and the heavier liquid is largely separated from the vapour so that only drops in the range &lt; 100 μm flow together with the vapour towards the central standpipe. The outflowing vapour leaves the separator via 4 tangentially arranged nozzles, under critical conditions. The vapour flow momentum drives the separator rotor. The arrangement was developed and tested during various series of experiments, under conditions or pressure relief with refrigerant R12. So far, separation efficiencies between 60 and 95% have been achieved at stirring speeds of up to 2500 min−1.

This process has been attributed to reversible physical changes in the entanglement structure of the polymer chain network. Shear modification studies were performed for two well‐characterized low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) grades differing in molecular weight distribution and degree of long chain branching. The shear working of the material was carried out using a specially designed shearing unit producing definable amounts of pure shear in a continuous process. Measurements of the dynamic storage modulus, G′, steady‐state shear compliance; Je, extrudate swell, melt flow index, and the extensional behavior (Rheotens test) indicate that primarily properties associated with the elasticity of the melt are reduced in value. The observed reduction is found to correlate with the mean specific energy dissipated during sample preparation. Comparing the two LDPE grades showed that higher degrees of modification can be obtained at lower energy input levels for the more highly branched grade. Reversibility tests were performed and complete recovery of the initial material behavior was observed. Comparison of measurement results for samples prepared using the shearing unit presented here and a Brabender Plasticorder indicates that the degree of modification depends not only on the molecular structure of the polymer but also on the manner in which the shearing history is imposed upon the material.

For these applications, however, this battery system is somewhat hindered by the loss of performance on deep discharge cycling due to a gradual migration of the zinc active material. To investigate why, where, and to what extent the zinc migrates during cycling, radiotracer techniques were developed and used to measure electrolyte movement and zinc migration in situ without disturbing the operation of the cell. This novel application of radiotracers to the study of the zinc/nickel oxide battery system has provided new and unique information. The findings indicate that electrolyte movement by forced convection in an operating cell overwhelms electrolyte movement due to natural convection processes, and that this movement is radially outward and inward from the center of the electrode pack during charge and discharge, respectively. The radiotracer zinc studies indicated that zinc migration at the top of the electrode pack is five times higher than at the center of the electrode pack. Autoradiograms of the electrodes before and after cycling confirmed earlier studies that zinc migrates to the nickel electrodes, and, in addition, showed that this zinc transfer is directly from the zinc electrodes through the separators to the nickel electrodes. The amount of zinc transferred depends upon the operating history of the cell and the location within the electrode pack. These results will help direct future development work to enhance the life and performance of deep discharge zinc/nickel oxide battery systems. © 1989, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

When glass beads are packed in the air channel of an air heater as a semitransparent material, a heat storage effect as well as 1.2-1.5 times higher heat-trap efficiency than in the absence of packing or where the packing is an opaque material like porcelain beads result. It is also indicated that packing with a glass tubes bundle will increase the pressure drop considerably less than will packing with glass beads. From these results, it is likely that the proposed solar air heater has good enough heat trap and heat storage characteristics for development as a new type of solar air heater with high efficiency.

These are designed to permit lower extremity amputees to participate in a wide variety of activities, such as running and jumping sports, as well as vigorous walking. Although kinesiologic studies of these devices have not been completed, clinical experience suggests that the Flex-Foot provides the highest performance, followed by the Carbon Copy II and the Seattle Foot. The S.A.F.E. Foot, the STEN Foot, and the Dynamic Foot provide less energy storage and may be suitable for less active patients or those with special needs such as walking on uneven ground. All of the ESPF except the Flex-Foot may be attached to a realigned conventional prosthesis. The Flex-Foot incorporates a pylon and foot in one unit and requires special fabrication technologies. The additional cost of most of the ESPF (compared to a Solid Ankle Cushion Heel Foot) may add little to the cost of a finished prosthesis although it provides greatly increased function. The Flex-Foot, however, is significantly more expensive. Advances in kinesiology and materials science are being applied in the design of prosthetic components that are lighter, stronger, and more resilient. Clinicians can now choose from a variety of innovative commercially available devices but have been hampered by a lack of published information. This paper will review the design philosophy, materials, and applications of ESPF, and will supplement the information available from individual manufacturers and the prosthetic literature. © 1989.","Amputee; Foot; Prosthesis; Running","biomechanics; disabled; economic aspect; education; foot; human; jumping; priority journal; prosthesis; rehabilitation; running; short survey; Amputation; Artificial Limbs; Comparative Study; Evaluation Studies; Foot; Human; Prosthesis Design; Running; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024599077

Thirtyfive laboratories (35 for T4, 34 for T3 and 23 for TSH) from different parts of country participated in the programme. Twentyfour samples (16 pools: 5 simple and 11 manipulated pools) in 8 batches, 3 per batch per month were sent for analysis of T4, T3 and TSH. Some of the samples were repeated 3 times at different occasions to assess the imprecision of the laboratory. The overall mean percent CV obtained for T4, T3 and TSH were 22.7, 36.32 and 52.38 respectively. The recovery for added T4 was 86.73% while that for T3 was 117.4%. A large variation was obtained for recovery of TSH. For T4 estimations, 13 laboratories had a desirable performance i. e. bias less than ±10.0% and variability of bias (VB) and imprecision (IP) less than 15.0%. None of the laboratories had a desirable performance for T3 or TSH. The number of laboratories with acceptable performance i. e. bias between ±10.0-15.0%, VB and IP between 20.0-25.0% for T4, T3 and TSH were 4, 3 and 0 respectively. The number of laboratories which required attention (bias between ±15.0-20.0%; VB and IP between 20.0-25.0%) were 5,7 and 1 respectively. The unacceptable results with larger bias, VB and IP for T4, T3 and TSH were 6, 18 and 17 respectively. Our results are in general agreement that the performance of T4 assay is better than T3 and both in turn are much better than TSH. Quantitation of circulating thyroid hormones (TH) viz. tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which form the largest percentage of hormones estimated in a clinical laboratory is mainly done by radio-immunoassay (RIA) procedures. The reliability and reproducibility of these assays are generally monitored by using internal quality control (IQC) samples in every assay batch. Thus, the IQC provides information whether the assay results are satisfactory and can be released. However, external quality assessment (EQA) is a procedure whereby an external agency undertakes evaluation of the quality of an analytical service by providing samples for analysis to individual laboratories performing the assay. The data gathered is analysed collectively. EQA therefore provides a means by which performance of a laboratory is assessed in relation to other laboratories and matching the assay unbiased by removing systematic error, if present. This is important since RIA procedure involves several steps (collection and storage of samples, quality of the reagents, procedure followed for performance of an assay, counting equipment used and the mode of the data analysis) and therefore prone to systematic errors. We therefore undertook the EQA programme for assessment of thyroid related hormones as a joint collaborative project of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, India and International Atomic Energy Agency. © 1989 Association of Clinical Biochemists of India.",,"liothyronine; radioisotope; thyrotropin; thyroxine; human; human cell; quality control; radioimmunoassay; thyroid gland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024595852

These are due to the low differential absorption of body tissues at therapeutic energies and to a relatively large radiation source. We used an experimental, high-contrast sensitivity storage phosphor imaging system (Eastman Kodak Co.) to produce portal images. The system consists of a storage phosphor detector, a high-contrast sensitivity laser scanner (12 bit), an image processing module, and a laser printer (12 bit). Patients undergoing radiation therapy treatments had both a conventional portal image and a storage phosphor image taken. Both were displayed side-by-side and were evaluated independently by three radiotherapists according to quality of information to verify the treatment field. Each of the three radiotherapists rated the storage phosphor images to be better (p < 0.001) than the conventional images.

Although there is much discrepancy of results, the following are obvious: Obesity is not a clear-cut syndrome, and individuals differ significantly in their genetic subtypes and in the stages, type, and degree of their metabolic disturbances. A difference in the facultative component of the thermogenic effect of food can explain some of the variation. This in turn is closely related to insulin resistance, which bears a close relationship to subtypes of hypertension and hyperlipidemias. The greatest scope for clinical intervention lies in these fields. Both the obese and the lean subjects are adapted to retain dietary fat independently of the energy needs.

A low-temperature spinning cell technique was used to produce high-quality bathorhodopsin spectra exhibiting resolved hydrogen out-of-plane wagging vibrations at 838, 850, 858, 875, and 921 cm-1. The isotopic shifts and a normal coordinate analysis permit the assignment of these lines to the HC7=C8H Bg, C14H, C12H, C10H, and C11H hydrogen out-of-plane wagging modes, respectively. The coupling constant between the C11H and C12H wags as well as the C12H wag force constant are unusually low compared to those of retinal model compounds. This quantitatively confirms the lack of coupling between the C11H and C12H wags and the low C12H wag vibrational frequency noted earlier by Eyring et al. [(1982) Biochemistry 21, 384]. The force constants for the C10H and C14H wags are also significantly below the values observed in model compounds. We suggest that the perturbed hydrogen out-of-plane wagging and C–C stretching force constants for the C10—C11=C12—C13 region of the chromophore in bathorhodopsin result from electrostatic interactions with a charged protein residue.

The intact joint was first loaded, and then tested under two different loading conditions after a complete medial meniscectomy. The first set of test conditions attempted to simulate those used by previous investigators, by ignoring the spacer effect of the meniscus and not repositioning the joint after its removal. The second set of tests was carried out after the joint was repositioned in the coronal plane to allow initial contact to occur in both tibiofemoral compartments. It is presumed that this occurs subsequent to a meniscectomy in vivo, following the application of any weight‐bearing load. As with previous investigators, it was found that after meniscectomy the joints produced slightly larger displacements and lower stiffnesses than when intact (no significant differences from intact). However, repositioning the meniscectomized joint produced markedly smaller displacements (35–49%, p < 0.01) and greater stiffnesses (47–123%, p < 0.05) over the range of forces analyzed, compared with the intact joint. The ratio of dissipated to input energy was 42% for the intact joint, and rose following meniscectomy to 54% (p < 0.05) with repositioning and 55% (p < 0.05) without repositioning. Measured contact area decreased by 17% (p < 0.05) following meniscectomy alone, and by 12% (p < 0.05) following meniscectomy with repositioning. Since repositioning of the joint subsequent to meniscectomy (accounting for the loss of the meniscal spacer) resulted in an increse in structural stiffness, it was concluded that the medial meniscus decreases the structural stiffness of the intact stifle joint. In addition, the meniscus has a role in elastic energy storage and increasing contact area. This study is intended to serve as a baseline comparison for future in vivo studies on meniscetomy, meniscal repair, and meniscal replacement, in addition to more fully elucidating the mechanism of load transmission. A model is presented to explain both the decrease in stiffness after meniscectomy without repositioning and the increase in stiffness after meniscectomy with repositioning, employing linear springs of unequal length and different stiffnesses. After removal of the softer meniscal element and allowing joint approximation to occur, loading of the stiffer articular element results in an initially stiffer preparation.

In addition, we investigated the possible beneficial effect of an intermediate normothermic perfusion half-way through the storage period on the preservation of ischemically injured kidneys. Thirty mongrel dogs were allocated to 5 experimental groups. In groups I and II kidneys were simply stored on ice for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. In groups III and IV kidneys were additionally subjected to 30 min warm ischemia before storage. In group 5 kidneys were treated as in group IV, but halfway through the storage period an intermediate normothermic ex-vivo perfusion was performed. The effect of these procedures on renal viability was tested by autologous reimplantation of the kidneys. During implantation the contralateral kidney was immediately removed. In group I all animals survived, whereas in group IV none of the animals survived. In groups II, III, and V, 2 of 6, 1 of 6, and 3 of 6 animals survived, respectively. The relationship, if any, between poststorage renal viability and the tissue levels of adenine nucleotides, guanine nucleotides, IMP, and purine degradation products was assessed by measuring the content of these metabolites in tissue specimen of the renal cortex, on which biopsies were done at various intervals during the experimental procedures. After an initial drop of about 30% in the content of adenine and guanine nucleotides and an increase in IMP, these values remained constant during 48 hr of cold storage. In contrast to kidneys stored for 24 hr, reimplantation of kidneys stored for 48 hr resulted in a significant decrease of adenine nucleotides following 60 min of in vivo reperfusion. Warm ischemia for 30 min prior to cold storage lead to lower initial nucleotide levels at the start of the storage period. During the first 24 hr nucleotide levels did not change, but a further decrease was observed during the following 24 hr of storage. Reimplantation after 24 hr of storage resulted in an additional decrease in the content of nucleotides. This poststorage decrease was absent after 48 hr of cold storage. Intermediate normothermic perfusion halfway through the storage for 48 hr significantly prevented the drop in the nucleotide content observed during the last 24 hr of storage in the corresponding control group. This nucleotide-sparing effect did not increase the level of nucleotides at the end of 60 min of reperfusion following reimplantation. These findings suggest that the tissue nucleotide content at the end of cold storage does not necessarily predict viability upon implantation. In general, however, preexisting warm ischemic injury impairs renal viability following implantation and reduces the nucleotide-sparing effect of cold storage. © 1989 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.",,"inosine phosphate; nucleotide; animal experiment; dog; ischemia; kidney perfusion; kidney transplantation; methodology; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; Animal; Dogs; Energy Metabolism; Female; Graft Survival; Homeostasis; Hypothermia, Induced; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Nucleotides; Perfusion; Reperfusion Injury; Replantation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Transplantation, Autologous",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024538675

A non‐blow‐molded LE‐2 polyolefin (PO) container was developed to store single‐donor apheresis platelet concentrates (PCs) processed by the Haemonetics Plasma Collecting System (PCS) at 22°C for over 1 day. We molded PO containers with heat‐sealing of light‐weight polymer alloy films with a thickness of 0.25 mm. The film was made of polymer blends consisting of polypropylene, styrene ethylene butylene styrene‐block copolymer, and ehtylene ethylacrylate copolymer. The PO container with enough strength and flexibility in routine practice has 2 and 1.6 times higher oxygen and carbon dioxide gas transfer properties than standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic containers. PCs (1–1.9times1011platelets) processed from 450 ml platelet‐rich plasma were stored in 0.6‐liter PO containers at 22°C with flatbed agitation for up to 6 days. The pH of PCs was well maintained at the mean values of 7.0 in PO containers after 6 days in the well‐oxygenated condition. The energy metabolism of stored platelets was determined. Oxygen consumption rates of platelets stored in PO containers averaged 1.5 nmol/min/109platelets. The rates of glucose consumption and lactate production were 0.4 and 0.8 nmol/min/1011platelets, respectively. The rates of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation of platelets, 9.7 nmol/min/109platelets, in PO containers did not differ from those in the PVC containers. Aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate and hypotonic shock response of platelets were better maintained in PO containers. The morphological changes into sphere forms with projections and the appearance of unclassified forms were more frequently observed in PO than in PVC containers. Single‐donor apheresis platelet products collected by the PCS system may be stored in a new 0.6‐liter PO container for over 5 days under acceptable conditions. © 1989 S.

Also, the monthly entropy fluxes associated with infrared radiation, evaporation and sensible heat are estimated. The net entropy flow into the lake becomes negative; that is, the lake absorbs 'negative entropy' from its surroundings. In this respect, the lake can be regarded as a 'superorganism', which has ordered structures and functions in it similar to a biological organism. The change of entropy content is computed from the change of heat-storage and the mean temperature of the lake. From the net entropy flow and the change of entropy content, the entropy production is calculated. Entropy production is large in summer and small in winter; it oscillates with a period of 1 year. The monthly entropy production (Sprod) is a linear function of the monthly solar energy absorbed by the lake (Esolar):Sprod=a+bEsolar, a=0.006 MJ m-3 month-1 K-1 and b=2.29 × 10-4 m-1 K-1. The values (a, b) are holistic indices which characterize the lake from an entropy viewpoint. Other indices of similar nature are also introduced. Comparison of these quantities in Lake Mendota (eutrophic) with those in the northern basin of Lake Biwa (oligo-mesotrophic) shows that processes of eutrophication or succession are accompanied by the increase of magnitudes of these indices that are related to entropy production. The increase of entropy production will be an entropy principle in some stage of ecological succession in lakes, and also in other ecological systems. A hypothesis is presented: the whole span of ecological succession consists of three phases: developmental stage (early stage) in which entropy production increases with time, stationary stage (intermediate stage) in which entropy production is kept constant, and senescent stage (later stage) in which entropy production decreases with time. These trends will be applied to Lotka-Odum's power and also Hirata-Ulanowicz's ascendency. © 1989.",,"ecological succession; energy budget; entropy flux; eutrophication; Japan, Lake Biwa; USA, Wisconsin, Lake Mendota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024531169

Studies conducted in our laboratory over the last decade, in conjunction with recent clinical and epidemiological observations, suggest that hypertension in the obese is derived from a fundamental relationship between dietary intake and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The application of kinetic techniques to the measurement of norepinephrine (NE) turnover rate in sympathetically innervated tissues of laboratory rodents has defined a relationship between the SNS and dietary intake. Fasting or caloric restriction suppresses sympathetic activity in a variety of organs of the rat, including heart and interscapular brown adipose tissue. Overfeeding a mixed, palatable, ""cafeteria"" diet stimulates sympathetic activity in these same tissues. The stimulatory effect of mixed diets is due to the carbohydrate and fat content, because these two latter nutrients stimulate sympathetic activity even when total caloric intake is not increased. Insulin-mediated glucose metabolism within central neurons associated with the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays an important role in the relationship between dietary intake and SNS activity as indicated by the following observations: (1) Hypoglycemia (noninsulin-mediated) is associated with suppression of the SNS (despite concomitant adrenal medullary stimulation); (2) 2-de-oxyglucose, an intracellular inhibitor of glucose metabolism, decreases sympathetic activity. The effects of 2-deoxyglucose, furthermore, are not additive with those produced by caloric restriction; (3) Streptozotocin-induced diabetes is associated with suppressed sympathetic activity despite increased caloric consumption; (4) Insulin infusion in normal human subjects, with maintenance of the plasma glucose level, is associated with increased plasma NE levels and signs of cardiovascular stimulation; and (5) destruction of insulin-glucose sensitive neurons in the VMH of mice treated with gold thioglucose obliterates diet-induced changes in SNS obesity. Dietary alterations in sympathetic activity are related to the changes in metabolic rate that occur during underfeeding and overfeeding. From an evolutionary standpoint suppression of metabolism would prolong survival during famine. The capacity to dissipate calories taken in excess may have its origins in the mammalian response to protein-deficient diets, because increased consumption of a low protein diet could satisfy basic needs for nitrogen while avoiding excessive fuel storage. Low protein diets, furthermore, stimulate the SNS whereas protein, in distinction to carbohydrate and fat, does not increase sympathetic activity. The capacity to augment sympathetically mediated ther-mogenesis during overfeeding, therefore, provides a potential buffer against excessive energy storage. The relationship between dietary intake and sympathetic activity, and the role of insulin as mediator in this relationship, suggests an hypothesis to explain the association of hypertension and obesity. In the obese, hypertension has been linked to hyperinsulinemia in both clinical and epidemiological studies. Insulin-mediated sympathetic stimulation in the obese may be a compensatory mechanism to limit weight gain by increasing thermogenesis. The concomitant effects of hyperinsulinemia on the kidney and the sympathetic nervous system would, however, increase blood pressure by enhancing renal sodium reabsorption and stimulating the cardiovascular system. Hypertension in the obese, according to this formulation, may be viewed as the unfortunate by-product of mechanisms recruited to limit weight gain and maintain energy balance.

The front, low atomic number, plate was assumed to be comprised of SrFBr and the rear, high atomic number, plate of commercially available BaFBr (98 mg/cm2 coating weight). Assuming a constant x-ray tube voltage of 50 kVp and a typical breast thickness, the theoretical model yielded a front SrFBr phosphor coating weight of ~ 21 mg/cm2. The study indicates that a relatively large separation in the average x-ray photon energies absorbed in the two plates can be obtained.

For example, denatured W139F showed the expected decrease in fluorescence emission intensity at 350 nm due to the deletion of one Trp residue, but the fluorescence emission of the wild-type and W139F enzymes in the native state did not differ in intensity. This result suggests that the fluorescence of Trp-139 in the native, wild-type enzyme is not manifested perhaps due to its proximity to the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. Results of energy-transfer studies at several wavelengths could also be interpreted as due to the proximity of Trp-139 and the coenzyme. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the negative Cotton effect at 420 nm due to the coenzyme was still present in W139F. However, the 280-nm optically active band present in the wild-type enzyme was greatly diminished in W139F. The mutant protein with Asp at position 139 (W139D) could not be isolated presumably because it was degraded. The other mutant enzymes, W139P, W139A, and W139H, were isolated with partial activities (15-35%) that were slowly lost upon storage at 4 °C. Overall, these results indicate the importance of Trp-139 in the thermostable D-amino acid transaminase. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

In this article we report and analyze the first events of this cycle. The June 1985 eruption was preceded by inflation and seismicity. A period of aseismic and slow inflation of the summit area was observed in early 1985. Seismic activity began in mid-May, and increased at the end of the month. Simultaneously, the rate of deformation increased. The seismic events clustered at depths ranging from 1 to 2.5 km, beneath the same area as the center of inflation, northwest of the main summit crater (Dolomieu). The shallowness and small lateral extension of the seismicity, and the short wavelength of the deformation showed that the focus of magmatic pressure was shallow and restricted to a small volume. The outbreak was preceded by a less than one hour intrusive crisis characterized by intense seismic activity and by rapid deformation. The intrusion reached the surface along a SW-NE system of fissures in line with the epicentral zone. The detailed analysis of the seismic and deformation patterns during the intrusive sequence, allow us to propose that the near surface path of the intrusion was guided by an existing tensional fissure system, a hypothesis that explains why the eruption did not occur closer to the epicentral zone. The eruption produced about one million cubic meters of transitional aphyric basalt of a composition similar to that of the lavas erupted since 1979. About one month later, an intrusion not followed by an eruption occurred on July 9; it was the first event of this type observed at Piton de la Fournaise since the installation of the Volcanological Observatory in 1980. The seismicity and deformation patterns during this intrusive sequence were similar to those observed before all the outbreaks since 1980. The main seismic zone was beneath the central to south part of Dolomieu crater, but the deformation showed that the intrusion eventually migrated toward the east and stopped at shallow depth, at about 1 km east of Dolomieu. As for the intrusion associated with the June 14 eruption, the path of the July 9 intrusion also seemed to be guided by a preexisting fissure system. As the July 9 summit crisis was ending, a new crisis began on the east flank of the volcano on July 10. It was the first seismic crisis observed in this area. It surpassed the previous summit seismic crises by two orders of magnitude in the number of earthquakes as well as the energy released. Initially, most hypocenters were concentrated at about 3 km ENE of the summit and at depths of 2-5 km beneath sea level. Later, after the climax of the crisis, the hypocenter zone spread over the entire Grandes Pentes area. We suggest that this flank crisis corresponded to the release of compressional stresses accumulated in the central area of the volcano during the repeated intrusions that occurred over the preceding years. The detailed analysis of the events reported in this article brings new insights in the shallow magma reservoir and in the tectonic behaviour of the volcano. The magma reservoir is inferred to be composed of several units rather than a single volume unit. The storage units are distributed over an area that corresponds about to that of Dolomieu crater and at depths between 1 and 2 km or less to at least 2.5-3 km. This reservoir complex has probably not been resupplied since 1977. The asymmetric tectonic behaviour of the volcano, already recognized from surface tectonic features, has been confirmed by the deformation and seismic observations. The contractional stresses accumulated in the central zone to accommodate the inflation of the reservoir and the emplacement of the intrusion, are released by preferential displacement of the free flank (sea-facing flank). A study of this mechanism is important for the recognition of future eruptive and tectonic activity. © 1989.",,"asymmetric tectonic behaviour; basaltic volcanism; contractional stresses; deformation; magma reservoir; seismicity; Reunion Island, Piton de la Fournaise volcano",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024486813

An existing mathematical model to calculate evaporation from the A pan was appropriately modified. Micrometeorological measurements were used to explain the mechanism of evaporation from the A pan. The modifications include the calculation of thermal energy storage and the establishment of a wind function for the daylight period. The modified model yielded an index of agreement and mean absolute difference between modelled and measured values of 0.92 and 0.76 mm (28% of mean pan measurements) for the daylight period, respectively. The mean difference was 0.06 mm or 2% of mean pan measurements. This model was used to create functions for transforming pan evaporation to AED. The ratios of estimated TEr to partially transformed pan measurements and untransformed pan measurements were 1.13 and 4.62, respectively, for daylight.

Neither these balance estimates nor evaporation models, which use the aerodynamic equation with mass transfer coefficients developed originally in the Lake Hefner studies, can be verified, since independent estimates of evaporation are not available with sufficient accuracy. However, water surface temperatures can be used to verify energy budgets. The mass transfer coefficient research is combined here with lumped concepts of classical energy conservation and a new superposition heat storage model to provide continuous simulation capability of both water surface temperatures and lake evaporation for use in outlooks and forecasts of lake levels. Calibration matches remotely sensed water surface temperatures for those Great Lakes with observations over the past 20 years.

We present a simple variant of the Meatgrinder circuit which permits a first order current profiling into the gun and recovery of the inductive energy in the barrel at a high repetition rate. The circuit is basically a one stage Meatgrinder which utilizes the ringing of the energy storage capacitor (0% reversal) to perform the opening switch function and a solid state diode as the crowbar switch between the two mutually coupled inductors. With resonant charging, this results in a completely passive, high repetition rate electromagnetic gun power supply.

The investigation is based on the minimization of entropy production due to a finite temperature difference. The results of this study indicate three basic points: 1, in the presence of heat leaks, the irreversibility rate is more than in its absence; 2, the increase in irreversibility due to heat leaks reduces the effective Ntu exponentially; 3, there exists a dimensionless optimum time parameter which relates two other fundamental dimensionless parameters for the maximization of useful work stored. These fundamental parameters are Ntu associated with heat flow across the non-adiabatic wall and Ntu of the storage unit. These points suggest that the leakage heat affects the entropy production adversely and hence it should be kept at a minimum. © 1989.","heat leaks; refrigeration; thermodynamics","Mathematical Models; Thermodynamics; Exergy; Heat Leaks; Refrigeration Energy Storage Units; Storage Capacity; Refrigeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024480111

This investigation is part of the Athens Automation and Control Experiment sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Storage and Distribution, Electric Energy Systems Program. In this experiment, distribution feeder equipment on twelve feeders connected to three substations is being remotely controlled from a central dispatch center, A supervisory control and data acquisition system provides substation and feeder monitoring and remote control of feeder circuit breakers, power reclosers, and load break switches. An analytical study is presented to show the improvement in conventional distribution system reliability indices that are achieved at AUB as a function of the penetration of automation equipment. The value of automation predicted by the study is highly sensitive to the historical outage data used in the analysis and to the economic worth of reliability assigned by the utility. These sensitivities are well known and account, at least in part, for the reluctance of some upper utility managers to invest in automation systems. Operating experience with the AUB automation system has shown that there are significant intangible reliability benefits and tangible cost savings associated with automation that are outside the scope of conventional distribution reliability indices. Eight case studies are described, from actual AUB operations, where the automation system resulted in significant cost savings and reliability benefits that are not captured by conventional reliability indices, Other utilities should expect similar benefits, which will be difficult to quantify analytically but, which add to the value of and justification for distribution automation. © 1989 IEEE",,"Electric Substations--Control; Electric Utilities--Reliability; Central Dispatch Center; Distribution Feeder Equipment; Feeder Circuit Breakers; Power Reclosers; Reliability Indices; Electric Power Distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024479220

Because wet bulb temperatures are generally lower during the winter and at night, evaporative chilling has enjoyed use as a 'free cooling' measure in meeting continuous cooling loads such as computer or industrial process cooling needs. Its use with building air conditioning systems, however, has been limited. HVAC designers have favored outside air cooling economizers when seeking to reduce typical building air conditioning energy use. In 1986 the company where the authors work designed evaporative chilling and thermal energy storage into the cooling system of a 72,000 sq ft manufacturing and office building for the Grass Valley Group located in northern California. This application is discussed in this article and provides a cogent example of the economic synergy and expanded opportunities that exist when these two cooling technologies are combined.",,"Buildings--Air Conditioning; Economics; Energy Storage; Annual Wet Bulb Distribution; Chilled Water System; Evaporative Chilling; Air Conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024478806

Energy stored at low current in the primary of a transformer is delivered at high current from the transformer secondary. Energy transfer to the secondary is accomplished by opening a high voltage switch in the transformer primary. The key components are a closely-coupled, air-core transformer and the high-voltage opening switch. We designed and fabricated all the hardware required to demonstrate the MAPPS technologies at 100 r—core, energy storage transformer was liquid nitrogen cooled to lower the resistance of the primary winding. The primary was de signed to conduct 1000 A and the secondary 100 kA. The primary was insulated from the secondary for 25 kV isolation. The opening switch used a Gate Turn Off Thyristor (GTO) to force commutation in a commercial vacuum interrupter. The switch was buit to develop 25 kV while interrupting 1000 A dc at five interruptions per second. The transformer and switch were integrated with a load into a 100 kA demonstration system. We completed testing of the 100 kA demonstrator in July 1986. The measured transformer coupling during operation was 0.99. The switch successfully interrupted 460 A and developed 7.5 kV at five commutations per second. Leakage current through the GTO prevented the switch from successfully reaching the 1000 A design goal. The switch performed well up to 460 A, successfully commutating current 290 times during testing. In this paper we describe the demonstration tests and review the results. We also discuss the observed limits to the switch performance and methods to improve performance. © 1989 IEEE",,"Acceleration; Electromagnetic Field Effects; Superconducting Materials; MegAmpere Pulsed Power Supplies; Railguns; Electric Transformers, Pulse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024478605

The thermic effects of glucose/insulin were 6.2% ± 0.4% and 5.6% ± 0.7% before atropine and edrophonium, respectively, and increased to 7.1% ± 0.5% (NS) with atropine and 7.5% ± 1.2% (P < .05) with edrophonium. In four subjects atropine or edrophonium was infused before the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. A significant increase in resting metabolic rate and plasma norepinephrine concentrations was observed with edrophonium alone. When the thermic effects of glucose/insulin were calculated with respect to the metabolic rates observed during the drug infusions alone, they were 5.9% ± 1.4% and 3.6% ± 0.6% (NS) for the clamp + atropine and clamp + edrophonium, respectively. These results demonstrate that the increases in the thermic effect of glucose/insulin infusions observed during inhibition or stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system were due to atropine or edrophonium increasing the resting metabolic rate rather than increasing the thermic response to glucose-insulin infusions. However, because it has been shown that atropine can decrease the thermic effect of an orally administered meal by approximately 60%, it would appear that the parasympathetic nervous system can influence the thermic effect of food by affecting the rate of digestion, absorption and storage of the ingested nutrients. © 1989.",,"atropine; edrophonium; edrophonium chloride; glucose; insulin; neutral insulin; cholinergic system; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; human cell; human experiment; intravenous drug administration; male; metabolism; normal human; priority journal; thermoregulation; Adult; Atropine; Body Temperature; Edrophonium; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Heart Rate; Homeostasis; Human; Insulin; Male; Nerve Block; Norepinephrine; Osmolar Concentration; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Rest; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024454836

Glucose utilization was measured during euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry and infusion of [3H-3]-glucose, while β-cell function was measured during a hyperglycemic clamp. The kidney-transplanted patients were resistant to the glucoregulatory effect of insulin, as demonstrated by a 25% reduction in total glucose disposal compared to control subjects. This defect was almost completely accounted for by a defect in storage of glucose as glycogen (3.3 ± 0.5 vs. 5.0 ± 0.5 mg/kgLBM·min; P &lt; 0.05). The reduction in nonoxidative glucose disposal was associated with reduced lean body mass and incapacity to release energy as heat after infusion of insulin, i.e. thermogenic defect. In contrast, oxidation of glucose and lipids was not influenced by steroid therapy. Furthermore, suppression of hepatic glucose production was normal, and insulin secretion was normally enhanced in relation to the degree of insulin resistance in the steroid-treated patients. In conclusion, steroid-induced insulin resistance in kidney-transplanted patients is due to alterations in the nonoxidative pathway of glucose metabolism.

The overflow of noradrenaline and DOPEG was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The efflux of DOPEG, the predominant neuronal noradrenaline metabolite, served as indicator of the free axoplasmic amine concentration. A calcium-free perfusion buffer was used to avoid exocytotic noradrenaline release. Sodium and chloride in the perfusion buffer were replaced by lithium and isethionate, respectively. (1) Reduction of extracellular sodium or chloride increased noradrenaline overflow in ischaemia. The release was suppressed by the uptake, blocker cocaine indicating carrier-mediated outward transport of noradrenaline. (2) In cyanide intoxication sodium or chloride reduction accelerated the onset of DOPEG efflux reflecting increased axoplasmic noradrenaline concentrations. This was accompanied by increased noradrenaline release. The ratio of noradrenaline/DOPEG overflow was increased by reduced sodium or chloride, indicating facilitation of carrier-mediated noradrenaline net outward transport. (3) In the presence of unaltered energy metabolism overflow of both, noradrenaline and DOPEG, was not enhanced by sodium or chloride reduction. The results demonstrate that reduction of extracellular sodium or chloride has two effects on noradrenaline release from the sympathetic neuron with reduced energy supply. First, reduced sodium or chloride induces increased axoplasmic noradrenaline concentrations by interference with vesicular storage function. Second, both interventions enhance carrier-mediated noradrenaline release. © 1989, Springer-Verlag.

We conclude that incubation at a medium pH of 6.1 for 60 minutes is optimal for the rejuvenation of stored red cells with PEP. Under such incubation conditions, the concentrations of 2,3 DPG and adenine nucleotides in red cells stored for 5 weeks were restored to normal without methemoglobin formation.

In addition, adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity was measured in four depots before and 45 min after the start of a meal. Plasma glucose was significantly elevated only at the 15-min time point, and while plasma triglyceride increased these changes did not reach significance. Plasma insulin was significantly elevated at all time points after a meal. Feeding resulted in a consistent decrease of adipose tissue blood flow expressed per gram wet weight of tissue. This decrease was maximal at 30 min after the start of feeding. The decrease in adipose tissue blood flow averaged 45% at 45 min after the start of feeding for the five depots evaluated. Lipoprotein lipase activity significantly increased in the retroperitoneal and mesenteric fat depots at 45 min after the meal start, but did not change in the epididymal or dorsal subcutaneous fat depots. These results suggest that a decrease in adipose tissue blood flow is a normal result of a meal in the rat. The regional specificity of changes in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity supports the concept of regional specificity of function for adipose tissue and suggests that the mesenteric and retroperitoneal depots are particularly important for the storage of triglycerides immediately after a meal.",,"insulin; lipoprotein lipase; radioisotope; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; blood flow; controlled study; glucose blood level; male; metabolism; nonhuman; postprandial state; priority journal; rat; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Blood Glucose; Eating; Energy Intake; Insulin; Lipoprotein Lipase; Male; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Regional Blood Flow; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024422034

Parenchymal cells maintained their viability nearly completely after up to 24 hr of cold storage as assessed by trypan blue exclusion (97% of cells) and LDH release (4% of total) from livers reperfused for 20 min following storage. Furthermore, hepatic glycolysis (rates of lactate plus pyruvate production), oxygen uptake and NADH redox state (Iactate:pyruvate ratio) were in the normal range at all time points studied up to 24 hr of cold storage. In contrast, nonparenchymal cells lost viability as assessed from trypan blue staining beginning after 8 hr of storage: 40% were nonviable after 24 hr of storage. Since injury to nonparenchymal cells occurs only upon reperfusion, oxygen radicals may be involved. Accordingly, xanthine and hypoxanthine, substrates for oxygen radical formation, were measured in perfusate upon reperfusion. Both purines accumulated (up to 80 *iM) with time of storage and were washed out rapidly (<10 min) upon reperfusion. Although parenchymal cell function was in the normal range in livers stored in the cold for 24 hr, liver grafts stored for 6 hr and longer in Euro-Collins solution could not be transplanted successfully. Thus, we conclude that viability of parenchymal cells in liver grafts prior to transplantation is a poor parameter to predict the outcome of transplantation. Therefore, assessment of parenchymal cell energy state (e.g., with 31P NMR and other methods) most likely will not predict survival reliably. On the other hand, nonparenchymal cells lose their viability significantly earlier following storage and reperfusion. These data suggest that preservation of nonparenchymal cell viability is critical for successful liver transplantation. © 1989 by Williams & Wilkins.",,"oxygen radical; radioisotope; animal experiment; graft survival; liver transplantation; nonhuman; organ preservation; priority journal; rat; Animal; Cell Survival; Cold; Free Radicals; Graft Survival; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Perfusion; Rats; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024421124

We have investigated the mechanism of this effect. Rabbit kidneys were subjected to 60 min of warm ischemia prior to preservation for 24 hr with Ross, Marshall, and Escott’s hypertonic citrate solution, with or without retrograde oxygen persufflation (ROP) via the renal vein. It was found that adenine nucleotide levels were almost doubled in the ROP-preserved kidneys, principally due to higher adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations. It was shown that cytochrome oxidase activity was unaffected by ischemia or preservation method, but studies with the metabolic inhibitors ouabain and a mixture of cyanide and iodoacetate suggested that ATP was being synthesized during the storage period but was also being utilized to power the active volume-regulating pump. Morphological examination revealed a much greater degree of cell swelling and cytological injury in the kidneys not subject to ROP, and the interstitial space appeared much reduced in the latter group. At the ultrastructural level, the ROP-treated kidneys showed generally well-preserved mitochondria, mostly in the energized “orthodox” configuration. In contrast, the mitochondria in the nonpersufflated kidneys were generally in the “condensed” deenergized state. We conclude that the provision of sufficient oxygen by ROP allows the continued production of ATP in sufficient quantities to permit improved maintenance of cellular volume and morphology under the conditions of low-temperature storage that we have studied. © 1989 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.",,"adenosine triphosphate; radioisotope; animal cell; histology; ischemia; kidney preservation; nonhuman; organ perfusion; oxygenation; priority journal; rabbit; Adenine Nucleotides; Animal; Cyanides; Cytochrome-c Oxidase; Energy Metabolism; Iodoacetates; Iodoacetic Acid; Kidney; Kidney Cortex; Kidney Transplantation; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Microscopy, Electron; Mitochondria; Organ Preservation; Ouabain; Oxygen; Perfusion; Rabbits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024411755

At birth, the distribution of muscle fibres and the activity of enzymes in muscle are different from in adults, but these differences disappear at about age 6. On the other hand, muscle fibre thickness increases from birth to about 18 years of age and this is concurrent with increases in muscular strength. The increase in maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2 max) ihat accompanies growth and maturation in the human has been attributed in the main to appreciating muscle mass. During exercise, heart rate and cardiac output increase in the child as in the adult, but the heart rate in the child is greater and the stroke volume smaller. Furthermore, the arteriovenous difference in oxygen is greater in the exercising child than in the adult. Children also evidence a diminished blood pressure response to exercise. It seems that control of ventilation at exercise is the same in children as in adults, but exercise ventilation has been reported to be less efficient in the child. The young are less capable of regulating core temperature at exercise than adults and are more readily dehydrated. Very limited data suggest that muscle energy substrate storage and utilisation in children are such that they are less capable of anaerobic metabolism than adults. Generally, children respond to aerobic training as do adults, but such training in the first decade of life has been reported to have negligible effects. Blood lipid levels in children seem to be favourably influenced by persistent endurance activity. Ventilatory efficiency of children at exercise is augmented by aerobic training. Maximal values of ventilation and breathing frequency are increased in children and youth by endurance training. Conflicting data exist regarding the influence of training upon the child’s vital capacity. Pulmonary diffusion capacity in well trained children has been seen to be greater than in untrained youngsters and many workers have reported increased V̇O2max as an outcome of endurance training. Limited data indicate that the nature of training may alter muscle fibre distribution in youthful athletes, and that muscle fibre hypertrophy can be induced in the young by means of strength and power training. That training alters muscle enzyme activity in young athletes remains debatable. There is little doubt that training stimulates bone growth in young humans. This stimulatory effect seems to be related to gains in muscular strength. The concern has been advanced that very intense physical training may retard skeletal growth. Very little research has been directed toward the effect of training upon hormone secretion and sensitivity in young individuals, but it is possible that habitual training facilitates fat utilisation at exercise, leading to reduced body fat and blood lipid levels. It has often been hypothesised that intense early training delays menarche, but this is not well supported by scientific data. Superior muscular strength bears upon youthful athletic success. Although strength training is more effective in postpubertal males, resistance training of young children can be both safe and useful. Some risk is involved when training young athletes. However, in view of the well documented dangers of sedentariness, the favourable outcomes of early athletic training clearly outweigh the risks. © 1989, ADIS Press Limited.

The potential between two reference electrodes located at the bulk solutions bathing the two sides of a membrane is the membrane potential. However, the applications of microelectrodes to organelles, small cells, and vesicles are severely limited because of size limitation. Thus, the methods used in these systems are mostly indirect.

A partial equilibrium condition is incorporated into the model which accounts for both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic chemical interaction between aqueous and solid phases. The model solves for aqueous and mineral phase compositions as function of time and space. A correct mineral assemblage is automatically searched for based on the principle of minimized Gibbs free energy. The mass of chemicals is conserved in both aqueous and solid phases. A two‐step dynamic mixing algorithm is used to solve the coupled transport and reaction equations. At each time step, the transport equation is first solved by the explicit difference method. The chemical equilibrium submodel is then called to calculate the distribution of chemical species under thermodynamic partial equilibrium conditions. By splitting the transport and reaction equations, the two‐step method significantly reduces computational time and memory storage requirements, which allows DYNAMIX to efficiently handle two‐ or three‐dimensional problems.

The ""gold standard"" for body fat is the body density from which fat and fat-free body mass can be calculated. The new technique of bioelectric impedance analysis may substantially improve the estimation of total body fat. For estimating regional fat distribution, either waist to hip circumference ratio or subscapular skinfold have been most useful. Using the body mass index, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kilogram per square meter), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 26%, or 34 million, adult Americans aged 20 to 75 were overweight. The prevalence of severe overweight (a body mass index above 30 kg/m2) is higher in the United States and Canada than in Great Britain, the Netherlands, or Australia. Obesity results from an increase in energy intake relative to expenditure. Total daily energy expenditure includes energy used during resting metabolism, energy associated with the ingestion of food, and energy needed for physical activity. The obese are often observed to be less active, but since carrying a heavier load requires more energy, their total energy expenditure may not be low. A low resting metabolic rate has been sugested as a predictor of future risk of becoming obese. Adipose tissue is the major site for fat storage and may contain more than 90% of total energy stores. The increase in body mass index or degree of body weight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, gall bladder disease, and diabetes mellitus. When fat is centrally located in either males or females, the risk for these diseases is also increased, and may be a more important risk factor than total overweight itself. Genetic factors form the background from which obesity develops. The best estimates suggest that these genetic factors may be of less importance than environmental events in determination of total body fat and its distribution. Obesity can be classified on the basis of the total number of fat cells and regional fat distribution by using the etiological factors which caused the obesity or by determining the age at which the obesity began. Regardless of the cause, treatment for obesity should be based on an evaluation of the individual's risk from obesity as compared with the risk of the treatment under consideration. Low-risk treatments, such as modest caloric restriction, exercise, and behavioral strategies, are appropriate for individuals with low risk from obesity. As the risk increases with a rising body mass index, the use of pharmacologic agents, very low calorie diets and, for those in the very high risk category (body mass index above 40 kg/m2), surgical treatments. Behavioral strategies appear to be among the most effective in dealing with obesity and should be a part of any treatment program. © 1989.",,"human; obesity; priority journal; short survey; Female; Human; Male; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024390939

Diets comprising oils mixed with laboratory diets at 10% oil w/w were fed ad libitum for 3 weeks. Animals fed laboratory diets were used as controls. Body composition was determined before and after the feeding period using 3H2O distribution space. Oxygen consumption was measured in each animal during the final week. Weight gains of groups fed corn and olive oil diets exceeded those of the group fed laboratory diet alone (p &lt; 0.05), although metabolizable energy intakes were similar across groups. Corn oil fed animals demonstrated higher carcass energy gains as fat compared with laboratory diet fed or menhaden oil fed groups. This was reflected in an increased fractional deposition of metabolizable energy intake in the group fed corn oil diet compared with the latter two groups. Fecal energy losses were lower in the group fed corn oil diet, and higher in the group fed laboratory diet alone, compared with other groups. Oxygen consumption did not differ between groups. These findings indicate that feeding dietary fish oil, compared with corn oil, favours energy substrate oxidation reducing the fraction of metabolizable energy partitioned for storage.","Dietary fatty acids; Energy balance; Energy Expenditure; Hamster","coconut oil; corn oil; fatty acid; menhaden oil; olive oil; radioisotope; animal cell; animal experiment; article; body composition; caloric intake; controlled study; energy expenditure; fat intake; hamster; male; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024387785

Nitrate was first removed from urine by an anion-exchange procedure that prevented the significant loss of various added reference NOC and unidentified urinary NOC. The total NOC were then determined by injecting the urine sample (nitrate content <1 mmol l-1) or anion-exchange eluate into refluxing ethyl acetate containing either acetic acid for determining heat and acetic acid labile thermal energy analyser responsive compounds (TAC) or into hydrogen bromide for the determination of TAC and NOC. The nitrogen monoxide levels released were measured using thermal energy analysis with chemiluminescence detection, and the difference between the two determinations represented the concentrations of NOC. The optimum conditions for preventing artefactual nitrosation in urine samples by the addition of sodium hydroxide or sulphamic acid without decomposition of NOC were determined. The influence of time and storage conditions on NOC stability was investigated. Fifteen urine samples collected from volunteers dosed with proline were analysed for total NOC and N-nitrosamino acids revealing a preponderance of unknown NOC. The determination of total NOC in human urine using this group-selective method offers a new approach to the estimation of human exposure to NOC and to isolate hitherto unknown NOC and their metabolites.","N-nitroso compound; Nitrate removal; Stabilisation and storage; Thermal energy analysis; Urine analysis","nitroso derivative; anion exchange chromatography; assay; human; human cell; methodology; thermal analysis; urine; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Human; Nitrates; Nitroso Compounds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024385006

The frequency of manipulatory movements during tactile recognition was twice that of tactile learning. Tactile recognition with the right hand increased rCMRO2 in six prefrontal cortical areas, bilaterally in the supplementary motor areas, the premotor areas and supplementary sensory areas, in the left primary motor and primary sensory area, in the left anterior superior parietal lobule, bilaterally in the secondary somatosensory area, the anterior insula, lingual gyri, hippocampus, basal ganglia, anterior parasagittal cerebellum, and lobus posterior cerebelli. These structures have in other studies been found to participate in manipulatory movements and analysis of somatosensory information. Tactile learning increased rCMRO2 in the same structures as did tactile recognition. Thus we found no differences in the anatomical structures participating in storage and retrieval. However the rCMRO2 increases in the left premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and left somatosensory hand area were larger during tactile recognition in accordance with the higher frequency of manipulatory movements and higher flux of somatosensory information from the periphery during recognition. Despite this the rCMRO2 was significantly higher in the neocerebellar cortex during tactile learning. Since there were no learning effects on the manipulatory movements, this extra metabolic activity in the lateral cerebellum was attributed to energy demanding processes associated with climbing fibre activity during storage of somatosensory information.

Liver attenuation was determined in 100 patients (46 cases of idiopathic hemochromatosis, 32 cases of chronic liver disease, and 22 normal controls). The iron load was determined for the first two groups by biochemical determination of liver iron concentration (performed in all but 12 subjects in the chronic liver disease group) and hepatic histologic grading. The main results for liver attenuation (upper normal limit, 72 Hounsfield units) showed that despite a high specificity (0.96), this parameter was of low sensitivity (0.63). Although mean liver attenuation in idiopathic hemochromatosis (77 ± 14) was significantly higher than in chronic liver diseases (53 ± 17; p &lt; 10-4) and normal controls (66 ± 3; p &lt; 10-3), and despite an overall good correlation between liver attenuation and liver iron concentration (r = 0.72; p &lt; 10-3), liver attenuation was unable to detect moderate iron overload. Fourteen of 18 patients with a liver iron concentration of &lt;150 μmol/g dry liver wt had liver attenuation values of &lt;72. Moreover, 3 of 18 subjects with a liver iron concentration of &gt;150 had a liver attenuation of &lt;72. Of these 17 false-negatives, only 7 could be attributed to associated steatosis. On the whole, single-energy computed tomography, when used on a routine basis for diagnosing iron overload, is of limited clinical value in idiopathic hemochromatosis due to its poor sensitivity. Hepatic histologic examination together with biochemical determination remains the most accurate means to assess liver iron. © 1989.",,"transferrin; adult; computer analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; fatty liver; female; hemochromatosis; human; iron overload; iron storage; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Comparative Study; Fatty Liver, Alcoholic; Female; Hemochromatosis; Human; Iron; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Age; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024351914

Forty studies were conducted in 29 full-term surgical infants (mean weight, 3.27±0.19 kg; mean days postsurgery, 8±1). Nineteen infants were receiving total parenteral nutrition, 13 were orally fed, and eight received a combination of intravenous and oral nutrition (mean caloric intake, 84±4 kcal/kg/d). Each study was comprised of a three-day nutritional balance measuring energy intake and energy losses in excreta. Metabolizable energy intake (MEI) was determined by subtracting losses from gross intake. Energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation were determined on the second day of the balance using continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry in combination with timed urinary nitrogen excretion. Energy and macronutrient storage were calculated by subtracting oxidation and losses from measured intake. The mean global energy expenditure was 57±1 kcal/kg/d. Linear regression analysis of the nutritional balance data allowed estimates of energy, fat, and protein storage at various MEI. The data suggest that in the surgical infant, protein balance is maintained, even during hypocaloric nutritional regimens. In infants receiving adequate calories to maintain energy balance, maintenance metabolism is supported by the oxidation of endogenous fat.

Cooldown and excitation tests of the magnet were carried out with the detector in its final configuration. The coil is made with a fully stabilized superconductor wound into an eight layer cylinder with a 2.39 m inner diameter, a 2.58 m outer diameter and 1.54 m in length. An outer jacket of thick stainless steel was shrunk-fit around the coil to provide strength to contain the magnetic forces and to serve as a liquid helium container for the pool boiling cooling system for the coil. A computer controlled refrigeration system with a capacity of 300 W at 4.4. K (100 l/h) was prepared to cool down the 17 t of cold mass of the magnet. It took about five days to cool down from room temperature and achieve a superconducting state, and an additional two days to completely fill the coil with liquid helium and to prepare for the excitation of the magnet. The thermal stresses on the coil support rods were evenly balanced during the cooldown, and the mechanical stresses on the support rods at full excitation (a current of 5000 A) were well below the allowed maximum. In order to verify the safe operation of the magnet system, we carried out fast discharge tests with a time constant of 21 s, which was optimized to protect the magnet from quench. The pressure rise in the helium vessel during the discharge from 5000 A was an easily manageable 1.38 × 105 Pa. During the fast discharge of the 5000 A excitation, the coil showed no signs of developing any normal regions. At the maximum rated current of 5000 A, the central magnetic field and the inductance were measured to be 3.0367 and 3.2 H, respectively, corresponding to a stored energy of 40 MJ, in good agreement with magnetic field calculations. During these tests and in the succeeding long term operation, the magnet showed excellent stability and reliability. © 1989.",,"Accelerators--Storage Rings; Cryogenics; Particle Detectors--Components; Spectrometers--Components; AMY Detector; Coil Support Rod Stress; Pool Boiling Cooling System; Tristan Storage Ring; Superconducting Magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024303971

At the same time, however, it will represent a technical achievement unparalleled in the history of science and engineering. This in turn would mean, in retrospect, that decisive contributions had to come from a number of disciplines as diverse as materials and engineering sciences and classical chemistry, and that the same collaboration will have to continue in the future in order to reach the ultimate goal, to construct a reactor capable of producing energy from almost inexhaustible source materials (fuels), such as deuterium and lithium. What is the chemist's role in this development? Similarly as in the development of fission reactors, i.e., the nuclear power plants currently in operation, chemists will have to ensure the existence of a reliable fuel cycle–starting from the availability, storage and reprocessing of the fuel through to the provision for safe storage of the waste. In this review article an attempt will be made to outline the problems associated with these tasks and the approaches to be made by the chemist in solving them.

Sulfate accumulated in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells. During 9 days of sulfate uptake by the seedlings the sulfate concentration in the vacuoles increased by a factor of about 10 or more, whereas the sulfate concentration in chloroplasts increased by a factor of less than 2. Maximal vacuolar sulfate levels were above l00 mol m−3 5 days after the sulfate concentration in the hydrophonic nutrient solution was increased to 300 mol m−3. Higher sulfate levels were not tolerated by the seedlings. Isolated vacuoles did not leak much endogenous sulfate even under a diminished transtonoplast proton gradient as long as the membrane potential remained significant. Rapid loss of sulfate occurred when both the proton gradient and the membrane potential were dissipated. External tracer sulfate was taken up by isolated vacuoles more rapidly in the presence than in the absence of ATP. The rate of uptake increased nonlinearly with concentration at low sulfate concentrations, with and without ATP being present. At high concentrations, uptake was linear with concentration only in the presence of ATP. ATP-stimulated sulfate uptake resulted in the vacuolar accumulation of sulfate against its concentration gradient. ATP-stimulated sulfate uptake by isolated vacuoles was inhibited by agents which are known to inhibit vectorial proton translocation into the vacuoles by the tonoplast ATPase. pCMBS inhibited sulfate transport both in the presence and in the absence of ATP, and particularly pronounced inhibition was observed at sulfate concentrations below 1 mol m −3, i.e. in the saturable range of the uptake kinetics. In the absence of a membrane potential, transfer of labelled sulfate across the tonoplast was inhibited significantly only by a large excess of chloride, nitrate, phosphate, or unlabelled sulfate, but not by malate. The main cation accompanying sulfate during net uptake into the vacuole was K+. It appeared to be taken up in exchange against H+. The transfer capacity of the tonoplast sulfate transporter is more than sufficient to account for temporary vacuolar storage of sulfate produced from SO2 during exposure of barley leaves to air polluted with 140 or 400μg SO2 m −3. These concentrations are considered to be permissible, at least temporarily, according to Federal regulation. Vacuolar detoxification of the sulfuric acid formed from SO2 appeared to be limited by the vacuolar capacity for proton storage, and not by that for sulfate storage. © 1989, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

The matrix element behavior of a special transition supports the suggestion by Wern et al. [Z. Phys. B. 60, 293 (1985)] to shift the one-electron states above the Fermi energy upward by 0.7 eV as an approximation to the excited states, though the experimental band mapping indicates that this shift should be energy dependent. Furthermore, a contribution of a second final-state band could be identified by our spin-resolving technique. Another positively polarized structure at the Fermi edge showing no detectable dispersion could not be interpreted in terms of direct bulk transitions.

Liquid-junction cells not only offer the possibility of integrating energy conversion and storage functions1, but also may exhibit electrical properties that are fundamentally different from those in solid-state systems2. We have investigated the photovoltaic behaviour of n-InP/metal and n-InP/liquid junctions. We have found that the electrical properties of these semiconductor/liquid junctions are superior to those of n-InP/metal (Schottky barrier) systems, and that the current-voltage characteristics are a strong function of the electrochemical potential of the liquid phase. Liquid contacts thus provide a possibility for the construction of more efficient photovoltaic devices than those available at present from Schottky barriers. © 1989 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008811050

Twenty-four different basis sets (ranging from minimal to triple-zeta plus polarization) have been used to compute the interaction energies of four conformations of two alanine molecules interacting through their respective carboxylic groups giving rise to a double hydrogen-bonded association. The basis set superposition error has been calculated in all the cases by using the functional counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi. It is shown that the basis set superposition error is still important at the double-zeta and valence triple-zeta levels of accuracy. In most cases the correction by the counterpoise method seems to be adequate providing interaction energies which, when compared with the uncorrected ones, are in better agreement with those coming from the largest basis set used in this work (full triple-zeta plus polarization). The use of basis sets which have a relatively small basis set superposition error (GEOLARGE, GEOTRIPLEZ, 6-31G**, 6-31G** ++(ss), 13,8/5,3*], [13,8/5,3**], and GEOTRIPLEZ**) in projects involving systems of biological interest, require both, computational time and storage capacity, which by far exceed what is generally affordable. The use of appropriately designed minimal basis sets together with the counterpoise correction constitutes a reasonably good approach to such systems. © 1989 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006484199

It thus becomes necessary to examine the ways fluctuations may influence protein-protein association processes and the communication between associated proteins which makes free-energy management possible. This contribution is a first step in this examination. The dynamical possibilities are grouped into two dynamical factors both of which are sensitive to the degree of matching of the dynamical spectra of the associated proteins. A mechanism for free-energy storage and redistribution based on alterations of dynamic spectra is elaborated in some detail using hemoglobin as a model, since the mechanism appears to be responsible for linkage in that protein. However, hemoglobin may not be an entirely satisfactory prototype for some other kinds of proteins, e.g., enzymes, which are built using the knot-matrix principle, since there are good reasons for suspecting that hemoglobin folding is based on a different construction principle. Some consequences of the two principles for fluctuation behavior are discussed particularly as they influence activated free-volume rearrangements, which appear to form the most important class of fluctuation phenomena. Knot-matrix proteins probably have fewer substates and fewer large-amplitude fluctuations, but the limited experimental information suggests that the dynamical factors are important for this class as well. The participation of the dynamical factors in single-subunit and multiple-subunit enzymes is examined in terms of the redistributions of free energy and free volume which are associated with the closing of the cleft between two domains. It is shown that the high degree of specificity in protein-protein associations and substrate selection can be established by adjustments of conformational fluctuations, adjustments made by residue changes and thus available for evolutionary experiments by simple changes in DNA. Strictly speaking thermodynamics can be applied only to dynamics at equilibrium but these may include fluctuations into most of the conformational states involved in enzymic catalysis. Thermodynamic fluctuation theory is introduced to examine the consequences of this simplification; e.g., linear-response behavior, fractal-like probability distributions. These form a basis for integration of empirical information about protein dynamics chemical species is an active participant. Perhaps this complexity can be achieved without utilization of the fluctuation behavior of the species but it is more likely that some supplement to the chemical natures and average geometries of the species is necessary. Conformational fluctuation behavior appears to be the only supplement available. To be useful the fluctuation behavior of the other macromolecules and structured arrays must be utilized in the same ways we propose for proteins. Membranes, for example, as a result of weak first-order phase changes develop near the midpoints of these transitions resonance conditions in which free-volume fluctuations are very large. Such fluctuations appear to labilize transport enzymes in the membranes72 and probably regulate passive permeation. Since the conformations and assembly of all biological macrospecies depend on secondary interactions, they must have similar dynamic spectra. It is thus likely that if dynamic matching is important for proteins, it is also important for other macrospecies in their assembly, functions and communication with other macrospecies. The three major requirements for tissue assembly are recognition, stability in association and cooperativity. As has been shown here all three can rest on a single dynamical basis. The additional requirement of mutability is automatically satisfied because the adjustments in all three are made by changes in DNA. The importance of dynamical behavior in biology has been appreciated for a very long time. To many readers the proposal that conformational fluctuations are a major source of such behavior is novel only in the mechanisms we propose. Conformations have the dynamical characteristics necessary to support the dynamical factors we have discussed but the quantitative significance of these factors may be insignificant. On the other hand, they may be so large that many biological mechanisms cannot be better understood until conformational fluctuations are better characterized. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006090635

The Bose-Einstein correlation is studied as a function of Q2, the four-momentum difference squared of the pair, and of Q32, an analogous quantity defined for triplets. After corrections for Coulomb effects and pion misidentification, pair analyses indicate a nearly full Bose-Einstein enhancement (1) in the J and the two-photon data, and about half the maximum value in the two higher-energy data sets. The pair analysis parameter r lies within a band of ±0.1 fm around 0.7 fm and is essentially the same for all four data sets. Pion triplet analyses give consistent results for the triplet parameters 3 and r3.

We report here the monitoring of photosynthetic energy storage in a Photosystem II submembrane fraction. The data are treated using an analogy to enzyme kinetics. The semi-reciprocal plot of the energy storage yield (′r) against the modulated measuring beam light intensity (I) provided an energy storage yield extrapolated at i = 0 (′r0), and a half-saturation beam intensity (i50). The energy storage reaction was characterized by a ′r0 of 42% in all the conditions used. However, the valueof i50 was affected by electron-transport inhibitors, artificial electron acceptors, and by the measuring beam wavelength. It was inferred that ′r monitored at any given measuring beam intensity varies with i50 in close relation to the electron-transport rate monitored as oxygen evolution. We proposed, from the data presented, that the energy storage monitored in photoacoustic experiments is related to the reduction of the plastoquinone pool. © 1989 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Most crops of tropical and subtropical origin are sensitive to chilling injury. Some crops of Temperate Zone origin are also susceptible. These crops are injured by low, but nonfreezing, temperatures. At these temperatures, the tissues weaken because they are unable to carry on normal metabolic processes. Various physiological and biochemical alterations occur in the sensitive species in response to low-temperature exposure. These alterations lead to the development of a variety of chilling injury symptoms, such as surface pitting, discoloration, internal breakdown, failure to ripen, growth inhibition, wilting, loss of flavor, and decay. This review article describes the changes in membrane lipids, permeability, proteins, carbohydrates, energy supply, respiration, ethylene production, and other metabolic processes that are affected by chilling temperatures. Methods for alleviation of chilling injury-such as temperature preconditioning, intermittent warming; chëmical treatments, hormonal regulation, controlled atmosphere storage, genetic manipulation, and other methods-are also discussed. © 1989 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001294307

Thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) analyses revealed that lipids of females were composed primarily of triacylglycerols (81%), the principal energy storage lipid of amphipods. Lipids of juveniles were composed largely of triacylglycerols (41%) and phospholipids (44%). Adult male P. hoyi lipids consisted mostly of phospholipids (64%) and, secondarily, of triacylglycerols (12%). The relatively low triacylglycerol concentrations in males may be associated with the minimal requirements for energy stores to support metabolic needs during the male's brief (10 day) life span. By contrast, the high lipid content and marked abundance of triacylglycerols in adult females represents an important energy store supporting subsequent egg development, particularly since females appear to halt all feeding upon maturation. In juvenile P. hoyi, increased individual size (NLDW) was accompanied by increased lipid dry weight, implying that juveniles accumulate lipids during growth. Overall, the results demonstrated the importance of considering P. hoyi size, life stage, and sex when describing a population's lipid content or composition. This consideration is particularly critical when evaluating the role of P. hoyi in the transfer of energy and/or organic contaminants within the Great Lakes food web. © 1989, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

This has become possible by the recent development of numerical methods for the solution of stiff differential /algebraic equation systems together with the availability of fast computers with high storage capacity. Computations of ignition processes are performed by solving the corresponding conservation equations (i.e., conservation of total mass, momentum, energy, and species mass) using a detailed reaction mechanism for the ozone-oxygen system (consisting of six elementary reactions) and a multispecies transport model. Thermal ignition is simulated by an additional source term in the energy conservation equation. Spatial discretization on a two-dimensional grid that is adapted statically in two spatial directions leads to a differential/ algebraic equation system which is solved numerically by an implicit extrapolation method to overcome stiffness problems caused by the multiscale character of the system considered.

The measured cross section ratio {Mathematical expression} indicates that D* production accounts for a large fraction of the observed charm production. Two complementary methods have been used to determine the forward-backward asymmetry of charm pair production due to electroweak interference. Combining both measurements the product of the axial vector couplings of the electron and the charm quark to the weak neutral current was determined to be gA egA c=-(0.276±0.073), in agreement with the standard model prediction of -0.25. Using a sample of reconstructed D*± mesons, the relative strength of the strong interaction coupling of the c quark compared to that of an average of all flavours is measured as αs(c)/αs(all)=0.91±0.38±0.15, consistent with the coupling constant being flavour independent.
