Characteristics of 405 nm wavelength laser diodes (LDs) are discussed. Reducing threading dislocation can increase the lifetime of nitride LDs. Using epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique, the dislocation density of the order of 105 cm-2 has been obtained. The relation between the lifetime of nitride LDs and the density of dislocation are discussed. Some optical and electrical properties are very important for optical disk system such as digital versatile disk (DVD) system. In use of the DVD system, important properties of nitride LDs are discussed. Furthermore, near-ultraviolet LDs and pure-blue LDs are described. The near-ultraviolet LDs uses GaN or AlInGaN active layer instead of InGaN.","Dislocation; GaN; InGaN; Laser; Lifetime; Quantum well; Ultraviolet","Band structure; Composition; Electron beams; Epitaxial growth; Lattice constants; Light emitting diodes; Semiconducting indium compounds; Semiconductor lasers; Semiconductor quantum wells; Ultraviolet radiation; Videodisks; Aluminum compounds; Data storage equipment; Dislocations (crystals); Energy gap; Gallium compounds; Gallium nitride; Indium compounds; Lasers; Nitrides; Quantum well lasers; Semiconductor quantum wells; Ultraviolet lasers; Videodisks; Dislocation; InGaN; Lifetime; Ultraviolet; Gallium nitride; Wide band gap semiconductors; Density of dislocation; Digital versatile disk systems; Dislocation densities; Epitaxial lateral overgrowth; InGaN; Lifetime; Optical and electrical properties; Ultraviolet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542287627

In this method, the constant rewriting is conducted in the normal state or dropout state, so this data restoring is inefficient in terms of the restoring speed and the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a dynamic dropout data restoring technique in the FTHM. In this dynamic technique, the strength of the rewriting effect change in proportion to dropout level, i.e. if dropout level becomes large, the strength of the rewriting effect also becomes large automatically. Therefore, this dynamic technique can improve the restoring speed and reduce the energy consumption for restoring. First, we analyze the temporal response of the output efficiency and the hologram. Next we analyze the dependency of the output efficiency on the coupling strength in the two crystals and the incident condition of two beams, and estimate the coupling strength threshold and the ratio of the incident beams in order to maintain the stored data. Finally, we experiment on the dropout data restoring by using BaTiO3 as photorefractive crystal, and achieve the data restoring for 2-3 seconds and the over 25 minutes readout.","Fault-tolerant; Four-wave mixing; Holographic memory; Photorefractive effect","Barium titanate; Crystals; Fault tolerant computer systems; Four wave mixing; Holograms; Optical data storage; Optical recording; Photoreactivity; Photorefractive materials; Constant rewriting method; Holographic memory; Holography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345375408

To reduce this effect, the electrodes of instruments are usually covered with electroconductive light- absorptive coatings having low reflectivity at the wavelength of 121.6 nm. In this paper the physical mechanisms are considered applicable to reduce the reflectivity of the Al-based coatings to be applied on electrodes of the particle analyzing instruments. Particular emphasis has been given to the role of three phenomena: (i) multiple light scattering in light traps of the rough surface, (ii) diffraction of the incident light at the rough surface of the coating, and (iii) electron scattering in a skin layer. It is presented the behavior of reflectivity of the Al-based coating in the course of mechanical and environmental tests simulating standard shipping, storage, launching, flight, and operating conditions of the space equipment. The noise measurements of the Faraday cups used on board the INTERBALL-1 mission are also given. As the hydrogen is the most prevalent substance in the Universe, perhaps, the 121.6 nm stray light problem is the common one not only for the solar wind missions and solar astrophysics telescopes, but also for the Far UV astronomy and future UV space astrophysics missions.","121.6 nm; Light-absorptive coating; Solar wind; Stray light","Airborne telescopes; Aluminum; Computer simulation; Electrodes; Light absorption; Light scattering; Reflection; Space research; Surface roughness; Ultraviolet detectors; Ultraviolet radiation; Solar astrophysics telescopes; Solar wind; Stray light reduction; Astrophysics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038192419

In this paper, we use diffractive superresolution technology to design a pure-phase plate for realizing the smaller spot size than the usual Airy spot size. We have calculated 2,3,4,5 circulation zones for optimizing the highest energy compression (Strelratio) with the constraint of the Firstzero value G=0.8. Numerical results show that the 2-circular zone pure-phase plate can yield the highest Strelratio (S=0.59) with the constraint of G=0.8. The 3-circular zone pure-phase plate with the respective phases of Φ1Φ2Φ3 has also been calculated. At the same time the 4,5 circular zone binary phase (0,π) plates are calculated to yield the result of S = 0.57 with G=0.8. The usage of the superresolution phase plate aims to realize the smaller spot size instead of the usage of the higher numerical aperture lens, which is the main advantage of this superresolution technology. Therefore, in this constraint of G=0.8, we have selected the 2-circular zone with binary phase for ease of fabrication. At last, we use a 50 nanometer fiber tip detector to scan the diffractive superresolution light spot in order to compare it with the Airy spot.

Study of the crystallization behavior of the films is very necessary to the optimization of film composition and dopants. This work dedicates our experimental investigation on the crystallization behavior of oxygen-doped Ge-Sb-Te phase change films, which were prepared by RF-sputtering. The crystallization behavior of the thin films was investigated using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). XRD spectra of the films in the as-deposited and heat-treated states show that the films changed from amorphous to crystalline states due to heat-treatment. By measuring the peak temperature of crystallization at different heating rates we calculated the crystallization activation energies and frequency factors.

To analyze the energy dissipation, we develop a high-level model using domain-specific modeling techniques. In this model, we identify architecture parameters that significantly affect the total energy (system-wide energy) dissipation. Then, we explore design trade-offs by varying these parameters to minimize the system-wide energy. For matrix multiplication, we consider a uniprocessor architecture and a linear array architecture to develop energy-efficient designs. For the uniprocessor architecture, the cache size is a parameter that affects the I/O complexity and the system-wide energy. For the linear array architecture, the amount of storage per processing element is a parameter affecting the system-wide energy. By using maximum amount of storage per processing element and minimum number of multipliers, we obtain a design that minimizes the system-wide energy. We develop several energy-efficient designs for matrix multiplication.

In each case channeling to the conversion site generally entails a multi-step energy transfer mechanism whose efficiency is determined by the arrangement and electronic properties of the array chromophores or ions, guided in the more complex systems by a spectroscopic gradient that promotes overall directionality. The functional cascade molecules known as photoactive dendrimers are exemplars of this approach. The latest developments involve new mechanisms for concerted excitation transfer in multichromophore systems, leading towards the tailoring and exploitation of optical nonlinearities for high intensity energy pooling applications.","Dendrimers; Energy harvesting; Nonlinear optics; Optoelectronics; Photoactive materials; Photonics; Photosynthesis; Solar energy","Chromophores; Crystals; Dendrimers; Energy resources; Large scale systems; Nonlinear optics; Optoelectronic devices; Photosynthesis; Separation; Energy harvesting; Materials science",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036422106

Laser output power, Pout ≥ 10W and beam divergence, θ ≤ 90μrad are available from a single-unit medium-scale (2cm-bore × 50cm) medium-power (10-20W) CuBr laser fitted with a positive-branch unstable resonator of medium (M=73-100) magnification. Laser spatial intensity, Pout/θ2 increases 5 times compared with the case of no hydrogen added (1390W.mrad-2 and 280W.mrad-2, respectively). Electrical field potential measurements in Ne-H2 mixtures show that comparison with the pure-Ne-gas case, the near-electrode E-fields are nearly of a factor of 2 lower whereas the far-from-electrode E-field is almost of a factor of 6 higher as the pressure of H2 additive reaches 0.37 Torr. Energy dissipation in the CuBr laser electrodes has been studied in a typical gaseous environment and with discharge length scaling. The power lost in the electrodes significantly increases not only with a decrease in electrode separation but also more compounds are added to the medium. The total energy dissipated in both electrodes varies between 10% and 30% of the storage capacitor energy.","Beam quality; Copper laser; Electric potential measurement; Electrodes","Copper compounds; Electric field effects; Electric potential; Electric properties; Electric variables measurement; Electrodes; Hydrogen; Laser beam effects; Optical properties; Beam divergence; Copper bromide laser; Laser spatial intensity; Storage capacitor energy; Chemical lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036408107

For many applications this entire range must be present on the same substrate with the upper end serving as decoupling capacitors and the lower end providing a variety of filtering, timing, coupling, RF and A/D functions. There are many thin film candidate materials and processes for dielectrics including ferroelectrics and paraelectrics formed by sputtering, anodization, CVD, sol-gel, etc. as well as polymers and ferroelectric/polymer composites. It is difficult, if not impossible, for any single dielectric material and capacitor configuration to provide this entire range without the lowest valued components occupying too small an area or exhibiting excessively high series resistance. Therefore, it will often be necessary to mix integrated capacitor technologies on a single substrate. Paraelectrics are more suitable for integrated capacitors in the 1 - 100 pF range because their low specific capacitance enables them to be formed with sufficiently large sizes; ferroelectrics would give footprints too small to be fabricated with acceptable precision. Also, the dielectric behavior of paraelectrics are more stable with regard to bias, frequency, temperature and time which is important to the functions delivered by low-valued caps. On the other end of the spectrum, ferroelectrics are better for decoupling and energy storage where high k is more important than stability.","Dielectric; Integrated capacitor; Integrated passive","Capacitance; Chemical vapor deposition; Dielectric materials; Ferroelectric materials; Polymers; Sol-gels; Sputtering; Temperature; Anodization; Paraelectrics; Thin film integrated capacitor; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036389389

In order to improve the efficiency of an active isolation system we analyze different feedback control strategies which will provide an electrical energy regeneration. In this case, the power is flowing from the mechanical disturbance through the electromechanical actuator and its switching drive into the electrical storage device (batteries or capacitors). We demonstrate that regeneration occurs when controlling one or both of the flow states (velocity and current). This regenerative control strategy also affects the closed loop dynamics. The regenerative control applied to a voice-coil actuator results in a closed loop system which has a reduced amount of damping compared to the initial system. In fact the regenerative control strategy will increase the level of vibration compared to the closed electrical circuit boundary condition in order to make the system absorb more energy, of which a part is transfered to an electrical storage device. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.","Electromechanical system; Optimization; Power flow; Power harvesting; State-space control","Actuators; Boundary conditions; Damping; Feedback control; Optimization; Power amplifiers; State space methods; Electromechanical systems; Systems analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036380342

In response to concern about increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), resulting from increase in global energy use, the cycling of carbon has become the object of many intensive investigations. Terrestrial ecosystems are a huge, natural biological scrubber for CO2 currently sequestering, directly from the atmosphere, about 22% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. It is assumed that a significant fraction of this carbon uptake goes into roots. Presently, there are no means by which root morphology, distribution, and mass can be measured without serious sampling artifacts that alter these properties. This is because the current methods are destructive and labor intensive. A non-invasive, imaging procedure for examining roots in situ would be a powerful tool quantifying subsurface storage, as well as for documenting changes in root structure. Preliminary results using a high frequency, 1.5 Ghz, impulse Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for nondestructive imaging of tree root systems in situ are presented.

The compounds generate various kinds of sulfonic acids, such as n-propane, n-octane, camphor and p-toluene sulfonic acid under Deep-UV exposure and are applicable for chemically amplified (CA) photoresists. The application-relevant properties of the compounds such as solubility in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), ethyl lactate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate, and 2-heptanone, UV absorption, thermal stability with or without poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS), storage stability in a neat form or in PGMEA solution with or without additives, sensitivity in a model resist formulation, dissolution inhibition efficiency during the development process and volatility were evaluated. The compounds exhibit good solubility in PGMEA, high sensitivity in positive tone CA resist formulations, with Deep-UV exposure, and no significant volatility. Especially it was found that the compounds are superior in terms of thermal stability and storage stability, i.e., high thermal stability up to 188 °C in a phenolic matrix, and no change during storage in PGMEA at 60°C for 5 months. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.","Chemically amplified resists; DUV; Non-ionic; PAG; Stability","Activation energy; Dissolution; Fabrication; Light absorption; Semiconductor device manufacture; Thermodynamic stability; Ultraviolet radiation; Photoacid generators (PAG); Photoresists",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036028911

The constitutive equations describe the one-way and two-way shape memory effect as well as pseudoelasticity, pseudoplasticity and the transition range between pseudoelasticity and pseudoplasticity. The material model is based on a free energy function as well as evolution equations for internal variables. In detail, the free energy function is introduced in order to describe the energy storage during thermoelastic processes, the energy difference between the regarded phases (austenite and martensite) as well as the energy storage due to the evolution of the residual stresses. In contrast to this, the evolution equations for the internal variables represent the observed inelastic behavior of shape memory alloys as well as the related thermomechanical coupling effects. Due to the description of the energy storage and release during the martensitic phase transitions by means of a mixture theory, one internal variable is the fraction of martensite. Others are the inelastic strain tensor and internal variables describing residual stresses. The viscous material behavior of NiTi shape memory alloys, which is experimentally observed, is represented by an inelastic multiplier of Perzynatype. Numerical solutions of the developed constitutive equations for isothermal and non-isothermal strain and stress processes demonstrate that the material model represents the main effects of shape memory alloys. Additionally, the material model is able to depict the multiaxial material behavior as observed. Numerical solutions are compared with uniaxial and in particular biaxial experimental observations on NiTi shape memory alloys.","Phase transitons; Shape memory alloys; Thermomechanical model; Thermoviscoplasticity","Elasticity; Free energy; Martensitic transformations; Mixtures; Numerical methods; Residual stresses; Strain; Thermomechanical treatment; Viscoplasticity; Thermomechanical models; Shape memory effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036028526

Reported performance has improved dramatically, particularly in the past few years, due to changes in synthesis methods, better characterization and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms. These actuators are able to displace large loads (up to 100 × greater than mammalian skeletal muscle), with moderate displacements (typically 2 %), and with power to mass ratios similar to that of muscle, while powered using potentials of no more than a few volts. Unlike electric motors and muscle, these actuators exhibit a catch state, enabling them to maintain force without consuming energy. Despite the impressive performance, commercial applications are at an early stage. One reason is the need to carefully consider the details of the actuator construction, including the thickness and surface area of the polymer, the electrolyte conductivity and geometry, the counter electrode spacing, the shape of the input voltage and the means of electrical contact to the polymer, in designing effective actuators. A set of design guidelines is presented that assist the device designer in determining the optimum actuator configuration. These are derived from extensive characterization and modeling of hexafluorophosphate-doped polypyrrole actuators. The set of design tools helps transform conducting polymer actuators into engineering materials that can be selected and designed for particular applications based on rational criteria. Most of the underlying physical principles used in determining these rules also underlie other conducting polymer actuators, polymer devices such as electrochromic displays, supercapacitors and batteries, carbon nanotube actuators, and electrochemically driven devices that involve volumetric charge storage.","Actuator; Carbon nanotubes; Conducting polymer; Diffusion; Impedance; Model; Polypyrrole","Carbon nanotubes; Electric conductance; Electric contacts; Electric impedance; Electric potential; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy utilization; Polypyrroles; Conducting polymers; Actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036028329
