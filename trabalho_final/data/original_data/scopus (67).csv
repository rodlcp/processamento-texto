It has changed our lives. It executes tasks with precision. There is no limit with what we can do with software. Computers are seductive. Companies and students cannot work without them. They help students to perform mathematical computations. It is very important that mathematical ideas are expressed in computer programs in order to have theoretical results and to verify them practically. Nowadays, the development of new and non-polluting energy producing and energy-storage systems is a great challenge for scientists. An alternative to the nuclear and fossil fuel power is renewable energy technologies. Due to ever-increasing energy consumption, rising public awareness of environmental protection, and steady progress in power deregulation, alternative (i.e., renewable and fuel cell based) distributed generation systems have attracted increased interest. There is an accelerating world demand for environmentally friendly power. Among the renewable energy sources, the Photovoltaic (PV) energy is the most promising candidate for research and development for large scale users. Fuel cells have been receiving a lot of attention lately due to their potential of becoming a new energy source with a large range of applications. Fuel cells can be incorporated with other components to create high efficiency industrial power plants. Fuel cells permit clean and efficient energy production. The purpose of the work is to optimize the system's operation. The main reason to build described system is to supply stand-alone systems using renewable energy sources. Therefore, the power plant has to produce energy independent of any weather fluctuations. Integrating photovoltaic energy composources with fuel cells, as a storage device replacing the conventional lead-acid batteries, leads to a non-polluting reliable energy source. In this chapter, an energy system comprising different energy sources, namely PV and fuel cells, is proposed. Photovoltaic cells coupled with electrolytic devices can be used to produce hydrogen and oxygen in a sustainable manner. With the produced hydrogen from the electrolysis process, it is possible to generate electricity through fuel cells. Photovoltaic panels in particular can provide a good source of producing green electricity. It is autonomous, its operation does not pollute the atmosphere, and it is an inexhaustible and renewable source with great reliability. The simulation program developed also allows the exportation of different configurations. The experimental system described has permitted the validation of the proposed method. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944883327

We employ the FP (L)APW+lo method, based on the density functional theory (DFT), in order to address the electronic structure of the low-temperature, martensitic phase of Ti 0.67Zr0.33Ni and its hydrides. Further, the thermodynamics of hydride formation in the martensitic Ti-Zr-Ni alloys is studied, and some unanswered questions regarding the hydriding of martensite TiNi are resolved. The calculated formation energy of the orthorhombic β- and γ-hydrides of martensitic Ti0.67Zr0.33Ni is, respectively, -14.2 kJ/mol(H) and -29.6 kJ/mol(H), showing that isostructural (Ti,Zr)Ni hydrides with a larger amount of titanium have improved potential for hydrogen storage applications. Furthermore, based on the calculation results, it is unlikely that the hydriding of TiNi martensite would lead to the formation of orthorhombic β-hydride in analogy to the pseudobinary compound. The formation of Ti 0.67Zr0.33Ni hydrides leads to significant changes in electronic structure, causing shifting of some metal states to lower energies due to their interaction with hydrogen s states, and the increase of the number of states at Fermi energy. By modeling intermediate structures, the process of hydride formation in martensitic Ti0.67Zr0.33Ni is resolved to reveal the effects of crystal structure change, volume increase, and hydrogen-metal interactions on the band structure, charge transfer, and thermodynamics. A dominant, stabilizing effect in the process of hydride formation was found to come from the chemical interaction of hydrogen and metal atoms. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculation results; Chemical interactions; Density functional theory studies; Formation energies; Hydrogen-metal interaction; Intermediate structures; Pseudobinary compounds; Stabilizing effects; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Martensite; Nickel; Thermodynamics; Titanium alloys; Zirconium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891413361

AMI normally has a focal point on the boundary between the utility and the end consumer and thus has as the important function to allow the demand to become active based on the extended information that will be available for both the utility and the end customer. On the other side, the large volumes of energy flows for instance at generation delivery points are being metered with other systems and normally at lower periodicities than those implemented for most of the AMI projects developed now a days. The above is considered contradictory since smaller volumes of data will be measured at higher periodicities while larger ones will be available with fewer granularities and at slower data collection rates. This paper presents the concept of integrating the entire set of electric energy meters in an integral concept allowing the implementation of functions that may use energy data for operation and for other purposes such as energy balances.

Power balancing requirements resulting from the intermittency of wind power suggest using energy storage assistance to improve overall generation and load characteristics. The problems in generation imbalance for wind power require multi-criteria analysis for the decision makers. In addition to the required multi-criteria analysis, there is also a problem of uncertainty inherent in future changes as a result of interdependence among these criteria. To counter this two problems, this paper describes a systematic approach of Bayesian causal maps and systematic probability generation method. Bayesian causal maps, which is built from causal maps, is used to develop a proposed framework on scenario-based assessment of energy storage technologies for wind power generation. Causal maps provides a rich representation of ideas, through the modeling of complex structures, representing the chain of arguments, as networks. However, causal maps is not easy to define and the magnitude of the effect is difficult to express in numbers. Hence, Bayesian causal maps can be used to make inferences in causal maps. A systematic probability generation method is used to estimate the conditional probability tables, which can reduce biases and inconsistencies. © 2013 PICMET.",,"Complex structure; Conditional probability tables; Decision makers; Energy storage technologies; Generation method; Load characteristics; Multi Criteria Analysis; Renewable energy generation; Complex networks; Electric power generation; Wind power; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890849816

We sought to assess whether the nicotinamide-induced reduction of G6PD activity might modulate redox balance and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Main methods: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (days 4 and 6 of differentiation) and adipocytes were cultured in the presence of 5 or 25 mM glucose. The cells cultured in 25 mM glucose were supplemented with nicotinamide (5-15 mM). Next, we evaluated the following parameters: cell viability, apoptosis, lipid accumulation, lipolysis, reducing power, reactive oxygen species (ROS), NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP), malic enzyme and G6PD, as well as the protein and mRNA levels of G6PD. We also analysed the kinetics of the nicotinamide-induced inhibition of G6PD. Key findings: G6PD mRNA levels increased at day 4 of adipocyte differentiation, whereas G6PD activity progressively increased at days 4 and 6 of differentiation and was reduced in adipocytes. Concomitantly, ROS, reducing power and lipid accumulation increased gradually as the preadipocytes matured into adipocytes. High glucose increased the activity of G6PD, which coincided with an increase in ROS, reducing power and lipid accumulation. All of these changes are prevented by nicotinamide, with the exception of lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Nicotinamide increased IDP activity without affecting NADPH levels. Lastly, nicotinamide inhibited G6PD in a non-competitive mixed way.

Routing in WSNs is the vital functionality that allows the flow of information generated by sensor nodes to the base station, while considering the severe energy constraint and the limitations of computational and storage resources. Indeed, this functionality may be vulnerable and must be in itself secured, since conventional routing protocols in WSNs provide efficient routing techniques with low power consumption, but they do not take into account the possible attacks. As sensor nodes may be easily captured and compromised, the classical cryptographic solutions become insufficient to provide optimal routing security, especially, for cluster-based WSNs, where cluster heads can be still among the compromised nodes. In this work, we propose a hierarchical, robust and well-adapted intrusion detection system, named THIDS (Threshold Hierarchical Intrusion Detection System), which is intended to be integrated into the secure hierarchical cluster-based routing protocols. We have chosen the protocol RLEACH to be equipped with the proposed IDS. The results of simulation performed under NS2 simulator show that the resulting protocol ORLEACH is much more resistant to compromised nodes exercising the most dangerous attacks.","Cluster-based wireless sensor networks; Hierarchical intrusion detection system; Secure routing protocols",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890184282

Due to high energy demand and high input currents, a fast-charging station is placed close to the substation that contains a low frequency transformer. Inside the fast-charging station, an intermediate DC-bus connects energy storages, a supply grid rectifier and charging converters. Low voltage (570 V) causes high currents and results in high losses at busbars, magnetic components and semiconductor devices. We propose a high voltage input multiport converter topology with a high frequency isolation transformer for a fast charger of an electric vehicle. High input voltage enables currents and conduction losses to be kept low in the charging converter until the very last conversion stage that is connected to the electric vehicle battery. Also, the dimensions of magnetic components are reduced due to high frequency. Grid-side converter is realized using the back to back cascaded converter topology. Charging converters can be realized with the current doubler rectifier topology and bidirectional with a controllable full bridge rectifier/inverter as in this operational mode it has an advantage over a current doubler. The quasi Z source could be used as a filter/boost circuit. The proposed charging station topology was verified by computer simulations. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Cascaded converters; Converter topologies; Current doubler rectifiers; Electric vehicle batteries; Full bridge rectifier; Grid-side converter; High-frequency isolation transformers; Magnetic components; Charging (batteries); Computer simulation; Electric vehicles; Magnetic devices; Power electronics; Topology; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889063766

If the compressor cavity is connected to the H- or E-arm of the Magic-tee with shorted side arms, the necessary condition for the microwave energy storage is the identicalness of the shorted arms regardless of the frequency. It means that the compressor operation in different cavity eigenfrequencies is possible without mechanical tuning. We have studied the two-frequency S-band compressor. Two characteristic geometries corresponding to different regimes of the microwave energy accumulation and release were tested using input pulses of 200-400 kW power, 2.4 μs duration, and variable frequency, 2.8 to 2.9 GHz. The geometries are characterized by an RF electric field in the interference switch that is higher or lower than the field in the cavity. For both geometries, the nanosecond output pulses in two resonant frequencies were obtained; the maximal peak output power measured was ∼1.8 MW. The efficiency of the microwave extraction was limited by either an insufficient coupling to the tee output arm (in the case of a high field in the tee) or non-uniformity of the plasma discharge (in the case of low field in the tee). © 2013 IEEE.",,"Eigen frequencies; Mechanical tuning; Microwave energies; Microwave extraction; Peak output power; Plasma interference; Rf electric fields; Variable frequencies; Electric discharges; Electric fields; Geometry; Natural frequencies; Compressors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888612725

Humans express SCD1 in WAT, and rodents express both SCD1 and SCD2 in this tissue. WAT SCD expression is regulated by hormones, cytokines, and nutritional status. Leptin, estrogen, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha reduce its expression, while insulin and ghrelin increase it. In humans, hypercaloric or high-carbohydrate diets stimulate WAT SCD expression, while caloric restriction suppresses it. Fatty acids have differential effects on WAT SCD expression with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) having an inhibitory effect and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) having a stimulatory effect. Interestingly, effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists are species-specific. WAT SCD plays an important role in modulating metabolic functions. Its expression positively correlates with body weight and insulin resistance. Although germline SCD1 deletion protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, adipose-specific SCD knockout does not provide these protective effects. Therefore, it is likely that WAT SCD upregulation in obesity is an adaption to increased availability of carbohydrates and SFAs. However, since palmitoleate and oleate, two major products of the desaturation reaction catalyzed by this enzyme, regulate inflammatory responses, WAT SCD also appears to be important in modulating adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. In conclusion, SCD is an important enzyme for triglyceride storage of WAT, which has additional functions in regulating metabolism and inflammation, especially in conditions of expanded fat mass. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

They range from simple and less efficient linear regulators, to more complex power electronic based converters. Therefore, based on the requirements of the system, more efforts should be focused on the design of the converter that links the PV generator to the load, in addition new and more sophisticated control strategies must be added into the system. Undoubtedly, energy storage system is one of the systems that require more efficiency at the conversion stage as well as adequate algorithms and control strategies, for ensuring long lasting at the energy storage device. In particular, the process of charging a battery requires a determinate number of stages, for ensuring long-life for the battery. At this paper, is exposed the design process of a 140W regulator for a battery based energy storage system. The regulator designed is a SEPIC converter that guarantees high efficiency under a wide range of operation. Additionally, the power converter is governed by a maximum power point tracking algorithm (MPPT) and control strategies that ensure an adequate process of charge for the batteries. Besides, a software tool was proposed for supervising the different stages of the charge as well as the complete energy storage system. The system was implemented and tested experimentally in order to verify the behavior under each stage of the battery charging process. © 2013 IEEE.","Charge regulator; DC/DC converter; MPPT; State feedback control","Charge regulator; Control strategies; Design and implementations; Different stages; Energy storage systems; Linear regulators; Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms; MPPT; Algorithms; DC-DC converters; Energy storage; State feedback; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897859139

Thelower emissions for natural gas are primarily due to differences in the current fleets' averageefficiency - 53 percent for natural gas versus 35 percent for coal, and a higher carbon contentper unit of energy for coal than natural gas. Even using unconventional natural gas, from tightsands, shale and coal beds, and compared with a 20-year global warming potential (GWP),natural gas-fired electricity has 39 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal perdelivered megawatt-hour (MWh) using current technology.In a life cycle analysis (LCA), comparisons must be based on providing an equivalentservice or function, which in this study is the delivery of 1 MWh of electricity to an end user.This life cycle greenhouse gas inventory also developed upstream (from extraction to deliveryto a power plant) emissions for delivered energy feedstocks, including six different domesticsources of natural gas, of which three are unconventional gas, and two types of coal, and thencombines them both into domestic mixes. These are important characterizations for the LCAcommunity, and can be used as inputs into a variety of processes. However, these upstream,or cradle-to-gate, results are not appropriate to compare when making energy policydecisions, since the two uncombusted fuels do not provide an equivalent function. Theseresults highlight the importance of specifying an end-use basis-not necessarily powerproduction-when comparing different fuels.Despite the conclusion that natural gas has lower greenhouse gases than coal on adelivered power basis, the extraction and delivery of the gas has a large climate impact -32percent of U.S. methane emissions and 3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases (EPA, 2011b). AsFigure ES-2 shows, there are significant emissions and use of natural gas-13 percent at thecity or plant gate-even without considering final distribution to small end-users. The vastmajority of the reduction in extracted natural gas -64 percent cradle-to-gate-are notemitted to the atmosphere, but can be attributed to the use of the natural gas as fuel forextraction and transport processes such as compressor operations. Increasing compressorefficiency would lower both the rate of use and the CO2 emissions associated with thecombustion of the gas for energy. Note that this figure accounts for the total mass of naturalgas extracted from the earth, including water, acid gases, and other non-methane content. But, with methane making up 75 to 95 percent of the natural gas flow, there are manyopportunities for reducing the climate impact associated with direct venting to theatmosphere. A further 24 percent of the natural gas losses can be characterized as pointsource, and have the potential to be flared-essentially a conversion of GWP-potent methaneto carbon dioxide. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are robust to a wide array of assumptions.However, as with any inventory, they are dependent on the underlying data, and there aremany opportunities to enhance the information currently being collected. This analysis showsthat the results are both sensitive to and impacted by the uncertainty of a few key parameters:use and emission of natural gas along the pipeline transmission network; the rate of naturalgas emitted during unconventional gas extraction processes such as well completion andworkovers; and the lifetime production of wells, which determine the denominator overwhich lifetime emissions are placed.This analysis inventoried both average and marginal production rates for each natural gastype, with results shown in Table ES-1. The average represents natural gas produced from allwells, including older and low productivity stripper wells. The marginal production raterepresents natural gas from newer, higher productivity wells. The largest difference was foronshore conventional natural gas, which had a 41 percent reduction in upstream greenhousegas emissions from 20.1 to 34.2 lbs CO2e/MMBtu when going from marginal to averageproduction rates. This change has little impact on emissions from power production.This inventory and analysis are for greenhouse gases only, and there are many otherfactors that must be considered when comparing energy options. A full inventory ofconventional and toxic air emissions, water use and quality, and land use is currently underdevelopment, and will allow comparison of these fuels across multiple environmentalcategories. Further, all options need to be evaluated on a sustainable energy basis, consideringfull environmental performance, as well as economic and social performance, such as theability to maintain energy reliability and security. There are many opportunities fordecreasing the greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas and coal extraction, delivery andpower production, including reducing fugitive methane emissions at wells and mines, andimplementing advanced combustion technologies and carbon capture and storage. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895411090

To accomplish this, BCAP was charged with two tasks: (1) to support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and (2) to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility.BCAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency (FSA). BCAP provides two categories of financial assistance: annual and establishment payments, which share in the cost of establishing eligible biomass crops and maintaining production; and matching payments, which share in the cost of the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of biomass to an eligible biomass conversion facility. The payments have different eligibility and sign-up requirements, payment rates, and contract lengths. BCAP assistance for establishing and producing biomass crops is available within designated project areas. BCAP project areas are specific geographic areas where producers may enroll land into BCAP contracts and produce specified biomass crops. As of June 2012, eleven BCAP project areas had been approved.On June 11, 2009, FSA implemented one portion of BCAP-the Collection, Harvest, Storage, and Transportation (CHST) matching payment program-through a Notice of Funds Availability in the Federal Register. The partial implementation created a possible unintended consequence of market competition for wood shavings, wood chips, sawdust, and other wood ""scraps"" between traditional purchasers-namely landscapers and particleboard manufactures-and facilities that convert biomass to energy. The issuance of the BCAP proposed rule on February 8, 2010, suspended CHST program enrollment and proposed rules for the implementation of the remainder of the BCAP program. USDA issued the BCAP final rule on October 27, 2010, implementing both program components.Under the 2008 farm bill, BCAP was authorized to receive such sums as necessary, meaning that funding for BCAP is both mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation and open-ended since it depends on program participation. However, recent congressional actions (as part of the annual appropriations process) have capped program funding in FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. In response to funding reductions, USDA temporarily suspended the CHST matching payment portion of the program through FY2011, and re-prioritized future program funds in favor of uses that emphasize annual and establishment payments, especially under existing contracts, over CHST matching payments.While BCAP is in the early stages of implementation, concerns regarding eligibility, funding, and sustainability continue to be discussed. These issues could shape future congressional action on the program in the context of budgetary measures and possible reauthorization in the next farm bill. In particular, BCAP does not include ""baseline"" budget spending beyond FY2012. Based on current budgetary requirements, the authorizing committees could potentially need to secure offset funding if BCAP were to be reauthorized in the next farm bill.This could prove difficult given tight budgetary constraints and the more recent and higher projections of the program's cost compared to its initial cost estimates. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Data acquisition, processing, storage and transmission are mandatory requirements for different applications. These nodes are expected to generate a correct representation of the sensed quantities, which is then used to make various decisions and control actions. This means that the node requires more memory capabilities to store data either temporary or permanently. The collected data can then be used. As the monitoring device of WSN is increasingly mobile, the need for efficient power management (PM) techniques is becoming crucial in order to extend the lifetime of the battery-powered device. Energy is a critical performance metric in WSNs. Challenges facing WSN designers range from computational energy, energy consumption, energy source, communication channels, etc. A new emerging memory technology like memristor provides a good candidate for WSN PM. Memristor non-volatility features coupled with small size and low energy operation provide a normally-off instant-on mode of operation for the WSN; this will minimize the loss of energy to leakage power. The paper gives an insight about using memristor in a PM scheme at the system level. © 2013 IEEE.","low power; non-volatile memories; Power Management; sensor nodes; system level",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894413919

Considerable research has gone into developing simulation models to comprehensively study the energy dynamics of different types of data center equipment in order to better understand how best to conserve it. Most of this research has gone towards modeling of servers and switches but relatively less amount of work is available on Storage Area Networks (SAN). Storage Area Networks play a very vital role in the data center architecture by using specialized storage hardware to manage data. In this paper, we have extended the Green Cloud simulator for computing the energy consumed by different SAN components. A simulation environment for SAN has been presented using the 'Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling' (DVFS) and 'Dynamic Shutdown' (DNS) techniques. The simulation results obtained through two SAN prototype models shows the energy consumption of SAN components to vary with the network topology and type of technique used in scheduling of the workloads. Our experimental simulations revealed that there is an increasing percentage of energy savings in DNS mode for both topologies for an increasing number of servers. Results demonstrated up to 35.6% energy savings. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy consumption; Green Cloud; Power consumption; SAN; SAN Simulator",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894198398

It is usually used in conjunction with tools such as Cacti, Zabbix and Zenoss to provide most of the features that IT professionals require to efficiently monitor network systems. However, SNMP is not be suitable for the emerging ubiquitous networking applications where energy frugal devices with limited storage and processing are usually deployed unattended sometimes with intermittent power supply. Furthermore, the client server model underlying SNMP may create traffic bottlenecks and a single point of failure for the underlying monitoring systems. Building upon these limitations, this paper proposes the lightweight network management protocol (LNMP) and demonstrates its relative efficiency compared to SNMP.

Simulation results are presented in support of the proposed theory. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Bi-directional; Buck boost converter; Cascaded controls; Controller outputs; Energy storage applications; Four Switch Buck-Boost converters; Inductor currents; Single controllers; Energy storage; Industrial electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893574589

The methodology utilises the time dimension of consumer power demand to generate a meaningful energy characteristic for each controllable household load. It is supposed that consumer preferences can be reflected entirely within the energy characteristic and hence controlling loads based on energy will result in better outcomes for the consumer. Hence guarantees can be placed on consumer satisfaction, while still near-optimally scheduling the resultant power flows. Simulation results for each second in a day are provided in MATLAB/Simulink for 7 typical New Zealand houses, and show that consumers with electric vehicles can save approximately 17% of their power bill without sacrificing comfort using practical time-of-use pricing rates. © 2013 IEEE.","Automatic control; Decentralized control; Distributed algorithms; Distributed power generation; Energy management; Energy storage; Home automation; Load management; Power demand; Smart grids; Smart homes","Consumer preferences; Consumer satisfactions; Demand side managements; Energy characteristics; Home automation; Power demands; Smart grid; Smart homes; Automation; Control; Decentralized control; Distributed power generation; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy storage; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Parallel algorithms; Industrial electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893554602

They contain reservoir rocks that have no presently exploitable resource within their pore system, perhaps because they lack a viable system for trapping buoyant fluids. The ultimate potential and impacts of CO2 injection into DSFs can only be assessed through dynamic simulations built on regional-scale static geocellular models. Static models must represent real geological heterogeneity of the DSF. Dynamic simulations must incorporate real hydrodynamic flow across boundaries of the DSF. Regulation of subsurface CO2 storage requires an assessment of likely interactions between CO2 storage operations and other subsurface resources. Basin-scale static models of DSFs in the Gippsland, Otway, and Surat basins of eastern Australia have been constructed for use in dynamic simulations of CO2 injection and storage. These simulations examine far-field effects of a variety of storage operations scenarios on the production of oil, gas, coal, groundwater, geothermal energy and on other competing uses of pore space basinwide.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893541050

With increased introduction of variable and renewable electricity production resources such as wind power and solar power, the need for power balancing also increases. If EV batteries can be used as individual and flexible storages performing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services with or without the possibility to inject power to the grid, this increased need for power balancing could be met. This paper investigates the potential for individual and flexible EV batteries to be used for V2G services by introducing a new model. With the model it is possible to estimate the potential for V2G power consumption and power injection with a well-developed charging infrastructure including dynamic EVC at electrified roads (ERs) and static EVC at parking sites. The model includes models for time-dependent V2G potential, dynamic EVC at ERs, static EVC at parking sites, vehicle mobility and vehicle driving power demand. A case study shows the resulting V2G potential for power consumption and power injection under different conditions with a charging infrastructure including both dynamic and static EVC infrastructure. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicle charging (EVC); Electric vehicles (EVs); electrified roads (ERs); plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); electrified roads (ERs); Plug-in-hybrid; Vehicleto-Grid (V2G); Electric vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Wind power; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893297039

The model is applied to a case study of a sixteen-bus test system that uses real-time data with a sampling time of five minutes. The results indicate that the application of wind/ESS can impact the overall power losses, peak load reductions, and the commitment of expensive thermal units. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Economic Dispatch; Operational decisions; Peak load reductions; Real-time data; Renewable resource; Sampling time; Short-term scheduling; Thermal units; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893230360

Curves showing the system risk for different levels of demand are obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation approach that performs unit commitment and economic load dispatch, considering randomly generated outages and randomly selected synthetic wind and solar generation profiles created using a semi-parametric model.

A conventional LNG supply chain is not the best solution taking into consideration its high investment. The possibility of using a small scale LNG supply chain concept (Mini LNG) is recently sought by the government and private sectors in Indonesia. It is even more promising when we consider the amounts and number of stranded gas fields in the country. One of the main obstacles to the development plan is the geographical position of Indonesia as an archipelagic country. This paper presents a case study of LNG supply chain model of 10 mmscfd Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in Batam and its design of LNG transportation model from Batam to Siantan-West Kalimantan [1]. The distance between Batam and Siantan is approximately 392 nautical miles. Two main objectives are covered in this paper. The first one is an implementation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to select the best location for mini LNG plant, and the second one is to design the LNG supply chain model based on optimization approach. The AHP model uses a pairwise comparison of 4 (four) qualitative attributes and 14 (fourteen) sub-attributes. 3 alternatives of location for mini LNG plant are evaluated, namely: Tanjung Uncang, Pemping Island and Janda Berhias Island. A sensitivity analysis by varying the weight of some critical attributes is also conducted to ensure that preferred location is sensitively selected with minimum error. The optimization of the LNG supply chain model is carried out by means of Gradually Reduced Gradient (GRG) methods. The Objective is to attain one design that will minimize investment (cost). Decision variables of the model are LNG plant capacity storage tank capacity in loading and receiving terminal, vessel size, number of round trip, number of operating vessels, regasification capacity at the receiving terminal, and others.

PV uses solar radiation, which is essentially a flux of elementary particles that promote photoreactions and generate a flow of electrons, whereas CSP harnesses irradiative solar energy, which is easily transformed into heat through absorption by gases, liquids, or solid materials and is then converted to mechanical energy and finally electrical energy. At the end of 2012, the world's PV installations totaled 32 Gw, compared to a cumulative 2.9 Gw of CSP capacity, the bulk concentrated in Spain (68%) and the US (28%). At least 7.3 Gw of new CSP capacity is in various stages of preconstruction development in the US, the Middle East and North Africa, and in China, India, and Australia. Saudi Arabia, notably, will lead a longer-term charge with its ambitions to generate 75 to 110 Tw-hr by 2032, which could require the installation of 25 Gw of capacity in Saudi Arabia alone. Yet, PV's growth is slated to soar to a staggering 41 Gw by 2014, an expansion that will be undertaken by all major world regions. Accounting for 84% of electricity generation costs of CSP, initial investment requirements range from $2,500 to $10,200/kw, depending on capacity factor and storage size. In contrast, solar PV's initial investment costs range from $3,500 to $6,000/kw.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893006487

This effect may be utilized in thermal energy storage, especially for solar-thermal power plants. In order to enhance the rate of heat transfer into PCMs, one of the most common methods is the use of fins which increase the heat transfer area that is in contact with the PCM. The present work deals with a latent heat thermal storage device that uses a finned tube with an array of radial fins. A heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows through the tube and heat is conducted from the tube to the radial fins that are in contact with the bulk of the PCM inside a cylindrical shell. The thermal storage charging/discharging process is driven by a hot/cold HTF inside the tube that causes the PCM to melt/solidify. The main objective of the present work is to demonstrate that close-contact melting (CCM) can affect the storage unit performance. Accordingly, two different types of experiments are conducted: with the shell exposed to ambient air and with the shell submerged into a heated water bath. The latter is done to separate the PCM from the shell by a thin molten layer, thus enabling the solid bulk to sink. The effect of the solid sinking and close-contact melting on the fins is explored. It is found that close-contact melting shortens the melting time drastically. Accordingly, two types of models are used to predict the melting rate: numerical CFD model and analytical/numerical close-contact melting model. The CFD model takes into account convection in the melt and the PCM property dependence on temperature and phase. The analytical/numerical CCM model is developed under several simplifying assumptions. Good agreement is found between the predictions and corresponding experimental results.

This paper deals with numerical modeling of a hybrid PCM-air heat sink, in which heat may be either absorbed by the PCM stored in compartments with conducting walls, or dissipated to the air using fins, or both. Under the assumptions of perfect insulation (except for the air fins), identity and symmetry between all PCM channels, and negligible 3-D boundary effects, a 2-D model of the problem for half a PCM compartment of the heat sink is solved, saving calculation time and yet taking into account the essential physical phenomena. A commercial program, ANSYS Fluent, is used in order to solve the governing conservation equations. Phasechange is solved using the enthalpy-porosity method. PCM-air interface is modeled using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) approach. The model takes into account natural convection in the liquid PCM and air, volume change, phase- and temperaturedependence of thermal properties, and PCM-air interface interaction. Various scenarios for the hybrid heat sink operation are simulated and compared. The difference in the melting patterns is analyzed for the cases of heating with and without the fan operating. The solidification process with the fan operating is also simulated. It is shown that the VOF model enables simulating realistic void formation in the solidification process.

The use of thermal energy to drive a absorption unit with low - power is a modern subject of research This paper analyzes the various elements of solar absorption cooling. Individual states were simulated in which working conditions were set for the capability of solar absorption cooling to balance heat loads in the room. The research is based on an experimental device (absorption units with a performance of 10kW) developed at the STU in Bratislava (currently inputs and outputs of cold sources are being measured). Outputs in this paper are processed so that they connect the entire scheme of the solar absorption cooling system (i.e. the relationship between the solar systems hot and cold storage and the absorption unit).

The exchange, or flux, of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface is called the global carbon cycle. Comparatively, human activities contribute a relatively small amount of carbon, primarily as carbon dioxide (CO2), to the global carbon cycle. Despite the addition of a relatively small amount of carbon to the atmosphere, compared to natural fluxes from the oceans and land surface, the human perturbation to the carbon cycle is increasingly recognized as a main factor driving climate change over the past 50 years. If humans add only a small amount of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, why is that contribution important to global climate change? The answer is that the oceans, vegetation, and soils do not take up carbon released from human activities quickly enough to prevent CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere from increasing. Humans tap the huge pool of fossil carbon for energy, and affect the global carbon cycle by transferring fossil carbon-which took millions of years to accumulate underground-into the atmosphere over a relatively short time span. As a result, the atmosphere contains approximately 35% more CO2 today than prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution. As the CO2 concentration grows it increases the degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun, which further warms the planet. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is mitigated to some extent by two huge reservoirs for carbon-the global oceans and the land surface-which currently take up more carbon than they release. They are net sinks for carbon. Currently, most of the total global carbon sink is referred to as the unmanaged, or background, carbon cycle. Very little carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored, or sequestered, by deliberate action. If the oceans, vegetation, and soils did not act as sinks, then the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would increase even more rapidly. Congress is considering legislative strategies to reduce U.S. emissions of CO2 and/or increase the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Congress may also opt to consider how land management practices, such as afforestation, conservation tillage, and other techniques, might increase the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the land surface. Some land management practices may be eligible to receive carbon offsets in cap-and-trade legislation that is under consideration. A capand-trade system designed to include carbon offsets would likely need an accurate and precise accounting for the tons of carbon sequestered deliberately by land management practices. How the ocean sink could be managed to store more carbon is unclear. Iron fertilization and deep ocean injection of CO2 are in an experimental stage, and their promise for long-term enhancement of carbon uptake by the oceans is not well understood. Of additional concern is how the ocean and land surface sinks will behave over the coming decades and longer, and whether they will continue to take up more carbon than they release. The uncertainty in the future behavior of carbon sinks implies that accurately predicting the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in the future is also uncertain, even if the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere could be controlled precisely. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Large, industrial sources of CO2, such as electricity-generating plants, are likely initial candidates for CCS because they are predominantly stationary, single-point sources. Electricity generation contributes over 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Congressional interest has grown in CCS as part of legislative strategies to address climate change. On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), which included $3.4 billion for projects and programs related to CCS. Of that amount, $1.52 billion would be made available for a competitive solicitation for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency improvement projects, $1 billion for the renewal of FutureGen, and $800 million for U.S. Department of Energy Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitations, which specifically target coal-based systems that capture and sequester, or reuse, CO2 emissions. The $3.4 billion contained in ARRA greatly exceeds the federal government's cumulative outlays for CCS research and development since 1997. The large and rapid influx of funding for industrial-scale CCS projects may accelerate development and deployment of CO2 capture technologies. Currently, U.S. power plants do not capture large volumes of CO2 for CCS, even though technology is available that can potentially remove 80%-95% of CO2 from a point source. This is due, in part, to the absence of either an economic incentive (i.e., a price for captured CO2) or a regulatory requirement to curtail CO2 emissions. In addition, DOE estimates that CCS costs between $100 and $300 per metric ton (2,200 pounds) of carbon emissions avoided using current technologies. Those additional costs mean that power plants with CCS would require more fuel, and costs per kilowatt-hour would be higher than for plants without CCS. After CO2 is captured from the source and compressed into a liquid, pipelines or ships would likely convey the captured CO2 to storage sites to be injected underground. Three main types of geological formations are being considered for storing large amounts of CO2 as a liquid: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. The deep ocean also has a huge potential to store carbon; however, direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean is still experimental, and environmental concerns have forestalled planned experiments in the open ocean. Mineral carbonation-reacting minerals with a stream of concentrated CO2 to form a solid carbonate-is well understood, but it also is still an experimental process for storing large quantities of CO2. The increase in funding for CCS provided for in ARRA and by other economic incentives may lead to less expensive and more effective technologies for capturing large quantities of CO2. Without a carbon price or a regulatory requirement to cap CO2 emissions, however, it will be difficult to predict or evaluate how the technology would be deployed throughout the U.S. energy sector. By comparison, transporting, injecting, and storing CO2 underground may be less daunting. A large pipeline infrastructure for transporting CO2 could be very costly, however, and considerable uncertainty remains over how large quantities of injected CO2 would be permanently stored underground. To help resolve these uncertainties, DOE has initiated large-scale CO2 injection tests in a variety of geologic reservoirs that are to take place over the next several years. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The questions are broadly representative of typical inquiries regarding the process and mechanics of storing CO2 underground, how much might be stored, and what might happen to CO2 once it is injected underground. Geologic sequestration is one step in a process termed carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. Following capture and transportation, CO2 would be injected into geologic formations that have suitable volume, or pore space, to retain large quantities of the captured gas. Currently, the most promising reservoirs for storing CO2 are oil and gas fields, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. Preventing CO2 from escaping a geologic formation would require careful reservoir characterization in advance of the injection phase of a project, as well as monitoring during and after CO2 injection. Knowledge gained from over 30 years of injecting CO2 underground to enhance oil recovery would be applied to storing CO2 for CCS purposes. In addition, a variety of techniques are currently available for monitoring leaks from a reservoir, and knowledge gained from field testing may lead to improved or new technologies for detecting CO2 leakage. Given the complexity of most geologic reservoirs, and the potentially huge volumes of CO2 that may be injected, risk of some CO2 leakage over time may never completely be eliminated. Even with careful characterization of a potential reservoir and monitoring of CO2 migration during and after injection, the detailed fate of CO2 stored underground may not be thoroughly understood. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has made an assessment of the potential sequestration capacity across the United States and parts of Canada and has determined that there exists sufficient volume to store approximately 600 years of CO2 produced from total U.S. fossil fuel emissions (at current rates). The sequestration capacity estimate is primarily drawn from existing information on the geology and depends on several assumptions about geologic sequestration mechanisms. How the DOE estimate will compare to the actual sequestration capacity will depend, in part, on the results from a series of seven large-scale CO2 injection experiments to be conducted by seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships across the United States. DOE has awarded funds totaling $456.7 million for the seven injection tests, which are scheduled to begin in 2009. Many people are unfamiliar with the concept of sequestering carbon-most likely in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2)-underground in geologic reservoirs. This chapter answers questions broadly representative of typical queries about why, where, and how CO2 may be stored underground, as well as how much CO2 might be stored. In addition, this chapter answers several questions about what might happen if CO2 escapes from underground storage. The term carbon sequestration includes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), but it is also used to refer to the biological uptake of carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This chapter does not discuss biological sequestration.1 Capturing and storing CO2 in the ocea ns is another possible option for carbon sequestration, although currently it is not deemed as promising as underground sequestration.2 The only operating major commercial project dedicated solely to CO2 sequestration in a geologic reservoir today is the Sleipner Project, located approximately 150 miles off the coast of Norway in the North Sea. Two other operating commercial-scale CO2 sequestration ventures-the Weyburn Project in south central Canada and the In Salah Project in Algeria-use the injected CO2 to help recover oil and natural gas, respectively. In the United States, the oil and gas industry injects approximately 48 million metric tons of CO2 each year for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but permanently sequestering CO2 has not been a focus of these EOR activities to date. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has sponsored carbon sequestration research and development since 1997, and is embarking on a third phase of its geologic carbon sequestration research and development program. DOE is planning seven large-scale CO2 sequestration injection experiments beginning in 2009. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This approach may require the transporting of captured carbon dioxide via pipeline to an underground storage reservoir with the intent of keeping it out of the atmosphere. Congress has begun to address this issue. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) contains measures to promote research and development of CCS technology, to assess sequestration capacity, and to clarify the framework for issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. Other legislative proposals have also sought to encourage the development of CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation technology. Further, measures were introduced in the 110th Congress, including the Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Study Act of 2007 (S. 2144), which would have required the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating a network of CO2 pipelines for CCS. Such a network could develop in the future with or without legislative action. If these pipelines were to cross state lines, it could raise important issues concerning regulatory jurisdiction over siting and pricing. This chapter discusses federal jurisdictional uncertainty over CO2 pipelines under existing law, as well as potential legislative activity to address any possible regulatory ""gap"" in jurisdiction. It should be noted that such a potential gap does not necessarily demand federal legislative resolution. Nevertheless, some analysts, drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development, anticipate a potential need for better defined federal legislative/regulatory authority over an interstate CO2 pipeline network. Accordingly, Congress may be called upon to consider whether existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the state-by-state regulatory structure for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for a possible interstate CO2 pipeline network in support of CCS. Congress could amend existing statutes, such as those related to the interstate pipeline jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to provide for definitive CO2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal government if it does not favor the existing regulatory scheme. Alternatively, Congress could establish another federal regulator of CO2 pipelines or possibly other legislation to amend the existing regulatory scheme. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A common requirement among the various techniques for CCS is a dedicated pipeline network for transporting CO2 from capture sites to storage sites. In the 110th Congress, there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration, while there has been relatively less focus on transportation. Nonetheless, there is increasing understanding in Congress that a national CCS program could require the construction of a substantial network of interstate CO2 pipelines. S. 2144 and S. 2191 would require the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such a network of pipelines. S. 2323 would require carbon sequestration projects to evaluate the most cost-efficient ways to integrate CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation. S. 2149 would allow seven-year accelerated depreciation for qualifying CO2 pipelines. P.L. 110-140, signed by President Bush on December 19, 2007, requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend legislation to clarify the issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. That CCS and related legislation have been more focused on the capture and storage of CO2 than on its transportation, reflects a perception that transporting CO2 via pipelines does not present a significant barrier to implementing large-scale CCS. Notwithstanding this perception, and even though regional CO2 pipeline networks already operate in the United States for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), developing a more expansive national CO2 pipeline network for CCS could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges. There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO2 itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because CO2 pipelines for EOR are already in use today, policy decisions affecting CO2 pipelines take on an urgency that is, perhaps, unrecognized by many. Federal classification of CO2 as both a commodity (by the Bureau of Land Management) and as a pollutant (by the Environmental Protection Agency) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO2 pipeline operations today. In addition to these issues, Congress may examine how CO2 pipelines fit into the nation's overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection. If policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under CCS, then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminished - and vice versa. Thus decisions about CO2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for a broader array of energy and environmental policies. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To study the synchronous motors starting modes dynamics with nonlinear capacitive energy storage for driving the rotation mechanism with considerable momentum static resistance while limiting the stator and start windings currents. Methodology. To reach the goal we have proposed nonlinear capacitive energy storage. Its parameters vary as a function of slip. This allows to compensate the synchronous motor excitation winding inductance, and by reducing the phase shift between the vectors of the e.m.f. and the current flowing through the coil, to increase the electromagnetic torque generated by it. The checking of the basic theoretical positions was made by numerical modeling methodology. For the research of influence of the nonlinear energy storage we have calculated synchronous motor starting modes by Park-Gorev equations in relative units of the system "" xad "" Findings. The analysis of the calculated dependence showed that, compared to starting with an additional resistor multiplicity f R8, start-up time CC3-2000-100 motor with the proposed non-linear capacitive storage decreased by 20.8% from 1200 r.u. to 950 r.u. Starting torque decreased from 4.8 r.u. to 3 r.u., and the average asynchronous torque increased from 1.6 r.u. to 2.3 r.u. The current in the field winding, connected to the energy storage, reached the value of 6.5 r.u in the beginning of start-up. The average value of the stator current decreased from 6.2 r.u. to 5.8 r.u. Originality. We have proposed the construction of the nonlinear capacitive energy storage, parameters of which depend nonlinearly on the frequency of the current flowing through it, and carried out theoretical studies of its influence on the asynchronous start of synchronous motor. Practical value. The proposed non-linear capacitive energy storage can find its application in the starters for synchronous motors in driving systems of wide range of industrial machinery.

Industrial processes can be a source of pollution and population should be promptly informed of any change in the concentration of harmful gases. Unlike industry, gases that are produced in landfills is impossible to avoid due to natural processes and general tendency is to use gas emissions as an energy source (natural gas) or converted into harmless compounds by combustion. The system is suitable for use in terrain conditions and operating on battery or solar power. Electrochemical and infrared sensors are built into the system because of low power consumption and an extended measurement range. The accuracy of the measurements is satisfactory, with fast response and generally good selectivity to the target gases. Signals from set of sensors are processed in local microprocessor unit and collected data are send via GPRS or serial communication to server for storage, interpretation and transformation in form acceptable for end users.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen engages a signal transduction pathway known as unfolded protein response (UPR) that feedback to recover ER homeostasis or to trigger apoptosis of irreversible damaged cells. The UPR is initiated by three main stress sensors including protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), which reprogram the genome through the control of downstream transcription factors.

Gas storage has to cope with an increasingly difficult market environment in Europe: gas demand growth in the region will be waning in the next years, leading to reduced price spreads, while the overall need for shortterm flexibility keeps soaring. In addition, the need for long-term flexibility and security of supply remains unchanged as the technical, economic and political risks in transit countries persist or even increase with growing import rates. However, storage utilisation seems to decrease due to the current market boundaries indicated by the recent filling status at European gas storage sites, which is remarkably lower compared with former years. This article analyses the flexibility services, such as line packing, trading products, swing production, long-term contracts and in particular gas storage. The usage of gas storage is influenced by temperature and price forecast (spreads and volatility) as well as the power market and hence indirectly also by the future usage of renewable energy sources. These challenges are evaluated, resulting in proposed solutions for new flexibility products, which focus on more mature and liquid gas markets; those products shall be (and to a certain extent already are) provided by storage operators. © 2013 URBAN/VERLAG Hamberg.",,"Energy markets; Long-term contracts; Market environment; Political risks; Price forecasts; Regional markets; Renewable energy source; Security of supply; Costs; Liquefied gases; Renewable energy resources; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890659446

Slight differences in the initial nitrate concentration, even minimal increments of 0.2 mM, significantly modify the microalgal response towards nitrogen limitation. This stress condition reduced cell proliferation, but increased cell mass values due to the simultaneous accumulation of two storage compounds: lipids, which contained up to a 55.9 % of total fatty acids; and carbohydrates, which may be primarily composed by starch. The highest biomass and lipid productivities of 98.24 and 43.24 mg/l/day, respectively, were attained at an initial nitrate concentration of 0.6 mM. The theoretical annual projection, based on these productivities, allowed the estimation of the liquid fuel energy yields, which are comparable or even higher than those calculated for several biomass feedstocks such as corn, oil palm, sugarcane, or even fast growing grasses, confirming the potential of nitrogen-limited N. oleoabundans biomass as an appropriate feedstock for biofuel purposes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biofuels; Biomass; Fatty acids; Lipids; Microalgae; Neochloris oleoabundans; Nitrogen limitation","Biochemical composition; Biomass feedstock; Lipid productivities; Micro-algae; Neochloris oleoabundans; Nitrate concentration; Nitrogen limitation; Storage compounds; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cell proliferation; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Lipids; Palm oil; Productivity; Nitrogen; biodiesel; biofuel; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; corn oil; fatty acid; monounsaturated fatty acid; nitrate; nitrogen; palm oil; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; starch; algal growth; alkalinity; article; biochemical composition; biofuel production; biomass; carbohydrate analysis; carbon fixation; carbon utilization; cell count; cell density; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell stress; chemical parameters; dry weight; energy yield; fatty acid analysis; lipid storage; microalga; Neochloris oleoabundans; nitrate uptake; nitrogen availability; nitrogen concentration; nitrogen limitation; nonhuman; pH; Poaceae; protein content; sugarcane; Elaeis; Neochloris oleoabundans; Poaceae; Zea mays; Biological Transport; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Count; Cell Proliferation; Chlorophyta; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fatty Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Plant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890568750

The objective is to maximize the total expected net benefits over the planning horizon, incorporating the costs and benefits of electricity consumption, generation, ancillary services, load-shedding, storage and load-shifting. The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies.

One type of ECs is pseudocapacitor made of metal oxides. WO3 is an inexpensive semiconductor metal oxide which has many applications. However the application of WO3 as an EC material was rarely reported. Therefore in this research EC was prepared from WO3 nanomaterial synthesized by a sol-gel process. The WO3 gel was spin-coated on graphite substrates and calcined at various temperatures of 300°C, 400°C, 500°C and 600°C for 1 h. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to observe the capacitive property of the WO3 samples. SEM, XRD, FTIR and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses were used to characterize the material structures. WO3 calcined at 400°C was proved to have the highest capacitance of 233.63 F·g-1 (1869 mF·cm-2) at a scan rate of 2 mV·s-1 in 1 mol/L H2SO4 between potentials -0.4 and 0.4 V vs. SCE. Moreover it also showed the most symmetric CV curves as the indication of a good EC. Hence WO3 calcined at 400°C is a potential candidate for EC material of pseudocapacitor type. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","calcination; electrochemical capacitor (EC); sol-gel process; WO3 nanomaterial",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890103263

The analysis takes into account the available solar potential for UAE and in particular for the Emirate of Sharjah. In order to identify the least-cost feasible option for each renewable energy source for power-generation (RES-E) technology, a parametric analysis is carried out by varying each RES-E candidate system capital cost. From the analysis it is evident that an alternative cost-effective technology to the installation of a 50 MWp PV system might be the utilisation of a 50 MWe parabolic trough CSP system with either a 14.5 h thermal storage system or a 24/7 operation. The advantages of the latter are the dispatchability and the increased electricity output due to the utilisation of a thermal storage system, which leads to higher amounts of annual CO2 avoided emissions. However, the electricity selling prices are higher than the current UAE electricity tariffs; therefore, for the promotion of solar RES-E technologies in the UAE, relevant financial supporting mechanisms need to be developed such as feed-in tariffs or feed-in premiums. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.","concentrated solar power; cost of electricity; photovoltaics","Concentrated solar power; Cost of electricity; Cost-effective technology; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Supporting mechanisms; Thermal storage system; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electricity; Environmental technology; Heat storage; Solar energy; Technology; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy use; installation; parameterization; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; solar power; tariff structure; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887039339

The liver is a central organ in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism, and it participates in triglyceride synthesis, export, uptake and oxidation. The metabolic syndrome and associated diseases are among the main concerns of public health worldwide. One of the metabolic syndrome components is impaired triglyceride metabolism. Diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome promote the appearance of hepatic alterations e.g., non-alcoholic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. In this article, we review the molecular actions involved in impaired triglyceride metabolism and its association with hepatic diseases. We discuss mechanisms that reconcile the chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, and new concepts on the role of intestinal micro-flora permeability and proliferation in fatty liver etiology. We also describe the participation of oxidative stress in the progression of events leading from steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Finally, we provide information regarding the mechanisms that link fatty acid accumulation during steatosis with changes in growth factors and cytokines that lead to the development of neoplastic cells. One of the main medical concerns vis-à-vis hepatic diseases is the lack of symptoms at the onset of the illness and, as result, its late diagnosis. The understandings of the molecular mechanisms that underlie hepatic diseases could help design strategies towards establishing markers for their accurate and timely diagnosis. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Hepatic disease; Inflammation; Insulin resistance; Liver; Metabolism; Triglycerides","2, 4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; alpha tocopherol; betaine; bezafibrate; fibric acid derivative; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; pentoxifylline; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; stress activated protein kinase; tetrahydrolipstatin; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; article; chronic inflammation; diabetes mellitus; fatty liver; human; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipid peroxidation; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; liver fibrosis; liver transplantation; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; risk factor; Fatty Liver; Fibrosis; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lactones; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Diseases; Liver Neoplasms; Metabolic Syndrome X; Oxidative Stress; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888037890

The PV part of the spectrum is further split into several subbands directed to bandgap appropriate solar cells on an inexpensive Si substrate. Epitaxial Ge on Si is used as a virtual substrate for III-V semiconductor growth. At long and very short wavelengths where PV efficiency is low, solar radiation is directed to a high temperature thermal storage tank for electricity generation using heat engines. The potential of using PV waste heat due to thermalization of high energy photoelectrons for electricity generation is also investigated.

This allows the high frequency components of intermittent power to be diverted to the EV battery, while the remaining, slowly changing power is fed to the AC distribution system. However, studies of lithium-ion (Li-ion) EV batteries have shown that frequent and rapid charging and discharging reduces battery lifetime.

Special attention is paid to the vibration reduction and the stable passage through the first critical speed. Design/methodology/approach - The finite element method based on Euller-Bernoulli beam theory is applied in the formulation of the rotor model. Since rotor/AMB systems are complex mechatronic systems, reduced order approach is used in the control system design. This study applies the modal decomposition method and the modal truncation method, thus retaining the lower order bending modes. The obtained numerical results are compared with the measured open loop frequency responses and the existing differences are compensated in order to obtain accurate numerical model. Findings - Frequency response of the entire system model (flexible shaft, actuators, power amplifiers and sensors) with amplitudes expressed in rotor lateral displacements can be verified by the measured frequency responses. The deviations in the amplitude and phase diagrams are then successfully corrected using the appropriate model modifications. Practical implications - The results of this research find direct applications in flexible rotors supported by AMBs, e.g. high speed spindles, turbo molecular pumps, flywheel energy storage systems, etc. The presented procedure can be especially valuable in the design of model based controllers. Originality/value - An AMB system model is developed and presented in this paper, in conjunction with a systematic description of an efficient procedure for the elimination of the typical mismatches between the simulation and experiment.

We investigated this outbreak to describe the illness in terms of person, place and time, develop the timeline of events, and determine the cause and community perceptions regarding the outbreak. Methods: We defined case-patients as students from affected schools reporting any two symptoms including abdominal pain, heartburn, bitter taste, and headache after eating biscuits on the day of illness. We conducted indepth interviews and group discussions with students, teachers, parents and community members to explore symptoms, exposures, and community perceptions. We conducted a questionnaire survey among case-patients to determine the symptoms and ascertain food items eaten 12 hours before illness onset, and microbiological and environmental investigations. Results: Among 142 students seeking hospital care, 44 students from four schools qualified as case-patients. Of these, we surveyed 30 who had a mean age of 9 years; 70% (21/30) were females. Predominant symptoms included abdominal pain (93%), heartburn (90%), and bitter taste (57%). All students recovered within a few hours. No pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, Shigella or Salmonella spp. were isolated from collected stool samples. We found no rancid biscuits in schools and storage sites. The female index case perceived the unusually darker packet label as a ""devil's deed"" that made the biscuits poisonous. Many students, parents and community members reported concerns about rumors of students dying from biscuit poisoning. Conclusions: Rapid onset, followed by rapid recovery of symptoms; female preponderance; inconsistent physical, microbiological and environmental findings suggested mass sociogenic illness rather than a foodborne or toxic cause. Rumours of student deaths heightening community anxiety apparently propagated this outbreak. Sharing investigation results and reassuring students and parents through health communication campaigns could limit similar future outbreaks and help retain beneficiaries' trust on nutrition supplementation initiatives. © 2013 Haque et al.",,"Bangladesh; child; epidemic; female; human; hysteria; male; mass behavior; psychology; school; statistics and numerical data; student; Bangladesh; Child; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Hysteria; Male; Mass Behavior; Schools; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893572490

To optimise their survival probability, fish must balance the need to out-grow predators by maximising their growth, while also accumulating sufficient energy reserves to sustain them through winter. We tested the hypothesis that resource allocation in Chrysophrys auratus changed from maximising growth to maximising energy storage over their first summer-autumn by measuring recent growth rates from otolith increments, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations in fish. Lipid concentrations showed the greatest change over the growing season, increasing three-fold between summer and mid-autumn. Growth rates showed the opposite trend, being significantly lower in mid-autumn than in summer. The relationships between growth rate and lipid or protein concentrations were consistent with a shift in resource allocation from growth to storage. During summer and early autumn, growth rates were independent of protein or lipid concentrations, but during mid-autumn there were significant positive correlations between the variables. Biochemical concentrations were independent of fish size, indicating that the accumulation of sufficient energy reserves for winter is determined by the timing of settlement and subsequent feeding conditions, which are likely to affect interannual recruitment variability of this important species. © CSIRO 2013.","Carbohydrates; Daily otolith increments; Energy allocation; Lipids; Nutritional condition; Pagrus auratus; Proteins; Seasonal changes","carbohydrate; energy; feeding; fish; growing season; growth rate; juvenile; lipid; otolith; perciform; probability; protein; recruitment (population dynamics); resource allocation; summer; survival; temperate environment; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886791409

One of the problems normally faced in tropical countries is pest infestation by the insect Sitophilus zeamais Motsch during the storage of maize in silo. This research aimed to study the influence of microwave treatment to the mortality of insect pest Sitophilus zeamais Motsch and to the content of starch and protein of treated maize. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Agicultural Energy and Laboratory of Food Chemistry, Bogor Agicultural University. The sample of 200 g of dry maize was invested by 50 insects and heated in a microwave exposed at 240, 480 and 720 W, respectively, for 60, 90 and 120 s. The results showed that 100% mortality could be achieved using microwave treatment with 720 W in 60 s which generated temperature of 74°C. The treatment used a very short time (60 s) compared to the use of hot air oven which needed 22 min exposure for a similar temperature. The short time heating by microwave had an advantage to maintain 68.5% starch content, and 9.4% protein while killing the insect pest totally.","Maize; Microwave treatment; Sitophilus zeamais Motsch","Hexapoda; Sitophilus zeamais; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889033044

The coke oven tar used was collected from tar decanters in the byproducts section of the coking plant. The moisture content in the tar varied depending on the residence time and water carryover from the coke oven tar separators to the storage tanks. Moisture contents of 1 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 6 wt.% were investigated in order to evaluate the effect on coal blend, carbonization, and coke properties. At 6 wt.% moisture content with 6 wt.% coke oven tar, although the coke quality improved the yield showed a 4% decrease. On the other hand, 1 wt.% moisture content with coke oven tar of 6 wt.%, increased the yield by 1% and the coke quality improved. However, the latter process was characterized by an excessive increase in wall pressure and pushing energy, both of which are detrimental to the oven walls. The optimum moisture content in coke oven tar was found to be 3 wt.% with a coke oven tar addition of 6 wt.% in the coal blend. With these conditions, the coke properties improved and wall pressure and pushing energy were acceptable. However, a decrease in coke yield of up to 2% was observed. Despite this, coke oven tar addition is considered to be a viable option based upon economic factors of a reduction in the quantity and cost of imported coking coals that is required to achieve the same optimum final coke product.© The southern african institute of mining and metallurgy, 2013.","Coal blend; Coal substitution; Coke; Coke oven tar; Coke quality; Tar moisture","Coal blends; Coal fractions; Coal substitution; Coke quality; Economic factors; Optimum moisture content; Residence time; Water carryover; Bottles; Byproducts; Coal carbonization; Coke; Coke ovens; Coking properties; Moisture determination; Tar; Coking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891780925

Storing surplus wind-generated electricity in batteries results in even greater reductions, from ∼ 20% for lithium-ion batteries to > 50% for lead-acid batteries, they found. Thus, it would actually be more energetically efficient to shut down a wind turbine than to store the surplus electricity it generates.

Consequently, the decay from the central dressed bare energy state (real energy state) of the set of the three upper closely spaced hyperfine decaying energy states of the sodium D2 line is completely cancelled under the trapping condition, exhibiting the novel phenomenon of a darkened bare energy state. Along with this cancellation, effective manipulation and storage of an atomic population in various dressed states of this one-atom quantum system are also explored.

Dissected adipose tissue from wild toque macaques (Macaca sinica) (WTM), feeding on a natural diet, accounted for 2.1% of body weight. This was far less than fatness reported for nonhuman primates raised in captivity or for contemporary humans. In WTM, fatness increased with age and diet richness, but did not differ by sex. In WTM (none of which were obese) intra-abdominal fat filled first, and ""excess"" fat was stored peripherally in a ratio of about 6:1. Intermuscular fat was minimal (0.1%). The superficial paunch held <15% of subcutaneous fat weight in contrast to its much larger proportions in obese humans and captive monkeys where most added fat accumulates subcutaneously. With increasing total adiposity, accumulating fat shifted in its distribution among eight different main internal and peripheral deposit areas - consistent with maintaining body balance and a low center of gravity. The available data suggest that, in arboreal primates, adaptations for agile locomotion and terminal branch feeding set constraints on the quantity and distribution of fat. The absence of a higher percentage of body fat in females and neonates (as are typical of humans) suggests that arboreal adaptations preclude the development of fat-dependent, large-brained infants and the adipose-rich mothers needed to sustain them. The lifestyle and body composition of wild primates represent a more appropriate model for early human foragers than well-fed captive monkeys do.

This is measured in terms of LPSP (Loss of Power Supply Probability), which is computed by simulation. The proposed method allows the possibility to supply excess power generated by the HES to the utility grid at a fixed sales price or through a Net Metering scheme. The system and design method proposed represent a viable alternative for grid-only power supply in rural/remote communities. As an example, a concrete case study is presented involving 15 homes (1 block) in Hanga Roa city of Easter Island, Chile. Results indicate that the grid-connected HES is highly beneficial for the block since it reduces long term costs of electricity generation and supply while at the same time supporting their energy consumption with cleaner, renewable energy sources, and contributing to reduce the load size of the utility grid power supply. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Business optimal design; Easter Island; Grid-connected HES (hybrid energy system); Hybrid PV (photovoltaic)-wind energy system; Life cycle cost; Net Metering","Energy utilization; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Easter island; Hybrid energy system; Lifecycle costs; Net metering; Optimal design; Wind energy systems; Electric power distribution; design method; electricity generation; energy; energy use; hybrid; life cycle; photovoltaic system; simulation; Chile; Easter Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885948703

Volatiles released during storage at 20°C for 24h were monitored using on-line Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (m/. z 21-180). Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) was used to evaluate possible correlations between enzymes and volatiles released during storage. The results showed that temperature treatment had significant effect on all enzymes, except LOX. Temperature treatment at 70°C resulted in at least 65% decrease in POD and AAO activity. In contrast, SOD and CAT activities generally increased during storage after temperature treatments. PLSR2 results showed that volatiles released after different temperature treatments and 24h storage had a strong correlation with the residual activity of POD, AAO and SOD but not CAT and LOX. PLSR1 results suggested that POD had the highest correlation to volatile release during storage of processed broccoli followed by AAO, SOD, CAT and LOX (the least). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Broccoli; Enzyme activity; Storage; Temperature treatment; Volatile release","Ascorbic acid oxidase; Broccoli; Effects of temperature; Partial least square regression; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; Superoxide dismutases; Temperature treatments; Volatile release; Energy storage; Enzyme activity; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Temperature; Enzymes; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. italica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879779672

Mitochondrial function (MF) analysis allows direct measurement of cellular metabolic function and may provide an additional index of hepatic health. Conventional MF analysis requires substantial tissue samples (.100 mg) obtained at open surgery. Here we report a method to assess MF using ,3 mg of tissue obtained by a Tru-cutH biopsy needle making it suitable for percutaneous application. Methods: An 18G BardH Max-coreH biopsy instrument was used to collect samples. The optimal Tru-cutH sample weight, stability in ice-cold University of Wisconsin solution, reproducibility and protocol utility was initially evaluated in Wistar rat livers then confirmed in human samples. MF was measured in saponin-permeabilized samples using high-resolution respirometry. Results:The average mass of a single rat and human liver Tru-cutH biopsy was 5.6060.30 and 5.1660.15 mg, respectively (mean; standard error of mean). Two milligram of sample was found the lowest feasible mass for the MF assay. Tissue MF declined after 1 hour of cold storage. Six replicate measurements within rats and humans (n = 6 each) showed low coefficient of variation (,10%) in measurements of State-III respiration, electron transport chain (ETC) capacity and respiratory control ratio (RCR). Ischemic rat and human liver samples consistently showed lower State-III respiration, ETC capacity and RCR, compared to normal perfused liver samples. Conclusion: Consistent measurement of liver MF and detection of derangement in a disease state was successfully demonstrated using less than half the tissue from a single Tru-cutH biopsy. Using this technique outpatient assessment of liver MF is now feasible, providing a new assay for the evaluation of hepatic function. © 2013 Chu et al.",,"animal tissue; Article; cell assay; cell function; clinical article; controlled study; electron transport chain capacity; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver mitochondrion; liver perfusion; liver weight; male; mitochondrial respiration; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; physical parameters; rat; respiratory chain; respiratory control ratio; respirometry; species difference; tissue characterization; animal; biopsy; electron transport; energy metabolism; evaluation study; homeostasis; liver function test; mitochondrion; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; Wistar rat; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Animals; Biopsy; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Humans; Liver Function Tests; Male; Mitochondria; Rats, Wistar; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925552962

Flow periods and reservoir boundary types are easily delineated and identified with the use of these curves. Furthermore, near wellbore characterization results are now more reliable. In this study, type curves for a reservoir subject to bottom water energy and a vertical well completion are developed to reveal specific signatures that can be used to achieve efficient pressure test analysis. Both early and late flow periods were considered for a wellbore of negligible skin and wellbore storage influences. Results obtained show that dimensionless pressures depart from infinite-acting behavior and attain steady state at dimensionless time of order proportional to the square of dimensionless reservoir thickness. Wellbore dimensionless radius affects dimensionless time of attainment of steady state inversely, which is rather accelerated by large fluid withdrawal rates (large pressure drawdown). On the other hand, dimensionless pressure derivatives show gradual collapse to zero after expiration of infinite flow. The rate of collapse is strongly affected by wellbore properties and pressure drawdown. Radial flow is generally characterized by a constant slope of 1.151 during which period the dimensionless pressure derivative gave a value of 0.5. Following assumption of negligible wellbore skin and storage, no early time hump is observed on dimensionless derivative curves. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bottom water; Dimensionless pressure; Dimensionless pressure derivative; Dimensionless time; Type curves; Vertical well","Bottom water; Dimensionless time; Pressure derivatives; Type curves; Vertical wells; Well completion; Well testing; Oil field equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885988891

Distributed generation and energy storage enable control of microgrid power flow which can be optimized for participation in the electricity markets. This paper presents an optimization model for economical scheduling of a microgrid using linear programming. Two microgrid models are taken into account. The microgrid proposed in the first model consists of thermal and electrical loads and a CHP unit. The second model consists of the units considered in the first model with addition of thermal and electrical storage. Optimization results for the two cases are compared to determine the impact of energy storage on an optimal scheduling. Operational costs are calculated for both cases and compared to the benchmark case where thermal energy is supplied from a gas fired boiler and all electricity is acquired from the grid. Additionally, the savings in several cases of energy storage size are compared. © 2013 MIPRO.","CHP; energy storage; optimal scheduling","CHP; CHP-systems; Electrical load; Electricity market; Micro grid; Optimal scheduling; Optimization modeling; Power flows; Communication systems; Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Information technology; Microelectronics; Scheduling; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886922863

A combination of ideologically driven environmental activism and inadequate fossil fuel industry response has made electricity rates soar with little carbon emissions benefit. Climate change, which tied for first place in the 2007 national election, fell to fifth place in 2013. The country needs a coherent long-term, bipartisan energy and climate strategy that makes realistic strides toward carbon capture and storage, creates a grid which allows renewable sources to enter once they become feasible, and science and innovation to drive future costs down, according to Chris Greig. Australia's coalbed methane production is growing to replace dwindling conventional production, but its shale gas resources - which are considerable - are located in the central part of the country where water is scarce and markets are far away. Government energy R&D in Australia has been almost entirely government-driven, while fossil fuel R&D has come from that industry with a heavy coal bed methane focus.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888123901

However, it possesses a high vapor pressure and reactivity which require stabilization via complexing agents, which reduce reactivity and vapor pressure without changing its electrochemical properties. Currently, bromide based batteries like the Zinc/Bromine cell, use as Bromide complexing agents, either Methyl Ethyl Morpholinium Bromide (MEM) or Methyl Ethyl Pyrrolidinium Bromide (MEP) or their mixture. Both complexing agents have been well known in the field for about 40 years. A possible drawback of their use as complexing agents for bromine is that they are not always compatible with different bromide chemistries. ICL-IP has developed a family of new effective Bromide complexing agents that are compatible with various bromide based chemistries and applications. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Complexing agents; Electro actives; Morpholinium; Pyrrolidinium; Energy storage; Hydrostatic pressure; Vapors; Bromine",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885668351

The optimal utilization of energy is a vital task today, as it determines the state of environment, technology and product price. The present work describes a method for the reduction of energy consumption by heat integration, in a system of bioreactors for the production of antibiotics. A scheme for heat integration of two heat reservoirs is suggested, ensuring performance at different time intervals. A mathematical model of the processes taking place in the two reactors is developed. On the base of the model, a strategy for optimal control of energy resources using heat integration of two heat reservoirs is proposed. The optimization task is formulated in terms of the Mixed Integral Non-Linear Programming (MINLP).

It is identified as an excellent candidate for geological CO2 storage due to its location and proximity to major CO2 emission sources, high storage capacity potential, and multiple overlying sealing units, which can ensure safe CO2 storage for the long term. A U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored pilotscale project has been funded in which 40,000 metric tons of CO2 from a nearby biofuel plant will be injected in the lower part of the Arbuckle reservoir over a period of nine months at Wellington field in Sumner County, Kansas.

The key objective is to estimate the resulting rise in pore fluid pressure, the extent of CO2 plume migration, and geomechanical and geochemical stability of the formation rock and any structural features that may be present.

The nominal 70 L hydrogen storage capacity of the container (T = 20 C, P = 101.3 kPa) suffices for ca. 2.5 h operation of a 50 W hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell stack. The hydride container is provided with aluminum extended surfaces to enhance heat exchange with the surrounding medium. These surfaces consist of internal disk-shaped metal foils and external axial fins. The characterization of the storage prototype at different hydrogen discharge flow rates was made by monitoring the internal pressure and the temperatures of the external wall and at the center inside the container. The response of the storage device was tested at room temperature under different conditions such as natural convection in air and forced air ventilation, and at different temperatures in a thermostated water bath, representing possible real situations to feed hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells. Current results are discussed and correlated with each particular environmental condition and hydrogen flow rate. It is found that for some environmental conditions the flow rate discharge behavior improves significantly. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Overlapped large polaron tunneling was the observed mechanism of charge carriers in used temperature range. The presence of colossal dielectric constant in the system is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner type polarization.

Such issues include how to make investment decisions in the context of federal fiscal constraints; how to distribute investments between activities to meet new demands for water supplies and aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection; how to maintain and reinvest in an aging portfolio of federal infrastructure (e.g., locks, dams, and levees); and how to effectively respond to and prepare for flood and drought emergencies. These issues often arise at the regional level, but have a federal nexus. For example, Congress may continue to be faced with issues associated with flooding (e.g., Hurricane Sandy response and recovery), navigation and water supply challenges due to drought-induced low river flows, and balancing water supply needs of farm and urban communities with protection of threatened and endangered species. The water resource issues of the 113th Congress are in part shaped by the actions of past Congresses, including the 112th Congress. In addition to holding numerous oversight hearings on agency policies and activities, the 112th Congress provided regular annual and supplemental appropriations for major federal water research agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation). The 112th Congress did not formally consider an omnibus Corps project authorization and policy bill-typically called a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA)-but a draft Senate Environment and Public Works bill was circulated and discussed in the fall of 2012. The 112th Congress also considered legislation to augment developed water supplies (e.g., water storage, water reuse), settle Indian water rights claims, and facilitate small conduit hydropower development. The 112th Congress considered several bills related to aquatic ecosystem restoration throughout the country (e.g., Everglades, Gulf Coast, Great Lakes, Klamath Basin, and Chesapeake Bay). The 112th Congress also considered legislation related to the energy sector's water use and the water sector's energy use, as well as water research and development legislation, including research related to climate change, water resource availability, drought indicators and streamflow. The 113th Congress may consider measures similar to those left pending in the 112th Congress (e.g., a farm bill, a WRDA, hydropower development, and water research legislation), as well as other proposals. Because of current water conditions, disasters, or legal or agency developments, certain basin issues are particularly likely to receive congressional attention (e.g., operation of federal reservoirs in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin, Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins (Central Valley Project), and Missouri River Basin). Other related legislation may include the energy-water nexus and environmental policy. This report discusses recent congressional activity and possible topics for the 113th Congress. It provides an overview of the federal role in water resources development, management, and protection, including a discussion of the two major federal water resources agencies and related legislation. It also discusses overarching policy issues, such as flood and drought management and response; project funding and authorization priorities; and aquatic ecosystem restoration. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Ironically, the solution to these taunting problems may lie in something small. Nanomaterials with attractive chemical and physical properties are being explored for potential uses in energy and environmental applications. Nanostructured Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has gained considerable attention in the energy and environment sectors due to their brilliant prospects in photo catalysis, solar cells, environmental pollution treatment and its use in solar water splitting for the production of H2. There are many processing techniques such as; the Sol gel (SG), the hydro-thermal (HT), the solvothermal (ST) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) which are used in the production of nanostructured TiO2 for the applications stated above. This review aims at examining the general characteristics of nanostructured TiO2 and its application in dye sensitized solar cells, photocatalytic splitting of water and solid state hydrogen storage devices.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Thermogravimetry, Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometery were used to investigate the samples. XRD patterns confirm the formation of Y-type hexaferrite phase. SEM patterns show that mostly grains exhibit rod shape and some appear in the form of hexagonal platelet shape. The rod or rice shape hexaferrite may be used in catalysis, information storage, surface enhanced Raman scattering, imaging and sensing. The samples with hexagonal platelet-like shape particles may be suitable as microwave absorbing materials. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectrum shows the presence of dissolved reactants Sr, Co, La and Fe. The saturation magnetization (Ms) calculated using the law of approach to saturation decrease with the increasing of lanthanum (La3+) contents. The decrease in 'Ms' may be because of magnetic dilution and spin canting and hence reduction in the super-exchange interactions. The retentivity (M r) and coercivity (Hc) enhance with the increase of La3+ contents. The enhancement in coercivity from 193 to 598.6 Oe may be because of increase in the porosity of samples with the increase of La 3+ contents. The coercivity of the synthesized materials is few hundred oersteds (Oe), which may be suitable for security, switching, sensing, high frequency applications and is also favorable for electromagnetic materials. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Hexaferrites; High frequency applications; Magnetic measurements; Microstructure; Sol-gel","Electromagnetic materials; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infra reds; Hexa-ferrites; High-frequency applications; Microwave absorbing materials; Structural and magnetic properties; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Carbon dioxide; Coercive force; Differential scanning calorimetry; Magnetic variables measurement; Microstructure; Platelets; Scanning electron microscopy; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Surface scattering; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Ferrite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887317019

This product is chosen for its high-protein content and nutritional value, and its use as a very important foodstuff in developing countries. A nonlinear regression procedure was used to fit experimental drying curves with most used empirical mathematical models available in literature. The comparison criteria between experimental and calculated data were the coefficient of determination and the reduced χ2. It was found that the Midilli etal. and two-term models give the best fit. The effective diffusivity was determined to be 8.7630×10-10-3.2131×10-09m2/s in the temperature range of 45-70C and in the relative humidity range of 20-40%. The activation energies for moisture diffusion were calculated to be varied from 35.6471 to 37.2625kJ/mol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fish is a major source of food for human nutrition. In fact, silverside fish are certainly a source of proteins and lipids, approximately 6.09 and 19.11g/100g, respectively. Therefore, silverside has a great importance in Tunisian food customs. This product is characterized by its high contents of moisture, which represent the most significant cause of their deterioration after its fishing, particularly in relatively hot countries. Fish can thus be valorized by drying, which is an efficient technique for improving stabilization and storage. Thus, the basic objective in drying agricultural products is the removal of water in the solids up to a certain level, at which microbial spoilage and deterioration chemical reactions are greatly minimized. Moreover, knowledge of drying behavior is important in the design, simulation and optimization of the drying process. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Coefficient of determination; Comparison criterion; Effective diffusivities; Microbial spoilage; Non-linear regression; Relative humidity range; Simulation and optimization; Thin-layer drying models; Activation energy; Agricultural products; Deterioration; Developing countries; Digital storage; Fish; Heat convection; Mathematical models; Moisture; Nutrition; Proteins; Drying; Argentina elongata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885843569

The forced convective heat transfer inside the channels is analyzed by solving the energy equation, which is coupled with the heat conduction equation in the PCM container. The comparison between the present exact solution with the numerical predictions and experimental data available in literature shows good agreement.

The defense against excess cell swelling is accomplished also by a reduction of the intracellular osmolarity by synthesis of osmotically less active macromolecules from their specific subunits (proteosynthesis and lipogenesis). At the same time proteolysis and lipolysis is inhibited. Conversely, cell shrinkage stimulates lipolysis, degradation of proteins to amino acids, degradation of glycogen to glucosephosphate and simultaneously protein, lipid and glycogen synthesis is inibited. The degradation products are osmotically more active than the macromolecules and their breakdown generates cellular osmolarity resulting in water entry into cells. Recently new interesting view of chronic changes of the cell volume and its role in model of body weight loss and regain in obesity is considered; secretion profile of adipocytes is related to their size. Decrease of body weight is constituted by the drop of fat in adipocytes, they consequently shrink. Surrounding extracellular matrix has to adjust to traction forces. To ascertain a sufficient supply of glucose and fat for re-storage, adipocytes change their pattern of secreted adipokines altering the total body metabolism and promoting energy intake. Shrunken adipocytes show insulin resistance, whereas glucose uptake is facilitated in osmotically swollen adipocytes. Compensating mechanism in patients on very-low calorie diet during weight maintenance period includes increase in water content of adipose tissue correlating with increase of insulin sensitivity. Consideration of participation these mechanisms might bring new insight into understanding of obesity pathophysiology and treatment.","Adipokines; Chronic change of cell volume; Insulin; Obesity","adipocytokine; glucose; insulin; leptin; adipocyte; article; cell damage; cell volume; cytokine release; extracellular matrix; glucose transport; hormonal regulation; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; lipolysis; low calory diet; obesity; protein synthesis; water content; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884556549

The electrochemical properties were studied through the measurements of discharge capacity, activation process, rate capability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the electrodes. The replacement of manganese by molybdenum, in the intermediate concentration tested (2% w/w) has a positive effect. This alloy presents the greatest discharge capacity, the closest potential to system equilibrium potential and therefore the lowest overpotentials. This alloy also has the best behavior for high-rate dischargeability and in concordance, the lowest charge transfer resistance.

The simulations assessed the real case study and analysed the impact of its architectural characteristics and passive techniques on its energy requirements. The impact of solar passive heating techniques already implemented in the envelope is studied in order to take advantage of them in winter and prevent their overheating effect in summer. Besides, additional passive cooling solutions are proposed and studied aiming to decrease the cooling requirements. The results showed that the insulation of the walls and the cool roof guarantee important savings of 46% in winter and 80% in summer compared to an ordinary building. The study was also focused on the impact of the trombe walls and showed that the heating requirements are raised by 20.7% if the storage walls are omitted from the construction. The integration of internal curtains in the windows and movable solar overhangs shading the storage walls and the low-emissive Argon coatings allowed a relevant reduction in total energy demands: 60.3% for heating demands and 47.7% for cooling demands. The peak cooling load has decreased from an initial value of 14.09-8.68 kW.

The change in the upstream reservoir operation from a conjunctive irrigation/hydropower mode to exclusively hydropower generation resulted in reducing the river flow downstream in the summer and increasing it in the winter. This phenomenon caused a downstream water shortage of 2,000- 3,000 Mm3/year in the summer and an excessive, often unutilized, flow of the same magnitude in the winter. This study suggests that the current practice of sequential in-channel reservoirs is not coping well with the needs of both upstream and downstream water users. Furthermore, it examines the alternative approach of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in the upstream of Fergana Valley with a view to adapt to new water management reality. Favorable hydrogeology conditions prevailing in the Fergana Valley are envisaged to create benefits from MAR both at local and regional levels. The study follows a stepwise procedure of implementing MAR in the Fergana Valley, starting from the regional assessment of the MAR potential to testing MAR at the pilot scale through field and modeling studies. The regional assessment shows that over 500,000 ha, or 55% of the currently irrigated land in the Fergana Valley, can be shifted from canal irrigation to conjunctive surface water-groundwater irrigation. This will reduce the return flow to the river by 30% (or by 1,000 Mm3/year), and form free storages of 500 Mm3 in the command areas of main canals. Pilot-scale studies for Isfara and Sokh aquifers in the Fergana Valley support the results of regional assessment. Overall, groundwater development for irrigation and MAR in the Fergana Valley is expected to reduce the winter flow of the Syrdarya River at the valley outlet by 1,500 Mm3 /year, and consequently increase its summer flow by the same magnitude. This report proposes a major shift in the focus of development projects in the Fergana Valley, from rehabilitation of dense drainage systems to groundwater development for irrigation and MAR.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884255316

The melting and solidification of the PCM was treated as a radial one dimensional conduction problem. The forced convective heat transfer inside the channels is analyzed by solving the energy equation, which is coupled with the heat conduction equation in the PCM container. The comparison between the present exact solution with the numerical predictions and experimental data available in literature shows good agreement.

It is observed that pre-treating Si and ePTFE substrates with different plasma modes results in significant changes of microstructures of as-deposited Mg and Mg-Ti films. After the hydrogenation of Mg films at 20 bar H2 pressure and 180 C temperature the formation of crystalline MgH2 phase is observed only for the films deposited on plasma non-treated Si substrates which had the films with smallest dimensions of its columnar structure. It is known that, usually, Ti additives has positive effect on hydrogenation properties of Mg, but in this study independently of the used substrate pre-treatment technique after the hydrogenation of Mg-Ti films their XRD analysis showed no peaks of the crystalline hydride phase. However, depending on the surface properties of the substrate after hydrogenation Mg-Ti films also have several disparities which are discussed and attributed to the potentially related substrate features. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The electrochemical and storage characteristics of electrodes made from these powders with addition of electrolytic copper powder or a carbon composite (1 wt.% carbon nanotubes + 7 wt.% nanosized carbon black) as a conductive additive have been studied. In the work, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electron-probe microanalysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and several electrochemical methods have been used. It has been established that, in the initial state, the coarse-fraction gas atomized powders show a better kinetics of the hydrogen exchange reactions and higher discharge capacity (∼300 mA h/g). It is shown that electrodes made from the powders of all the fractions have a good high-rate discharge capability. Hydrogen diffusion coefficients during discharge of the electrodes made from the alloy powders of all the fractions and conductive additives have been calculated. It is shown that, for LaNi4.5Al0.5 alloy electrodes with the composite carbon additive, the hydrogen diffusion coefficients during discharge computed from data obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method agree well with those calculated from cyclic current-voltage curves (2-4 × 10 -9 cm2/s). © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Bearing in mind that hydrogen is important as an energy source in this paper we investigated the adsorption properties of sumanene toward hydrogen molecules. We used a theoretical and computational approach in the framework of density functional theory. Frontier molecular orbitals, HOMO and LUMO, are visualized and molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are created, in order to locate adsorption places. We determined H2 adsorption binding energies, for which we obtained the applicable results. The adsorption properties of sumanene molecules toward hydrogen molecules were discussed through analysis of the density of states, partial density of states and overlap population density of states.

Through this wireless function EVs get charged by microwave beam from transmitter and then receiver will capture this microwave beam which is transferred into DC power and finally stored in various electrochemical storages (e.g. Lithium ion cell, Supercapacitors). For environmental safety the beam emission zone will be protected by barrier which surrounds the vehicle charging area so that it doesn't cause any hazard on humans. Here, Li-ion battery replaces traditional fossil fuel system of automotive vehicles. Because now-a-days Li-ion batteries are considered as the dominant power source for EVs due to its high energy density, good cycle life, and good power performance.

Phase change materials (PCMs) are used to store energy in the process of changing the aggregate state from solid to liquid. The energy balance equations for the various elements of the still as well as for the PCM are formulated and numerically solved. In meteorological conditions taken on 15th of June 2011 at the Errachidia city (Latitude: 31°58'N, Longitude: 4°20'W), Morocco, numerical calculations have been carried out for three kinds of PCMs which have different melting temperatures. To validate the simulation results, the brackish water temperature is compared with the analytical expression and the existing results in the literature. The obtained results show that the excess energy produced during sunshine times is stored in a PCM for use later during the night. Moreover, it is highlighted that the choice of the phase change material (PCM) depends closely on the maximum of the brackish water temperature that can reach by the brackish water in the basin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish water; Desalination; Heat energy storage; Phase change material (PCM); Solar still","Aggregate state; Analytical expressions; Brackish water; Energy balance equations; Heat energy storage; Meteorological condition; Numerical calculation; Solar stills; Computer simulation; Desalination; Distillation; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Solar heating; Temperature; Water filtration; Phase change materials; brackish water; desalination; distillation; numerical model; solar power; water temperature; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879566126

Box 32, El-Alia, 16111 Algiers, Algeria","A new predicting approach of long-term storage capacity for autonomous PV installations has been developed using the rescaled range analysis (R/S). The method consists mainly in establishing a mathematical law between the (R/S)τ ratio and the time period τ. The method has been tested over one year for two autonomous PV systems located in the huge desert of Algeria. Data used are converted solar energy which are not stationary. The experimental results show that even if the condition of stationarity is not satisfied, the rescaled range is well described by a power function of the time, this is possible by introducing a new exponent E. Using the power law the PV storage capacity is predicted for periods ranging from 1 to 5 years. The obtained results show that for an energy demand equalling the mean of converted energy, a storage of several months is needed to obtain the autonomy of the PV systems, consequently it will be too expensive to set-up such PV installations.

The aims were to evaluate physicochemical characteristics and to predict shelf life by sensory analysis. Extrudates were made using a Brabender 20 DN single-screw extruder. Specific mechanical energy consumption (SMEC), expansion ratio, specific volume, water solubility and water absorption were measured. Extrudates were stored at three temperatures (12.5, 30 and 45 °C) for 50 days. Colour, crispness and rancid flavour were evaluated by a trained panel. Both addition of haemoglobin and enhancers did not produce significant differences for SMEC, expansion and specific volume. Flavour was the attribute with the greatest degree of damage during storage, thus was used for predicting shelf life. The expanded product added with haemoglobin, and Na2EDTA could be kept for 15 months at 15 °C or 10 months at 22 °C without rancid flavour development. © 2013 Institute of Food Science and Technology.","Extrusion; Haemoglobin; Maize/soybean; Rancid flavour; Shelf life","Haemoglobins; Maize/soybean; Physicochemical characteristics; Shelf life; Shelf-life estimations; Significant differences; Single screw extruder; Specific mechanical energy; Energy utilization; Extrusion; Mammals; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881614320

The storage and plant models are simple and easily solved, yet they describe major performance characteristics observed in experiments. We show that the sliding pressure mode with constant heat extraction, currently preferred for operation from storage, does not provide constant electrical power output. A variant of sliding pressure, accounting for the variation of the thermodynamic cycle efficiency, can achieve nearly constant electrical power output. Moreover, the model shows that constant power operation can be achieved even for natural PCM without heat transfer enhancement, potentially reducing the complexity and cost of the storage system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating solar power (CSP); Direct steam generation (DSG); Latent heat thermal storage; Phase change materials","Concentrating solar power; Direct steam generation; Electrical power output; Heat discharge rates; Heat Transfer enhancement; Latent heat thermal storage; Performance characteristics; Solar thermal power plants; Heat storage; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Steam engineering; Thermodynamic properties; Solar concentrators; complexity; electrical power; evaporation; heat transfer; latent heat flux; power plant; solar power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880386884

We show that a generation mix comprising 49% hydro, 23% wind, 13% geothermal, 14% pumped hydro energy storage peaking plant, and 1% biomass-fuelled generation on an installed capacity basis, was capable of ensuring security of supply over an historic 6-year period, which included the driest hydrological year on record in New Zealand since 1931. Hydro spillage was minimised, or eliminated, by curtailing a proportion of geothermal generation. Wind spillage was substantially reduced by utilising surplus generation for peaking purposes, resulting in up to 99.8% utilisation of wind energy. Peaking requirements were satisfied using 1550. MW of pumped hydro energy storage generation, with a capacity factor of 0.76% and an upper reservoir storage equivalent to 8% of existing hydro storage capacity. It is proposed that alternative peaking options, including biomass-fuelled gas turbines and demand-side measures, should be considered. As a transitional policy, the use of fossil-gas-fuelled gas turbines for peaking would result in a 99.8% renewable system on an energy basis.

Since the SSDs are more energy efficient than HDDs, aggressive prefetching for the data in the HDD level enables it to have as much standby time as possible in order to save power. In the Eco-Storage system, the application can still read its on-demand I/O reading requests from the hybrid storage system while the data blocks are prefetched in groups from HDD to SSD. We show that these two steps can be handled in parallel to decreases the system's power consumption. Our Eco-Storage technique differs from existing energy-aware prefetching schemes in two ways. First, Eco-Storage is implemented in a hybrid storage system where the SDD level is more energy efficient. Second, it can group the informed prefetching process and quickly prefetch the data from the HDD to the SSD to increase the frequent HDD standby times. This will makes the application finds most of its on-demand I/O reading requests in the SSD level. Finally, we develop a simulator to evaluate our Eco-Storage system performance. Our results show that our Eco-Storage reduces the power consumption by at least 75 % when compared with the worst case of non-Eco-Storage case using a real-world I/O trace. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Hybrid storage system; Informed prefetching; Parallel storage systems; Power consumption","Energy efficient; Hard Disk Drive; Hybrid storage systems; Parallel storage systems; Pre-fetching scheme; Prefetching; Prefetching techniques; Solid state disks; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Hard disk storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880325540

In this study, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Elpida) and strawberries (Fragaria×ananassa cv. Camarosa), were harvested (breaker and 100% of surface red color respectively) and treated with 4kJm-2 of UV-C, at low (3Wm-2) or high (33Wm-2) radiation intensities. Untreated fruits were used as controls. After the treatments and at different storage times the incidence of postharvest rots and the changes in fruit physical and chemical properties were determined. UV-C treatments reduced decay, with the effects being were more marked in fruit exposed to high intensities. Mold counts were unaffected by the treatments, suggesting that improved disease control did not result from greater germicide effect. In both fruit species exposure to UV-C radiation delayed ripening, evidenced as lower color development, pigment accumulation and softening. UV-C-treated fruit maintained better quality than the control. In strawberry, high intensity treatments were more effective to prevent deterioration than in tomato where the differences between UV-C treatments were subtler. Soluble solids, titratable acidity and ethanol soluble antioxidants were not affected regardless of the UV-C intensity. Consumer tests showed higher preference of fruit treated at high UV-C intensity. Results show that in addition to the applied dose, radiation intensity is a main factor determining the effectiveness of UV-C treatments and should not be over-sighted. For a given dose, increasing radiation intensity may in some cases maximize the benefits of UV-C on fruit quality, while significantly reducing the treatments time. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..","Fluency; Irradiation; Quality; Strawberry; Tomato","Fragaria x ananassa; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876698878

Wind power growth, in particular, is likely to require the support of dedicated fast-start reserve capacity. Moreover, in New Zealand, non-pumped hydroelectricity-based storage has only limited potential to meet seasonal variations of hydro inflows. This constraint has contributed to several 'dry-year' events over the last decade. This case study surveys New Zealand electricity sector experts as to the feasibility of meeting reserve capacity needs while reducing carbon emissions through the introduction of pumped hydro and utility-scale batteries by 2025. Most respondents project peak power demand to continue to increase, resulting in new-build centralised (∼150 MW) thermal reserve power sources. Pumped hydro is seen by most as prohibitively costly, but is almost universally viewed as technically capable of providing renewables support and peak power adequacy. Utility-scale batteries are seen as least cost-effective, with very high storage costs per kWh and most likely only to be used in NZ for very high-value applications where there is a strong technical advantage, such as the six-second instantaneous reserve. A price of carbon of around NZ$100/tCO2-e, however, was seen as making these technologies much more competitive, and climate change mitigation was seen as a strong driver of these storage options. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost of storage; Energy storage; New Zealand; Pumped hydropower; Reserve electricity generation; Utility-scale batteries","Carbon emissions; Centralised; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Electricity storages; Hydro inflow; Most likely; New zealand; Peak power; Power sources; Pumped hydropower; Renewable electricity; Renewables; Reserve capacity; Seasonal variation; Storage costs; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Energy storage; Hydroelectric power; Wind power; Costs; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; energy use; hydroelectric power; perception; renewable resource; seasonal variation; storage; thermal power; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874557020

By means of fuel cells, hydrogen can serve as a clean fuel, i.e. without the emission of pollutant gases, for the production of electricity in which it is known as the hydrogen economy. Another main advantage of hydrogen is that is the fuel, which provides the highest amount of energy per unit weight. However, the large-scale implementation of hydrogen requires significant advances in further lowering its production costs and finding efficient techniques for its storage and transportation. At present, there is also a strong interest to couple the inherent intermittent renewable energy systems with the production of hydrogen so that the hydrogen can return the energy stored by means of a fuel cell when the primary source (solar radiation, wind, etc.) is not available. In this chapter, we make a review of the most usual techniques for hydrogen production: steam methane reforming, gasification, electrolysis, renewable energies, etc., and costs. One important result from our findings is that hydrogen produced by biomass gasification can practically compete in costs with that produced from fossil fuels. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Alternative to fossil fuels; Biomass Gasification; Hydrogen economy; Production cost; Production of hydrogen; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Storage and transportations; Costs; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gasification; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Lead acid batteries; Renewable energy resources; Sun; Hydrogen storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883029058

CCS involves first the capture of the emitted CO2, mainly from power and industrial plants, its transportation and, finally, its injection in underground reservoirs for storage. In this chapter, we describe the four main technologies for CO2 capture: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, oxy-fuelling and chemical looping. Evidently, any of these capture techniques result in a significant energy penalty to the base plant. However, it is expected that in the future CCS will contribute to reduce global CO2 emissions. After the CO2 is captured, it should be compressed for transportation through high-pressure pipelines or ships, and finally stored into geological formations such as depleted gas reservoirs, saline formations and deep unmineable coal seams. Depending on the capture technology, the additional costs for generating electricity from a coal plant with CCS have been evaluated. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Additional costs; Carbon capture and storage; Chemical looping; Depleted gas reservoir; Energy penalties; Geological formation; Post-combustion captures; Saline formation; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Environmental impact; Industrial plants; Underground reservoirs; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883028426

Electricity storage is especially needed in distribution for loadlevelling and for integrating the frequently intermittent renewable resources. In the case of considerable hourly variations of the demand, the levelling of the load would substantially reduce the projected total generating capacity making it more efficient and less costly. In this chapter, we review the main electrical storage technologies. The most common storage devices are batteries, which are highly efficient. Batteries have evolved during the last decades from the lead-acid ones to the lithium ion, which are at present receiving the most attention. If high power, instead of energy management is needed, then the use of ultracapacitors is more appropriate. Evidently, if very large amounts of energy and power are needed, pumped hydro systems constitute the best choice. Other energy storage technologies reviewed in this chapter are compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel devices and superconducting systems. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Compressed air energy storage; Electrical grids; Electricity storages; Electricity supply and demands; Energy storage technologies; Generating capacity; Renewable resource; Storage technology; Compressed air; Economics; Environmental impact; Superconducting devices; Virtual storage; Electric energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882989848

The basic principle behind cooling is the sorption process by which coldness is generated by the evaporation of a solvent that is later adsorbed into another medium. Solar collectors for heating can be divided into flat-plate or air collectors, evacuated tube collectors and unglazed panels. In the case of air conditioning, the dominant technologies being used today are: closed chillers, which use either liquid or solid sorption materials, and open cooling cycles. In this chapter, different analyses about technology trends and how cost can be close to conventional heating and cooling systems are exposed. Moreover, it is appreciated how solar cooling systems operate more efficiently than for heating since the peak energy demand closely coincides with the highest solar irradiation. Within the field of SHC long-term energy storage is also considered to hold the heat (warm or cold) over time. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Basic principles; Conventional heating; Evacuated tube collectors; Peak energy demand; Solar cooling systems; Solar heating and cooling; Solar irradiation; Technology trends; Air conditioning; Cooling; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Solar radiation; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882953645

Generally, CSP uses concentrating high-reflective mirrors to generate high-temperature thermal energy that is fed into conventional steam or gas turbines for the production of utility-scale power. Within CSP systems, the most mature are the parabolic trough systems, which concentrate the energy from the sun by means of long cylindrical mirrors of parabolic cross section. Next in popularity are the tower systems, which use a large field of numerous flat mirrors (heliostats) to concentrate the solar direct radiation into a receiver located at the top of the tower. Also, parabolic dishes and linear Fresnel reflectors must be considered. These technologies are described in this chapter and grid parity is analysed and expected to be reached soon for locations with strong solar direct irradiation. Finally, in relation to CSP, it is important to emphasise how thermal storage as well as natural gas hybridisation can be easily added, thus practically eliminating the power intermittencies of other important renewable technologies. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Concentrated solar power; Concentrating solar power; Cylindrical mirror; Direct irradiation; Direct radiations; High-reflective mirrors; Linear fresnel reflector (LFR); Renewable technology; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Mirrors; Solar power generation; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882942651

Limiting current distortion to levels recommended in IEEE 519-1992 improves system efficiency, increases reliability, and limits voltage distortion that can adversely influence sensitive loads. This paper revisits a non regenerative active front end system that has been studied in the past but offers significant improvements to make it acceptable to the drives industry. A three-phase current injecting inductor, required in the topology, is constructed in a five limb fashion and is shown to be helpful in limiting non characteristic harmonics. Since the current injected into the split dc bus capacitor is a 360Hz ripple, it is proposed that the main dc bus capacitor be split into film capacitor for ripple current and optimally reduced electrolytic capacitor for the main energy storage requirements. Experimental results are given based on the suggested improvement and low distortion levels that were not achieved in the past have been shown to be attainable. Comparison between a standard three-limb inductor and a five-limb inductor is made to highlight the performance improvements achievable. Adoption of the topology for common dc bus applications is also proposed. © 2013 IEEE.","Active Harmonic Filter; Five-limb Inductor; Harmonic Mitigation; Non-regenerative Active Filter","Active harmonic filters; Discontinuous current; Five-limb Inductor; Harmonic mitigation; Non-characteristic harmonics; Non-regenerative; Performance improvements; Variable frequency drives; Active filters; Electric distortion; Electric machinery; Electrolytic capacitors; Harmonic analysis; Topology; Variable speed drives; Electric drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881628478

Instead of relaying all data to a sink node, sensor nodes can filter measurements to provide only the set of data required to compute a given function (e.g., maximum, range). In this context, the network can progressively learn where relevant data are available and use this information to compute the function over time by only querying a subset of nodes. Trails between sink and these nodes can be obtained based on bio-inspired strategies, reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the network lifetime. The adaptive behavior of swarm intelligence allows to overcome a lot of obstacles presented in wireless communication networks. In this work, we evaluate the PhINP (Pheromone-based in Network Processing) mechanism, which drives the filtering process based on the integration of metaheuristic and learning algorithms. MAX function computation in one-and multiple-source environment monitoring is used as a case study. We show by simulation that communication cost can be significantly reduced respect to traditional mechanisms, increasing the network lifetime, while keeping a low computational error.

A small fraction of a lithium based activator (typically 2.5%) modifies the protective properties of the oxide/hydroxide film on the aluminum particle surface, allowing the water to react with the aluminum.

Capacitive energy storage in the so-called supercapacitors is distinguished from other types of electrochemical energy stoage devices such as batteries by short charging times, the ability to deliver significantly higher power and to demonstrate very prolonged cycling (orders of magnitude better than rechargeable batteries). A key limitation to this technology is its low energy density and for that reason there is a considerable interest in exploring pseudo-capacitive electrodes' materials where faradaic mechanisms based on surface red-ox activity offer higher energy density than simple electrostatic interactions, yet with a very prolonged cycle life and high rate capability. Among the materials studied, one can find conductive polymers, redox functional groups and transition metals sulfides, nitrides, carbides and oxides. MoO3 is a transition metal oxide which has several options for redox activities with protons and alkaline cations in aqueous solutions due to the multi-valence nature of molybdenum. In this work, we report on pseudo-capacitor electrodes, composed of monolithic, binder free, activated-carbon/carbon-nanotubes/molybdenumtrioxide (AC/CNT/MoO3)matrices, demonstrating stable capacity up to 400 Fg-1, within a potential window of 1V in acidic aqueous solutions, during at least 10,000 cycles.

Asynchronous mobile cloud communication is a two way process which in most cases is managed via REST (from mobile to cloud) and push technologies (from cloud to mobile). There are several push notification mechanisms provided by the cloud vendors and mobile operators for delivering messages to the mobile applications (e.g. GCM, APNS, MPNS, etc.). However, these mechanisms have certain constraints such as being platform specific, limited message payload and the number of the messages that can be sent to a single handset. This paper explored the possibility of implementing a messaging framework that can be used as open notification mechanism running at the cloud for handling asynchronous delegation of mobile tasks to cloud. The framework is developed by extending a XMPP-based IM infrastructure, which can be integrated with any application server and reconfigured on demand as the mobile workload grows or shrinks. The detailed analysis of the framework shows that it is possible to send messages to the smartphones with IM, at a quality of service similar to that of other push notification mechanisms. © 2013 ACM.","Middleware; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile delegation; Notification services; XMPP","Application Servers; Mobile applications; Mobile delegation; Mobile operators; Notification mechanism; Notification Service; Processing power; XMPP; Middleware; Quality of service; Smartphones; Mobile cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881193613

Implementation options and organization of such memory have big impact on the power, area, and performance. The goal of this paper is to analyze the different options available for SRAM to enable energy efficient implementation including low voltage operation. The paper will present the findings of implementing high bandwidth (256-bit) LI cache using SRAM cell with full swing bitlne using 28nm foundry process technology [1].

In an effort to improve its hydrogen sorption kinetics, the effect of 1 mol% AlCl3 addition to LiNH2-LiH system was systematically investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared analysis and hydrogen volumetric measurements. It is shown that Al3+ is incorporated into the LiNH2 structure by partial substitution of Li+ forming a new amide in the Li-Al-N-H system, which is reversible under hydriding/dehydriding cycles. This new substituted amide displays improved hydrogen storage properties with respect to LiNH2-LiH. In fact, a stable hydrogen storage capacity of about 4.5-5.0 wt% is observed under cycling and is completely desorbed in 30 min at 275 C for the Li-Al-N-H system. Moreover, the concurrent incorporation of Al3+ and the presence of LiH are effective for mitigating the ammonia release. The results reveal a common reaction pathway for LiNH2-LiH and LiNH2-LiH plus 1 mol% AlCl3 systems, but the thermodynamic properties are changed by the inclusion of Al3+ in the LiNH2 structure. These findings have important implications for tailoring the properties of the Li-N-H system. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In a similar way, multisegmented MNs (m-MNs) can be obtained by alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic materials during the fabrication process. In both cases, nanocylinders result axially parallel and forming triangular arrays immerse themselves within the membrane used to produce them. Due to shape anisotropy, each magnetic segment presents its magnetization pointing along the cylinder axis either inward or outward of the membrane plane. The as-grown system presents no global magnetization. A strong enough localized magnetic field can revert the magnetization of small groups of neighboring m-MNs. This feature can be used to inscribe ferromagnetic patterns (FP) over either membrane surface to store fixed information (security codes or firmware). Here, we study the total energy per cylinder for the case of a disc shaped FP inscribed over a circular membrane containing a huge amount of m-MNs. To try to prevent spontaneous magnetization reversion due to thermal effects we test for m-MNs a stabilization mechanism proposed previously for homogeneous MNs: an opposite ferromagnetic band (OFB) inscribed inside the FP. We have compared inscription and stabilization of FP over arrays of homogenous and multisegmented MNs. © 1965-2012 IEEE.","Magnetic materials; Magnetic memories; Magnetic nanoparticles","Circular membranes; Fabrication process; Magnetic memory; Magnetic nano-particles; Non-magnetic materials; Spontaneous magnetization; Stabilization mechanisms; Triangular arrays; Alumina; Cylinders (shapes); Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Firmware; Magnetic materials; Magnetic storage; Magnetization; Membranes; Stabilization; Magnetic anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881096733

The increase of the light intensity from 1043,12 to 2649,10 W/m2 increased the effectiveness of the collector.

We build on this concept and take a new approach, presenting our model and simulation results, which show clearly how HC and regulation of energy intake and expenditure by consumers, along with the presence of energy storage and compensatory mechanisms in the microgrid can provide much insight on how to make these systems more efficient, sustainable and resilient, particularly when integrated to the mains. Simulation provides a good fit to the data, and the response of the system to changing supply in different scenarios was characterized by its consistency and logical framework, supporting the model employed. © 2013 IEEE.","complex adaptive systems (CAS); coordination and control; cybernetics; efficient electricity supply; energy storage; Homeostatic control; microgrids; sustainable blocks; sustainable energy systems","Complex adaptive systems; Coordination and Control; Electricity supply; Homeostatic control; Micro grid; sustainable blocks; Sustainable energy systems; Adaptive systems; Cybernetics; Electric power distribution; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880986385

Examination of cross sections by means of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy coupled to a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and micro- Raman spectroscopy revealed the same corrosion composition and structure for all the objects under study, namely an internal layer adjacent to the metal surface with ghost inclusions and an external layer containing quartz grains. The study also revealed that the presence of magnetite (Fe3O4), maghemite (γFe2O3), and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) within the internal layer is the only difference between the chemical compositions of iron corrosion products within the two layers. The results also made it possible to retrace the corrosion history during burial and long-term storage. © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2013.","Archaeology; Bambandyanalo; Conservation; Corrosion; Iron artefacts; Micro-Raman","Archaeological artefacts; Archaeology; Bambandyanalo; Chemical compositions; Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy; Iron corrosion products; Micro-Raman; Scanning Electron Microscope; Aluminum corrosion; Architecture; Conservation; Corrosion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Iron; Quartz; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Iron research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880912055

This conference has followed the tradition of being an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of information and experience in the exciting field of materials science of ternary and multinary compounds, which was initiated in 1973 in Bath, UK, by Prof. Brian Pamplin. Scientific sessions as well as keynote lectures on various topics of current interest have covered a wide range of materials science on ternary and multinary compounds, their synthesis, their properties, and their applications. About 40% of the presentations were devoted to ternary and quaternary materials for thin film photovoltaics as the traditional main topic of the ICTMC conference series, but also new topics emerged, like materials for energy storage and thermoelectrics. Interestingly, about 10% of the contributions were devoted to ab-initio calculations of electron and phonon spectra of ternary and quaternary materials for energy conversion or storage. The scientific programme of the ICTMC-18 included 6 exciting keynote lectures and 42 interesting oral contributions. Three poster sessions provided time for scientific discussions. Most of these contributions are included in the present proceedings. We were happy about a broad participation. Colleagues from 21 countries set the basis for an exciting meeting: Japan, Germany, Azerbaijan, France, Austria, Taiwan, Italy, Great Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, China, India, Belarus, Portugal, The Netherlands and Spain (order according to the number of participants).

A deep insight into the effect of Ce/La atom ratio of support chemical composition on the catalytic performance (CO conversion vs. temperature and stability) and kinetic rates of Pt-loaded catalysts was realized after employing HAADF/STEM, in situ Raman and DRIFT spectroscopies under different gas atmospheres, temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) in He and O2/He gas atmospheres following WGS reaction, CO-TPD, in situ UV-vis/DRS, oxygen storage capacity measurements, and transient 18O-isotopic exchange studies followed by WGS reaction.

Energy storage (ES) such as a battery, super capacitor, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) etc., can be used to reduce the frequency fluctuation. However, ES is extremely expensive especially for developing countries. They still prefer to minimize the use of battery or apply cheaper technology to suppress the frequency oscillation such as controllable load. This paper proposes the design of robust PI controllable load to stabilize frequency fluctuation in a remote microgrid power system. The proposed controller is a conventional first-order PI controller. To guarantee the robustness of the proposed PI controller, an inverse additive perturbation is formulated as an optimization problem and a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to tune and optimize the proposed PI control parameters.

In most published literature, Heat Integration of batch facilities is treated as a secondary objective to production scheduling, which implies that the starting and ending times of tasks are fixed a priori. However, suppression of time as a variable in the overall optimisation framework has proven to result in suboptimal results. True optimum is achieved when time is treated as a variable. The chapter presents a promising graphical technique that could be used in setting targets for heat recovery and design of the corresponding utility system. As in all graphical techniques, time is treated as a parameter rather than as a variable. This is followed by a mathematical model that allows time to be treated as a variable in setting energy targets and storage design. The performance of this model is demonstrated through a case study. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved..","Batch; Design; Heat; Integration; Utility","Batch data processing; Design; Heating; Production control; Waste heat; Batch; Graphical technique; Heat integration; Multipurpose batch plants; Production schedule; Production Scheduling; Utility; Utility systems; Integration",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942907715

The primary processing of milk includes its storage, separation, homogenization and the pasteurization process as well. The latter is a kind of heat treatment, which has been used to extend the storage life of food since the late 18th century. Although heat treatment of milk can be achieved through the use of microwave technology, the inhomogeneity of electromagnetic fields leads to an uneven distribution of temperature in the food products, therefore precluding their use in industry. The pasteurization operation is very often Critical Controll Point (CCP) according of food safety systems. In recent years our research team has developed continuously operating heat treatment pilot-plant equipment, capable of measuring and contrasting the effects of different heat treatment methods, such as thermostat-controlled water baths and microwave energy, on liquid food products. We examined and compared protein, fat and bacterial content in samples of fresh cow milk with heat-treated cow milk samples.

The PCM is a latent heat thermal energy storage system which could be a new option of performance improvement of a household refrigerator by enhancing heat transfer of the evaporator. The PCM is located behind the five sides of the evaporator cabinet in which the evaporator coil is immersed. The refrigeration system has been tested with two different PCMs (Water and Eutectic solution of melting point 0 and - 5°C, respectively) at different thermal loads. Experimental results show that the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the refrigeration cycle with PCM is considerably higher than that of without PCM. Depending on the types of PCM and thermal load, around 20-27% COP improvement of the refrigeration cycle has been observed with PCM in respect to without PCM. With the increase of the quantity of PCM (0.003-0.00425 m3) COP increases about 6%. Between two different PCMs the COP improvement for Eutectic solution is higher than Water. The experimental results with BCM confirm that, depending on the thermal load and the types of BCM average compressor running time per cycle is reduced significantly and it is found about 2-36% as compared to without BCM. © 2013 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.","Compressor; COP; Energy consumption; Household refrigerator; Phase change material",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880413179

In C15 Laves phases, hydrogen can occupy three possible interstitial positions: 96g, 32e, and 8b. To determine which one of these interstitials is the most favorable for storing hydrogen, enthalpies of formation were calculated for every site, with different concentrations of hydrogen. In order to investigate the change in electronic structure before and after hydrogenation, we calculated the electric field gradients induced by hydrogen on the vanadium, and compared them with the existing nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. This comparison enabled us to study the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the crystal lattice, as well as the occupation of possible interstitials.

We review herein a novel approach to in situ gravimetric monitoring of the compositional changes in porous carbon electrodes during their charging using the electrochemical quartz crystal admittance (EQCA) method. In addition to gravimetric sensing, mechanical changes in the electrode coating under different charge/discharge/ storage regimes can be monitored with high precision and sensitivity. Adsorption of ions in charged meso- and microporous carbons studied by EQCA was interpreted by linking them to the classical EDL models and capacitive deionization theory. Focus is provided for application of EQCA in characterizing adsorption of different series of ions, including determination of the number of solvent molecules accompanying ions during their adsorption and monitoring the molecular interactions between the adsorbed ions and bulk water. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Capacitive deionization; Capacitive deionization technologies; Compositional changes; Electric double layer; High energy densities; Micro-porous carbons; Porous carbon electrodes; Solvent adsorption; Adsorption; Electrodes; Porous materials; Quartz; Ions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880817187

In this compressor, the necessary condition for energy storage in the compressor cavity is frequency-independent, so that its operation in different cavity eigenmodes without mechanical tuning is possible. An S-band compressor operating in two different frequencies (neighboring modes) was investigated. Two characteristic geometries corresponding to different regimes of the microwave energy accumulation and release were tested using input pulses of 200-400 kW power, 2.4 μs duration, and variable frequency, 2.8 to 2.9 GHz. The geometries are characterized by an RF electric field in the interference switch that is higher or lower than the field in the cavity. The plasma discharge that switches the phases of compressor operation from energy storage to release was initiated by small metallic cones placed in the appropriate location. For both geometries, the nanosecond output pulses in two resonant frequencies were obtained; the maximal peak output power measured was ∼1.8 MW. The efficiency of the microwave extraction was limited by either an insufficient coupling to the tee output arm (in the case of a high field in the tee) or non-uniformity of the plasma discharge (in the case of low field in the tee). © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Different frequency; Mechanical tuning; Microwave energies; Microwave extraction; Neighboring modes; Resonant microwave; Rf electric fields; Variable frequencies; Electric discharges; Electric fields; Energy storage; Geometry; Natural frequencies; Compressors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880787681

This paper demonstrates how the principles of a market oriented supply chain provide a strategic framework for new research projects, focused collaboratively on plant biology, production technologies and cross-border value chains. Our research aims at the development of propagation material for early flowering perennials - Potennials™ for special markets niches in North America and Europe. The new production technologies are based on the comparative advantages of horticulture under Mediterranean climatic conditions: (1) rapid plant growth under the favorable conditions of the Mediterranean winter - relatively warm temperatures and high light intensity; (2) environmentally friendly and sustainable production in screen-houses using natural energy resources, as an alternative to production in heated greenhouses in northern regions; (3) disease-, pest-free non-dormant propagation material; (4) sea transportation of the propagation units and half-finished products at the stage of ""growth arrest"" to markets. The research is focused on about 50 different crops, while the most promising candidates are Aquilegia, Delphinium, Digitalis, Gaura, Dicentra and Hellebores.

Here homeostatic regulation (HR) and control play a vital role in reaching efficient equilibrium towards reconciling power supply and demand response management. Unlike most of the work reviewed in the literature, the focus here is on supervisory control of grid-connected micro-generation systems without energy storage, aiming towards building energy efficiency, thriftiness and sustainability in energy consumption. Building on homeostatic control (HC) principles first introduced by F.C. Schweppe in 1979, the paper explores the concepts of sustainability and sustainable hybrid energy systems (SHES) applied to micro-generation, focusing on operational aspects rather than on socio-economic, environmental or regulatory ones. A concrete theoretical model for building a SHES is presented for a proposed grid-connected renewable microgrid. The model seeks to reconcile power supply and demand towards efficient equilibrium (homeostasis) proposing reward-based criteria for controlling renewable electricity supply and consumption in rural communities in Chile. Discussion and recommendations are also offered stating that energy sustainability (ES) is essentially a systems issue, and one where ES is first and foremost a structural, organizational and operational property which is in the very nature of the system itself - it is built into it - rather than explained by exogenous factors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Homeostatic control; Rural communities; Sustainable hybrid energy systems","Building energy efficiency; Complex adaptive systems; Homeostatic control; Homeostatic regulations; Hybrid energy system; Operational properties; Renewable electricity; Rural community; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879817859

To do such computations, the activation energies for different elementary processes have been estimated. Moreover, the different thermodynamical quantities of interest are determined by performing the ab-initio calculations. Then, we discuss the hydrogen diffusion in magnesium hydride (such as adsorption, diffusion and desorption). More precisely, we study the effect of each elementary mechanism on the diffusion that we characterize through the density distribution of hydrogen atoms including filling ratios, diffusion time, temperature and pressure. Among others, we show that all elementary mechanisms are needed to reproduce a behavior of ab/desorption which correlates well with the experimental results reported in literature. In particular, at high temperature and pressure, the results of simulations indicate that the studied material involves slow kinetics. © Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Storage technologies are expensive and may not be suitable for large scale installations. Recent research suggests that electric vehicles (EVs) can be used for matching power demand with generation from distributed PV installations. This approach, called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), has never been demonstrated on a residential district to make it independent of the grid. In this study, we adopt the V2G concept and apply it to the Masdar Institute (MI) campus. Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of powering MI campus 24/7 from its own rooftop solar installations by using its EVs infrastructure for storage. The results showed that the generation and EV infrastructure already in place can power MI campus for 1 to 7 hrs of storage time, respectively.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane noted that in the early days of the nuclear industry, fuel was designed for optimizing reactor operations, and no attention was paid to the back end of the fuel cycle. Also speaking at the opening plenary session was Per Peterson, with the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He began his presentation by noting that the U.S. nuclear capacity factor has increased greatly since the 1970s and is now in the 91 percent range.

As the present energy supply on Croatian islands relies mostly on fossil fuels and electricity from the mainland, it becomes obvious that exploitation of renewable energy sources is the only solution that leads towards self-sufficiency and sustainable development. In order to design a self-sufficient and sustainable island, three major technological changes are needed: integration of renewable energy sources alongside with energy savings and improvements in energy efficiency in the energy production. Analyses for several other Croatian islands have been performed using Renewislands/ADEG methodology in order to assess all possible outcomes. The scenarios in these cases have shown that islands can become self-sufficient through combining renewable technologies and energy storage systems. Energy storage systems will be crucial for achieving desired objectives in terms of energy independence from the mainland and in general import of fossil fuels. The analysis conducted for the island of Hvar will result in creation of several scenarios which will clearly point out the favorable solutions for improvement of both security of energy supply and covering the majority of energy demand with renewable energy sources and storage technologies. Also, when talking about implementation of renewable technologies on island of Hvar, an optimal mix of technologies must be applied in order to avoid excess costs and to achieve minimal impact on environment in terms of visual pollution. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Energy independence; Energy productions; Energy storage systems; Integration of renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Storage technology; Technological change; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Technology; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884201255

Also, 70%-75% of emissions are associated with the electricity generation due to the predominant role of the lignite fuelled power plants. Recently, the government has adopted a strategy for the use of renewable energy sources (RES) which identifies a target of 21% of final energy consumption from RES by 2020. In this paper, analyses are conducted in order to investigate to which extent and in which way the absorption capacity of the power system for RES electricity can be improved. For this purpose, combining various conventional and RES technologies, including pump storage hydro power plant and revitalisation of the existing lignite power plants six scenarios for the power system expansion are developed by making use of EnergyPLAN model. Critical excess of electricity analyses are conducted in order to identify the maximal penetration of wind electricity. The results have shown that in the exiting capacities maximal penetration of wind electricity in 2020 is 13% of total electricity consumption. The revitalization of the existing lignite power plants and building of pump storage power plant would increase the wind penetration. Furthermore, the developed scenarios are comparatively assessed in terms of the associated greenhouse gases emissions and import of electricity. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Absorption capacity; Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Greenhouse gases emissions; Power system expansion; Pump storage power plants; Renewable energy source; Use of renewable energies; Electricity; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Lignite; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884178138

Some types, such as storage hydro, have very good power control capabilities. On the other hand, electricity production of wind power plants is strongly dependent on the wind that is forecasted with some degree of uncertainty. If wind power plant production misses the schedule submitted to transmission system operator, the production of another power plant has to be altered in order to compensate mismatch of scheduled power production. This specially refers to sudden changes caused by outage of wind generators as a result of high wind speed. Wind power plants control could cause unpredictable power flows in the transmission network if their production is controlled by power plants that are not located in their electrical vicinity.

Such technology seems particularly advantageous being implemented in long-range electric vehicles. Up to now, almost all efforts in the field are focused on Li-air cells, and the air cathode is often considered as the most challenging component of such nonaqueous metal-air cell. The major challenges, which the research community is focusing on, are the limited ability of the air cathodes to accommodate a significant amount of metal oxide, high charge over-voltage, low cycle life and low power capabilities of the cell. By comprehensively reviewing the studies conducted so far, the aim of this extended review is to demonstrate that the implementation of nanoengineered materials (predominantly carbon-based nanomaterials, specifically, graphene and carbon nanotubes) is a promising approach to increase metal-air energy performance and, particularly, cathode ability to accommodate larger amount of metal oxide. The advantages of nanosized catalysts are also being heavily discussed; the employment of such catalysts is favorable once being implemented either onto a regular carbon black substrate, or along with nanoscaled substrate. The combination of nanoscaled supporting substrate with a proper catalyst manifests itself as a promising technology for decreasing the charge over-voltage, as well.

This study investigated the effect of changes in loading and contact friction on hoof deflections and elastic energy storage by varying the boundary conditions applied to finite element models. For all cases a load of 10Nkg-1, typical of the peak load in the trot gait, was used. In one scenario the coefficient of contact friction was varied from 0 (frictionless) to 1, at a constant non-zero joint moment, to simulate the effects of restriction of the hoof at the ground surface. In the other scenario a varying joint moment, with contact friction set at 0, was used to move the centre of pressure (COP) forward. Both increasing the ground surface friction and moving the COP forward caused the hoof capsule deflections and stored elastic energy to decrease. Peak strain energy in the capsule occurred when the frictional coefficient was 0 and when the COP was below the centre of rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint. Minimum strain energy occurred when the frictional coefficient was 1.0 and when the COP location was 30mm forward of the joint centre. Hoof expansion and elastic energy storage are considerably influenced by ground surface friction and centre of pressure location. Therefore model validation studies should account for these parameters. Maximising the energy absorption may explain why heel first landing is preferred. •Sensitivity of a finite element hoof model to loading conditions investigated.•Moving centre of pressure back increases hoof capsule deflections and stored energy.•Restriction of ground surface decreases capsule deflection and stored energy.•Hoof capsule compliance may be related to the hoof's ability to absorb concussion. © 2013 IAgrE.",,"Biomechanical effects; Centre of pressure; Contact - frictions; Distal interphalangeal joint; Elastic energy storage; Finite element models; Frictional coefficients; Ground reaction forces; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Deflection (structures); Elasticity; Energy storage; Finite element method; Friction; Loads (forces); Strain energy; Tribology; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878045380

The main conditioning operation before preparation of herbaceous biomass compositions for solid biofuel production is shredding. Shredding can increase bulk density up to 165 kg m-3. Biomass compacting represents technology for the conversion of biomass into a solid biomass fuel in the shape of briquettes and pellets. Compacting of biomass is one of the important processes for effective handling, transport and storage of this biomass fuel material. The purpose of the work was to investigate reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) comminuting energy, bulk density and briquetting energy dependence on hammer mill screen opening sizes. For comminuting was used a hammer mill, equipped with four different screens with opening sizes 20, 12, 6 and 1.5 mm. Comminuting energy for these opening sizes was stated within 11-236 kJ kg-1. Bulk density for reed canary grass by comminuting can be increased up to 165 kg m-3 if hammer mill screen with opening size 1.5 mm is used. For briquetting experiments were used a hydraulic laboratory press, where for compacting were used five different pressure levels - 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 MPa. Maximum density 899-964 kg m-3 had been achieved for compacting pressure 210 MPa. Summary energy consumption for comminuting and briquetting is approximately 50 kJ kg-1 if screen opening sizes are 12 and 20 mm in comminuting.

Metallic phase change materials (PCMs) have high thermal conductivity, which relate to high charging and discharging rates in TES system, and can operate at temperatures exceeding 560 °C. In the study, a eutectic aluminium-silicon alloy, AlSi12, is identified as a good potential PCM. AlSi12 has a melting temperature of 577°C, which is above the working temperature of regular heat transfer fluids (HTFs). The eutectic sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) is identified as an ideal HTF in a storage system that uses metallic PCMs. A concept is presented that integrates the TES-unit and steam generator into one unit. As NaK is highly reactive with water, the inherently high thermal conductivity of AlSi12 is utilized in order to create a safe concept. As a proof of concept, a steam power-generating cycle was considered that is especially suited for a TES using AlSi12 as PCM. The plant was designed to deliver 100MW with 15h of storage. Thermodynamic and heat transfer analysis showed that the concept is viable. The analysis indicated that the cost of the AlSi12 storage material is 14.7 US$ per kWh of thermal energy storage.

In this study, the effects of nanodomain structure and particle size distribution on the electrochemical intercalation of Li+ in Li 4Mn5O12 are examined by applying powder X-ray diffractions, TEM and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The composite structure of XRD-pure Li4Mn5O12 comprises layered- and spinel-like nanodomains. The formation of nanodomain structure, as well as the particle size distribution, is effectively controlled by applying two methods of synthesis: the oxalate and the acetate precursor techniques. The electrochemical intercalation of Li+ into the spinel compositions is analysed in model lithium cells in galvanostatic mode. The surface interaction of Li4Mn5O12 with the electrolyte solution is followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Morphology and microstructure of samples were analysed using XRD and particle size analysis*while estimation of penetration depth and deposition of defects were done by SRIM calculations. Hydrogen desorption properties and kinetics were evaluated from TPD measurements and numerical non-isothermal procedure. Results suggest that there are several mechanisms of desorption depending on defect concentration*their interaction and ordering.

The applications in this domain, however, currently rely on centralized or cloud-like architectures for data sharing and searching tasks, introducing both data-disclosure and performance concerns. In this paper, we present a distributed search architecture for intelligent search of objects in a mobile social community. Our framework, coined SmartOpt, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on smartphones and searches then take place over an intelligent multi-objective lookup structure we compute dynamically. Our MO-QRT structure optimizes several conflicting objectives, using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated solutions in a single run. Then a decision-making subsystem is utilized to tune the retrieval preferences of the query user. We assess our ideas both using trace-driven experiments with mobility and social patterns derived by Microsoft's GeoLife project, DBLP and Pics 'n' Trails but also using our real Android SmartP2P (http://smartp2p.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) system deployed over our SmartLab (http://smartlab.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) testbed of 40+ smartphones.

Even though, a few species remain active during the cold season, such as Hypsiboas pulchellus that has its reproductive peak during the autumn-winter period (and the consequent energy demand). The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the feeding and development of fat bodies during the low temperature season for H. pulchellus and Dendropsophus nanus. We analyzed entire gastrointestinal tract contents of both species (H. pulchellus=110 specimens; D. nanus=114 specimens) and applied an index (IRI%) that combines prey abundance, volume and frequency to describe frogs diets; we used fat bodies weights as indicators of stored energy reserves. We compared diet between species with a niche overlap index (Ojk: 0-1) and used null models to ascribe statistical significance to evaluate overlap; and we analyzed variation in empty guts proportions through months and between species. Also, using ANCOVAs we explored differences in fat bodies, number and volume of prey consumed along months, between species and sexes. The most important preys in H. pulchellus diet during the cold season were Araneae (IRI%=34.96), Chironomidae (IRI%=33.08), Tipulidae (IRI%=11.44) and Gryllidae (IRI%=7.31); while for D. nanus, Chironomidae (IRI%=48.14), Tipulidae (IRI%=18.41), Psychodidae (IRI%=7.44) and Araneae (IRI%=7.34). Diet overlap between species was elevated (Ojk=0.78) and higher than expected by chance (mean simulated indices: Ojk=0.04; p[observed≥expected]<0.01; p[observed≤expected]=1). In H. pulchellus there was a monthly variation in number of prey per gut, while in D. nanus there was a difference in fat bodies development between sexes. Fat bodies development, number of prey per gut and preys volume also varied between species. Despite diet similarity between H. pulchellus and D. nanus, each species showed a different strategy to accumulate energy and support their activity during the cold season. The low rate of gastrointestinal emptiness in H. pulchellus (<10% in any analyzed month) together with the poor development of their fat bodies, allows us to point out that, to sustain the breeding elevated energy demands, this species continues with a high feeding rate even at the low temperatures of cold season. On the other hand, the rate of gastrointestinal emptiness of D. nanus was higher than that of H. pulchellus (May=17.24%, July=22.22% and August=35.71%), while their fat bodies were well developed. Thus, D. nanus would depend more on their stored reserves to sustain the energy demands of being active during the low temperatures season and hence would reach the reproductive season in spring-summer in good body condition.","Cold season; Dendropsophus nanus; Diet; Energy source; Fat bodies; Hypsiboas pulchellus","animal; Anura; Argentina; article; classification; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; female; male; physiology; season; Animals; Anura; Argentina; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Male; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877252836

Bellstar) during prolonged storage and subsequent mechanical processing. The initial content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli florets averaged at 5.18 ± 0.23 and 0.70 ± 0.03 μmol/g fresh weight, respectively. Results showed that the content of ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli degraded during storage at 23 °C, for at least 4.5-fold after 6 days of storage. On each day of storage, broccoli florets were mechanically processed, but the content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione was not significantly affected. When the mechanically processed broccoli florets were further incubated for up to 6 h, the amount of ascorbic acid was greatly reduced as compared to glutathione. To obtain an in-depth understanding on the degradation of ascorbic acid and glutathione, the activity of enzymes involved in plant antioxidative system via ascorbate-glutathione cycle, as a response towards oxidative stress that took place during storage was determined in this study. The content of total ascorbic acid and glutathione in broccoli florets before and after mechanical processing were found to decrease concurrently with the activity of ascorbic acid peroxidase and glutathione reductase over the experimental storage duration.

This phenomenon was demonstrated by the level of oxidative stress biomarkers examined, in which the formation of lipid peroxides, protein carbonyls and DNA oxidised products was positively associated with the degradation of total ascorbic acid and glutathione. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the effect of ARG on some anthropometric parameters of MES in normal rats. Female wistar rats (60-80 g) were randomized into two groups (n = 8 animals) and exposed to 60 mg kg-1 (b.wt.) of ARG and 3 inL kg-1 b.wt. of distilled water respectively as treated and control groups. Twenty eight days oral exposure to ARG caused a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase in feed efficiency (4.83±0.06 or 19.26%) and total water consumption (0.83±0.17 L or 25.75%), but a significant (p&lt;0.01) decrease in total feed intake (0.31±0.06 kg or 20.51%), indicating suppressed calorie storage or decreased energy balance that may improve MES. Changes observed in the rats final length (0.30±0.01 m or 3.45%), total body weight gam (0.05±0.01 kg or 16.66%), body mass index(1.24±0.15kgm-2 or 1.59%) and lean body weight (0.27±0.03 kg or 0.73%) though insightful, were not significant (p&gt;0.05), warranting follow up. From the results of Pearson correlations analysis, feed efficiency correlated negatively with total feed intake (p = 0.01) but positively (p = 0.05) with total water consumption, suggesting apparent synergy in the ARG-induced effects. Thus, ARG significantly improved some anthropometric parameters of MES, hence may improve some MES features related to excessive calorie build up or storage in the female rats. The findings warrant similar studies on a longer duration for meticulousness.","Anthropometric parameters; Body mass index (BMI); Feed efficiency (FE); Lean body weight (LBW); Metabolic syndrome (MES)","arginine; animal experiment; anthropometric parameters; article; body height; body mass; controlled study; energy balance; female; fluid intake; food intake; lean body weight; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; rat; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877993010

It is produced in large quantities (20 kg per 100 L of produced beer) throughout the year at a low cost or no cost, and due to its high protein and carbohydrates content it can be used as a raw material in biotechnology. Biotechnological processes based on renewable agro-industrial by-products have ecological (zero CO2 emission, ecofriendly by-products) and economical (cheap raw materials and reduction of storage costs) advantages. The use of brewer's spent grain is still limited, being basically used as animal feed. Researchers are trying to improve the application of brewer's spent grain by finding alternative uses apart from the current general use as an animal feed. Its possible applications are in human nutrition, as a raw material in biotechnology, energy production, charcoal production, paper manufacture, as a brick component, and adsorbent. In biotechnology brewer's spent grain could be used as a substrate for cultivation of microorganisms and enzyme production, additive or yeast carrier in beer fermentation, raw material in production of lactic acid, bioethanol, biogas, phenolic acids, xylitol, and pullulan. Some possible applications for brewer's spent grain are described in this article, includeing pre-treatment conditions (different procedures for polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and cellulose hydrolysis), working microorganisms, fermentation parameters and obtained yields. The chemical composition of brewer's spent grain varies according to barley variety, harvesting time, malting and mashing conditions, and a quality and type of unmalted raw material used in beer production. Brewer's spent grain is lignocellulosic material rich in protein and fibre, which account for approximately 20 and 70% of its composition, respectively.","Bioethanol; Biotechnology; Brewer's spent grain; Enzymes; Lactic acid",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877722604

When adsorbing Pt species on C60, we find that the systems gain energy when the platinum atoms aggregate on the fullerene surface, forming clusters of different sizes and symmetries. Notable structural variations around the adsorption sites are obtained, consisting in expansions and contractions of the C-C, Pt-Pt, and Pt-C bond lengths as large as 7%. The adsorption energies vary in the range of 1.5-3.1 eV, and there is a notable Pt → C charge transfer (∼0.15e) that leads to the formation of robust Pt-C bonds. When the C60Ptn compounds are exposed to molecular hydrogen, the Pt-rich regions of the surface are the ones favorable for the dissociative chemisorption of H2. The density of states around the Fermi level is very sensitive to the presence and location of the hydrogen species in our C60Ptn structures, a result that could have strong effects on the transport properties of our fullerene compounds and can be used as a fingerprint to identify precise structural features in these kind of complexes. Using the nudged-elastic-band method, we obtain that atomic hydrogen diffuses very easily on the surface of both free-standing and C60-supported Ptn clusters. However, H-atom migration on the carbon surface is very unlikely, since barriers of the order of 1.5 eV need to be overcome. Hydrogen transfer events between platinum and carbon regions on our here-considered C60Ptn structures, so-called spillover processes, are highly dependent on the local atomic environment. When going from the single Pt atom to the small cluster regime, the spillover energy barriers vary between 0.7-1.6 eV, a result that is important to consider in order to more clearly understand recent experimental studies addressing hydrogen storage in carbon nanostructures via chemical adsorption. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption energies; Adsorption properties; Carbon Nanostructures; Chemical adsorption; Density functional theory calculations; Dissociative chemisorption; Experimental studies; Structural variations; Adsorption; Agglomeration; Atoms; Charge transfer; Density functional theory; Fullerenes; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Platinum; Transport properties; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878043724

Those schemes try to approach page mapping performance and flexibility while seeking block mapping memory usage. Furthermore, flash-specific cache systems were designed (1) to maximize lifetime by absorbing some erase operations, and (2) to reveal sequentiality from random write operations. Indeed, random writes represent the Achilles' heel of flash memories. Both cache systems and FTL schemes were designed independently from each other. This paper presents a scalable (in terms of mapping table size) and flexible (in terms of I/O workload support) Cache-Aware Configurable Hybrid (CACH) FTL. CACH-FTL uses a common feature of flash-specific cache systems that is flushing groups of pages from the same block. CACH-FTL partitions the flash memory space into two regions: (1) a data Block Mapped Region (BMR) collecting large groups of pages from the above cache (sequential I/Os), and (2) a small Page Mapped over-provisioning Region (PMR) which purpose is to collect/buffer small groups of pages coming from the cache (random I/Os) before moving them to BMR. CACH-FTL is flexible as it offers many configuration possibilities and can be adapted according to the I/O workload. CACH-FTL approaches the ideal page mapping FTL performance as it gives less than 15% performance difference in most cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Cache; Flash Translation Layer (FTL); NAND Flash Memory; Solid State Drive (SSD); Storage","Achilles' heel; Cache; Common features; Erase operation; Flash translation layer; NAND flash memory; Solid state drives (SSD); Write operations; Digital storage; Energy storage; Mapping; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877647349

Ultimately, a significant amount of water is required to produce energy and vice versa [2, 3]; motivating the need for co-optimization based approaches for the two resources. Recently, one such simultaneous co-optimization method has been contributed for the economic dispatch of networks that include water, power and co-production facilities [4]. That study showed that capacity and process constraints often limit total production cost. This paper seeks to add plant ramping behavior as potentially binding constraints and investigate the impact of water and storage facilities as a technology that can help alleviate binding constraints and lead to more levelized production and cost levels. The paper builds upon the optimization program provided in previous work [4] to develop two optimization programs with and without storage facilities and compares their respective results. Storage facilities are shown to reduce total operating costs and lead to more levelized daily production suggesting that they have an important role to play in the optimization of the energy-water nexus. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Daily production; Economic Dispatch; Optimization programs; Process constraints; Production and consumption; Ramping constraint; Storage facilities; Total production cost; Optimization; Scheduling; Water resources; Binding energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877598458

By using an electrolyser, hydrogen can be generated and stored for future use. The hydrogen produced by the electrolyser using PV power is used in the FC system and acts as an energy buffer.

It was found that the most probable mechanism contains the slow step of hydrogen atoms recombination on highly energetically nonuniform surface of CNT when the polarization is low. Increasing the polarization for more than -300 to -350 mV vs silver chloride reference electrode results in the operation of the CNT as a porous gas electrode with linear current-potential dependence. The influence of catalysts consists in the, first, decrease of the ohmic resistance of this electrode and, second, increase of the coulomb efficiency of charge (reduction of H+ ions) to discharge (oxidation of stored H2) from 70 to 80-90%.

In this paper, the operation of a simple system was simulated under different operating conditions.During the charging mode of the operation, refrigerant R134a is injected into water stored in an evaporator to exchange directly heat with the water and form clathrates.Later, the clathrate is used tocool water which is used for air-conditioning purposes. Direct contact charging and/or discharging eliminate the necessity of a heatexchanger inside the storage tank and leads to an effective heat transfermethod. The results indicate that the performance of the system depends on the refrigerant type, compressor speed and the mass flow rate of the refrigerant. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Direct contact heat exchanger; Refrigeration cycle; Thermal energy storage TES","Charging modes; Direct contact; Direct contact heat exchangers; Heat transfer rate; Mass flow rate; Refrigeration cycles; Simple system; Storage tank; Hydrates; Refrigerants; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876900704

Unfortunately, supercapacitors have significantly lower energy densities than batteries, which limit the applications for supercapacitors. The addition of pseudocapacitance, that is, chemical reactions similar to those in batteries but which behave electrically like a capacitance, can be used to increase the energy density of supercapacitors. This work focuses on increasing the capacitance of carbon nanotube (CNT)- or graphene-based supercapacitors by adding pseudocapacitive manganese oxide nanoparticles. A number of methods have been investigated for fabrication of CNT/graphene/manganese oxide composites. Manganese oxide nanoparticle pseudocapacitance has been successfully incorporated into CNT/graphene-based supercapacitors. Further optimization of the composite compositions and electrode fabrication methods is still required to optimize the energy densities of these devices. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is a widespread belief that the combination of the two renewable technologies generally improves the reliability and supply quality of electricity generation. Indeed, there are some locations where wind speeds are definitely larger during the nights because of the increased stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. However, a proper decision making requires to study the supposed benefits at the very location of designed installations. Here, we report on a model study, where the whole area of Hungary is evenly covered by wind generators and solar photovoltaic units of various composition and total rated power. The combined model output is compared to the recorded electricity consumption in Hungary. Our results indicate that the integrated output of combined renewable production can be definitely lower than the output of ""pure"" (either solar or wind) resource network of the same rated power. The main reasons are the lack of daily cycle of wind strength and the strong annual seasonality of insolation in the Carpathian basin. Benefits of combined production show up at unrealistically high rated power values which is a consequence of limited capacity factors of both renewable sources around Hungary. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Electricity generation; Electricity-consumption; Renewable sources; Renewable technology; Solar electricity; Solar photovoltaic units; Unsolved problems; Wind generator systems; Energy management; Energy resources; Rating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879956430

Compatibility analysis of natural and artificial water inflows, with the use of a small water reservoir, showed that the PV-PSH system can ensure a continuous supply of energy throughout the whole year, while winter energy shortages in the ST-PSH system can be solved by using a larger reservoir. The obtained results show that the integrated solar-hydro system is efficient and desirable in terms of achieving goals related to the increase of green energy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hydro energy; Integrated solar hydro; Renewable energy sources; Solar energy; Sustainable energy","Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Energy policy; Hydroelectric generators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Compatibility analysis; Continental climate; Energy shortages; Green energy production; Hydro energy; Integrated solar hydro; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy; Reservoirs (water); hydroelectric power; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; sustainability; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876451819

The reservoir is used for power generation, water supply and environmental improvement. Dissolved manganese (Mn) is removed from reservoir water dedicated to domestic use by purification processes. Removal of Mn, however, poses a major challenge to purification processes and warrants the study of ways to naturally reduce dissolved Mn levels in the reservoir. The source of Mn within the reservoir is not well understood, however, presumably arises from sediment mobilization initiated by variation in pH, redox potential (ORP or Eh), dissolved oxygen (O2) and ionic strength conditions. This study investigated conditions within the reservoir to further understand Mn transfer from the sediment into the water column. O2, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP or Eh), organic matter content and electric conductivity were measured in water samples and sediment from the reservoir. Sequential extraction (SE) procedures were used to test the specific effects exerted by each of these conditions on Mn mobilization from the sediments. The European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction procedure was used to quantify metals in sediment (referred to as the BCR extraction below). Statistical analysis of geochemical data from water samples (both water column and sediment pore water) and sediments demonstrated the conditions under which Mn can be released from sediments into the water column. The results indicated a primarily oxic water column and anoxic reducing conditions in the sediment (ORP or Eh ≤ -80 mV). The pH of water in contact with bottom sediments varied from 7. 6 to 6. 8. The pH of sedimentary pore water varied from 6. 8 to 4. 7. The sediments contained significant amounts of organic matter (20 %). Chemical extractions showed that the exchangeable fraction contained over 50 % of the total Mn within sediments. Microscopic analysis using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) indicated that Mn does not occur within well-crystallized mineral phases in the Riogrande II sediments. A large proportion of Mn exists instead as material adsorbed onto the surfaces of recently deposited sediment particles. Bacterial oxidation of organic matter may cause the observed anoxic conditions at the bottom of the reservoir. Mineralization of organic matter therefore contributes to reducing conditions within the sediments. Mobilization of Mn from the sediment into the water column may result from reductive dissolution of this fraction. Manganese release by this mechanism diminishes the water quality of the Riogrande II reservoir and warrants further study. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","BCR; Complexation; Geochemical conditions; Geochemical fractionation; Sediment; Sequential extraction procedure","Biochemical oxygen demand; Biogeochemistry; Complexation; Digital storage; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Extraction; Ionic strength; Manganese metallography; Organic compounds; Oxic sediments; Positive ions; Purification; Redox reactions; Reservoirs (water); Scanning electron microscopy; Sea level; Sediments; Water quality; Water supply; Environmental improvements; European community bureau of references; Exchangeable fraction; Geochemical conditions; Geochemical fractionations; Organic matter content; Oxidation reduction potential; Sequential extraction procedure; Manganese removal (water treatment); anoxic conditions; bacterium; complexation; dissolution; dissolved oxygen; electrical conductivity; fractionation; geochemical method; manganese; mobilization; organic matter; oxidation; pH; pollutant removal; sea level; water column; water supply; Antioquia [Colombia]; Colombia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876086081

Wind speed prediction is critical for a wind energy conversion system since it may greatly influence the issues related to effective energy management, dynamic control of wind turbine, and improvement of the overall efficiency of the power generation system. In this study, a wind speed prediction model is developed by artificial neural network (ANN) which has advantages over the conventional prediction schemes including data error tolerance and ease in adaptability. The proposed SCU-based control would help to reduce the size of the energy storage system for minimizing wind power fluctuation taking the advantage of prediction scheme. The model for prediction using ANN is developed in MATLAB/Simulink and interfaced with PSCAD/EMTDC. Effectiveness of the proposed control system is illustrated using real wind speed data in various operating conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","Flywheel energy storage system (FESS); induction generator (IG); power smoothing; supervisory control unit (SCU); wind speed prediction","Energy storage systems; Flywheel energy storage system; Output power fluctuations; Power generation systems; Power smoothing; Supervisory control; Wind energy conversion system; Wind speed prediction; Asynchronous generators; Electric utilities; Flywheel propulsion; Neural networks; Wind effects; Wind power; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884586872

The SWHS is mainly composed of two solar collectors, with a 4 m 2 total surface, related to a 200 L storage tank and a capillary polypropylene heat exchanger integrated to the greenhouse. During the simulation all combinations possible of the two solar collectors (series and parallels) are investigated. The parameters which have influence on the storage system, like the inlet flow rate, tank volume and collector area are also investigated. The results of simulation show that, by increasing the tank volume, the temperature at the collector outlet decreases. In addition, high flow rate minimizes the phenomenon of stratification and increases the efficiency of the system. We notice that decreasing the exchanger inlet flow rate is good solution to reduce heating loses. The best storage system we found will be used as our greenhouse heating system. In fact, the choosen heating system according to this parametric analysis, mainly composed of a flat plate collector and a 200 L tank, can increase the inside air temperature of the greenhouse by 5 C and make it suitable for tomatoes agriculture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare three techniques implemented in the single-pass configuration: DC-biased amplitude modulated AFM (AM-AFM), electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) in terms of the physics of sub-surface image formation and experimental robustness. The methods were applied to study the dispersion of sub-surface networks of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) in a polyimide (PI) matrix. We conclude that among these methods, the KPFM channel, which measures the capacitance gradient (∂C/∂d) at the second harmonic of electrical excitation, is the best channel to obtain high-contrast images of the CNT network embedded in the polymer matrix, without the influence of surface conditions. Additionally, we propose an analysis of the ∂C/∂d images as a tool to characterize the dispersion and connectivity of the CNTs. Through the analysis we demonstrate that these AFM-based sub-surface methods probe sufficiently deep within the SWNT composites, to resolve clustered networks that likely play a role in conductivity percolation.

Forests sequester carbon by conducting photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy to chemical energy and storing it in the chemical bonds of sugar. Carbon sequestration through forestry has the potential to play a significant role in ameliorating global environmental problems such as atmospheric accumulation of GHG's and climate change. The present investigation was carried out to determine carbon sequestration potential of hybrid Eucalyptus. This study was conducted primarily to develop a prediction model of carbon storage capacity for plantation forest of hybrid Eucalyptus in Aek Nauli, Simalungun District, North Sumatera. Models were tested and assessed for statistical validity and accuracy in predicting biomass and carbon, based on determination coefficient (R2) and correlation coefficient (r), aggregative deviation percentage (AgD), and the average deviation percentage (AvD). The best general model to estimate the biomass of hybrid Eucalyptus was Y = 1351,09x0,876.e (0,094x). Results showed that hybrid Eucalyptus had an average above-ground biomass in year 0 (the land without the eucalyptus trees) up to year 3 as large as 1.36, 11.56, 43.18, and 63.84 t ha-1.

Congress may consider options to increase the carbon stored (sequestered) in forests as it debates this and related issues. Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle. Plants use sunlight to convert CO2""water""and nutrients into sugars and carbohydrates""which accumulate in leaves""twigs""stems""and roots. Plants also respire""releasing CO2. Plants eventually die""releasing their stored carbon to the atmosphere quickly or to the soil where it decomposes slowly and increases soil carbon levels. However""little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change. How to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious. Land use changes-especially afforestation and deforestation-can have major impacts on carbon storage. Foresters often cut some vegetation to enhance growth of desired trees. Enhanced growth stores more carbon""but the cut vegetation releases CO2; the net effect depends on manyfactors""such as prior and subsequent growth rates and the quantity and disposal of cut vegetation. Rising atmospheric CO2 may stimulate tree growth""but limited availability of other nutrients may constrain that growth. In this context""timber harvesting is an especially controversial forestry practice. Some argue that the carbon released by cutting exceeds the carbon stored in wood products and in tree growth by new forests. Others counter that old-growth forests store little or no additional carbon""and that new forest growth and efficient wood use can increase net carbon storage. The impacts vary widely""and depend on many factors""including soil impacts""treatment of residual forest biomass""proportion of carbon removed from the site""and duration and disposal of the products. To date""the quantitative relationships between these factors and net carbon storage have not been established. Some observers are concerned that ""leakage"" will undermine any U.S. efforts to sequester carbon by protecting domestic forests. By leakage""they mean that wood supply might shift to other sites""including other countries""exacerbating global climate change and causing other environmental problems""or that wood products might be replaced by other products that use more energy to manufacture (thus releasing more CO2). Others counter that the ?leakage{norm of matrix} arguments ignore the enormous disparity in ecological systems and product preferences""and discount possible technological solutions. Several federal government programs affect forestry practices and thus carbon sequestration. Activities in federal forests affect carbon storage and release; timber harvesting is the most controversial such activity. Federal programs also provide technical and financial help for managing and protecting private forests""and tax provisions affect private forest management. Various federal programs can also affect the extent of forested area""by supporting development (which may cause deforestation) or encouraging tree planting in open areas""such as pastures. Global climate change is a widespread and growing concern that has led to extensive international discussions and negotiations.1 Responses to this concern have focused on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases""especially carbon dioxide""and on measuring carbon absorbed by and stored in forests""soils""and oceans. One option for slowing the rise of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere""and thus possible climate change""is to increase the amount of carbon removed by and stored in forests.

Recent expansion in natural gas production, primarily as a result of new or improved technologies (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling) used on unconventional resources (e.g., shale gas, coal-bed methane), has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the U.S. energy supply. This expansion, however, has prompted renewed questions about the industry's potential impacts on human health and the environment, including impacts on air quality. But unlike the debate over groundwater contamination or induced seismicity-where questions remain as to whether or not production activities contribute significantly to these impacts-there is little question that natural gas systems emit air pollutants. The concerns, instead, are: · which pollutants?· how much of each pollutant?· from which sources?· what are the impacts of the emissions?· how much is the cost of abatement? and,· what is the role of the federal government?Air pollutants are released in natural gas systems through the leaking, venting, and combustion of raw natural gas; the combustion of other fossil fuel resources; and the discharge of particulate matter during associated operations. Pollutants include, most prominently, methane and volatile organic compounds-of which the natural gas industry is one of the highest emitting industrial sectors in the United States-as well as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and various forms of hazardous air toxics. Emissions sources include pad, road, and pipeline construction; drilling, completion, and flowback activities; and gas processing and transmission equipment such as controllers, compressors, dehydrators, pipelines, and storage vessels.EPA's New Air StandardsThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in response to a consent decree issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, promulgated air standards for new and modified source categories in crude oil and natural gas systems on August 16, 2012. These standards-effective October 15, 2012-revised existing rules and promulgated new ones to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from many source categories that had never before been covered by federal oversight. Since natural gas is both the product and a pollutant of the industry, compliance to the standards has the potential to translate into economic benefits, as producers can offset pollution abatement costs with the value of products recovered and sold at market. With this expectation, EPA reported the annual environmental and the economic benefits of the standards to be VOCs reductions of 190,000 tons, HAPs reductions of 12,000 tons, methane reductions of 1.0 million tons, and a net cost savings of $11 million to $19 million. Industry and other stakeholders have disputed these figures as both too high and too low. Further, the expansion of both industry production and government regulation of natural gas has sparked debate on a number of critical issues, including:· establishing comprehensive emissions data,· determining the proper coverage of pollutants and sources,· understanding the human health and environmental impacts of emissions,· estimating total compliance costs, and· managing the role of local, state, and federal governments.Scope and Purpose of This ReportThe focus of this report is on natural gas-both as a saleable product and as a potential air pollutant. After briefly outlining the production, processing, transmission, and distribution phases of the natural gas industry, the report characterizes the types and sources of pollutants. It then turns to the role of the federal government in regulating these emissions, including the provisions in the Clean Air Act and the regulatory activities of the EPA. The report summarizes both the prior NeSource Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Oil and Natural Gas Sector, and those promulgated on August 16, 2012. It concludes with an extended discussion of the aforementioned critical issues. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891989561

This effect was described in a thermodynamically strict way by converting the sorption isotherms of organic vapors on variously hydrated sorbents into the derivatives relating the change in the amount of water associated with a sorbent to the change in the amount of an organic sorbate. Further, these derivatives were analyzed by means of the Linear Free Energy Relationship (LFER). The analysis included the sorption data for various organic vapors on such environmentally important sorbents as quartz, metal oxides, calcite, clay minerals and humic acid. From the LFER analysis it followed that (i) organic sorbate polarizability contributions from n- and π-electrons resulted in driving water into the sorbent phase; (ii) the increasing volume of the organic compounds involved expelling water molecules; (iii) the increasing hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity of organic sorbates resulted in expelling water from inorganic surfaces but in enhancing hydration of the humic phase. In contrast to inorganic surfaces, when sorbed on strongly hydrated humic acid, the majority of organic sorbates containing oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms drive water into the sorbent phase. Several molecules of water may need to be cosorbed by a humic sorbent for each sorbed molecule of an organic compound thus supporting the possibility of the concomitant participation of a number of water molecules in organic sorbate-humic matter interactions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Distribution; Humic matter; Hydration effect; Mineral surfaces; Organic compounds; Sorption","Calcite; Digital storage; Free energy; Hydration; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen inorganic compounds; Molecules; Organic acids; Organic compounds; Sorbents; Sorption; Distribution; Environmental compartment; Humic matter; Hydration effects; Inorganic surfaces; Linear free energy relationships; Mineral surfaces; Naturally occurring; Organic minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880701791

These materials have several industrial applications such as turbine blades, valves, hard tools, fasteners, piping, storage tanks, water components, food processing equipment, etc. An erosion test rig similar to that shown in ASTM G76-95 standard was used to perform the tests. The abrasive particle used was angular silicon carbide (SiC) with a particle size of 420-450. μm. Tests were carried out using different impact angles (30°, 45°, 60° and 90°) with a particle velocity of 24±2. m/s and an abrasive flow rate of 150±0.5. g/min. The room temperature during the tests was between 35. °C to 40. °C. The chemical composition of the tested materials was obtained by using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). In addition, SEM images were used to identify the wear mechanisms. In this particular case, wear damage similar to brittle fracture with the detachment of large fragments was observed on the surfaces of AISI 304 and 316 stainless steels. Plastic deformation characterised by pitting and cutting action was also observed. In respect to AISI 420, it was only damaged by plastic deformation, with pitting and ploughing action, some random scratches and irregular indentations on its surface for all impact angles. The results showed that AISI 304 and 316 presented a higher erosion rate at 60°, whereas AISI 420 exhibited the higher erosion damage at 30°.

Cold storage after full melting of fats was necessary to avoid the appearance of exothermic peaks in the modulated temperature DSC thermograms, in order to make an appropriate estimation of melting energy. Different fats were analyzed by NMR and DSC, obtaining considerably higher solid fat content values with the latter, uncorrected method. These differences were attributed to the fact that consumed energy per unit of melted mass tends to increase with the increase of the melting temperature of each fraction of the fats. A linear correlation between melting enthalpy and melting point of different triglycerides was used to estimate the energy per unit of mass consumed at each temperature. From these data, an estimated transformation of melting energy into melted mass was performed and new solid fat content values were calculated. The results obtained from this correction were much closer to the measurements made by NMR, in comparison to the uncorrected DSC method. © 2012 AOCS.","Comparison of techniques; Differential scanning calorimetry; Melting enthalpy; Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance; Solid fat content","Comparison of techniques; Consumed energy; Exothermic peaks; Linear correlation; Melting enthalpy; Modulated temperature; Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance; Solid fat content; Cold storage; Enthalpy; Estimation; Melting point; Metadata; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Phase transitions; Differential scanning calorimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876171022

However, these factors have been calculated for developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere and are lacking for developing countries. This paper shows how such factors have been developed for the collection, transport and landfilling of municipal waste in South Africa. As such it presents a model on how international results and methodology can be adapted and used to calculate country-specific GHG emission factors from waste. For the collection and transport of municipal waste in South Africa, the average diesel consumption is around 5dm3 (litres) per tonne of wet waste and the associated GHG emissions are about 15kgCO2equivalents (CO2e). Depending on the type of landfill, the GHG emissions from the landfilling of waste have been calculated to range from -145 to 1016kgCO2e per tonne of wet waste, when taking into account carbon storage, and from 441 to 2532kgCO2e per tonne of wet waste, when carbon storage is left out. The highest emission factor per unit of wet waste is for landfill sites without landfill gas collection and these are the dominant waste disposal facilities in South Africa. However, cash strapped municipalities in Africa and the developing world will not be able to significantly upgrade these sites and reduce their GHG burdens if there is no equivalent replacement of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) resulting from the Kyoto agreement. Other low cost avenues need to be investigated to suit local conditions, in particular landfill covers which enhance methane oxidation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon storage; CDM; Developing countries; Dumps; GHG emission factors; Landfill sites","Carbon storage; CDM; Dumps; GHG emission; Landfill site; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Land fill; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Waste management; Greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; clean development mechanism; developing world; emission; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; Northern Hemisphere; waste disposal; waste facility; waste management; waste transport; article; carbon storage; concentration (parameters); developing country; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; solid waste management; South Africa; traffic and transport; waste disposal; waste gas management; Air Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; South Africa; Transportation; Waste Management; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875812052

The present work demonstrates the convenience of employing economic feasibility assessments together with engineering analyses before applying solar strategies during the design stages, in order to convince house owners that these solar technologies can be economically viable. In a case study, this approach is tested for a real house project developed in North Cyprus (NC) in which solar energy applications for electricity generation, hot water preparation, space heating and passive cooling are investigated. It is reported that grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems would be economically feasible with savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) values of 2.9 to 3.4. A thermal performance analysis is carried out for a thermal storage wall (TSW) together with a direct solar gain (DSG) window in the living room. It is discovered that the temperature range of the living room was within 18-22°C throughout the majority of winter days. This application is also proved to be economically feasible with an SIR of 1.3, compared to installing an 18,000Btu/h heat pump. It is determined that both locally produced solar water heaters and imported solar water heaters (ISWHs) are economically viable compared to using a 3-kW storage-type electric water heater. Their SIR values are estimated to be 7.5 and 3.7, respectively. A solar-assisted stack-effect ventilation (SEV) system is verified to have techno-economic feasibility and is also useful in concealing the unattractive cold and hot water storage tanks on the roof. The prospective house owner decides to invest 3840 EUR in installing a grid-connected PV system of 1 kWp, an ISWH, a DSG window, building a TSW for space heating and a SEV system with an overall SIR value of 3.2. This procedure can be developed into a government policy where all these assessments are made mandatory to increase the awareness of the home builders before they make their decisions about the final designs of their houses.

Effect of γ-irradiation on seed color, functional and pasting properties of six selected cowpea cultivars was investigated. Color (L*a* b*) of non- and γ-irradiated cowpea cultivars was measured, and the deltachroma (ΔC), color difference (ΔE) and hue angle were calculated. Functional and physicochemical (pasting) of the milled cowpeas were determined using standards methods and rapid visco-analyzer, respectively. Generally, L*, a* and b* values of cowpea seeds were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) affected by irradiation dose. Calculated chroma, color intensity and hue angle varied with cultivar and γ-irradiation dose. Oil absorption capacities of the nonirradiated and irradiated cowpea flours varied from 1.08 to 1.30 and 0.94-1.20 g oil/ g sample, while the water absorption capacities ranged from 1.59 to 2.00 and 1.58-2.01 g water/g sample, respectively. Nonirradiated cowpea flours showed higher pasting properties (peak, trough, breakdown, final and setback viscosities) than the irradiated cowpea. Aside from breakdown viscosity, the pasting properties decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with increased γ-irradiation dose. The IT96D-610 and IT97K-568-18 cultivars showed significantly higher peak, trough, final and setback viscosities compared with other cowpeas. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Exposing foods to ionizing radiations such as gamma rays emitted from the radioisotopes 60Co and 137Cs, or high energy electrons and X-rays produced by machine sources, helps to destroy microorganisms or insects present in the food. Depending on the absorbed radiation dose, various effects can be achieved resulting in reduced storage losses, extended shelf life and/or improved microbiological and parasitological safety of foods. Microorganisms and pests can no longer proliferate and continue their activities, and insect gametes do not survive or become incapable of proliferation. Large quantities of stored legumes are lost annually as a result of mould contamination and insect attack which continues after harvesting even to storage. Irradiation of cowpea is a viable alternative to the use of chemicals, which have adverse effects on both food and environment, associated with residues and ozone depletion, and are perceived to be carcinogenic. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Absorbed radiation; Breakdown viscosity; Extended shelf lives; High-energy electron; Mould contaminations; Oil absorption capacity; Vigna unguiculata; Water absorption capacity; Chemical contamination; Color; Color computer graphics; Food safety; Gamma rays; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Microorganisms; Ozone layer; Plants (botany); Viscosity; Oils and fats; Hexapoda; Vigna unguiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875490265

The effect of hypothermic preservation of hepatocytes in endocytic transport following rewarming has not been previously reported. We evaluated the uptake of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) ligand conjugated to fluorescent Quantum Dots (QDs) probes in rat hepatocytes after 24 and 72h cold storage in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution at 4°C. QDs uptake was visualized during rewarming to 37°C under air or, in a second approach, at the end of rewarming under 5% CO2. After 24h in UW solution, QDs were internalized under both rewarming conditions similar to non-preserved hepatocytes and cells maintained a normal cytoskeleton distribution. However, in hepatocytes preserved 72h none of the cells internalized QDs, which remained bound to the membranes. After rewarming, this group showed diminished actin staining and 60% reduction in ATP levels, while viability was maintained at ∼70%. Our results present evidence that, hypothermic preservation for 72h in UW solution at 4°C does not prevent EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) activation but irreversibly impairs endocytic uptake upon EGF stimulation; presumably due to actin cytoskeleton disassembling besides reduced ATP pool. Our approach can be applied on other membrane receptor systems and with other hypothermic preservation solutions to understand the effect of cooling in endocytic transport and to determine the optimal cold storage period. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Cultured rat hepatocytes; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Hypothermic preservation; Quantum dots; Receptor-mediated endocytosis","actin; adenosine triphosphate; epidermal growth factor; quantum dot; University of Wisconsin solution; actin filament; animal cell; article; cell interaction; cell membrane; cell metabolism; cell structure; cell viability; cellular distribution; controlled study; cryopreservation; endocytosis; energy transfer; fluorescence microscopy; histology; internalization; liver cell; liver cell culture; male; nonhuman; normothermic rewarming; priority journal; protein localization; protein transport; rat; staining; warming; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Endocytosis; Epidermal Growth Factor; Glutathione; Hepatocytes; Insulin; Male; Organ Preservation Solutions; Quantum Dots; Raffinose; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Refrigeration; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875254277

Mathematical description for the circuit part between the inverter output and the grid is presented. Detailed researches of PV system were carried out by means of the mathematical simulation. The researches disclosed dependence of the system reactive power on the phase of sinusoidal modulation voltage of the inverter. It is defined that phase of the modulation voltage must be positive and can vary in the range 0÷20 degrees. Researches show that researched PV system can generate the capacitive reactive power for compensation of the inductive reactive power of the grid. Operation mode of the system when the reactive power is equal to zero can be achieved in this system. It is defined that electromagnetic distortion (THD) of the grid has maximal value at the point when the reactive power is equal to zero.

The decisive trend in its utilization relative to other fossil fuels is as a result of the following. (1) The growing energy demand from an expanding world economy. (2) Environmental pressure for the use of a fossil fuel free from environmental degradations. (3) Market development and improved technologies for its production, processing, transportation, storage and more importantly, its abundance in nature. Presently, the world has a proven reserve of about 156 trillion cubic meters (5,500 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas. Out of this, approximately 31% is discovered in Russia, 36% in the Middle East and 8% in the Asia-Pacific region, with overall consumption of about 2.5 trillion cubic meters per year. The overall demand will continue to increase, especially in the Asia-Pacific region where most countries are pressing ahead with energy-intensive industrialization projects. Natural gas prospects are high, with the market improving appreciatively since the advent of LNG and CNG technologies, where over 4,660 refuelling stations with approximately 2.7 million vehicles are running on CNG globally.

The method is aimed to reduce energy demands at the increasing thermal loads. In summer, in daytime, walls of the building are exposed to the ambient thermal load, and heat transferred inside is absorbed by the melting wax. The study is numerical. It relates to temperature variations outside and inside, coupled with heat conduction and accumulation in walls, with radiation between the surfaces, with natural convection of air inside and melting of the wax at the ceiling. Fins spacing on the storage plate, visualization of the melting process, and its parametric investigation provide an insight into the physical phenomena.

De Ciencias Médicas, UNLP, La Plata, Argentina","In aquatic invertebrates, lipids represent an important source of stored energy, as well as structural components of cellular membranes and other lipoprotein complexes. In the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium borellii, we demonstrated that the hepatopancreas, also known as midgut gland, has a high capacity for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, storage and breakdown. When radioactive palmitic acid was injected in vivo, most of the label was transported to the hepatopancreas, where triacylglycerol were actively synthesized. The enzymatic activity that initiates glycerolipid synthesis, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, is located in the mitochondria. In contrast, triacylglycerol synthesis in hepatopancreas microsomal fraction follows the monoacylglycerol pathway. Even though triacylglycerol count for the major lipid class (up to 80% of the total lipids), phosphatidylcholine is exported from the hepatopancreas to other tissues and transported in hemolymph as a high-density lipoprotein (HDL), suggesting that triacylglycerol are stored in the hepatopancreas for energy supply or lipid remodeling. M. borellii's HDL lipid moiety is composed mainly of phosphatidylcholine with minor quantities of cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Lipid transference between hepatopancreas and HDL was studied in vitro, confirming that HDL releases free fatty acids to the hepatopancreas, whereas phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids are liberated from the hepatopancreas to HDL. Proteins, lipids and carbohydrates present in the vitellus of eggs are important energy and building block sources for the embryo development in ovipara. In aquatic invertebrates, these compounds are usually associated forming lipoproteins called lipovitellins (LV) that function as nutrient sources for the development of the embryo and also satisfy the metabolic larvae needs from their birth to the moment they start feeding on external sources. In M. borellii and other crustaceans, LVs are high-density lipoproteins with phosphatidylcholine as the major lipid and minor quantities of other lipids like triacylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. LVs are originated from a plasma lipoprotein restricted to ovogenic females: vtellogenin (VG). M. borellii's VG lipids are similar quantities of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, triacylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. During vitellogenesis, VG is endocyted into the ovary, where it is processed and changed into LV. Compared to VG, LV has twice as much phosphatidylcholine as the other lipid classes and less sphingomyelin, suggesting that the lipoprotein processing in the ovary provides LV with different lipid domains specific for its biological function. Due to the fact that some of LV apolipoproteins have been detected inside the developing embryo, it was concluded that LV was consumed. LV transfers to the embryo mainly the lipids loaded inside the ovary (mostly phosphatidylcholine), together with proteins to feed the embryos. Further studies are needed to determine the lipid transference mechanisms involving the lipoproteins with lipid donor and receptor organs. However, our knowledge about lipid transport and metabolism in crustaceans has evolved in the last few years regarding both plasma and yolk lipoproteins; it sets ground for understanding the lipoprotein function in reproduction and embryo development.© 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Simulations of the model are applied to parabolic, wedge, and hyperbolic billiards that are driven sinusoidally. The simulations demonstrate that the parabola has stable, periodic motion, while the wedge and hyperbola (at high driving frequencies) appear chaotic. The hyperbola, at low driving frequencies, behaves similarly to the parabola, i.e., has regular motion. Direct comparisons are made between the model's predictions and previously published experimental data. The representation of the coefficient of restitution employed in the model resulted in approximate agreement with the experimental data for all boundary shapes investigated. We show how the coefficient of restitution varies under different model assumptions.

We therefore encourage organization and natural environment scholars to follow up on the claims we make in this paper and pursue the questions we raise further. This paper reviews both the potential and the limitations of venture capital (VC) as a source of funding for clean energy. We provide preliminary evidence that venture capitalists (VCs) have been adjusting their operating procedures to accommodate clean energy. First, they have been investing larger amounts of money for longer periods of time. Second, they have started to avoid funding high risk production, distribution, and installation manufacturing and production companies and to a greater degree have been funding companies that focus on the intersection between information technology and energy. Third, besides making bigger bets, stretching out their timetables, and avoiding high risk and capital intensive companies, they have been experimenting with investments in companies with very risky technologies. Were these companies to succeed in commercializing these technologies the impact on the natural environment would be very great. We challenge organization and natural environment scholars to take up questions like these and others that deal with clean energy funding. Amongst a number of possible funding sources, what role is venture capital best suited to play? How would it need to change to play a more significant role? What would have to happen for venture capital to stimulate a major breakthrough, one that was of the magnitude of the Internet in transforming our economy and society in a more sustainable direction? © 2013 SAGE Publications.","clean energy; Department of Energy; disruptive innovation; high tech; organizations and natural environment; pension funds; private equity; solar energy; storage; venture capital","capital; energy market; financial market; information technology; Internet; investment; pension system; solar power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875073778

A compact high-pressure cryogenic storage system has promising features to the storage challenge associated with hydrogen-powered vehicles. Cryogenic pressure vessels consist of an inner vessel designed for high pressure (350 bar) insulated with reflective sheets of metalized plastic and enclosed within an outer metallic vacuum jacket. When filled with pressurized liquid hydrogen, cryogenic pressure vessels become the most compact form of hydrogen storage available. A recent prototype is the only automotive hydrogen vessel meeting both Department of Energy's 2017 weight and volume targets. When installed onboard an experimental vehicle, a cryogenic pressure vessel demonstrated the longest driving distance with a single H2 tank (1050 km). In a subsequent experiment, the vessel demonstrated unprecedented thermal endurance: 8 days parking with no evaporative losses, extending to a month if the vehicle is driven as little as 8 km per day. Calculations indicate that cryogenic vessels offer compelling safety advantages and the lowest total ownership cost of hydrogen storage technologies. Long-term (~10 years) vacuum stability (necessary for high performance thermal insulation) is the key outstanding technical challenge. Testing continues to establish technical feasibility and safety.

Deterioration, chilling injury (CI), weight loss, surface color, firmness, respiration rate, acidity, sugars, and antioxidants were determined. At 10°C 1-MCP treated fruit showed lower deterioration and weight loss. The inhibition of ethylene action delayed yellowing, softening, and respiration, and prevented the increase of acidity. Chilling injury, manifested as shrunken areas and surface depressions, yellowing and softening were reduced in 1-MCP-treated fruit stored at 0°C. Sugars and antioxidants were not affected. Results suggest that ethylene is involved in senescence and CI development in summer squash.

Although there are new technologies that impact on reducing emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere, it is estimated that its amount in the atmosphere will continue to rise and influence the greenhouse effect on a global scale. It is known that, in addition to developing new energy technologies and applications of Renewable Energy Sources, additional measures to reduce emissions of CO2 are being considered, including possibilities of accepting, appropriations, transportation and storage of CO2 in reservoirs in general. Since a part of the energy sector in most countries is focused on the burning of fossil fuels, it is necessary to consider the possibility of CO2 storage from these plants.

Apple peel constitutes a waste of dried apple manufacture, although it contains more phenolics than the fruit pulp. This fraction can be preserved by drying. However, it is important to consider that the dehydrated product obtained requires protection. The objective of this research was to study the stability of drum dried apple peel powder in order to select the suitable packing material: high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or metalized films of high barrier (MFHB). The samples were stored under accelerated (38 °C, 90% RH) and conventional (25, 10 and 4 °C, 60-70% RH) conditions during 120 days. Kinetic modelings for the attributes degradation were evaluated. Total phenolics and moisture levels are largely dependent on the type of packing and storage conditions. The apple peel powder samples packed in MFHB pouches preserved most of the phenolic compounds, and exhibited lesser moisture increase.

The study area is part of an orogenically active region along the northwestern collision zone of Indian-Eurasian plates. During spring and summer suspended sediment load is highest, but least in winter. Sediment load of all rivers studied is directly proportional to the melting of glaciers and/or high rainfall during spring and summer. Glacier melt, rainfall, lithology of rocks (shale, slate, phyllite, mudstone, and siltstone), discharge, and other anthropogenic factors caused the high suspended load in rivers. Mostly the fine sediments settle during winter due to flow velocity of rivers reducing appreciably and residence time of water increasing in reservoirs. The high sediment influx deposition in major reservoirs like the Terbella and Warsak, etc. reduces their storage capacity as well as power generation capacity. So it is proposed that life span of these reservoirs can be lengthened by the construction of small check dams (silt control dams) on upstream, dam cleaning tactics, effective watershed management, extensive afforestation on the steep mountain slopes upstream of the lake, and the use of runoff rivers for electricity generation using steep gradient and fast flow velocity.","Environment; Hydel power; Indus River; Siltation in dams; Soft rocks; Suspended load",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872901445

Using a vibratory mill at room temperature, with initial H2 pressures of 40-80 bar, a constant-rate pressure decrease was observed throughout 200 h experiments, reflecting hydrogenation reaction progress. A combination of 1H and 15N solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques was used to identify unambiguously the reaction products as the metastable solid mixture of magnesium hydride and magnesium amide/imide. The NMR shows that the reaction products are disordered and of nonbulk, noncrystalline character. Our thermodynamic analysis shows that considerable pressure elevation and mechanical surface destabilization favor the hydrogenation reaction. We present an original model which suggests for the first time that the local gas pressure rises considerably in a confined zone of the fine powder impacted by colliding balls in the mill. This model describes a flow-restricted, short-term, nearly isothermal pressure elevation. The demonstrated ability to facilitate such thermodynamic unfavorable reactions and create a metastable hydrogen-rich product suggests a new concept for hydrogen storage and chemical conversion processes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical conversion process; Fine powders; Gas pressures; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogenation reactions; Magnesium hydride; Magnesium nitrides; Mechanical surface; Mechanochemicals; Metastable solids; NMR techniques; Original model; Room temperature; Thermo dynamic analysis; Vibratory mill; Amides; Ball milling; Ball mills; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Magic angle spinning; Nitrides; Reaction products; Thermoanalysis; Magnesium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872852229

The microstructure, structure and thermal behavior of the phases formed during the processing were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. Kinetic properties of the reaction with hydrogen of the 2MgH2-Co and 3MgH2-Co mixtures after RMM were evaluated using modified Sieverts-type equipment. The 3MgH2-Co mixture showed better properties for storage applications, with its highest rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption at 300 °C, its storage capacity of about 3.7 wt% in less than 100 s, and good stability after cycling. Although the starting material presents Mg2CoH5 as majority phase, the cycling leads to disproportion between Mg and Co. We obtained a mixture of Mg2CoH5, Mg6Co2H11 and MgH2 hydrides, as well as other phases such as Co and/or Mg, depending on experimental conditions.Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This Review addresses three recently developed topics in the area of optobioelectronics, while addressing the potential applications of these systems. The topics discussed include: (i) the reversible photoswitching of the bioelectrocatalytic functions of redox proteins by the modification of proteins with photoisomerizable units or by the integration of proteins with photoisomerizable environments; (ii) the integration of natural photosynthetic reaction centers with electrodes and the construction of photobioelectrochemical cells and photobiofuel cells; and (iii) the synthesis of biomolecule/semiconductor quantum dots hybrid systems and their immobilization on electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical and photobiofuel cell elements. The fundamental challenge in the tailoring of optobioelectronic systems is the development of means to electrically contact photoactive biomolecular assemblies with the electrode supports. Different methods to establish electrical communication between the photoactive biomolecular assemblies and electrodes are discussed. These include the nanoscale engineering of the biomolecular nanostructures on surfaces, the development of photoactive molecular wires and the coupling of photoinduced electron transfer reactions with the redox functions of proteins. The different possible applications of optobioelectronic systems are discussed, including their use as photosensors, the design of biosensors, and the construction of solar energy conversion and storage systems. The integration of biomolecules with electrode supports provides the grounds for the development of optobioelectronic devices. This is demonstrated with the photonic switching of the bioelectrocatalytic functions of redox proteins by means of photoisomerizable units, the electrical wiring of photosynthetic reaction centers with electrodes and the fabrication of photobioelectrochemical and photobiofuel cells, and the assembly of redox protein/semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hybrids on electrode surfaces.

The study employed the bivariate cointegration technique to estimate the long-run relationship between the variables; an error correction model was used to determine the short-run dynamics of the system, while Granger causality test was used to find the directions between these variables. The study investigates the relation between four energy consumption variables (i.e., oil/petroleum consumption, gas consumption, electricity consumption and coal consumption) and four macroeconomic factors which have further sub-classifications, i.e., balance of payment (BOP) factors (i.e., exports, imports, trade deficit, worker's remittances and current account balance), fuel factors (i.e., carbon dioxide emissions, natural resource depletion and net forest depletion), agricultural crops yield per hectare (i.e., wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize and cotton) and industrial production items (i.e., beverages, cigarettes, motor tyres, motor tubes, cycle tyres and cycle tubes) in order to manage robust data analysis. The result confirms the long-run relationship between total commercial energy consumption and macroeconomic factors in Pakistan, as oil/petroleum consumption increases exports, fuel factors, agricultural crops yield per hectare and industrial items; however, the intensity of these factors are different in nature. Carbon dioxide emissions, net forest depletion, beverages, motor tyres and motor tubes are more elastic with oil/petroleum consumption. However, oil/petroleum consumption decreases trade deficit and workers' remittances in Pakistan. Gas, electricity and coal consumption increases agricultural crops yield per hectare and industrial production which shows that as agriculture and industry modernizes, energy demand increases. Energizing the food production chain is an essential feature of agricultural development which is a prime factor in helping to achieve food security in Pakistan. The empirical results only moderately support the conventional view that energy consumption has significant long-run casual effect on macroeconomic variables in Pakistan. The present study finds evident of unidirectional causality between the commercial energy consumption factors and macroeconomic factors in Pakistan. However, there is some bidirectional causality exist which is running between electricity consumption (EC) and exports, EC to imports, EC to carbon emissions, EC to natural resource depletion (NRD) and EC to wheat.

Spinel phase LiMn2O4 was doped with bimetallic nanoparticles, LiM xMn2-xO4 (M = FeAu), with concomitant oxidation of the Mn3+ ions (responsible for LIB capacity loss) to Mn 4+. This nano-composite architecture accommodates the structural transformation that occurs during Li+ ion charge and discharge. Ultra-low scan rate (0.01 mV s-1) cyclic voltammetry of the pure LiMn2O4 cathode material in 1 M LiPF6/ electrolyte solution, showed two sets of redox peaks with a third observed at lower potentials for LiMxMn2-xO4. The FeAu incorporation increased the reaction rate upon reduction of LiMn 2O4 as indicated by the enhanced reduction peak seen by cyclic voltammetry. Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed LiFeAuxMn2-xO4 having increased conductivity with lower resistance of charge. X-ray diffraction studies showed the LiMxMn2-xO4 material retained well-developed octahedral structures bounded by (111) planes. The material crystallite size was ∼10 nm with clear lattice fringes having a separation value of 0.48 nm which concurrently improved the diffusion rate of Li+. Solid-state NMR results showed the progressive increase in average nominal manganese oxidation state from +3.5 to +4 resulted in an increase in the super-transferred hyperfine field at the 7Li nucleus of the FeAu doped cathode material. The LiFeAuxMn 2-xO4 material also showed improved cycleability, especially at high C rate. This improvement was due to the enhanced physical stability of LiMn2O4 and its improved electrical conductivity ascribed to the incorporated FeAu nanoparticles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cathode material; Charge transport; Doping; Lithium-ion battery; Nanomaterials","Bimetallic nanoparticles; Cath-ode materials; Electrical conductivity; Lithium manganese oxide; Lithium-ion battery; Lithium-ion battery cathodes; Structural transformation; X-ray diffraction studies; Charge transfer; Cyclic voltammetry; Doping (additives); Electric conductivity; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Gold; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Manganese; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Transition metal alloys; X ray diffraction; Cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878566826

However, a bottleneck has formed through the inability of the energy networks to respond to the needs of DR at the volumes which would reflect the aspirations of the policy makers. This paper explores the idea that if the connection requirements of DR were integrated into the NSPs' planning processes then, more convenience and assurance could be achieved for DR proponents, thereby reducing the well-known non-price barriers to DR connection that has been a back-wind in realising the energy policies of many jurisdictions. The approach suggested in the paper, is to consider the accommodation by NSPs of the needs of DR, (whether it be wind resource, or PV, or a range of other resources such as intermittent storage), as a range of new Network Services that an NSP needs to provide at its points of interconnection with the grid. Then, through the normal Planning Process, and through the governance provided by the regulator, an NSP can work systematically, a) to define the levels of the new Network Services that it is able to provide at each POI; and b) to match the network capability to the expected demands for these Services that will manifest over the current planning cycle. Any shortfall can then be made good through the normal regulatory approval of CAPEX. Certainty is provided to prospective DR connectors through framing the new Network Services so as to be supportive and complying with their needs. However the expected impacts on the network of the forecast demand for DR connections, and therefore the new network services, are determined by the normal techniques of simulation utilised in a standard planning processes. © 2018 Israel Annual Conference on Aerospace Sciences.

They are not easy to compare because of variation in the definitions and performance levels—nZEB definitions have not yet been available when these buildings have been designed. It is important to check which energy uses are included in the calculated and measured energy performance and are the results reported as delivered or primary energy. Tenant’s electricity (appliances, lighting) is often not included. Simulated primary energy is typically between 50 and 100 kWh/(m2 a) for high-performance nZEB buildings with on-site renewable energy production if all energy uses are included. Such buildings may be extremely complicated, e.g. control of mixed mode ventilation or integrated energy supply solutions with storage and many operation modes. “Overkill” complexity may have implications on operation and maintenance as nobody cannot manage systems, which are not easy to control and operate. Another trend that can be seen is simple and reliable solutions based on high-performance components and careful system design and fitting with building properties. In the following, five nZEB buildings across the Europe are reported. Three of them are with measured energy data, indicating that strict targets are not always easy to achieve; however, some deviations have been caused also by unrealistic energy calculation input data. Technical solutions used show that there are many alternative ways to achieve high performance; however, strong differences in design bases and basic solutions in similar climate may also show that optimal solutions are always not known or found. Four first case studies are mostly focused on description of technical solutions, but the last one also describes the tuning of systems needed in the first year of operation to achieve the targets. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Cellulose; Dust; Europe; Mercury; Platinum","Buildings; Cellulose; Digital storage; Dust; Mercury (metal); Platinum; Renewable energy resources; Energy calculation; Energy performance; Europe; High-performance components; Mixed-mode ventilations; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energies; Technical solutions; Structural design",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965146364

Here we review the state of the art on the synthesis but also on the physical and chemical properties of semiconductor nanowires functionalized with noble metal nanoparticles such as Ag, Au, Pt and Pd with particular emphasis on their application for gas sensors, surface enhanced raman scaterring sensors, resistance switching memories, supercapacitors and batteries but also for their application in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Aspect ratio; Catalysis; Chemical properties; Electrocatalysis; MOS devices; Nanowires; Oxide semiconductors; Precious metals; Silicon compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Device performance; High aspect ratio; Metal oxide semiconductor; Nanoparticle assemblies; Physical and chemical properties; Resistance switching; Semiconductor nanowire; Surface enhanced Raman; Metal nanoparticles",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951776433

Nuclear reactors can produce potentially vast amounts of energy with relatively low consumption of natural resources and emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. However, facilities that produce nuclear fuel for civilian power reactors can also produce materials for nuclear weapons. The process of nuclear fission (splitting of atomic nuclei) to generate power also results in the production of radioactive material that must be contained in the reactor and can remain hazardous for thousands of years. How to manage the weapons proliferation and safety risks of nuclear power, or whether nuclear power is worth those risks, are issues that have long been debated in Congress. The 104 licensed nuclear power reactors at 65 sites in the United States generate about 20% of the nation's electricity. Five new reactors are currently licensed for construction. About a dozen more are planned, but whether they move forward will depend largely on their economic competitiveness with natural gas and coal plants. Throughout the world, 436 reactors are currently in service, and 62 more are under construction. The March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan increased attention to nuclear safety throughout the world. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which issues and enforces nuclear safety requirements, established a task force to identify lessons from Fukushima applicable to U.S. reactors. The task force's report led to NRC's first Fukushima-related regulatory requirements on March 12, 2012. Several other countries, such as Germany and Japan, eliminated or reduced their planned future reliance on nuclear power after the accident. Highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel that is regularly removed from nuclear power plants is currently stored at plant sites in the United States. Plans for a permanent underground repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, were abandoned by the Obama Administration, although that decision is being challenged in court. The Obama Administration appointed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to recommend an alternative nuclear waste policy. The Commission recommended in January 2012 that new candidate sites for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities be selected through a ""consent based"" process. The level of security that must be provided at nuclear power plants has been a highprofile issue since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. Since those attacks, NRC issued a series of orders and regulations that substantially increased nuclear plant security requirements, although industry critics contend that those measures are still insufficient. Encouraging exports of U.S. civilian nuclear products, services, and technology while making sure they are not used for foreign nuclear weapons programs has long been a fundamental goal of U.S. nuclear energy policy. Recent proposals to build nuclear power plants in several countries in the less developed world, including the Middle East, have prompted concerns that international controls may prove inadequate. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Safety engineering; Terrorism; Waste disposal; Economic competitiveness; Fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plants; Fundamental characteristics; Nuclear power reactors; Regulatory requirements; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Underground repositories; Weapons proliferation; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947104420

The need for SNF storage, even after the first repository is opened, will continue for a few reasons. First, the Obama Administration terminated work on the only planned permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, which was intended to provide a destination for most of the stored SNF. Also, the Yucca Mountain project was not funded by Congress in FY2011 and FY2012, and not included in the Administration's budget request for FY2013. Second, even if the planned repository had been completed, the quantity of SNF and other high-level waste in storage awaiting final disposal now exceeds the legal limit for the first repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Third, the expected rate of shipment of SNF to the repository would require decades to remove existing SNF from interim storage. Accordingly, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and reactor operators are considering extended SNF storage lasting for more than 100 years. The debate about SNF typically involves where and how it is stored, as well as what strategies and institutions should govern SNF storage. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and resulting damage to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, caused some in Congress and NRC to consider the adequacy of protective measures at U.S. reactors. The NRC Near-Term Task Force on the disaster concluded it has ""not identified any issues that undermine our confidence in the continued safety and emergency planning of U.S. plants."" Nonetheless, NRC has accepted a number of staff recommendations on near-term safety enhancement, including requirements affecting spent fuel storage and prevention and coping with station blackout. NRC is not requiring accelerated transfer of SNF from wet pools to dry casks, but the SNF storage data from the last several years indicate that accelerated transfer has already been occurring. As of December 2011, more than 67,000 metric tons of SNF, in more than 174,000 assemblies, is stored at 77 sites (including 4 Department of Energy (DOE) facilities) in the United States located in 35 states (see Table 1 and Figure 5), and increases at a rate of roughly 2,000 metric tons per year. Approximately 80% of commercial SNF is stored east of the Mississippi River. At 9 commercial SNF storage sites there are no operating nuclear reactors (so-called ""stranded"" SNF), and at the 4 DOE sites reactor operations largely ceased in the 1980s, but DOE-owned and some commercial SNF continues to be stored at DOE facilities. In the United States, SNF is stored largely at nuclear reactor sites where it was generated. Of the 104 operating nuclear reactors in the United States, all necessarily have wet storage pools for storing SNF (wet pools are required to allow for a safe ""cooling off"" period of 1 to 5 years after discharge of SNF from a reactor). Wet storage pools are used for storage of approximately 73% (49,338 out of 67,450 metric tons of uranium, or MTU) of the current commercial SNF inventory, whereas the remaining 27% (18,112 MTU) of commercial SNF is stored in dry casks on concrete pads or in vaults. As wet storage pools become filled to capacity using ""dense packing"" storage methods, dry storage is increasingly being used, although there are 27 sites with 36 wet storage pools with no dry cask storage capabilities. This chapter focuses on the current situation with spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States. It does not address all of the issues associated with permanent disposal of SNF, but rather focuses on the SNF storage situation, primarily at current and former reactor facilities for the potentially foreseeable future. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Budget control; Digital storage; Fuels; Lakes; Landforms; Nuclear fuel cladding; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Waste disposal; Department of Energy; Earthquake and tsunamis; Fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plants; High level nuclear wastes; Nuclear waste policy acts; Spent nuclear fuels; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Yucca Mountain Project; Fuel storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946923873

The goal of this study was to explore the applicability of cloud cover forecasts, typically used to determine visibility for aviation, for solar PV irradiance prediction. Using known equations which define solar position, a theoretical clear-day irradiance profile was calculated specifically for a solar array located near Mesa del Sol in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. Percent cloud cover forecasts posted by the National Weather Service (NWS) were then combined with the theoretical data to predict actual irradiance experienced by the array. The cloud cover forecasts do not differentiate cloud types (for example, storm fronts or non-precipitating stratus clouds) which could affect irradiance differently. Nonetheless, a weighting constant was applied to percentages such that, at 100% cloud cover, a minimum irradiance exists. Predictions were calculated for dates with recorded irradiance data, allowing for comparison and optimization of weighting. This comparison was done both for raw data, which for cloudy days was highly variable, and a sliding average of the same data. Comparing predicted versus measured irradiance provided scatter-plots which could be influenced by modifying the weighting constant. Numeric optimization was then performed to minimize either the irradiance or daily energy prediction error. After developing this prediction method, it is apparent there are opportunities for improvement over using only percent cloud cover, such as incorporating precipitation forecasts to characterize the nature of the clouds. This method could be used to estimate energy production of a solar field, which is useful for storage optimization and energy resource scheduling.

The power distribution between fuel cell and super-capacitor modules for obtain a good performance is an essential problem in dual-source electric vehicles. Traditional numerical optimization for energy management relies too much on the expert experience, and it's easy to get the sub-optimal performance. In order to overcome this drawback, a new intelligent method metaheuristic of Bat optimization is introduced for energy management in dual-source propelled electric vehicle. This work, based on the systemic power analysis in the energy storage strategy, the vehicle power propulsion system encounters and the constraints the energy storage strategy should obey. Then, difierent operation modes of dual-source systemic power analysis in energy storage strategy are presented.

Although these systems can be bought commercially, the commercial systems are generally intended for larger solar panels than those of nanosatellites and therefore are not very cost-efficient to use, especially in more complex power harvesting architectures that require the simulation of many independent solar panels at once.

Finally, the energy performances of this material were compared with those of gypsum without cork. The findings of experiments indicate that corkgypsum materiel is better than gypsum without cork in term of thermal insulation, energy storage capacity and slowness of heat transmission; the material is also significantly lighter than gypsum without cork.

Certification must be achieved by supplementing historical nuclear test data with use of computer calculations. AWE therefore regularly procures, installs and operates large supercomputers, and complements this with high end storage, network, visualisation and desktop systems that enable the supercomputers to be exploited effectively. This High Performance Computing (HPC) environment is useless without computer programmes or 'codes' to run on it. Multi-physics algorithms are developed to solve the equations of compressible fluid flow coupled to transport algorithms and other required physics such as fusion burn. These state-of-the-art algorithms are in turn worthless without material property data. It is particularly challenging to obtain required material properties such as opacity and equation of state in the extreme conditions of interest. The requirements span timescales of many orders of magnitude and pressures up to Gigabars with temperatures ranging up to tens of millions of degrees. The regimes of hot dense matter (HDM) and warm dense matter (WDM) are pertinent, representing material that is heated while remaining at a density close to solid; similar conditions exist in the cores of large planets and in the sun. In some cases it is possible to harness the power of HPC to calculate the material properties but even if this is the case, it is always important to underpin calculated properties with measurements in appropriate conditions. Once the material property data have been incorporated into the multi-physics codes, meaningful calculations become possible. It is then necessary to carry out further experiments to validate the codes and indeed the designers who are using them. It turns out that an excellent way to meet many of the requirements for material property data and to provide confidence in the validity of the algorithms is through experiments carried out on high power laser systems. © 2013 The Optical Society.",,"Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Equations of state; Experiments; High power lasers; Supercomputers; Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; Compressible fluid flow; Computer calculation; High energy density physics; High performance computing (HPC); High-power laser systems; Material property datum; State-of-the-art algorithms; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903753069

Parabolic trough technology is nowadays the most extended solar system for electricity production or steam generation for industrial processes. It is the most proven, lowest cost and large-scale solar power technology available today. It is basically composed of a concentrator collector field which converts solar irradiation into thermal energy that will be used as input for a Rankine power cycle. In such plants, a storage system can be implemented in order to increase plant production. This work aimed to conclude with a simulation model of a solar thermal power plant using a parabol solar concentrator. The Euro Trough (ET) Concentrator was used as case study. MATLAB software was used for the analysis and performance evaluation. Different working fluids were used in the simulation which were: Pressurized water, Boiling water and Oil (Therminol- VP1). It was found that using water (pressurized or boiling) in the receiver tube is better than the Therminol-VP1 oil. And the pressurized water has the highest value of efficiency compared to the boiling water and Therminol- VP1 oil. The oil using system presented the highest energy losses system, and the lowest efficiencies. The ET performance was tested at different places in Jordan, and the distribution of direct solar irradiance at different days around the year was calculate and exhibited for Ma'an city as a case study. A comparison between simulated results and that found in literature were carried out with observed good conformity.

However the heat transfer mechanisms that govern the charging and discharging processes at high operating temperatures are still under development and represent an important aspect in the thermal energy storage design process. This study presents a numerical solution of the heat transfer and phase change that occurs during the solidification process of a phase change material (PCM) encapsulated in a spherical container. A transient two-dimensional axisymmetric mathematical model was solved using the control volume discretization approach along with the enthalpy-porosity method to track the melting front. A spherical shell of thickness t, under the gravitational field is completely filled with liquid PCM. For time t&gt;0, a constant temperature boundary condition Tw, which is lower than the phase change temperature of the PCM, is imposed at the outer surface of the shell. A comprehensive analysis is presented in order to assess the role of the capsule size, buoyancy-driven flow in the liquid phase, and shell outer surface temperature on the thermal performance of the system. Results show that with the increase of Stefan number the solidification rate is enhanced. A reduction of 39.25% in total solidification time is predicted when the Stefan number changed from 0.095 to 0.143. Finally a generalized correlation for the solid mass fraction during solidification is obtained based on a combination of Fourier and Stefan numbers and a dimensionless material parameter.

The PCM used is sodium nitrate, which expands upon melting. Therefore, the cylindrical shell is partially filled with the PCM and the remaining volume is occupied by air. The influence of cylinder shape on the melting and heat transfer rate is analyzed. The numerical model takes both conductive and convective heat transfer into account during the melting process. For the problem being considered here, the dimensionless numbers that characterized the process are the Grashof, Stefan, and Prandtl numbers. The Aspect Ratio (AR) is used to characterize the shape of the cylinder, which is defined as the ratio of the height to the diameter of the cylinder. In this study, a range of AR values from 0.25 to 10 are investigated. Cylinders with small AR, corresponding to high Grashof numbers, lead to lower melting times compared with cylinders with high AR. The partially melted PCM shape differed between the high and low AR cases. The molten PCM stream function was also influenced greatly by the variation in solid PCM shape.

Active elements of the IDD are cooled by liquid nitrogen. To calculate the IDD's working processes a numerical-analytical approach is used. Within a small interval of time analytical expressions for the main values are calculated. The transient process is modeled on a computer program by iterative relations and time loops. In the calculation the IDD's armature is represented as a set of elementary shortcircuited circuits uniformly distributed on a disk's surface, and the multi-turn inductor is represented by a primary circuit connected to the capacitance energy storage (CES). On the base of the carried out mathematical modeling it is demonstrated that the most effective is the cryogenic cooling of the armature for which a minimal amount of cryogen is required. At the simultaneous cooling of the inductor and the armature the IDD's efficiency increases 24 times. It is shown that in case of the use of a ferromagnetic core as an alternative to a cryogenic cooling, the IDD's efficiency increase is much lower. The validity of the proposed mathematical model and obtained numerical results is demonstrated on the base of experimental modeling.

The research then defines the reasons for using tankers for floating storage and concludes with a depiction of the use Iran makes of floating storage in its attempt to contend with the volatile situation of the oil market. The oil tanker market has considerable influence on the modern economy. The increasing importance of oil as one of the main elements in energy consumption caused the tanker market to become a significant and influential factor in the oil industry. In 2009, for example, half of the 88 million barrels of oil consumed worldwide was transported by various types of tankers, with the rest being transported overland. However, changing consumption patterns, government maritime laws, dependence on tanker building companies and the need to scrap some of the tankers due to superannuation or surplus have made the market very volatile and been detrimental to tanker industry profits. Generally speaking, factors such as world demand for oil products, the distance between oil producing countries and oil consuming countries, the laying of transatlantic pipelines, the number of tankers converted to floating storage devices, and tanker availability as well as the number of tankers designated for scrapping have influenced the industry and its cost effectiveness. © SEECMAR / All rights reserved.","Floating oil storage; Iran; Oil imports; Tankers; VLCC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902475701

However, maintaining of acid value of sesame seeds below 6 is an extremely difficult task because, incremental increase of acid value steadily takes place during storage, due to the influence of storage temperature, seed moisture and enzymes present in the seed itself. Therefore, a study was conducted using 30kg of seed with known initial acid value (3.3) as described in the methodology. Results revealed that acid values of raw sesame seeds increased steadily from 33 to 4.05, while blanched sesame seeds showed a declining acid value from 3.20 to 3.13 during the 60 day testing period. In the case of decorticated raw and blanched sesame seeds, acid values continuously declined from 2.1 to 1.2 and from 1.7 to 1.1 respectively throughout the storage period. However, as the decortication process involved water, it is an unproductive method because of the extra energy and time needed for drying. Therefore, storing of blanched undeeortkated sesame seeds is recommended as a productive treatment for extracting edible grade sesame oil.

The objectives of this paper are calculation of the external neutron and γ-radiation of a single container, and prediction of radiation characteristics during a storage period up to 50 years. The calculations were made for VSC-24 special ventilated containers manufactured by Sierra Nuclear Corporation (USA) [2]. The analysis shows that the change in gamma energy spectrum results in a faster decrease in dose with time which is in agreement with observations in the SFDSF. The γ- radiation dose rate is mainly composed of 0.5 to 2.5 MeV quanta.

Relatively longer write time and high write energy are the main obstacles in the way of adapting memristor for on-chip memory to replace SRAM. The off-to-on resistance ratio for memristor are in excess of 1000x which provides adequate noise margin to separate the on versus off states. In this paper, we explore the design space of memristor by studying retention time, write time, write energy, and noise margin ratio. Our results show that by reducing target retention time both write time and energy can be reduced to a competitive level. In addition, reducing the noise margin reduces both the write time and energy. Our study shows that by reducing retention time to about 4 years write energy can be reduced to 0.1pJ. Compared to SRAM power consumed is 88.6% less for 128KB memory array. Since on-chip memory is not expected to retain data for long time [1], our proposed approach can be used in many energy critical applications and is able to reduce system complexity especially power management unit. © 2013 IEEE.","cache design; embedded memory; low energy memory; memristor; non-volatile memory","Cache memory; Data storage equipment; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Passive filters; Static random access storage; Cache design; Critical applications; Embedded memory; Memristor; Non-volatile memory; Power management unit; Resistance ratio; System complexity; Memristors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901415412

Lithium batteries are utilized as power storage in electric cars considering their advantages. Nevertheless, they are prone to external disturbances, such as physical shock or metal debris which may cause electric short and lead to fire. Design and testing of platform structure as a protection to electric batteries during crash impact has been done. Platform structure is specifically designed, so it can be built as a prototype for further developments. Computational simulations shows that during front impact test, stresses are distributed in the front side of platform, while addition of stiffener offers more concentrated stresses to certain location. Moreover, for side impact test, critical point is located in corner side near the location for batteries, which means reinforcement is needed to improve protection for batteries during side impact. Additional scenario of rear impact test is also done. Result shows critical point around rear side of batteries, means that reinforcement should be added in rear side of platform to improve protection for batteries. © 2013 IEEE.","crashworthiness; electric vehicle; impact; lithium battery; platform","Communication systems; Crashworthiness; Electric vehicles; Information technology; Reinforcement; Computational simulation; Concentrated stress; External disturbances; Fossil-fuel depletions; Further development; impact; platform; Power storage; Lithium batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901396043

In this work, a supercapacitor module characterization at the hybrid system operation conditions was presented and this characterization was compared with the values obtained for mean of simulation of control considering terms such as ESR (equivalent series resistance) and the effect of DC/DC converters, and based on the considered hybrid system and characterization results an interconnection with a battery bank to decrease the stress in the bank is proposed.a © 2013 IEEE.","battery stress; current peak; renewable energy; Storage system; supercapacitor","Characterization; DC-DC converters; Electric machinery; Electric resistance; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Current peak; Energy storage systems; Esr (equivalent series resistance); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Portable applications; Renewable energies; Storage systems; Super capacitor; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901374320

This leads to a fragmented and incongruent decision-making, which is a serious barrier for the implementation of complex design goals, most notably, the concept of sustainability. Even though the awareness of sustainability at the overall level of the project through an interdisciplinary design and engineering organization has reached the traditional building sector, this is only recently being explored in the area of underground engineering (Sterling et al.,2012; Hunt et al., 2012). As the area of underground engineering is rapidly evolving into a multidisciplinary field with a large R&D and implementation potential, the challenges of sustainability and multidisciplinary integration still remain to be improved. Croatia is European country where the preservation of natural resources has been considered as national priority. Currently, a considerable number of large-scale infrastructure projects (like Zagreb Metro project and Rijeka-Budapest railway corridor) in the area of underground engineering is under development, which provides an opportunity to implement the most recent sustainability standards into the engineering processes of those projects. So far, the thematic of sustainable engineering has been touched through work of ITA Croatia, including organization of two conferences on underground space. Hosting of World Tunnel Congress in Croatia in a few years shows determination in dealing with sustainability issues. This paper presents the recently established Sustainable UNderground Engineering Centre (SUNEC) at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Zagreb (UNIZG-FCE). The aim is to integrate the sustainable underground engineering process through the following research modules within the institution of UNIZG-FCE: sustainable ground improvement using waste materials, water management, renewable energy utilization and storage, underground fire safety, transportation engineering, monitoring of underground structures and process-driven risk management.

And sea waters are characterized by large temperature gradients. In summer the atmospheric moisture off the Crimean coast is 10 - 15 g/m? 3 at air temperature over 20 - 25 °C. Meanwhile water temperature of cold intermediate layer is about 8 °C. The nucleus of cold intermediate layer off the Crimean coast is at a depth of 90 - 100 m, its upper bound is at a depth of 55 - 70 m and its lower bound at a depth of 125 - 135 m. In the Caspian Sea in summer cold waters with the temperature 7 - 8 °C are at a depth of 80 - 100 m. It is a unique opportunity to get fresh water on the arid shores of these inside seas by the condensation of atmospheric moisture on the outer surface of the tube condensers that are cooled by deep sea water. Air cooling on the condenser surface to 10 °C will cause condensation of about half air moisture or 5 g of 1 m3 of air when air temperature above the sea is 20 °C and atmospheric moisture content is 10 g per 1 m 3. Thereby to get 1 kg of fresh water is necessary to cool 200 m 3 of air to 10 °C. The condensation of 1 kg of moisture will emit 2258*103 joule of heat, cooling of 200 m3 of air to 10 °C 2676*103 joule more. To produce 1 kg of fresh water the condenser must absorb about 5000*103 joule of heat energy. To withdraw such quantity of heat is necessary to heat 240 kg of deep water (T 8 °C) to 13°C. These theoretical estimates were confirmed experimentally off the Black Sea coast in Sevastopol by exposition of a cold water vessel at fixed test duration, obtained condensate mass and water temperature changes in the vessel. According to the experiment, as 24-hour period equivalent about 11 kg of fresh water was obtained from 1 m2 of vessel surface or 35 kg of 1 m2 of condenser cross-section. This quantity at wind speed about 3 m per second is hardly 1,5 % of atmospheric moisture general content in air composition that cross 1 m2 of wind current cross-section during 24-hour period. Using a complex tube condenser this index can be increased by an order, placing the tubes at a distance equal to the diameter of each other in a checkerboard pattern. So, it's very possible to obtain up to 350 kg of fresh water per 24-hour period on 1 m2 of condenser cross-section. Cold water feed to the coastal slope can be carried out by electric pumps through plastic pipes of large diameter having thermal insulating properties, to a height suitable for the condenser location. The condensers can be assembled of individual sections, consisting of thin polyethylene tubes. Passing through the condensers sea water can accumulate in pool and then reset to the turbines, returning the spent energy on lifting, during its deficit in electrical supply. Operating in Hydro-accumulator power plant regime the complex of condensers can fully supply with drinking water a town with a population of 500 thousand in the summer time, occupying only a few kilometers of sea coast. To get a commensurate amount of fresh water by the thermal desalination, it would require energy of a nuclear power station. Moreover, these condensers and storage pool can be located close to the coast outside the actual beach area, without infracting its economic and recreational use.

Packaging was done in already hygienically cleaned bottles. The product was stores under controllable conditions. During the storage period the product was analyzed for moisture, crude protein, total ash, crude fat.and acidity. The sensory evaluation of the product was also made when stored under controlled conditions. The result of the investigation was statistically analyzed and interpreted. The present project was carried out to study the effect of corn oil on the different quality characteristics of mayonnaise. Different concentrations of corn oil were used to prepare mayonnaise samples. The mayonnaise samples were prepared by using 235, 240, 245, 250 and 255 ml_ of corn oil. Theses samples were tested for chemical properties like moisture, crude protein, crude fat, total ash, peroxide value and acidity. Among the sensory characteristics it was evaluated for its taste, texture, flavor and overall acceptability during 40 days of storage period. The test was made after 10 days interval up to 40 days. Among chemical characteristics the effect of different oil concentration was non-significant for fat and acidity. While as sensory characteristics were concerned color, flavor, taste, texture and overall acceptability decreased by increasing oil concentration. The last result was shown by the mayonnaise sample prepared by using 235 ml_ of corn oil. The concentration of 235 ml_ of corn oil showed good quality attributes especially with respect to its sensory evaluation such as color, taste, texture, flavor and overacceptibility of mayonnaise.

Under isoenergetic conditions there is evidence of a macronutrient hierarchy for satiety (protein > CHO > fat), energy density (ED) plays a major role, but the causal relationships and underpinning mechanisms of the macronutrients are still being elicited. Effects of CHOs on food intake are greatly complicated by the wide variety of forms in which CHO is consumed. Numerous theories have been proposed as to the effect of CHO on satiety, with conflicting recommendations made both for increase and decrease in our daily diet, and these are discussed in this chapter. Hypotheses include effects on circulation and storage CHOs, including Mayer's original glucostatic theory of low circulating blood glucose and Flatt's glycogenostatic theory of low glycogen stores in liver and muscle both triggering hunger, and the glycaemic index (GI) theory of 'fast release' available CHO causing rapid high spikes and rebound low troughs in blood glucose to also stimulate hunger. Conversely, there are the peptide theory of CHO-driven secretion of circulating satiety biomarkers and/or peptides, and the high-fibre theory wherein foods with a high fibre content and/or a low GI and/or enhanced large bowel microbiota suppress hunger. In addition, low ED theory supports complex/fibrous CHO/low energy foods for suppression of hunger, whilst the low CHO theory, wherein total CHO intake is restricted, predicts suppression of both GI and hunger. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.","Beverages; Carbohydrate; Fibre; Fructose; Glucose; Glycaemic index; Microbiota; Wholegrain foods",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899889936

On some substrates such as copper and nickel, CNTs do not grow well or at all. We have previously shown that mesoporous silica thin films can be deposited onto metal substrates including copper and nickel, and that, after removal of the templating surfactant, the mesoporous silica film can be used as template for the electrodeposition of metals to give metal nanostructures. [Campbell et. al., Micro. Meso. Mater., 97, 114-121 (2006)] The size of the metal nanostructures makes them attractive as seeds for growth of CNTs. We have found that under appropriate conditions nickel deposited into mesoporous silica can act as catalyst for CNT growth on a number of different substrates including copper coated silicon wafers, and nickel foam. Using three different furnaces and different feed streams it was found that the growth is sensitive to carbon source; acetylene and ethylene both produced CNTs whereas attempts to produce CNTs using xylene have so far been unsuccessful.

This creates a large demand for hot water. By using calorifiers that has the storage and heating capacity to cope with the large amounts of hot water needed, the cleansing requirements are satisfied. Calorifiers use resistance heating elements that have a very high demand for electrical energy. To lessen the demand for electrical energy by the resistance heaters, waste heat can be utilised. For this case study waste heat from a compressor system was used to increase the inlet temperature of the water to the calorifiers.

The economic viability of retrofitting these assets to enable - instrumentation for seamless data capture, remote transmission, storage and integration with engineering applications is sometimes challenged. A methodology and practical approach for designing and implementing integrated field (i-field) in a mature joint venture asset in Chevron Nigeria is presented in this paper. The various fields span several kilometers cutting across different terrain including land, swamp and shallow offshore locations with maximum water depth of 150 ft. The first well spudded in December 1963 came on production in March 1965 and still producing 48 years later (in 2013). There are more than thirty fields currently producing across over 2.2 MM acres. The extent of the geographical spread not only comes with different terrains but also presents complexity with design and application of i-field within Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL). The identification, prioritization and deployment of petro-technical transformational workflows were discussed. The implementation of a robust IT architectural foundation is pivotal to the adoption of existing and emerging solutions. The methodology for ranking the assets was largely based on current production and remaining reserves, existing downhole or wellhead instrumentation, availability of SCADA network and ease of implementation through a proof of concept (POC). Using a phased approach, multiple components of the i-field program were implemented. The first wave of solutions recorded a value of $2.5 MM in 2012 from better collaboration, production optimization, and management by exception. In addition, significant savings resulting from improved productivity, safety and operation excellence was attained in several assets/fields that are more than 40 years old. The overall impacts of these deployments have resulted in early gains resulting from reduction in OPEX and loss production opportunity (LPO) and improved reliability. Some of the challenges encountered include ability to retrofit existing wells and facilities especially with diminishing reserves and aging facilities. Value proposition for marginal field and lack or limited infrastructure related to bandwidth for communication was a big challenge. In addition, best practices and lessons learned for development and deployment of i-field initiatives in mature brown fields are presented Copyright 2013, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Digital storage; Offshore oil well production; Design and application; Different terrains; Economic viability; Engineering applications; Multiple components; Offshore locations; Production optimization; Remote transmissions; Retrofitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899462499

Because the price of electricity is not known more than 24 hours in advance, forecasting is necessary when scheduling the ESU. The reduction in profitability of the ESU because of forecasting errors must be taken into account. The methodology applies ridge regression for price forecasting to overcome the problem of having many highly correlated inputs, which lead to poor performance of the forecaster. The methodology demonstrates the encouraging result that the profitability of an ESU is not highly sensitive to forecaster error, as the scheduler is insensitive to the types of errors introduced by the forecaster. This is because of the nature of the variance in electricity market price. © 2013 IEEE.","electricity price forecasting; Energy storage sizing; linear programming; model-predictive control; regularization; ridge regression; scheduling","Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric power system interconnection; Energy storage; Linear programming; Model predictive control; Power electronics; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Economic assessments; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Energy storage unit; Multiple services; Real time pricing; regularization; Ridge regression; Profitability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899411198

This elevation led to the use of hybrid electrical systems. The use of these multi sources systems progressed a lot in different industrial sectors. Between all sources of energy that we have, the batteries and renewable sources of energy such as photovoltaic and wind contain the highest specified energy. In contrast to fossil energy, renewable energy must be harvested when it is available, and to maintain a balance between production and consumption, some sort of energy storage is needed or at least of value. This paper presents a study of an electrical hybrid system using two important renewable energies: solar and wind energies, and investigates a control strategy using fuzzy logic to ensure and manage, in an adequate and automated way, the flow of energy in the system and the two storage devices used: batteries and super capacitors. © 2013 International Institute for Innovation, Industrial Engineering and Entrepreneurship - I4e2.","energy management; fuzzy logic control; Hybrid system; PV energy; Wind energy","Energy management; Fuzzy logic; Industrial engineering; Virtual storage; Wind power; Control strategies; Electrical systems; Fuzzy inference control; Fuzzy logic control; Production and consumption; PV energy; Renewable energies; Solar and wind energies; Hybrid systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899111918

The scope of this work is to investigate a new control strategy to ensure a balance, at each instant, between the wind farm generated power and the required one by the consumers without adding any type of storage systems. The proposed wind farm control is composed of two hierarchical structures. The first one is the global control applied to the manager wind turbine which has the responsibility to make, on the one hand, the wind farm generated power smooth and to ensure, on the other hand, the energy balance. The second one is the local control corresponding to the slaves wind turbines which are used only to produce the maximum of energy.

Coal is used for power generation as the major fuel in the world. However it is true that control of global warming should be applied to coal power generations. Therefore, many people expect CO2 reduction by technical innovation such as efficiency improvement, Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). In case of coal power plant are considered for improving efficiency. Some of them have already put into commercial operation but others are still under R&amp;D stage. Especially, the technical development prospect of the power plant is very important for planning the energy strategy in the resource-importing country. Japan Coal Energy Center (JCOAL) constructed a program to forecast the share of advanced coal fired plants/natural gas power plants towards the year of 2050. Then, we simulated the future prediction about 2 cases (the Japanese scenario and the world scenario). The fuel price and the existence of CCS were considered in the forecast of the technical development of the thermal power generation. Especially in the Japanese scenario, we considered the CO2 reduction target which is 80% reduction in 1990. In the world scenario, coal price had almost no influence on the share of coal fired plant. However, when the gas price increased 1.5% or more, the share of coal fired plant increased. In that case, CO2 emissions increased because coal-fired plant increased. Compared with both cases, the amount of CO2 in 2050 without CCS case was 50% higher than that of with CCS case. In Japanese scenario, achievement of 80% CO2 reduction target is impossible without CCS. If CCS is introduced into all the new establishment coal fired plant, CO2 reduction target can be attained. In the Japanese scenario, the gas price more expensive than a coal price so that the amount of the coal fired plant does not decline. Since the reduction of the amount of CO2 will be needed in all over the world, introductory promotion and technical development of CCS are very important not only Japan but also all over the world.","CCS; Coal fired plant; Forecast; JCOAL model",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898750718

Core to delivering this project will be the engagement of the South African public at both a national and local level. CCS public engagement will have some unique challenges in South Africa given the significant diversity of the population with regard to culture, language and economic situation. Given that South Africa is a developing country, communication about CCS technology also needs to be placed in the context of other national priorities such as access to energy, poverty alleviation, job creation and education. In April 2012 a consortium of South African and international consulting and research organisations was appointed as part of the World Bank South African Department of Energy CCS Study. The task of the consortium is to prepare two separate stakeholder engagement plans, a National Plan (NatPlan) and a Local Plan (LocPlan) prior to the commencement of CCS projects in South Africa, including the SACCCS Test Injection Project.

We then perform a numerical analysis on the macroeconomic effect of CCS with EOR on the Abu Dhabi economy for CO2 capture from the steel and aluminum industries. Result shows that the current scale of CCS remains too small and can only increase the supply of gas by 0.1% for Abu Dhabi.

Actually, other than fatty acids and lipid moieties, WAT secretes a wide range of bioactive factors, considerably different in therms of structure and functions, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, complement system molecules, acute phase reactants, and hormones, among which the products predominantly or exclusively synthesized by and released from adipocytes are categorized as ""adipokines"". The adipokine expression is intimately linked to various parameters of adiposity (such as total body fat, percentage of body fat, and fat distribution), resulting generally (with very few exceptions, such as adiponectin, omentin, and Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) in positive correlation with WAT mass. The adipokine profiles undergo opposite changes in WAT excess or deficiency/dystrophy. In obese subjects, the altered adipokine network strikingly contributes to the development of systemic low-grade inflammation, as well as of obesity-related metabolic/CV comorbidities, that collectively define the so called metabolic syndrome. Adipokine dysregulation has been also observed in patients with chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disorders, such as connective tissue diseases, and adipokine pathway targeting has been thought to represent a potential innovative therapeutic perspective. Comprehensive advances in understanding the WAT biology and signaling may provide crucial insights into the physiopathology of the whole body homeostasis.",,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; APLN protein, human; chemerin, human; chemokine; cytokine; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; ITLN1 protein, human; lectin; leptin; lipocalin; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; plasma retinol binding protein; RBP4 protein, human; seminal plasma protein; serine proteinase inhibitor; SERPINA12 protein, human; signal peptide; Zn alpha 2 glycoprotein; Zn-alpha-2-glycoprotein; adipose tissue; animal; biological model; cardiovascular system; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; human; inflammation; metabolism; obesity; physiology; review; signal transduction; Adipokines; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cardiovascular System; Chemokines; Cytokines; Gene Expression Regulation; GPI-Linked Proteins; Homeostasis; Humans; Inflammation; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lectins; Leptin; Lipocalins; Models, Biological; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Obesity; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma; Seminal Plasma Proteins; Serpins; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897977747

Perfect knowledge of a users' power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. An in-home storage system, which provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without the inconvenience (delay) caused by demand response, can also be used to maintain the privacy of a user's power profile. In this work, the design of battery charging and discharging algorithms in response to time varying demand and prices are studied. In particular, a fundamental tradeoff between how much privacy can be provided to individual consumers by a finite capacity battery and the cost savings that can be achieved assuming a zero tolerance for delay is studied using a Markov process model for user's demands and instantaneous electricity prices. When the demands and prices follow a Markovian evolution, the optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with belief dependent rewards (ρ-POMDP). Due to high computational complexity of the model, computable inner and upper bounds are presented on the optimal tradeoff. In particular, inner bounds are derived using specific strategies for battery scheduling including the cost optimal, optimal fixed deterministic strategy and the greedy algorithm. Upper bounds are provided using a standard rate-distortion optimization. These bounds are derived for a binary model, where the battery state is binary, and the demand and prices are distributed i.i.d.

The first approach is based on spectral analysis and fuzzy logic and the second one uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) analysis and feed-forward back-propagation neural networks. As human speech is imprecise and ambiguous, fuzzy logic - the base of which is indeed linguistic ambiguity, could serve as a precise tool for analyzing and recognizing human speech. The authors' systems revolve around the visual representations of voiced signals - the Fourier energy spectrum and the MFCC. The essences of a Fourier energy spectrum and the MFCC are matrices that include information about properties of a sound by storing energy and frequency in discrete time. The decision making process of their systems is based on fuzzy logic and neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that their fuzzy logic based system is 86% accurate whereas the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based system is 90% accurate compared to a commercial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based speech recognizer that shows 73% accuracy on an average. Moreover, the authors' research derives that, even though ANN gives a better recognition accuracy than the fuzzy logic based system, the fuzzy logic based system is more accurate when it comes to ""more difficult"" or "" polysyllabic"" words. In terms of runtime performance, the fuzzy logic based system outperforms the ANN based Bangla speech recognition system.

This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the concentrated solar power plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber. The additional stages in the CSP may increase thermal efficiency. The stages consist of two oriented solar absorber to create superheated steam fed to the steam turbine and one regenerator to optimally regenerate heat for working fluid before pumped to solar absorber. A suitable treatment for superheated steam from solar absorber can optimally supply the turbine with a continually stable steam. The continuous stable steam can be controlled using steam accumulator right before the superheated steam fed into turbine. The thermal energy storage in the cycle can be optimally selected based on the stored energy capacity per kg of compared material used. The final modification was made using recently developed absorber material of hafnium molybdenum nitride to create four layer tandem absorber of HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3. The tandem absorber indicates a stable absorptance and emittance up until 600°C (in vacuum) and 525°C (in air).

The system, which is based on control moment gyroscope (CMG) principles, utilises the gyroscopic response of a gimballed flywheel mounted within an AUV body to generate energy from the wave induced rotational motions of the vehicle. By utilising the wave induced rotational motions of an AUV and the relative motion/torque created by a precessing gimballed flywheel promises to enable AUVs to generate energy in-situ and from a renewable source. This novel approach has several advantages. As the system is housed internally it is not exposed to the harsh underwater environment, is not susceptible to bio-fouling and does not add any hydrodynamic drag. In addition, the system can be positioned anywhere within the AUV body and the technology has the potential to be developed into an integrated energy harvesting, storage and motion control system; whereby the wave induced gyroscopic precession of the flywheel can be used to generate energy, the flywheel kinetic energy (spin) can be utilised for energy storage (similar to Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems or KERS) and motion control can be provided by precession control of the flywheel (providing a stable platform for improved monitoring/recording capabilities). In this paper a theoretical description of the system is provided including a derivation of the governing equations of motion following a momentum (Newton-Euler) approach. A numerical model is also described and simulation results for a pitching 2m AUV system are presented. The results show that the system could be used to periodically recharge an AUV remotely, enabling longer AUV deployments at sea. © 2013 MTS.","Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs); Gyroscopic systems; Renewable energy; Wave energy","Automobile bodies; Equations of motion; Flywheels; Gyroscopes; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Motion control; Oceanography; Rotational flow; Wave energy conversion; Wheels; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Control moment gyroscope; Governing equations of motion; Gyroscopic system; Renewable energies; Underwater environments; Wave energy; Autonomous underwater vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896340167

Some key issues include complexity, outdated platform level designs, lack of flexibility and hardware expenses. The challenges were addressed by designing a new customised mote platform, using a modular design approach. The platform supports both TinyOS and ContikiOS, promoting flexibility and operability. Dual operating system (OS) support allows programmers to choose which OS to use based on the application specific problem that needs to be solved. The mote consists of two modular units that provide processing and communication functionality on one layer and energy storage and harvesting on a second layer. The energy harvesting module uses a solar panel to charge a rechargeable battery pack. Designs were based around minimalistic concepts to minimise cost and reduce hardware complexity. User friendly design was also a key consideration, since the platform is intended to be used by novice programmers to obtain practical experience in sensor networks. The platform can be manufactured in South Africa resulting in an overall cost reduction for small quantities. Future work will include the design of several application specific add-on boards to facilitate field tests in water quality monitoring, gas sensing, smart grid metering, agricultural monitoring and asset tracking. © 2013 The Authors.","ContikiOS; Energy harvesting; MEMS; Modular construction; Mote design; Mote platform; TinyOS; Wireless sensor networks","Cost reduction; Energy harvesting; Exhibitions; Hardware; MEMS; Modular construction; Product development; Water quality; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural monitoring; Application specific; Communication functionality; ContikiOS; Mote platform; Research and development; TinyOS; Water quality monitoring; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893766181

However, they are limited due to their reliance on traditional energy sources such as electricity and petroleum which cannot always provide a convenient energy source in all situations. Moreover, in a more eco-conscious modern world, these energy sources, which require the burning of a fuel in order to generate the output of electricity, are increasingly being shunned in favour of cleaner alternative energy sources such as solar energy. This study seeks to demonstrate the viability of an alternative, renewable, energy source for the operation of mobile robots. For the purposes of this study, an Industrial Mobile Robot Platform (IMRP) was designed that would run on solar power making use of an array of photovoltaic panels. In order to overcome the limitations of solar power, which is dependent on the availability of sunshine and thus cannot provide a constant source of energy, an energy storage medium was employed making use of metal hydrides. The advantage of this medium is that it is able to store energy in the form of hydrogen produced from solar energy, thus providing a reliable and constant energy source to power the IMRP. The IMRP was fabricated to run on hydrogen fuel cells using a low-pressure metal hydride hydrogen storage system that can store more energy on board than current conventional energy storage methods. The results show that solar energy can indeed provide a viable renewable energy source to power IMRPs, and that its limitations due to solar being an inconstant energy source can be overcome by the use of energy storage materials in the form of metal hydrides that store energy produced from solar power, and thereby satisfying the constant demand for energy. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Mobile Robot; Solar","Fuel cells; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Mobile robots; Photovoltaic cells; Robotics; Solar energy; Alternative energy source; Energy; Energy storage materials; Metal-hydride hydrogen storage system; Mobile robot platforms; Renewable energy source; Solar; Solar-hydrogen energy; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893213095

Not all species are able to increase their absorptive capacity for fats in response to a high fat diet. The effects of a high fat diet (10% canola oil) on the lipid absorption and deposition in the liver, breast and thigh muscles of male and female Japanese quail were investigated. Thirty-eight Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were randomly divided into a high fat diet (HFD) and a standard diet (STD) group. The birds were fed the diets for seven weeks after which half of the birds were subjected to oral fat loading tests (OFLT) with plant oils containing long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides. The remaining birds were included for the lipid deposition measurements. Thereafter the birds were euthanised, blood samples were collected and liver, breast and thigh muscle lipid deposition was determined. Female quail on both diets had significantly higher plasma triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05) compared with their male counterparts. No significant differences in plasma triglyceride concentrations were observed after the OFLTs. Female quail had significantly heavier liver masses compared with the males but there was no significant difference in the liver lipid content per gram liver mass. Female quail on the HFD had higher lipid content (p < 0.05) in the breast muscle compared with their male counterparts whilst male quail on the HFD had higher lipid content (p < 0.05) in the thigh muscle in comparison with both males and females on the standard diet. Dietary supplementation with 10% canola oil did not alter gastrointestinal tract lipid absorption, but it caused differences between the sexes in muscle lipid accumulation, the physiological significance of which requires further investigation. © 2013.

In this research, nanoporous carbons were prepared using simple and innovative approach based on structural array of phenolic resin polymer without activation during carbonization process. The effect of phenolic reactant type and composition on pore structure and carbon surface morphologies was studied. Nanoporous carbon derived from resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) and from resorcinol phenol formaldehyde (RPF) polymers was suitable for electrode material supercapacitor and CO2 capture medium. RF-derived and RPF-derived carbons provide electrode material supercapacitor with specific capacitance up to 246 F/g, whereas carbonized RPF exhibited CO2 uptake of 10.63 mmol/g (at 3.5 MPa 298 K). Nanoporous carbon derived from resorcinol para-tertbutyl phenol formaldehyde (RTBPF) polymer exhibited attractive characteristics as methane storage media with methane uptake capacity as high as 8.98 mmol/g (at 3.5 MPa 298 K).","Gas storage; Phenolic formaldehyde polymer; Porous carbon; Supercapacitor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891806662

Introducing hydraulic headloss, water leakage and changing pump energy consumption, effect the resulting system optimal operation but also create a non-linear problem due to the convex relation between flow, headloss, water leakage and total head. This study utilizes a methodology published by the authors for linearization of convex or concave equations. An iterative linear programming (LP) minimal cost optimal operation supply model is solved including the Hazen-Williams headloss equation, pressure related water leakage equation, changing pump energy consumption and source cost. The model is demonstrated using an example application. 'Greater than' or 'less than' water head constraints at nodes may force the system to maintain certain water levels in water tanks reducing the available operating volume forcing pumping stations to operate in peak tariff periods as less storage is available in low tariff periods. Operationally, reducing water leakage may be achieved by reducing water heads along the system by means of shifting pump operation periods and maintaining low water levels in water tanks. Source costs may serve as penalties or rewards discouraging or encouraging the use of certain water sources. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Convex; Headloss; Successive linearization; Water distribution system optimal operation; Water leakage",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891763096

An investigation of the responses to dynamic perturbations of typical representatives, noble metal oxides, carbonaceous materials and RuO 2-impregnated carbon blacks, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is presented. This presentation follows a brief description of supercapacitive behavior and origin of pseudo-capacitive response of noble metal oxides. For all the investigated materials, the electrical charging/discharging equivalent of the EIS response was found to obey the transmission line model envisaged as a so-called ""resistor/capacitor (RC) ladder"". The ladder features are correlated to material physicochemical properties, its composition and the composition of the electrolyte. Fitting of the EIS data of different supercapacitive materials to appropriate RC ladders enables in-depth profiling of the capacitance and pore resistance of their porous thin-layers and finally the complete revelation of capacitive energy storage issues.

In stark contrast, Nigeria's associated gas is continually flared and treated as a huge liability despite gas proven environmental advantage and heating efficiency in industrial and domestic processes. It is sad to note, for example, that the perennial flaring of gas in the Niger Delta has ever existed along side perennial kerosene scarcity all over Nigeria. The main challenge with the utilization of associated gas in Nigeria is the low pressure and volume of the gas available at a particular producing station. Harnessing these low-pressured, scattered gas resources using conventional technologies will require expensive gathering, compression and transportation systems. In this paper, the authors explore the potential contribution of activated carbon in gas utilization efforts in Nigeria. Activated carbon allows the adsorptive storage of natural gas at a relatively low pressure. The natural pressure of the produced gas may be sufficient or a low capacity compressor may be installed for this purpose. This could allow the setting up of small activated carbon adsorption units wherever gas is routinely flared in the Niger Delta. From an environmental and economic view point, this is a game changer as flaring is reduced and gas is made available for productive purposes. Since activated carbon is usually produced from waste carbon material, the scheme will potentially also aid solid waste management. Nigeria's under-utilized water bodies in the Niger Delta may provide for cheap transportation of activated carbon blocks to and from adsorption stations.

Going through a typical set of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) we can see the following vessels: •Separators (2-phase & 3-phase) •Free Water Knock-Out Drum •Gas Scrubbers •Flare Knock-Out Drums •Slug Catcher • Degassing Drum • Gas Separator • Storage Tank • Feed Flash Drum • Reflux Accumulator • Day Tank • Surge Drum • Suction Scrubber • Slug Catcher • Lube Oil Separator • Head Tank • Deaerator Although each of these is essentially a simple vessel or tank with or without any special internal structure, each serves a different purpose. Once it is clear what the purpose of a piece of equipment is, and how it functions, it will also be clear how to control and protect it. Different purposes need different controls. Vessels and tanks are probably the most hazardous pieces of equipment in any plant. This may seem a little surprising until one considers that they store energy as well as material. In the control of vessels and tanks, two separate control parameters are implied: Level and flow. Although controlling these parameters separately and independently is relatively simple, in most applications, a combination of the two parameters is required to be controlled simultaneously. Interface level control means the control of interface between two liquids such as oil and water. Correct installation of level instrument is an interdisciplinary effort involving Process, who sets the basic functional requirements, Mechanical, who has various constraints such as distance of taps from seams, Piping, who has accessibility and orientation requirements; and Instrumentation, who must select from a finite catalogue of available instruments. Most vessel and tank content measurements are made in the form of level. When true volume is required for such purposes as custody transfer, the tank volumes are calculated taking into account all details of their geometry as well as dimensional changes resulting from the pressure exerted by the density of the liquid. This paper looks into the different types of controls of multiple parameters in each of the vessels mentioned here. It also describes in detail the types of vessels listed in this abstract. It then looks into the benefits and dangers of various fluid media used for vessel pressure-testing.

The growth mechanism of the as-prepared bamboo-like CNTs, and the role of copper containing catalyst were studied.

As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively and develop the research of heat storage systems. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of using a continuous solid medium, composed mainly of an unsaturated sandy soil, which is the case in many desert areas in the world, where the solar energy is abundant, for long or short term like Underground Thermal Energy Storage System (UTESS) using a simple configuration and local means of low cost. Despite all attempts made by researchers and the continuous progress brought about, UTESS are still dependent mainly on the geological nature of the soil and they require enormous means for their construction in some cases with non usual cooling and heating systems. As a matter of fact, solar heat is characterized by its intermittency, in order to overcome this disadvantage, similar techniques can be useful to store thermal energy for later use. A mathematical model based on the heat conduction equation in two dimensional cylindrical coordinates is adopted to describe the heat transfer between a buried pipe and the storage medium (soil). Using a new analytical approach, a steady state solution of this model is presented, which consists of an exact solution composed of the sum of two functions. The approach is then used to determine the overall heat coefficient, the amount of heat stored, the amount of heat recovered and the heat storage efficiency. Some original conclusions and suggestions are given.","Efficiency; Exact solution; Heat conduction; Underground heat storage","Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Heat conduction; Mathematical models; Solar energy; Cylindrical coordinates; Exact solution; Heat conduction equations; Renewable energy source; Social and economic development; Thermal energy storage systems; Underground heat storage; Unsaturated sandy soils; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886694618

Solar is extremely variable and to use it reliably thermal storage is necessary. Heat recovery loops (HRL) are an indirect method for transferring heat from one process to another using an intermediate fluid (e.g. water, oil). With HRL's thermal storage is also necessary to effectively meet the stop/start time dependent nature of the multiple source and sink streams. Combining solar heating with HRL's makes sense as a means of reducing costs by sharing common storage infrastructure and pipe transport systems and by lowering non-renewable hot utility demand. To maximise the value of solar in a HRL, the means of controlling the HRL needs to be considered. In this paper, the HRL example and design method of Walmsley et al. (2013) is employed to demonstrate the potential benefits of applying solar heating using the HRL variable temperature storage (VTS) approach and the conventional HRL constant temperature storage (CTS) approach. Results show the VTS approach is superior to the CTS approach for both the non-solar and solar integration cases. When the pinch is around the hot storage temperature the CST approach is constrained and the addition of solar heating to the HRL decreases hot utility at the expenses of increased cold utility. For the VTS approach the hot storage pinch shifts to a cold storage pinch and increased heat recovery is possible for the same exchanger area without solar. With solar the VTS approach can maintain the same heat recovery while also reducing hot utility still further due to the presence of solar, but only with additional area. When the pinch is located around the cold storage temperature, solar heating can be treated as an additional heat source and the benefits of CTS and VTS are comparable.

The use of such materials in composites has increased due to their relative cheapness, their ability to recycle and their mechanical and physical properties. Composites based on natural fibbers have many advantages over their synthetic counterparts owing to their low cost, low density, high specific strength and stiffness, excellent sound-absorbing and high impact energy absorption. The technical hemp as fast-growing plant has prospect in the construction field in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. A special attention is paid to the use of fibrous hemp as well as hemp hurds (nonfibrous fraction hemp stalk) in the building materials preparing in various forms, such as insulation boards, mass-spraying hempcrete for the production of lightweight composites, where it is in the role of filler. The presence of surface impurities and the large amount of hydroxyl groups make plant fibbers less attractive for reinforcement of composites. Incompability of interface between fibres and matrix, the tendency to form aggregates during processing and poor resistance to moisture can be eliminated by physical/chemical treatments of fibbers and/or matrix or the use of coupling agents. In this paper, some aspects of durability of hardened composites based on chemically modified of hemp hurds slices and MgO-cement as binding agents after long termed storage in deionised water by testing on some important material properties as water absorbability, thermal conductivity coefficient, apparent density and compressive strength was studied.

Thus, a 2.5 kW hybrid power system (solar, wind and hydrogen) was designed and installed to meet the power demand for a stand-alone application at the University of Zacatecas. The hybrid unit integrates three power energy sources -a photovoltaic system (PV), a micro-wind turbine (WT), a prototype of a unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC) and energy storage devices (batteries)- in addition to their interaction methodology. The main contribution of this work is the URFC integration to a hybrid power system for the production of H2 (water electrolyzer mode) and energy (fuel cell mode). These three energy technologies were connected in parallel, synchronized to the energy storage system and finally coupled to a power conversion module. To achieve the best performance and energy management, an energy management and control strategy was developed to the properly operation of the power plant. A meteorological station that has wireless sensors for the temperature, the humidity, the solar radiation and the wind speed provides the necessary information (in real time) to the monitor and control software, which computes and executes the short and mid-term decisions about the energy management and the data storage for future analysis.

The methodology for working this out is set down by the German Institute of Standards. But how close is this figure to dwellings' actual heating energy consumption, and how does this affect the real energy savings potential through thermal retrofits? This chapter examines existing data on 3,400 representative German homes, their calculated energy rating plotted against their actual measured consumption. The results indicate that occupants consume, on average, 30% less heating energy than the calculated rating. This phenomenon, which we call the 'prebound' effect, increases with the calculated rating. The opposite phenomenon, the rebound effect, tends to occur for low-energy dwellings, where occupants consume more than the rating. A similar phenomenon has been recognized in recent Dutch, Belgian, French, and UK studies, suggesting policy implications in two directions. First, using a dwelling's energy rating to predict fuel and CO2 savings through retrofits tends to overestimate savings, underestimate payback time, and possibly discourage cost-effective, incremental improvements. Second, the potential fuel and CO2 savings through nontechnical measures like occupant behavior may well be far larger than is generally assumed in policies, so policymakers need a better understanding of what drives or inhibits occupants' decisions. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.","Energy rating; Heating energy consumption; Occupant behavior; Prebound effect; Thermal retrofit","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Fuels; Heating; Housing; Public policy; Energy rating; Heating energy consumption; Occupant behavior; Prebound effect; Thermal retrofit; Retrofitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883633489

This situation creates the need for an effective method by which excess heat can be stored for later use. Latent heat thermal energy storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy through which the disparity between energy production or availability and consumption can be corrected, thus avoiding wastage and increasing the process efficiency. This paper reviews a series of phase change materials, mainly inorganic salt compositions and metallic alloys, which could potentially be used as storage media in a high temperature (above 300 C) latent heat storage system, seeking to serve the reader as a comprehensive thermophysical properties database to facilitate the material selection task for high temperature applications.

This paper explores energy storage costs whose alternatives will be weighed against increasing payload fraction costs. A conceptual solution is presented that provides low cost of ownership: an engine that operates as a spark-ignited two stroke engine with compounding and light electrification.

In this network, a few nodes become cluster head which causes the energetic heterogeneity of the network, therefore the behavior of the sensor network becomes very unstable as soon as the life of the first node is elapsed. SEP has proposed the extension of time to network stability before the death of the first node and the reduction of unstable time before the death of the last node. This protocol is based on the election of cluster head by the balance of the probabilities of the remaining energy for each node. In this paper, we propose to improve SEP by fuzzy logic (SEP-FL). We show by simulation in MATLAB that the proposed method increases the stability period and decreases the instability of the sensor network compared with LEACH, LEACH-FL and SEP taking into account the energy level and the distance to the base station. We conclude by studying the parameters of heterogeneity as the protocol proposed (SEP-FL) provides a longer interval of stability for large values of additional energy brought by the more powerful nodes (advanced). © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

At its one end there is kwashiorkor and on the other is nutritional marasmus, all the developing countries are at great risk of developing PEM among children. The main objective of study was to assess the nutritional status of primary school children. It was achieved by well designed questionnaire using anthropometric, dietary patterns and clinical signs of children belonging from different socio-economic statuses. Total 46 urban school age children less than 12 years were selected through simple random sampling technique. It was found that young children (both boys and girls) were suffering from PEM were under weight than that of their normal requirement. They use to belong to big family size as indicating unavailability of food or imbalanced nutrition because they hardly take milk or milk products; eat meat, vegetable, fat or cereal group food daily. Only a few children took iron/vitamin syrups. This was expressed in their anthropometric measurements. Most of the children usually lacked apathy impression of skin, turned their hair colour brown, white or grayish, dry and thin. They largely had: enlarged thyroid glands, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly pot belly. They usually had ailments during last six months. They use to face diarrhea, fever diseases and malaria. They mainly use to suffer from phagophagia. Therefore it is suggested that raising the awareness of policy makers on the current magnitude of child malnutrition, country wide and in special subgroups, at city level, enhancing food security by improving storage and distribution systems.

The batch production schedules resulting from each of these formulations do not guarantee that the plant is operated optimally. Presented in this contribution is a formulation that addresses the optimization of both water and energy, while simultaneously optimizing the batch process schedule. The scheduling framework used in this study is based on the formulation by Seid and Majozi (2012). This formulation has been shown to result in a significant reduction of computational time, an improvement of the objective function and leads to fewer time points. The objective is to improve the profitability of the plant by minimizing wastewater generation and utility usage. From a case study it was found that through only applying water integration the cost is reduced by 11.6%, by applying only energy integration the cost is reduced by 29.1% and by applying both energy and water integration the cost is reduced by 34.6%. This indicates that optimising water and energy integration in the same scheduling framework can reduce the operating cost and environmental impact significantly. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Energy integration; Heat storage; Multipurpose batch plant; Wastewater minimisation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879019874

In addition to photosynthate supply from leaves, the chlorophyll-containing flavedo of citrus (Citrus sp.) fruit (outer, colored part of the rind) has the ability to fix CO2 through its own photosynthetic system. In this experiment, spanning three seasons, the three main sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) were quantified in the flavedo of 'Nules Clementine' mandarin (Citrus reticulata) fruit during Stages II and III of fruit development. Flavedo was sampled from fruit borne on the inside (low light intensity) or outside (high light intensity) of the tree's canopy. In one season, the photosynthetic and respiration rates of fruit borne in the two canopy positions were measured pre- and post-color break (March and April, respectively). Sucrose concentration increased constantly from initial sampling in February until harvest (May), whereas glucose and fructose concentrations increased significantly only during the last month of fruit development. The flavedo of inside fruit, developing under low-light conditions, was less well colored (higher hue angle) and had a lower sugar concentration compared with outside fruit developing under conditions of high light levels. This response could be attributed to the higher pigment concentration leading to a higher photosynthetic rate as well as greater sink strength of the outside fruit. The inside fruit had an increased susceptibility to the progressive postharvest physiological disorder, rind breakdown. The lower carbohydrate and pigment concentrations of the rind from fruit borne inside the canopy compared with those from the outside of the canopy could be indicative of a weaker rind condition at the time of harvest.","Fruit photosynthesis; Photosynthetically active radiation; Rind breakdown; Rind pigments","Citrus; Citrus reticulata; Nules clementine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878418644

During 2013-2014, the economy is estimated to gain strength, therefore sparking an upsurge in industrial demand. NWGA attributes this future boost in demand to the industry renewing pre-recession production levels or switching to natural gas. Generation demand is measured to have a growth rate of 1%/yr. The Pacific Northwest is using more natural gas to generate electricity, which is estimated to continue. With the upcoming flood of supply and uptick in demand, midstream infrastructure is a prime concern.

The thermal gradients are also evaluated as a function of the difference between the average temperature of the storage tank and the ambient surrounding temperature which signifies heat losses. The thermal gradient is seen to rise to a maximum value at some instance of time and then start to drop as thermal de-stratification in the storage tank starts.

Electricity generation accounts for almost half of the emission; besides, conventional electrical production based on fossil fuel is becoming more and more expensive. One approach to significantly slow down global warming is to drive our society away from the current fossil fuel fiesta and use only renewable power such as solar and wind energy. Another approach is to improve the management of energy production, transmission, and distribution. Part of the latter solution is on the supply side, where one possible solution is to develop continent-wide smart power grids and energy storage systems. However, an equally important part of the solution is on the demand side, where technologies and applications that can work with this type of unpredictable energy consumption are becoming necessary. The smart power grid with new sources of data, fast growth of information, and proactive management requires new strategy for business and operational management. In this paper we discuss how Cloud computing model can be used for developing Smart Grid solutions. The Cloud computing model is based on the delivery of computing as a service, whereby storage, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a commodity over the Internet. The advantages of Cloud computing - reduced costs, increased storage, on-demand performance, and better flexibility - have motivated many companies in recent years to move their IT operations to the cloud; the same advantages can be used to achieve the most important future goals of a large-scale Smart Grid, such as energy savings, two-way communication, and demand resource management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Information and communication technology; Renewable energy sources; Smart power grid","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Green computing; Wind power; Electricity generation; Energy storage systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Operational management; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Technologies and applications; Two way communications; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877336844

It is shown that HNO3 treatment results in an increase of the electrostatic capacitance up to 202 F/g in 7.6 m KOH-solution as well as pseudocapacitance up to 1250 F/g in 4 m KI. This increase is supposed to be related both with hydrophilicity and with an increase of the density of states on Fermi level. The ultrasonic treatment enables one to significantly increase (more than 200 times) the density of states on Fermi level which in turn causes both quantitative and qualitative changes in farad-volt dependences.

However, metabolic syndrome can also occur in lean individuals, suggesting that obesity is a marker for the syndrome, not a cause. Metabolic syndrome is difficult to define, due to its nonuniform classification and reliance on hard cutoffs in the evaluation of disorders with non-Gaussian distributions. Defining the syndrome is even more difficult in children, owing to racial and pubertal differences and lack of cardiovascular events. Lipid partitioning among specific fat depots is associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to mitochondrial overload and dysfunctional subcellular energy use and drive the various elements of metabolic syndrome. Multiple environmental factors, in particular a typical Western diet, drive mitochondrial overload, while other changes in Western society, such as stress and sleep deprivation, increase insulin resistance and the propensity for food intake. These culminate in an adverse biochemical phenotype, including development of altered glucose metabolism and early atherogenesis during childhood and early adulthood. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.","Diet; Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Reactive oxygen species","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; adiponectin receptor 1; adiponectin receptor 2; branched chain amino acid; C reactive protein; fatty acid; hydrocortisone; interleukin 6; leptin; reactive oxygen metabolite; abdominal obesity; adipose tissue; alcohol consumption; article; atherogenesis; carbohydrate intake; cardiovascular risk; childhood disease; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; dyslipidemia; endoplasmic reticulum stress; endothelial dysfunction; environmental factor; fat body; fat intake; fatty acid blood level; food intake; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hydrocortisone release; hypertension; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; insulin clearance; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver cell; metabolic syndrome X; muscle; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; phenotype; signal transduction; sleep deprivation; stress; subcutaneous fat; unfolded protein response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875686432

Effective stiffnesses for lubricated asperities are used to calculate the bearing and shear forces, while variable surface energy is modeled at the asperity level and used within an improved continuum adhesive formulation. Contributions from asperities in lubricant and solid contact for partial coverage are determined within the context of a statistical mechanics model.

Crumbling/sulfation is the main failure mechanism of the active materials, which limits their cycle life. LA batteries possessing long cycle life can serve as an ideal energy storage technology for load leveling applications. By uniformly adding properly oxidized CNTs to the positive active material of LA batteries, we achieved a pronounced improvement in their cycle life. This improvement was mainly attained by the formation of a stable conductive grid that enabled the delivery of current to all the active material. The grid consisted of composites made of CNTs conformably coated with lead salts. By enabling a uniform electron distribution, and subsequently proper electrochemical redox reactions, the formation of too big PbSO4 particles did not occur, thus changing the failure mechanism from crumbling/sulfation to pure crumbling. Additionally, the perfect coating of the CNTs prevented their electrochemical oxidation to CO or CO2.

SHRs had significantly higher liver weight and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels, irrespective of NAFLD. Liver abundance of Hif1a mRNA and Hif1α protein were overexpressed in SHRs (P < 0.04) and were significantly correlated with ALT levels (R=0.50, P < 0.006). This effect was not reverted by a direct acting splanchnic vasodilator (hydralazine). Angiogenesis may be induced by the HFD, but the disease model showed significantly higher hepatic Vegf (vascular endothelial growth factor) levels (P<0.025) even in absence of dietary insult. Hif1α mRNA overexpression was not observed in other tissues. Liver mRNA of Nr1d1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1; P<0.04), Ppara [Ppar (peroxisome-proliferatoractivated receptor) α; P<0.05], Pparg (Pparγ; P<0.001) and Sirt1 (Sirtuin 1; P<0.001) were significantly upregulated in SHRs, irrespective of NAFLD. Sirt1 and Hif1a mRNAs were significantly correlated (R=0.71, P<0.00002). Inconclusion, CVD is associated with Hif1a-related liver damage, hepatomegaly and reprogramming of liver metabolism, probably to compensate metabolic demands. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2013 Biochemical Society.","Arterial hypertension; Fatty liver; Hypoxia; Hypoxia inducible factor 1α; Liver damage; Metabolic syndrome; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","alanine aminotransferase; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interleukin 6; nuclear receptor NR1D1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; sirtuin 1; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vasculotropin; alanine aminotransferase; glucose; hydralazine; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vasculotropin A; alanine aminotransferase blood level; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arterial pressure; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; circadian rhythm; controlled study; disease association; energy metabolism; fatty liver; gluconeogenesis; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver injury; liver ischemia; liver weight; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; perfusion; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; rat; rhythm; triacylglycerol blood level; upregulation; vasoconstriction; analysis of variance; animal; cardiovascular disease; comparative study; enzymology; fatty liver; histology; lipid diet; liver; male; metabolism; pathology; real time polymerase chain reaction; spontaneously hypertensive rat; Western blotting; Wistar Kyoto rat; Alanine Transaminase; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diet, High-Fat; Fatty Liver; Glucose; Histological Techniques; Hydralazine; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Inbred WKY; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872196275

Also, the fact that the technology poses few environmental risks makes it an attractive solution for energy storage. However, widespread application of tailorable circumferentially wound composite flywheel rotors is hampered by the relatively low energy density that these rotors have been able to achieve. This contributes to high capital cost, which currently makes the flywheels prohibitively expensive for many applications. With the materials that are currently available, there seems to be ample room for improvement in the energy density achieved by composite flywheel rotors. To this aim, some of the design methods that have previously been proposed are herein studied, and our findings suggest that the manner in which the optimization problem is formulated is crucial to the design of high energy density flywheels. A new problem formulation is proposed, which is shown to lead to notable improvements in certain cases. By making use of the proposed problem formulation, flywheel rotors can be designed to consistently achieve high energy density relative to the materials that are made available. This can contribute towards lowering the cost of flywheel systems, and making flywheel energy storage viable for a wider range of applications. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Composite material; Energy density; Energy storage; Flywheel rotors; Optimal; Optimization","Attractive solutions; Capital costs; Composite flywheels; Design method; Energy density; Environmental risks; Fast response time; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel rotors; Flywheel systems; High energy densities; Long cycles; Optimal; Optimization problems; Problem formulation; Composite materials; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Flywheels; Rotors; Wheels; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871995563

A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications.

The second one is the droop control used to control the exported or imported active and reactive powers transferred with the grid ensuring its stability by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of its output voltage. The system is simulated using MATLAB software and results are provided in order to show the feasibility of this control strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is responsible for about 5% of anthropogenic CO2 in the world. Therefore, it is a relevant industrial sector for CO2 emission regulation strategies. Bearing in mind the importance of cement industry in Croatia, and because of the fact that Croatia will soon become an EU member state, the present paper analyses the potential to reduce CO2 emission in the Croatian cement industry. There are several measures that can reduce CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process: the use of waste heat as an alternative source of energy; CO2 capture and storage technologies; reduction of clinker to cement ratio; the use of alternative and biomass fuels; the use of alternative raw materials; an energy efficient combustion process. The most energy efficient technology for cement manufacturing today is the use of a rotary kiln together with a multi-stage preheater and a calciner. Since the use of cement calciners is a relatively new technology, further improvement of their operating conditions is still needed. This paper also highlights the results of research in the field of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations that are used for the investigation of process and combustion emissions. The above mentioned measures together with numerical investigations can reduce the effect of cement manufacturing in Croatia on the environment and can make it more competitive with cement manufacturers from the EU. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cement calciner; Cement industry; Emission analysis; Energy efficiency","Automobile manufacture; Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Cement manufacture; Cements; Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy efficiency; Waste heat; Alternative raw material; Alternative source; Biomass fuels; Calciners; Capture and storage technologies; Cement manufacturers; Cement manufacturing; Cement manufacturing process; Combustion emissions; Combustion pro-cess; Croatia; Croatians; Emission analysis; Emission regulation; Energy efficient; Energy efficient technology; Industrial sector; Multi-stage; Numerical investigations; Operating condition; Pre-heater; Cement industry; alternative energy; carbon emission; cement; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; construction industry; emission control; energy efficiency; European Union; industrial emission; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869867619

A 0.16 m3 tank filled with granulated activated carbon was used, where 360 PCM spheres (40 mm diameter) were placed inside. Adsorption and desorption temperatures, together with CO2 discharge amount were recorded experimentally from 0.8 to 3.0 MPa adsorption pressure. Results shown that experimental temperature profiles are well contrasted with numerical simulation of the process obtained using STAR CCM+ software. It was observed that it is possible to mitigate temperature fluctuation, rising adsorption and decreasing desorption, as well as increase the amount of desorbed CO2, with the use of PCM spheres. The best discharged amount of desorbed CO2 was 8952 L at 3.0 MPa using PCM spheres on carbon bed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of three different simultaneous charging and discharging cases are presented. The three different cases of simultaneous charging and discharging are; (i) an initially unstratified storage tank, (ii) an initially stratified storage tank, and (iii) an initially unstratified storage tank at the top and stratified at the bottom. The three different cases of simultaneous charging and discharging indicate that water can be boiled within 2 h of the charging/discharging cycle and a sufficient amount of energy can be stored in the storage tank. It is suggested that foods which take longer cooking times can be cooked with the boiling water. The energy stored can be used to heat up or cook foods that require lower cooking temperatures.

The properties of biofuel containing C. sativa oil methyl esters (CMEs) were compared with the properties of fossil diesel fuel and standardized rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and fossil diesel fuel blends. To ensure compliance with the requirements for fatty acid methyl esters established by the EN 14214 standard, pure CMEs were blended with methyl esters of animal origin, the content of which accounted for 32% of the blend. Motor studies were carried out in the VALMET 320 DMG diesel engine while using fuel blends consisting of 30% of a mixture of C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl esters and 70% fossil diesel fuel. Environmental and energy indicators were compared with indicators related to RME and fossil diesel fuel. In the course of the experiments, it was established that when no anti-oxidant was used, the C. sativa oil and pork lard methyl ester mixtures met the requirements of the oxidation standard only during the first month of storage, whereas the physical properties did not change considerably during the whole storage period. Due to the properties of fuels containing C. sativa oil methyl esters, they can be used in cold climate areas in summertime. As a result of performing measurements of emissions of hazardous components, it was observed that throughout the storage period, the maximum reduction of CO reached 7-10%, whereas the decrease in HC was - 5-8% and that of NOx was approximately 4%. The most significant effect was detected in the case of smoke intensity, where the reduction reached 20-25%, and the useful effect increased to 4%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A mandatory quota system requires that 5% of the electricity generated in the country must come from renewable energy sources, gradually increasing to 10% by 2024. As of 2010, solar energy has received attention only for small-scale future demonstration projects. Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are an interesting option for the country, especially when considering the high levels of solar radiation and clearness index that are available in northern Chile. Here we present a thermal and economic analysis of CSP plants of the parabolic trough type, comparing five different configurations including thermal energy storage and fossil fuel backup. The electricity yields are obtained from hourly simulations that consider radiation levels, solar field, and power plant characteristics. An economic model that includes the costs of construction, operation and maintenance allows predicting the levelized electricity cost (LEC) as a function of plant configuration and location. The results indicate that the plants can produce dispatchable electricity at a cost that is competitive and inversely proportional to radiation levels. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the influence of solar field area and radiation levels, and the optimal plant configuration and solar field area are obtained as a result. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chile; Parabolic trough; Solar power","Chile; Clearness indices; Concentrated solar power; Demonstration project; Economic models; Hourly simulation; LEC; Levelized electricity cost; Northern Chile; Operation and maintenance; Parabolic trough; Quota systems; Radiation levels; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar fields; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Sun; Electricity; economic analysis; electricity generation; power plant; resource assessment; solar power; solar radiation; state role; uncertainty analysis; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866539301

The latter is very important for Cyprus as seaside areas are very expensive. Such a solar power station however should be located near the sea close to an existing power station. An additional reason is that such a solar plant can be combined with solar desalination to produce fresh water from seawater which is also a precious commodity for Cyprus. Based mainly on their industrial maturity and the advantages mentioned in this paper, the parabolic trough system seems to be to best one to apply.

However, in the last decade, many large blackouts happened worldwide that led to serious economic losses. It allows concluding that the ability of current PFC to meet an emergency is poor, and security of power system (PS) should be improved. An alternative to effectively enhance the PFC and thus the PS security is to store exceeding energy during off-peak load periods in efficient energy storage systems (ESSs) for substituting the primary control reserve. In this sense, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) in combination with a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) are capable of supplying power systems with both active and reactive powers simultaneously and very fast, and thus to enhance the system security dramatically. In this paper, a new concept of PFC based on incorporating a STATCOM coupled with a SMES device is presented. A full detailed model of the integrated STATCOM-SMES is proposed, including a pseudo 48-pulse voltage source inverter (VSI) and a two-quadrant three-level dc-dc converter as interface with the SMES. In addition, a dynamic equivalent model of the STATCOM-SMES for multi-machine power system studies is presented. The proposed simplified modeling is developed using the state-space averaging technique and is implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink environment using the phasor simulation method. Moreover, a three-level control scheme is designed, including a full decoupled current control strategy in the d-q reference frame with a novel controller to prevent the STATCOM dc bus capacitors voltage imbalance and an enhanced power system frequency controller. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
