This paper first reviews the properties of lithium-ion batteries that can produce hazards in grid scale systems. Then the conventional safety engineering technique Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) is reviewed to identify its limitations in complex systems. To address this gap, new research is presented on the application of Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to a lithium-ion battery based grid energy storage system. STPA is anticipated to fill the gaps recognized in PRA for designing complex systems and hence be more effective or less costly to use during safety engineering. It was observed that STPA is able to capture causal scenarios for accidents not identified using PRA. Additionally, STPA enabled a more rational assessment of uncertainty (all that is not known) thereby promoting a healthy skepticism of design assumptions. We conclude that STPA may indeed be more cost effective than PRA for safety engineering in lithium-ion battery systems. However, further research is needed to determine if this approach actually reduces safety engineering costs in development, or improves industry safety standards. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Battery; Energy storage; Lithium-ion; Safety; STAMP; STPA","Accident prevention; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Stamping; Standards; Battery; Designing complex; Energy storage systems; Engineering techniques; Lithium ions; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Process analysis; STPA; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943629706

Initially, iridium complex crystals were formed during [IrCl2(CO)2]- complex oxidation. Next, pyrrole was electropolymerized on the surface of the iridium needles. The morphology of the composite was investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. At positive potentials, the iridium complex crystals and the polypyrrole were oxidized. In aprotic solvents, oxidation of the iridium complex crystals resulted in their dissolution. In water containing tetra(n-butyl)ammonium chlorides, the 1-D iridium complex crystals were reversibly oxidized. The product of the iridium complex oxidation remained on the electrode surface in crystalline form. The iridium complex needles significantly influenced the redox properties of the polymer. The polypyrrole involved electrode processes become more reversible in presence of crystals of iridium complex. The current of polypyrrole oxidation was higher compared to that of pure polypyrrole and the capacitance properties of the polymer were significantly enhanced. A specific capacitance as high as 590 F g-1 was obtained for a composite of polypyrrole and 1-D crystals of the iridium complex in water containing tetra(n-butyl)ammonium chloride.

An ongoing question associated with these two RFBs is determining whether the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) or iron-chromium redox flow battery (ICRFB) is more suitable and competitive for large-scale energy storage. To address this concern, a comparative study has been conducted for the two types of battery based on their charge-discharge performance, cycle performance, and capital cost. It is found that: i) the two batteries have similar energy efficiencies at high current densities; ii) the ICRFB exhibits a higher capacity decay rate than does the VRFB; and iii) the ICRFB is much less expensive in capital costs when operated at high power densities or at large capacities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capital cost; Comparative study; Iron-chromium redox flow battery; Large-scale energy storage; Vanadium redox flow battery","Chromium; Costs; Decay (organic); Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Iron; Metal ions; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Capital costs; Charge discharge performance; Comparative studies; Cycle performance; High current densities; High power density; Intrinsic safety; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943385094

However, energy and power capabilities of LIBs decrease sharply at low operation temperatures. In particular, the charge process becomes extremely sluggish at temperatures below -20 °C, which severely limits the applications of LIBs in some cold areas during winter. Extensive research has shown that the electrolyte/electrode composition and microstructure are of fundamental importance to low-temperature performances of LIBs.

It was found that through the polydopamine(PDA)-assisted chemical reduction process performed on the CuGeO3 NWs, the phase partially transformed to a mixture of crystalline Cu (∼70 nm) and amorphous CuxGeOy NWs with carbon coating, but the nanowire-shaped morphology was maintained.

Even at 800 mA g-1, it also exhibited excellent high rate capacity of 350 mA h g-1.

Compared to Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Ti, W and their alloys, Al, the most abundant metal in the crust has been less used in supercapacitors due to its high activity which makes it unstable in acid and base electrolytes. In this paper, we explore a novel Al/C/MnO2 sandwich structured material for the first time for supercapacitor. Owing to the highly porous and open surface structure and the highly conductive Al/C double core current collector on nanoscale, the Al/C/MnO2 sandwich nanowall arrays supported on Al foil show excellent capacitance performance with a maximum area specific capacitance of 1008.3 mF cm-2 and a high energy density of 35.2 μWh cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2. Moreover, a supercapacitor device with 4 supercapacitors connected in series can power a LED lamp. The present study demonstrates a novel electrode architecture based on Al foil with remarkably high area specific capacitance and stability for promising supercapacitor applications. Our strategy provides a new approach to the fabrication of hierarchical electrode materials from Al metal (could also be extend to other metal substrates) for supercapacitors and other energy storage and conversion devices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchical flower-like TiO2 particles were prepared via a facile solvothermal process and incorporated into the P(VDF-HFP) matrix. The temperature and frequency dependent dielectric properties of flower-like TiO2/P(VDF-HFP) composites as well as commercial TiO2/P(VDF-HFP) composites were investigated. The results reveal that the flower-like TiO2 particles are more effective in increasing the dielectric constant of P(VDF-HFP) when compared with commercial TiO2. Typically, the dielectric constant of the P(VDF-HFP) composite filled with 20 vol % flower-like TiO2 reaches 83.1 at 100 Hz, in contrast to 43.4 for the composite filled with 20 vol % commercial TiO2 and 11.3 for pristine P(VDF-HFP). Also, the flower-like TiO2-filled composites exhibit similar characteristic breakdown strengths to their commercial TiO2-filled counterparts.

The structures and morphologies of the synthesized composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), from which an egg-like structure was observed due to the deposition of carbon layers on the SiO surface.

However, the ISCC systems usually have to be operated at part-load conditions with low system efficiency when no or lower insolation than that at design point is available as most of state-of-the-art such systems have no thermal storage equipped. In order to improve system performance and prolong the system full-load operation hours, a proper solar field size represented as the solar multiple is a prime parameter to be determined during the design stage of the ISCC system. A too large solar multiple might cause the collected solar thermal energy to become partially useless without thermal storage and high investment cost, while a smaller one might worsen the part-load performance of the system.This paper presents the thermodynamic and economic analysis for an ISCC system with two pressure level DSG solar fields (ISCC-2DSG), aiming to study the impacts of solar multiples on system performance with or without consideration of thermal storage. In the ISCC-2DSG system, the solar thermal energy produced from two solar fields is only used to supply latent heat for low- and high-pressure water vaporization, respectively. Feedwater preheating and steam superheating are achieved in a HRSG. The annual thermodynamic performance of several such ISCC-2DSG systems, with different solar multiple values but with identical design parameters in the power subsystem, is characterized. Based on these features, the LEC for each system is calculated and compared. An optimum solar field size (solar multiple), which gives the minimum LEC, for the ISCC-2DSG system can be finally obtained. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","DSG technology; ISCC system; Solar multiple; Thermal storage","Costs; Economic analysis; Heat storage; Investments; Solar energy; Solar heating; Steam generators; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Direct steam generation; Integrated solar combined cycles; ISCC system; Part load conditions; Power generation systems; Solar multiples; Thermal storage; Thermodynamic performance; Cost benefit analysis; cost analysis; economic analysis; electricity; energy efficiency; latent heat flux; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; solar power; thermal power; thermodynamics; vaporization; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946079496

In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable leading to alternative strategies such as rooftop water harvesting (RWH), storage and pumping. Since urban garden irrigation is the highest outdoor water consumer, optimal scheduling is important to conserve energy and water over conventional lawn irrigation methods. A model to optimally control the lawn irrigation was developed with the simulation results showing 17.4% potential water savings when using water directly from municipal sources. With RWH of a 1-h event with 1-mm rainfall from a 120-m2 roof, the model can potentially save 23.4% of water and 73.8% in energy costs per day.

The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) show that the paraffin can be well vacuum drawn into the expanded interlayer spaces of EVM-800, and that the paraffin and EVM-800 are chemically inert. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results reveal that the composite PCM has an onset melting temperature of 27.0±0.1°C and latent heat of 77.6±4.3J/g, and good thermal stability is clearly suggested by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. Moreover, the LW-TESCCs with bulk densities below 1500kg/m3 were further developed by incorporating the composite PCM as sand replacement. It is found that the LW-TESCCs have significantly improved thermal resistance performance and well-endowed thermal storage capabilities. Thus, it can be expected that the potential applications of the LW-TESCCs in building envelopes would significantly contribute to reducing indoor air temperature fluctuations and in saving energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Expanded vermiculite; Lightweight cement-based composite; Paraffin; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Aggregates; Cements; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal energy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Cement based composites; Composite phase change materials; Expanded vermiculite; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Indoor air temperature; Interlayer spaces; Lightweight cement; Vacuum impregnation method; Storage (materials); aggregate; air temperature; bulk density; cement; chemical analysis; composite; crystallization; energy conservation; microstructure; phase transition; temperature gradient; thermal power; vermiculite; wax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942748839

The as-prepared LDOs samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique. The results show that the LDHs are decomposed to ZnO with amorphous aluminium species dispersed in the lattice. After calcinations, LDOs inherit the lamellar structure of LDHs. LDOs with thermal treatment at different temperature are tested as the anode active materials for Zn/Ni secondary battery. Cyclic voltammetries (CV) and Tafel curves measurements reveal that the calcined products have better electrochemical performances, lower polarization and better reversibility. Galvanostatic charge/discharge shows that the calcined products have excellent cycle stability and higher specific discharge capacity.

The unique MOFs-derived core/shell structured ZnO/ZnCo2O4/C hybrids are assembled from nanoparticles of ZnO and ZnCo2O4, with homogeneous carbon layers coated on the surface of the ZnCo2O4 shell. When acting as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the MOFs-derived porous ZnO/ZnCo2O4/C anodes exhibit outstanding cycling stability, high Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable rate capability. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZnO/ZnCo2O4/C LIB anodes can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the porous structure of the MOFs-derived core/shell ZnO/ZnCo2O4/C and homogeneous carbon layer coating on the surface of the ZnCo2O4 shells. The hierarchically porous core/shell structure offers abundant active sites, enhances the electrode/electrolyte contact area, provides abundant channels for electrolyte penetration, and also alleviates the structure decomposition induced by Li+ insertion/extraction. The carbon layers effectively improve the conductivity of the hybrids and thus enhance the electron transfer rate, efficiently prevent ZnCo2O4 from aggregation and disintegration, and partially buffer the stress induced by the volume change during cycles. This strategy may shed light on designing new MOF-based hybrid electrodes for energy storage and conversion devices. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","anodes; carbon layer; core/shell structure; lithium-ion batteries; metal-organic frameworks","Anodes; Crystalline materials; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Java programming language; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Organometallics; Secondary batteries; Zinc oxide; Carbon layers; Core/shell structure; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage and conversions; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; Metal organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Structure decomposition; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949654012

The superior electrochemical performance of the inverse opal structures was evaluated through galvanostatic and potentiodynamic cycling, and the IO thin film battery offers increased capacity retention compared to micron-scale bulk particles from improved mechanical stability and electrical contact to stainless steel or transparent conducting current collectors from bottom-up electrodeposition growth. Li+ is inserted into planar and IO structures at different potentials, and correlated to a preferential exposure of insertion sites of the IO network to the electrolyte. Additionally, potentiodynamic testing quantified the portion of the capacity stored as surface bound capacitive charge. Raman scattering and XRD characterization showed how the IO allows swelling into the pore volume rather than away from the current collector.

It is well known that pressure can cause profound structural and electronic changes, leading to the fundamental modification of the physical properties. Here, we reported the structural phase transition, lattice dynamics, and electronic properties of alkali metal (Li, Na, K, and Rb) peroxides by using the unbiased structure searching techniques and first-principles density functional calculations in the pressure range of 0-100 GPa. The predicted first-order phase transitions pressures in Li2O2, Na2O2, K2O2 and Rb2O2 occur at ∼84, 28, 7 and 6 GPa, respectively, which closely correlates with the electronegativity of alkali metals. Different phase transition mechanisms and complex phase transition structures have been observed for these alkali metal peroxide compounds. These predicated high-pressure phases are thermodynamically stable against decomposition into alkali metal oxides plus O2 or alkali metals plus O2. Interestingly, the character of the peroxide group (O22-) is maintained under the considered pressure range. Phonon calculations using the quasi harmonic approximation confirm that these structures are dynamically stable. The band gaps for the studied alkali metal peroxides increase with increasing pressure.

The plant consists of solar collector field of 120 kW peak thermal capacity, thermal storage tank with 3 tons of therminol-66 oil, an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) of 4.3 kW nominal electric power production capacity, and thermally driven absorption chiller (TDC) of 35 kW cooling capacity. The present article reports on the plant layout, thermodynamic analysis, solar field design, ORC and TDC integration, thermal storage system, and control system and operation strategy. The plant is modeled and analyzed using parabolic trough (PTC) and Linear Fresnel collectors (LFR) at different operation modes in typical winter and summer days. The power output from the solar field in typical summer days results in simultaneous operation of the ORC and TDC using PTC for about 10 and 12 hr/day, respectively. The use of LFR solar collectors results in reduction in the operation hours of ORC and TDC by about 50% and 30%, respectively. Low power output of the solar collector field in winter allows for operation of the ORC unit only. Careful design and operation of the plant can increase the overall plant efficiency which improves its economic value.

The structure of rGCP composite mainly resulted from the synergistic effect of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and crumpled graphene layers, which was beneficial for achieving large surface area, short ion diffusion pathway, excellent rate performance and cycling stability. As a result, the hybrid rGCP composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of almost 400 F g-1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s-1. Furthermore, even at the high current density of 10 A g-1, it still retained the capacitance of 243.2 F g-1, and excellent cycling stability (91.8% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles). The as-prepared hierarchical hybrid composite has promising potential in electrochemical energy storage. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The shell of HCS is highly graphitized and abundant in oxygen-containing surface groups. The presence of K2CO3 activates the carbon matrix with numerous hierarchical pores during heat treatment. A slow heating rate is the key to fabricate hollow carbon spheres. The by-product of water possibly serves as the template and promotes the formation of HCS. The carbonization duration plays an important role. Extending the heating time enhances both the porosity and the graphitization degree of the shell. The HCS-10 exhibits a large specific surface area of 517.5 m2 g-1 and pore volume of 0.265 cm3 g-1. The unique hollow spherical morphology and suitable porous structure bestow HCS-10 excellent supercapacitive performances. Derived from the CV curves, a symmetrical supercapacitor of HCS-10 exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 317 F g-1 at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and a high rate capacitance of 222.2 F g-1 at a fast scan rate of 300 mV s-1 with the potential window of 1.0 V by using 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge-discharge displays a high capacitance of 265.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a high rate capacitance of 137.9 F g-1 even at a high current density of 100 A g-1. The high capacitance retention of 99.6 % over 25000 charge/discharge cycles further confirms the cycling stability and rate performance with varied current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 1 A g-1. Also, the presence of oxygen-containing groups broadens the working voltage up to 1.5 V. Notably, the highest power density of 100 kW kg-1 is achieved at current density of 100 A g-1 and working voltage of 1.0 V. Cycling tests deliver a compatible data at 1.4 V and 10 A g-1, a high capacitance of 286 F g-1 with a high energy density of 77.88 Wh kg-1 and a large power density of 14 kW kg-1.

In subzero temperature environments, EVs suffer a dramatic driving range loss due to the energy and power capability reduction of LiFePO4 batteries, as well as severe battery degradation due to Li plating. This will increase the system operation cost because the battery pack needs to be changed frequently. Based on a novel degradation model of LiFePO4 batteries, which is validated over a wide temperature range, a near-optimal energy management strategy of the HESS for on-line use is proposed using the dynamic programming (DP) approach, which minimizes the operation cost (the electricity and the battery fade costs) over a typical China Bus Drive Cycle (CBDC). The convective heating method is integrated into the DP process. Finally, the required heating of the HESS at subzero temperatures over multi-CBDC is analyzed by evaluating the system operation cost. Simulation results show that the heating process becomes increasingly necessary with increased driving range, battery price, and heating efficiency, as well as decreasing environment temperature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery degradation; Electric city bus; Hybrid energy storage system; Subzero temperatures; Thermal analysis","Costs; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Energy storage; Heating; Operating costs; Thermoanalysis; Battery degradation; Electric cities; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy management strategies; Environment temperature; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Sub-zero temperatures; Secondary batteries; activation energy; design; efficiency measurement; electric vehicle; energy budget; energy conservation; heating; lithium; optimization; temperate environment; temperature effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942519491

The objective of the optimization is to minimize the overall costs of the net acquisition for heat and power in deregulated power market. A planning model consisting of energy balances and constraints for system control and operation is built and an efficient algorithm is developed. We demonstrate the method in a CHP-DH system with a solar thermal plant and a thermal energy storage (TES).

Comprehensive testing of Boston Power Swing 5300 lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells utilized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to power humanoid robot Robonaut 2 (R2) is conducted to support the development of a test-correlated Thermal Desktop (TD) Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) (TD-S) model for evaluation of power system thermal performance.

Building from test data, embedded FORTRAN statements directly simulate Ohmic heat generation of the cells during charge-discharge as a function of surrounding temperature, local cell temperature and state of charge.

Developing advanced sodium storage anode materials with appropriate working potential, high capacity, and good cycling performance is very important. Herein, we demonstrate a nanostructured tellurium@carbon (nano-Te@C) composite by confining nano-Te molecules in the space of carbon micropores as an attractive anode material for SIBs. The nano-Te@C anode presents an appropriate redox potential in the range of 1.05-1.35 V (vs Na+/Na), which avoids the Na dendrite problem and achieves a high reversible capacity of 410 mA h g-1 on the basis of a two-electron redox reaction mechanism. Notably, the nano-Te@C exhibits an admirable long-term cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 90% for 1000 cycles (i.e., ultralow capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle). The excellent electrochemical property of nano-Te@C benefits from the high electroactivity from the nanostructure design and the effective confinement of the microporous carbon host. In addition, a Na-ion full cell by using nano-Te@C as anode and Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as cathode is demonstrated for the first time and exhibits a remarkable capacity retention up to 95% after 150 cycles.

Here, we demonstrate all-solid-state, flexible micropseudocapacitors via direct laser patterning on crack-free, flexible WO3/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composites containing high levels of porous hierarchically structured WO3 nanomaterials (up to 50 wt %) and limited binder (PVDF, &lt;25 wt %). The work leads to an areal capacitance of 62.4 mF·cm-2 and a volumetric capacitance of 10.4 F·cm-3, exceeding that of graphene based flexible MSCs by a factor of 26 and 3, respectively. As a noncarbon based flexible MSC, hierarchically nanostructured WO3 in the narrow finger electrode is essential to such enhancement in energy density due to its pseudocapacitive property. The effects of WO3/PVDF/MWCNTs composite composition and the dimensions of interdigital structure on the performance of the flexible MSCs are investigated. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","energy storage; laser patterning; microsupercapacitors; nanomaterials; tungsten oxide","Capacitance; Carbon; Electromechanical devices; Energy storage; Graphene; MEMS; Microelectromechanical devices; Nanostructured materials; Tungsten; Yarn; Interdigital structures; Laser patterning; Microsupercapacitors; Portable electronics; Pseudo-capacitive properties; Tungsten oxide; Tungsten trioxide; Volumetric capacitance; Flowcharting; carbon nanotube; graphite; nanomaterial; nanowire; oxide; tungsten; tungsten oxide; chemistry; electric capacitance; laser; porosity; Electric Capacitance; Graphite; Lasers; Nanostructures; Nanotubes, Carbon; Nanowires; Oxides; Porosity; Tungsten",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952651922

Charge/discharge tests indicate that sodium ions can reversibly co-intercalated with diglyme solvent into graphite anode and show good rate performance. The energy densities of the NICs are as high as 93.5 and 86.5 Wh kg-1 at 573 and 2832 W kg-1 (equal to 4 C and 50 C) in the voltage window at 1-4 V, respectively.

It has been reported that gel electrolytes based on ionic liquids (ionogels) with large potential windows can be used as solid electrolytes to enhance the energy density of MSCs, but a systematic study on how to select and evaluate such ionogels for MSCs is rare. In this study, we construct a series of all-solid-state asymmetric MSCs on the interdigital finger electrodes, using graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as the negative electrode, MnO2 nanosheets as the positive electrode, and different ionogels as the solid electrolytes. Among them, the MSC using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTF2]) with 4 wt % fumed SiO2 ionogel exhibited the best electrochemical performance, having excellent rate capability with the scan rate up to 2000 V s-1, ultrafast frequency response (τ0 = 206.9 μs) and high energy density. The outstanding performance of this device mainly results from fast ion diffusion, high ion conductivity of the ionogel, and ionic liquid-matrix interactions. The results presented here provide guidance for picking out appropriate ionogels for use in high-performance all-solid-state MSCs to meet the growing requirement of micronanoscale energy storage devices.

Regarding these two backgrounds, there is special research interest to investigate the technical feasibility of integrating a H2 vehicle with an on-site renewable electrical (REe) system in the ZEB. Hereby, a hybrid system consisting of an on-site REe and a H2 vehicle integrated H2 system is proposed and set up in the TRNSYS simulation with novel control logics defined by the authors. The essential principle is to drive the electrolyzer with the surplus on-site REe, and to drive the fuel cell to cover the on-site electrical shortage, while the cogenerated heat from the H2 system will be utilized for domestic heating purposes. The simulation results show that with the support of a 14kW wind turbine, the building will be a nearly ZEB with full annual availability of the H2 vehicle, whereas with the support of a 178m2 PV, the building will be a net ZEB with 48days' annual unavailability of the H2 vehicle. Via a seasonal matching analysis, it can be found that the H2 vehicle integrated H2 system has a significant effect on alleviating the monthly surplus on-site REe generation. By relieving the condition of discharging the H2 storage by the fuel cell, both the on-site surplus REe and energy shortage will be further reduced and the cogenerated heat from the H2 system can be increased. Therefore, the research approves that it is technically feasible to simultaneously meet the zero-emission fuel requirement of the H2 vehicle, the convenient accessibility of the H2 refuelling station, the fulfillment of the zero energy balance of the building, and the highest matching capability between generation and demand. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy matching; Hydrogen building; Hydrogen vehicle; Renewable energy; Zero energy building","Amphibious vehicles; Buildings; Energy conservation; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Wind turbines; Energy matching; Hydrogen vehicles; Matching analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Research interests; Trnsys simulations; Zero energy building (ZEB); Hybrid vehicles; cogeneration; commercialization; electric vehicle; emission; energy efficiency; energy resource; feasibility study; fuel cell; hydrogen; power generation; renewable resource; research method; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941281635

To address this problem, the application of phase change materials (PCM) in buildings has received attention because of their high energy storage density and their ease of incorporation in building envelopes. Despite large experimental works conducted on the application phase change materials in buildings, there is very little work done on this application in combination with night ventilation. In this study, the application of night ventilation in combination with PCM-impregnated gypsum boards for cooling purposes was experimentally investigated. Two identical test huts equipped with ""smart"" control systems were used for testing the concept. One hut was constructed using impregnated gypsum boards, while the other hut was finished with ordinary gypsum board.

Combining this system with night time generation of CO2 hydrate slurry can significantly reduce the investment costs for cooling purposes. These systems require hydrate generation temperatures around 8°C and can, from an energetic point of view, contribute to significant energy savings. In this paper a numerical and experimental investigation is carried out for a shell-and-tube fluidized bed heat exchanger, combined with a hydrate slurry storage vessel. When required, heat can be removed from the storage by circulating the slurry through a heat exchanger which is part of the cold distribution system. The model of the fluidized bed heat exchanger is coupled with the model of the cold storage system. The phase change process is modelled by using a crystal growth model.

For now and in the foreseeable future, the combination of rechargeable batteries and electrochemical capacitors remains the most promising option for many energy storage applications. Porous carbonaceous materials have been widely used as an electrode for batteries and supercapacitors. To date, however, the highest specific capacitance of an electrochemical double layer capacitor is only ∼200 F/g, although a wide variety of synthetic approaches have been explored in creating optimized porous structures. Here, we report our findings in the synthesis of porous carbon through a simple, one-step process: direct carbonization of kelp in an NH3 atmosphere at 700 °C. The resulting oxygen- and nitrogen-enriched carbon has a three-dimensional structure with specific surface area greater than 1000 m2/g. When evaluated as an electrode for electrochemical double layer capacitors, the porous carbon structure demonstrated excellent volumetric capacitance (&gt;360 F/cm3) with excellent cycling stability.

However, there still exists some obstacles prohibiting the further improvement of dielectric performance, such as poor interfacial compatibility and low dielectric constant. Therefore, in depth study of the size dependent polarization and surface modification of BT particle is of technological importance in developing high performance BT/PVDF composites. Here, a facile molten-salt synthetic method has been applied to prepare different grain sized BT particles through tailoring the calcination temperature. The size dependent spontaneous polarizationof BT particle was thoroughly investigated by theoretical calculation based on powder X-ray diffraction Rietveld refinement data. The results revealed that 600 nm sized BT particles possess the strong polarization, ascribing to the ferroelectric size effect. Furthermore, the surface of optimal BT particles has been modified by water-soluble polyvinylprrolidone (PVP) agent, and the coated particles exhibited fine core-shell structure and homogeneous dispersion in the PVDF matrix. The dielectric constant of the resulted composites increased significantly, especially, the prepared composite with 40 vol % BT loading exhibited the largest dielectric constant (65, 25 °C, 1 kHz) compared with the literature values of BT/PVDF at the same concentration of filler. Moreover, the energy storage density of the composites with tailored structure was largely enhanced at the low electric field, showing promising application as dielectric material in energy storage device. Our work suggested that introduction of strong polarized ferroelectric particles with optimal size and construction of core-shell structured coated fillers by PVP in the PVDF matrix are efficacious in improving dielectric performance of composites. The demonstrated approach can also be applied to the design and preparation of other polymers-based nanocomposites filled with ferroelectric particles to achieve desirable dielectric properties. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","BaTiO3; core-shell structure; dielectric constant; dielectric loss; energy storage; molten salt method; nanocomposites,ferroelectric polymers","Barium compounds; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Digital storage; Dispersions; Electric fields; Energy storage; Ferroelectricity; Filled polymers; Fillers; Fused salts; Nanocomposites; Permittivity; Plastic coatings; Polarization; Polymers; Rietveld refinement; Shells (structures); Storage (materials); Surface treatment; X ray diffraction; Batio; Core shell structure; Ferroelectric polymers; Interfacial compatibility; Low dielectric constants; Molten salt method; Powder X ray diffraction; Theoretical calculations; Dielectric materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946949633

The results suggest that a thin layer of PPy was successfully wrapped on the surface of MnO2, and the shell/core structure of MnO2@C/TiO2 nanowire arrays was not changed after electro-deposition of PPy.

However, the poor cycle stability hinders the further development of this battery system. In order to improve the stability of Li-S batteries, the diffusion of polysulfides from electrodes into electrolyte should be suppressed. Herein, we utilize a positively charged polyelectrolyte to functionalize the electrode materials with the aim to hamper the polysulfides dissolution via electrostatic interaction between strong positively charged polyelectrolyte and negatively charged polysulfides anion. The effect of the functionalization quantity of poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) and functionalization sequence on cycling performances is investigated in detail. It is found that the sulfur-graphene composite (SG) directly functionalized with 10 times PDDA exhibited best cycling stability. At a discharge current density of 0.2 C, much higher capacity retention was realized on the functionalized electrodes than the unfunctionalized (81% vs. 47.3%) after 120 cycles. The as-observed results demonstrate that the electrostatic interaction can effectively prolong the cycling life of Li-S batteries, which provides a new promising strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, however, their specific capacitance is much smaller than the theoretical limit due to the low electrical conductivity and serious agglomeration. In the present work, we demonstrate that highly conductive nanoporous silver (NPS) network with uniform continuous nanoporosity and high surface area which was fabricated by dealloying Ag-Mg-Ca metallic glasses can be employed as supports and collectors for MnO2 capacitors. By plating the MnO2 nanocrystals into the nanopore structure, the NPS/MnO2 composite electrode provides fast ionic conduction and excellent electron-proton transport, resulting in an ultrahigh specific capacitance of the plated active MnO2 (∼1088 F g-1), which is close to the theoretical limit. The unique combination of high specific capacitance and long cycle life enhanced by the current composite structure makes the NPS/MnO2 composite promising for electrochemical supercapacitor as electrode material.

The development of anode materials is a crucial step to promote the commercialization of SIBs, and amorphous carbon materials are likely to be the most promising alternatives among all proposed anode materials. However, the cost of the reported carbon materials is still very high due to the expensive precursors and their low carbon yield. Here, we report an amorphous carbon (AC) material made from low cost pitch. The amorphous carbon material with an amazing high carbon yield of 57% was achieved by utilizing the emulsification interaction between pitch and lignin to suppress the graphitization of pitch during the carbonization. The effects of heat-treatment temperatures and the pitch/lignin mass ratios on the morphology, microstructure and the electrochemical performance of AC were systematically investigated. By optimizing experimental conditions, we achieved one representative AC with a suitable morphology and microstructure, which exhibits promising performances with a high reversible capacity of 254 mA h g-1, a high initial coulombic efficiency of 82% and excellent cycling stability.

One of these promising technologies is phase change materials (PCM), where, the latent heat storage potential of the transition between solid and liquid state of a material is utilized as thermal mass. A PCM layer incorporated in a transparent component can increase the possibilities to harvest energy from solar radiation by reducing the heating/cooling demand and still allowing the utilization of daylight. The introduction of dynamic components in the building envelope makes the characterization of conventional static performance indices insufficient in giving a clear picture of the performance of the component in question. Measurements have been performed on a state-of-the-art window that integrates PCM using a large scale climate simulator. The glazing unit consists of a four-pane glazing with an integrated layer that dynamically controls the solar transmittance (prismatic glass) in the outer glazing cavity. The innermost cavity is filled with a phase change material. This article presents and assesses the series of measurements and the related methodologies with the aim of investigating the thermal behavior and thermal mass activation of the PCM-filled window.

One of them imposes the normalized theoretical heat demand to be limited to 15 kWh/m2, year. In operation, it is very difficult to check, from simple observations or measurements, the real performance of such a house: different energy vectors may be used to meet the space heating as well as the domestic hot water demand, a storage tank may be used and fed by different energy sources (heat pump, direct electricity, solar thermal). The problem is still more complicated if the house is equipped with PV panels which naturally decrease the apparent electrical consumption. In the frame of the IEA Annex 58 project, a passive house was the object of a detailed analysis aiming at estimating the different terms of the energy balance. Some terms were results of direct in situ measurements and unmeasured terms such as solar and internal gains were estimated by dynamic simulation. The combination of measurements and simulation results allowed a reconstruction of a robust energy balance.

In this study, rice husk char was compressed into pellets with four kinds of binders (lignin, starch, calcium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide). The compressive process, mechanical strength, basic fuel properties, and combustion characteristics were investigated to elucidate the effect of binders on the properties of bio-char pellets. Results showed that starch pellets had good hydrophobicity, but low volume density and poor mechanical strength. The softening and morphological transition of lignin during compression may account for the high elastic modulus and good bonding of lignin pellets. The low saturated moisture content of Ca(OH)2 pellets is mainly ascribed to its hydration. NaOH pellets showed the highest compressive strength among all pellets, and also exhibited the highest moisture uptake that may worsen the handling and storage treatment of bio-char. Compared with raw bio-char, bio-char pellets had a lower ignition temperature, wider temperature interval, and higher oxidation activity according to the thermogravimetric analysis.

The use of hybrid electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency, thus reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In this research, the performance characteristics of a novel coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain for a transit bus are presented. The power sources are a combination of a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine and supercapacitors. A mathematical model for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain is established. Subsequently, an analysis program is developed based on Matlab and Advisor. The parameters are specified using experimental data. Afterwards, a rule-based control strategy is designed and optimized from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. Later, the system performance is evaluated using the Chinese Transit Bus City Driving Cycle and compared to a conventional powertrain. The results indicate that the proposed coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can fulfill the requirements of the transit bus and enhance the energy efficiency dramatically. Moreover, the average energy efficiency of the supercapacitors was found to be above 97% over the entire driving cycle. Using supercapacitors as energy storage devices for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can effectively recover the kinetic energy during regenerative braking and is a good solution for transit buses that require frequent acceleration and deceleration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CNG engine; Coaxial power-split; Hybrid electric powertrain; Performance analysis; Supercapacitors","Automotive industry; Bus transportation; Buses; Capacitors; Compressed natural gas; Digital storage; Engines; Hybrid powertrains; Hybrid vehicles; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; MATLAB; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; CNG engine; Hybrid-electric powertrain; Performance analysis; Power splits; Super capacitor; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945130772

The challenge of alleviating additional uncertainty and variability brought by new sources to the system operation is seen as defining both flexibility capacities and flexibility requirements through provision of multiple services. In this context the role of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage (ES), is recognized through their active participation in providing both energy and reserve service.This paper elaborates on the benefits of active EV participation in multiple system services through various charging strategies. The presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) unit commitment problem (UC) considers the capability of EV to provide primary, secondary and tertiary reserve as well as energy, however the focus is put on the benefits of EV providing spinning reserve services. The results clearly show benefits of multiple EV role to that of providing energy only.

Different from private electric vehicles, EBs are scheduled by a public transport company and required to be charged as soon as possible during operation hours. Consequently, the implementation of fast charging stations (FCSs) is essential to support the operation of EBs. Usually, the size of an FCS is constrained by the residual capacity of the connected distribution network and the investment budget. An energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a potential supplement not only to reduce the network integration cost for FCSs but also to reduce the charging cost of EBs through electricity price arbitrage. To quantify the value of ESS in an electric bus FCS, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for optimal sizing and control of FCS and ESS is built. A simplification method is proposed to convert the MINLP problem to a linear one without any loss in optimality, which accelerates the solving process. Simulations are performed based on historical data of a practical FCS. Numerical results indicate that ESS can significantly help reduce the overall investment and charging cost of the FCS. Meanwhile, the parameters of investment cost, lifespan and time-of-use electricity price have significant influences on the overall value of ESS for an FCS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric bus; Energy storage system; Fast charging station; Mixed integer program","Budget control; Buses; Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Costs; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Electric bus; Energy storage systems; Environmental friendliness; Fast charging stations; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Mixed-integer programs; Simplification method; Time-of-use electricity price; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934900447

We show that the energy storage limits of today's electric vehicles are outweighed by their high efficiency and the fact that driving in the United States seldom exceeds 100 km of daily travel. When accounting for these factors, we show that the normal daily travel of 85-89% of drivers in the United States can be satisfied with electric vehicles charging with standard 120 V wall outlets at home only. Further, we show that 77-79% of drivers on their normal daily driving will have over 60 km of buffer range for unexpected trips.

This work reports a facile method to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) from the polyurethane foam (PUF) waste and use it as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur for lithium-sulfur batteries. The obtained NPC has a unique interconnected sheet-like porous morphology with a large surface area of 1315 m2 g-1. The NPC-S composite delivers a large reversible capacity of 1118 mAh g-1 with good cycling performances and excellent high-rate capabilities. A large reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 can be retained at a large current of 5C (8.35 A g-1) after 100 cycles. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cathode material; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Nitrogen-doped porous carbon; Polyurethane foam","Carbon; Cathodes; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Foams; Lithium; Nitrogen; Polysulfides; Polyurethanes; Porous materials; Rigid foamed plastics; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Sustainable development; Capacity degradation; Cath-ode materials; Environmental pollutions; High energy densities; High rate capability; Lithium sulfur batteries; Polyurethane Foam; Porous carbons; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929575287

Their structure and surface morphology are studied using X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results suggest that a RGO layer was coated on the MnO2 nanoflakes, and the MnO2 nanoflakes have a well-distributed coverage on the surface of the C/TiO2 shell/core nanowire arrays.

Owing to the high activity of the scaffold-like CoMoO4 nanowires and the well-defined CoNiO2 nanoneedles, the three-dimensional (3D) electrode architectures achieved remarkable electrochemical performances with high areal specific capacitance (5.31 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2) and superior cycling stability(159% of the original specific capacitance, i.e., 95.7% of the maximum retained after 5000 cycles at 30 mA/cm2).

Two polymerization approaches were compared, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was found to be superior to potentiostatic polymerization for the growth of PEDOT/GO films. After deposition, incorporated GO was reduced to rGO by a rapid electrochemical method of repetitive cathodic potential cycling, without using any reducing reagents. The films were characterized in 3-electrode configuration in BMIMBF4. Symmetric supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte were assembled from the composite films and characterized through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic discharge tests. It was shown that PEDOT/rGO composites have better capacitive properties than pure PEDOT or the unreduced composite film.

Recent work suggests that secondary interactions may enhance polyaniline's electrochemical stability and cycle life, but evidence to date is not conclusive. Here, we investigate spray-assisted layer-by-layer assemblies containing polyaniline nanofibers (PANI NFs) or conventional PANI and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which provides hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. This spray-on approach may be suitable for the deposition of PANI onto a variety of surfaces. The effects of PANI type, PAA pH, and PAA molecular weight on the growth behavior, conductivity, and electrochemical performance are examined. It is shown that LbL films with PANI NFs, higher molecular weight PAA, and lower PAA pH yield the thickest films, whereas the thinnest films come from conventional PANI assembled under similar conditions. Electron microscopy imaging and density measurements show that LbL films containing PANI NFs are very porous, whereas those containing conventional PANI are very dense (0.28 vs 1.33 g/cm3, respectively). The difference in density dramatically affects the electrochemical properties in terms of capacity and long-term cycling behavior. Upon extended cycling, PANI NFs alone rapidly lose their electrochemical activity. On the other hand, PANI NF-based LbL films exhibited somewhat enhanced stability, and PANI-based LbL films were exceptionally stable, maintaining 94.7% of their capacity after 1000 cycles when cycled up to 4.2 V vs Li/Li+.

During conversion processes, the crystal structure and composition of the electrode material are drastically changed. Surprisingly, in our study, inheritance of a crystallographic orientation was found during lithiation/delithiation processes of single-crystal α-Fe2O3 nanocubes by ex situ transmission electron microscopy. Single-crystal α-Fe2O3 was first transformed into numerous Fe nanograins embedded in a Li2O matrix, and then the conversion between Fe and FeO nanograins became the main reversible electrochemical reaction for energy storage. Interestingly, these Fe/FeO nanograins had almost the same crystallographic orientation, indicating that the lithiated/delithiated products can inherit the crystallographic orientation of single-crystal α-Fe2O3. This finding is important for understanding the detailed electrochemical conversion processes of iron oxides, and this feature may also exist during lithiation/delithiation processes of other transition-metal oxides. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","conversion mechanism; high-angle annular dark-field imaging; inheritance of a crystallographic orientation; lithium-ion battery; α-iron oxide","Anodes; Crystal structure; Electric batteries; Electrodes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ions; Iron; Iron oxides; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Single crystals; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Transmission electron microscopy; Conversion mechanism; Conversion reactions; Crystallographic orientations; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical reactions; High-angle annular dark-field imaging; Lithiation/delithiation; Transition-metal oxides; Crystal orientation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946405385

Two different mechanisms were evaluated for the development of the model, a combined surface-diffusion controlled process and a surface confined process. Nonlinear multiple parameters estimation was implemented by direct comparison with experimental data, obtained in a rotating disk electrode system during linear sweep voltammetry, to calculate the kinetic parameters for the different elementary steps proposed in the mechanisms. It was demonstrated through modeling discrimination techniques that a surface confined process drives the oxidation of ammonia on the implemented electrode surface. The model validates that the formation of N2 is controlled by the catalytic dimerization of partially reduced ammonia adsorbates (i.e. NH2(ads)). Moreover, it confirms that the formation of stronger adsorbed intermediates at high overpotentials is the main cause for the catalyst deactivation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

So far, impregnation of the oxide into ordered mesoporous carbon materials has been demonstrated either in hard-templated carbon synthesized by using ordered mesoporous silica or alumina scaffolds, or soft-templated carbon derived from surfactant micelles. The hard-template method can provide a high pore volume but the instability of these mesostructures hinders total electrode performances upon oxide impregnation. While the soft-template methods can provide a stable mesostructure, these methods produce scaffolds with a much smaller pore volume and surface area, leading to limited metal oxide loading and electrode capacitance. Herein, anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) and triblock copolymer F127 are used together as hard and soft-templates to fabricate ordered mesoporous carbon nanowires (OMCNWs) as a host material for Fe2O3 nanoparticles. This dual-template strategy provides a high pore volume and surface area OMCNW that retains its stable structure even for high metal oxide loading amounts. Additionally, the unique nanowire morphology and mesoporous structure of the OMCNW/Fe2O3 facilitate high ionic mobility in the composite, leading to &gt;260 F g-1 specific capacitance with good rate capability and cycling stability.

A low-temperature and facile solvothermal method for preparing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical covellite (CuS) microspheres from an ionic liquid precursor [Bmim]2Cu2Cl6 (Bmim = 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) is reported. The formation of CuS nanostructures was achieved by decomposition of intermediate complex Cu(Tu)3Cl (thiourea = Tu), which produced CuS microspheres with diameters of 2.5-4 μm assembled by nanosheets with thicknesses of 10-15 nm. The ionic liquid, as an all-in-one medium, played a key role for the fabrication and self-assembly of CuS nanosheets. The alkylimidazolium rings ([Bmim]+) were found to adsorb onto the (001) facets of CuS crystals, which inhibited the crystal growth along the [001] direction, while the alkyl chain had influence on the assembly of CuS nanosheets. The CuS microspheres showed enhanced electrochemical performance and high stability for the application in supercapacitors due to intriguing structural design and large specific surface area. When this well-defined CuS electrode was assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with an activated carbon (AC) electrode, the CuS//AC-ASC demonstrated good cycle performance (∼88% capacitance after 4000 cycles) and high energy density (15.06 W h kg-1 at a power density of 392.9 W kg-1).

Factors causing BOG are presented, and quantities of BOG generated due to each factor at each location are calculated under different LNG temperatures.

We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19-42%) and also a 2-38% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6-1.6% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23-64% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84% (±30%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77. €/MWh (±12€). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon Capture and Storage; Flexibility; Power system modeling; Renewable energy; Thermal power plants","Carbon capture; Commerce; Competition; Economics; Global warming; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Carbon capture and storage; Flexibility; Power system model; Renewable energies; Thermal power plants; Power markets; carbon; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; economic analysis; energy efficiency; global warming; industrial investment; market system; operations technology; optimization; power plant; renewable resource; thermal power; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936852555

Offshore compressed air energy storage (OCAES) is a carbon-free storage technology that can used to support renewable energy generation in marine environments. This paper provides the first economic characterization of OCAES performance when coupled to an offshore wind farm by employing a mixed integer programming model. The model seeks the minimum levelized cost of electricity by optimizing the grid-tied cable capacity and OCAES component sizes across a range of specified cable capacity factors. OCAES can be used to increase the capacity factor of the grid-tied transmission cable, but the resultant levelized cost of electricity strongly depends on the OCAES cost assumptions. Compared to using a land-based gas turbine as backup, OCAES is significantly more expensive, even when the price of carbon exceeds 1000. $/tC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mathematical modeling; Offshore energy storage; Wind energy","Cables; Carbon; Compressed air; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Gas turbines; Integer programming; Mathematical models; Offshore wind farms; Pressure vessels; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Critical challenges; Economic characterization; Levelized cost of electricities; Mixed integer programming model; Offshore energy; Renewable energy generation; Techno-economic assessment; Transmission cables; Compressed air energy storage; cost analysis; energy conservation; energy market; fixed offshore structure; marine environment; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; renewable resource; technological change; turbine; wind farm; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934948157

This is mainly due to the complex interplay of energy production/consumption/storage systems as well as the automatically and manually controlled systems/elements in the highly integrated buildings.

Nevertheless, little is known about thermal stratification in their storage tank as most research on these devices reports averaged temperatures and energy conversion efficiency. Here we address the issue by analyzing the impact of the slope on thermal behavior of. the device at low tilt angles, of particular interest for sub-tropical regions. In the present work the effect of the tilt angle on flow patterns, energy conversion efficiency and the stratification effect was studied with experimental setups and tridimensional numerical simulations as well. The study was performed using a commercial ""water in glass evacuated tube solar water heater"" (WGET-SWH) with nominal capacity of 40. L and 8 evacuated tubes. Experiments were carried during four weeks varying the tilt angle of the collector. The data gathered during the clearest days were used to validate the tridimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The numerical model was used to study the effect of several tilt angles (10°, 27° and 45°) with the same energy input. It was found that the tilt angle has significant effect on daily solar energy gain, flow patterns inside the storage tank and stratification. Nevertheless, it was found little impact on the thermal efficiency due to the low magnitude of heat losses though the vacuum tubes. Also, 10° tilt angle allowed to achieve significant higher temperatures and thermal stratification, along with a thermal inactive area at the bottom of the tank. Conversely, the content of the storage tank for the 45° tilt angle is fully mixed at the end of the heating process. This occurred mainly due to the relative position of the tubes' opening inside the tank and the mixing effect of the convective water flow. A non dimensional number to quantify the stratification effect is proposed and it was found an exponential dependence on the tilt angle. Some considerations regarding the use of WGET-SWHs on subtropical regions are made.

An annual performance analysis of the Solar STIG cycle with latent heat phase change material (PCM) storage is presented for the climatic conditions of Sede Boqer, Israel. We show that the heat transfer limitation present in a real PCM storage leads to a slight performance penalty only compared to an ideal storage. We also analyze the impact of shifting electricity generation from daytime to evening, which can lead to a surprisingly high contribution of the thermal storage. Results show annual solar fraction of up to 35.2%.

The upper level is for regulating the energy between the engine-generator and hybrid energy-storage system, while the lower level is for the battery and ultracapacitor. Second, a driving pattern recognition based adaptive energy management approach has been proposed. This approach uses a fuzzy logic controller to classify typical driving cycles into different driving patterns and to identify the real-time driving pattern. Dynamic programming has been employed to develop optimal control strategies for different driving blocks, and it is helpful for realizing the adaptive energy management for real-time driving cycles.

In this study, CTP-based activated carbon materials (CACs) with high capacitance for supercapacitors were prepared by doping elemental N with co-carbonization of CTP and melamine. The electrochemical performance and textural characterization of CACs were investigated by constructing a single electrode capacitor in a 6 M KOH electrolyte, N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and XPS. Results show that CACs with mass proportion of melamine and CTP being 1:5 possess a surface area of 2573 m2 g-1, with mesopore volume accounting for 56% of the total volume. After co-carbonization, N content on the surface of the CACs increased by 134% compared to that of undoped activated carbons. Their capacitance reached up to 228 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The high electrochemical performance of the CACs is attributed to its additional pseudo-capacitance and high surface area.

However, the large volume changes during cycling and structural pulverization significantly hinder the cycling stability and high capacity for lithium-alloy electrodes. Herein, novel one-dimensional (1D) hollow core-shell SnO2/C fibers were synthesized by facile coaxial electrospinning. The as-prepared fibers that possess sufficient hollow voids and nanosized SnO2 particles on the inner shell are able to serve as an anode in LIBs.

The proposed methodology can be applied to a variety of functional nanomaterials and enables exploration of nanofluids as a medium for industrial applications beyond heat transfer fluids, taking advantage of both liquid behavior and functionality of dispersed nanoparticles. The highest particle concentration achievable with pristine 25 nm titania (TiO2) nanoparticles in aqueous electrolytes (pH 11) is 20 wt %, which is limited by particle aggregation and high viscosity. We have developed a scalable one-step surface modification procedure for functionalizing those TiO2 nanoparticles with a monolayer coverage of propyl sulfonate groups, which provides steric and charge-based separation of particles in suspension. Stable nanofluids with TiO2 loadings up to 50 wt % and low viscosity are successfully prepared from surface-modified TiO2 nanoparticles in the same electrolytes. Viscosity and thermal conductivity of the resulting nanofluids are evaluated and compared to nanofluids prepared from pristine nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the surface-modified titania nanoparticles retain more than 78% of their electrochemical response as compared to that of the pristine material.

This method can synthesize MxCo3-xO4 (M = Co, Mn, Fe) porous nanocage materials and allow precise control of the ratio of substituted metal in Co3O4 catalysts. These catalysts were investigated for photochemical, chemical-driven (cerium(iv)-driven) and electrochemical water oxidation, and they presented a superior activity for water oxidation. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of ∼3.2 × 10-4 s-1 per Co atom was obtained under neutral pH using Co3O4 porous nanocages in the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, which is comparable with those of nanostructured Co3O4 clusters supported on mesoporous silica. Under cerium(iv)-driven water oxidation conditions, a high TOF of ∼3.6 × 10-3 s-1 per Co atom was achieved, which was the highest among those of other known reported cobalt oxides. The overpotential of Co3O4 porous nanocages for the electrochemical water oxidation (η = 0.42 V at 1 mA cm-2) is comparable to the reported overpotentials of catalysts based on cobalt.

Here, we, for the first time, report utilizing IOx-/I- redox couple for the positive electrode, which pins the positive electrode potential to be 0.4-0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. With the positive electrode potential pinned, we can polarize the cell to 1.6 V without breaking down the aqueous electrolyte so that the negative electrode potential could reach -1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl in the basic electrolyte, greatly enhancing energy storage.

Herein, hollow fluffy cages (HFC) of Co3O4, constructed of ultrathin nanosheets, were synthesized by the formation of Co(OH)2 hollow cages and subsequent calcination at 250 °C. The large surface area (245.5 m2 g-1) of HFC Co3O4 annealed at 250 °C ensures the efficient interaction between electrolytes and electroactive components and provides more active sites for the surface redox reactions. The hierarchical structures minimize amount of the grain boundaries and facilitate the charge transfer process. Thin thickness of nanosheets (2-3 nm) ensures the highly active sites for the surface redox reactions. As a consequence, HFC Co3O4 as the supercapacitor electrode exhibits a superior rate capability, shows an excellent cycliability of 10 000 cycles at 10 A g-1, and delivers large specific capacitances of 948.9 and 536.8 F g-1 at 1 and 40 A g-1, respectively.

Our calculations show that Li atoms can be easily transported on the surfaces of the monolayers, with negligible barriers as low as 0.017 eV on Ti2N, because of low adsorption energy and long binding distance. We further show that these monolayers remain metallic under full Li-intercalation and have low open circuit voltages. In particular, the Ti2N monolayer shows the best performance with an open circuit voltage of 0.53 V and the highest specific capacity of 487 mA h g-1.

Data of a steel enterprise are used to prove the economic benefit of the coal gas utilization mode. Given that China produces more than half of converter steel of the total production worldwide, their coal gas resources are abundant.

Theoretical models are developed to analyze the effect of the induced stratification through storage division into several tanks for different system configurations: multi-tank systems with even mass distribution, and two-tank systems with uneven and variable mass distribution. The instantaneous and the process efficiencies are defined to assess the performance of the system as function of operation parameters. For two- and four-tank systems with mass evenly distributed, efficiency increments around 4% and 7%, respectively, are possible. For two-tank systems, higher efficiencies are accomplished for short times when the mass is unevenly distributed and larger amount of the mass is in the hotter tank. For longer times, the even distributed mass situation provides the highest performance. To achieve superior efficiency of two-tank systems during the entire timespan, a time varying mass distribution χ=0.5(1+e-2t*) is proposed. Finally, the energy losses as well as the pumping effects on the performance of one- and two-tank systems are analyzed. It is found that, both, the pumping effects and the energy losses are generally negligible and the efficiency can be improved dividing the storage system, rather than increasing the mass flow rate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Constant heat extraction; Discharge efficiency; Exergy analysis; Multi-tank system; Thermal energy storage","Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Exergy; Extraction; Heat storage; Offshore pipelines; Thermal energy; Discharge efficiency; Exergy Analysis; Heat extraction; Operation parameters; Process efficiency; System configurations; Tank system; Thermal energy storage systems; Tanks (containers); exergy; theoretical study; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929575432

The developed technique does not require a sacrificial layer to accommodate the volumetric expansion of the PCMs on melting. The encapsulation consists of coating a non-reactive polymer over the PCM pellet followed by deposition of a metal layer by a novel non-vacuum metal deposition technique. The fabricated capsules have survived more than 2200 thermal cycles, which is equivalent to about seven years of service in a thermal energy storage system. Thermophysical properties of the PCMs were investigated by DSC/TGA, IR and weight change analysis. Thermal cycling test showed no significant degradation in these properties at any stage of testing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Encapsulation; Latent heat storage; Phase change materials; Thermal energy storage","Characterization; Deposition; Encapsulation; Energy storage; Heat storage; Latent heat; Storage (materials); Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Innovative techniques; Latent heat thermal energy storage systems; Macro-encapsulation; Non reactive polymers; Sacrificial layer; Thermal cycling test; Thermal energy storage systems; Volumetric expansion; Phase change materials; degradation; encapsulation; latent heat flux; melting; phase equilibrium; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929316925

From a system perspective, this introduces additional issues regarding demand and supply balancing and also creates the need for more balancing capacity. One of the best supplements to volatile wind nature is certainly hydro generation, especially in complement with pumped storage technology. Water can provide large backup capacity and flexibility to balance wind deviations. In this research short-run hydro-wind coordination is addressed and an approach based on the duality method of a convex programming is proposed, for valuing the impact of variable wind generation on the water shadow price of hydro generation. In such hydro-wind coordination, hydro generation is committed for the differences between the actual and forecasted wind generation. Obtaining water shadow prices is important for determining short-run marginal cost and economic feasibility assessment of this coordination. The proposed method solves short-run profit maximization, as its primal problem, and determines the values of limited hydro and wind resources, as its dual problem, using a linear programming approach. The coordination between the Vinodol hydropower plant and the Vrataruša wind farm in Croatia is presented as a case study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coordination; Hydropower; Water shadow price; Wind power","Convex optimization; Costs; Electric utilities; Hydroelectric power; Linear programming; Wind power; Coordination; Economic feasibility assessment; Forecasting methods; Hydropower; Profit maximization; Short run marginal costs; Variable generations; Water shadow prices; Hydroelectric generators; energy resource; feasibility study; forecasting method; linear programing; power generation; shadow pricing; technological change; volatilization; wind power; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929305652

Their controllable and excellent properties distinguish mesoporous carbons from traditional carbon materials in their synthetic route, adjustable specific surface area and channels, and even interfacial properties. The template carbonization method has been widely used for the synthesis of mesoporous carbons and corresponding composites and endows mesoporous carbon materials with an ordered pore arrangement, developed pore structure and mesoporosity. Novel mesoporous carbon materials with unprecedented control over their morphology, framework and rich composition have been obtained by employing various nanotechnologies.

The excellent electrical conductivity and interconnected macroporous framework of SGHs facilitate unconstrained electrolyte ion diffusion and electron transportation. Moreover, the surface confined redox reactions and fast kinetic feature of AZ molecules result in an outstanding electrochemical capacitive performance. In the three-electrode system, the AZ-functionalized SGHs (AZ-SGHs) electrodes exhibit a larger specific capacitance (as high as 350 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, two times higher than that of bare SGHs) and ultrahigh rate capability (61% capacitance retention at 200 A g-1) in aqueous electrolyte solutions. More importantly, when the resultant AZ-SGHs electrodes are integrated into a symmetric supercapacitor (SSC), the electrode material shows a good self-synergy and potential self-matching behavior due to two pairs of redox peaks with mirror symmetry. As a result, the AZ-SGHs SSC exhibits an excellent energy storage performance.

Reliability of Li-ion batteries used in these devices has been recognized as of high importance from a broad range of stakeholders, including medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, patients and physicians. To ensure a Li-ion battery operates reliably, it is important to develop health monitoring techniques that accurately estimate the capacity of the battery throughout its life-time. This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning method that utilizes the charge voltage and current measurements to estimate the capacity of a Li-ion battery used in an implantable medical device. Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is employed as a probabilistic kernel regression method to learn the complex dependency of the battery capacity on the characteristic features that are extracted from the charge voltage and current measurements. Owing to the sparsity property of RVM, the proposed method generates a reduced-scale regression model that consumes only a small fraction of the CPU time required by a full-scale model, which makes online capacity estimation computationally efficient. 10 years' continuous cycling data and post-explant cycling data obtained from Li-ion prismatic cells are used to verify the performance of the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To balance such hybrid systems, the rate of the redox component must be substantially comparative to the levels of the double layer process. As far as the insertion-host material TiNb2O7 is concerned, we have used facile step electrode design consisting of the physically assisted template infusion of Ti-Nb sol into the pores of AAO followed by in situ conversion into porous TiNb2O7 nanotubes within the AAO walls under calcination, and finally making those templates dissolve away.

Notably, the highest capacitance of DS-HCSs up to 381 F g-1 is higher than the capacitance reported so far for many carbon-based materials, which may be attributed to the high surface area, hollow structure, nitrogen functionalization, and double-shell architecture. These kinds of N-doped hollow-structured carbon spheres may show promising prospects as advanced energy storage materials and catalyst supports.

However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g-1), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).

Operating as the ""rocking-chair"" battery, sodium ion battery (SIB) with acceptable high capacity is a very promising energy storage technology. Layered vanadium oxide xerogel exhibits high sodium storage capacity. But it undergoes large lattice breathing during sodiation/desodiation, resulting in fast capacity fading. Herein, we develop a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize iron preintercalated vanadium oxide ultrathin nanobelts (Fe-VOx) with constricted interlayer spacing. Using the Fe-VOx as cathode for SIB, the lattice breathing during sodiation/desodiation is largely inhibited and the interlayer spacing is stabilized for reversible and rapid Na+ insertion/extraction, displaying enhanced cycling and rate performance.

Fabricating novel hybrid nanostructures is a promising approach to obtain a fast diffusion and transport process. In this study, a porous honeycomb-like iron fluoride hybrid composite comprising iron fluoride nanocrystals (∼1-4 nm) encapsulated in separate carbon nests constructed by multi-scale pores (∼1-100 nm) was fabricated through a combination of room-temperature fluorination and a mild annealing process for the first time. The iron fluoride topochemically evolved from a smaller iron oxide nanocrystal precursor (∼2-3 nm) is closely engineered with carbon creases nested in carbon microbubbles (CMBs) which exhibit a three dimensional (3D) porous honeycomb-like network structure. As a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the hybrid electrode delivers a large capacity of nearly 500 mA h g-1 at 20 mA g-1 (normalized to the composite, i.e. the capacity is calculated based on the total mass of the composite). Meanwhile, a durable cyclability of more than 500 cycles and a large rate of 10 A g-1 were also realized at room temperature. The impressive specific energy/power performance (1100 W h kg-1/224 W kg-1) which is superior to that of today's Li-ion batteries (∼380 W h kg-1/∼80 W kg-1) reveals the efficiency of the novel hybrid nanostructure in speeding up the kinetics without sacrificing the storage capability. Direct insights into the lithiation process reveal that iron fluoride firstly undergoes a mild amorphization process, and then crystallizes as γ-Fe nanocrystals after in-depth lithiation; during the de-lithiation process, γ-Fe firstly becomes amorphous due to the injection of fluorine, and subsequently evolves into double-salt-like LixFeFy nanocrystals for further fluorine enriching. Reversible conversion between C-Fe0/LiF and T-FeF2, like LixFe3+Fy with a 3 mole electron transfer, lasts for more than 100 cycles without any obvious re-distribution of the active materials. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Fluorine; Fluorine compounds; Honeycomb structures; Iron; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Nanocrystals; Nanostructures; Amorphization process; Conversion reactions; Hybrid nanostructures; Iron oxide nanocrystals; Li-storage properties; Lithiation process; Storage capability; Threedimensional (3-d); Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942887346

The oxygen electrode is the key component that determines the capacity and cycling performance of this type of battery. In this study, a Co3O4/mesoporous carbon composite (Co3O4/C) with a carbon content of 42 wt%, a rich mesoporous pore content and a homogeneous distribution of Co3O4 nanoparticles over the carbon surface was prepared using a facile silica template method with sucrose as the carbon source, and H3BO3 as an agent for expanding the space between the silica and carbon to impregnate and accommodate the Co3O4 precursor. This composite was used directly as the oxygen electrode in LOBs without additional conductive carbon additives. Galvano charge-discharge tests showed that the capacity of the composite electrode based on the mass of the mesoporous carbon reached approximately 4500 mA h gcarbon-1 at a current density of 123 mA gcarbon-1. The cell was further successfully run for over 200 discharge-charge cycles at a fixed current density of 246 mA gcarbon-1 and a trapped capacity of 740 mA h gcarbon-1, which indicated the superior electrochemical performance of the electrode. Different materials have been comparatively tested as oxygen electrodes, including Super P (SP), SP + nano Co3O4, carbon derived from KIT-6 (KIT-6-C), and the as-prepared Co3O4/C, among which the current Co3O4/C composite showed the best performance.

In this work, hierarchical ZnCo2O4/polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructures on Ni foam were rationally designed and successfully fabricated through a facile two-step method and were directly used as an integrated electrode for supercapacitors. The novel nanoscale morphology has been proven to be responsible for their excellent capacitive performance. When used as electrodes in supercapacitors, the hybrid nanostructures demonstrated prominent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance (1559 F g-1 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2), a good rate capability (89% when the current density increases from 2 to 20 mA cm-2), and a good cycling ability (90% of the initial specific capacitance remained after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 mA cm-2). Moreover, the high specific energy density is 30.9 W h kg-1 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode system. The excellent electrochemical performance of hierarchical ZnCo2O4/PPy nanostructures can be mainly ascribed to the enhanced adherent force between electrode materials and Ni foam to hold the electrode fragments together by means of ZnCo2O4 nanowires, the good electrical conductivity of PPy, and the short ion diffusion pathway in ordered porous PPy nanofilms and ZnCo2O4 nanowires. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Capacitance; Cobalt compounds; Current density; Electrochemical electrodes; Nanowires; Nickel; Supercapacitor; Zinc compounds; Capacitive performance; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; High current densities; High specific capacitances; Specific energy density; Supercapacitor electrodes; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941199821

The introduction of high-k nanomaterials into ferroelectric polymers has proven to be a promising strategy for the fabrication of high-k nanocomposites. One-dimensional large-aspect-ratio nanowires exhibit superiority in enhancing k values and energy density of polymer nanocomposites in comparison to their spherical counterparts. However, the impact of their intrinsic properties on the dielectric properties of polymer nanocomposites has been seldom investigated. Herein, four kinds of nanowires (Na2Ti3O7, TiO2, BaTiO3, and SrTiO3) with different inherent characteristics are elaborately selected to fabricate high-k ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. Dopamine functionalization facilitates the excellent dispersion of these nanowires in the ferroelectric polymer matrix because of the strong polymer/nanowire interfacial adhesion. A thorough comparative study on the dielectric properties and energy storage capability of the nanowires-based nanocomposites has been presented. The results reveal that, among the four types of nanowires, BaTiO3 NWs show the best potential in improving the energy storage capability of the proposed nanocomposites, resulting from the most signficant increase of k while retaining the rather low dielectric loss and leakage current. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","breakdown strength; dielectric constant; energy storage; leakage current; nanocomposite; nanowire","Aspect ratio; Barium compounds; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Energy storage; Ferroelectricity; Leakage currents; Nanowires; Permittivity; Breakdown strengths; Energy storage applications; Ferroelectric polymers; High dielectric constants; Inherent characteristics; Interfacial adhesions; Low dielectric loss; Polymer nanocomposite; Nanocomposites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939789271

Insufficient control of the hierarchal morphology of the blend has yielded a precipitous decline in breakdown strength at high BT nanoparticles volume fractions. Here, we demonstrate that breakdown strength and energy storage density can be increased up to higher value by creating uniform distribution of low content of BT nanoparticles in PVDF matrix. The dielectric properties of BT/PVDF nanocomposite were measured as a function of BT nanoparticles loading. The nanocomposite displayed a 150% increase in dielectric breakdown strength and energy density increased to more than triple that of the pure PVDF even at the 1 vol% BT nanoparticles loading. It was attributed to the uniform distribution of low content BT nanoparticles in PVDF matrix, which lead to superior dielectric breakdown strength and energy storage density than those of composites filled with high content of BT nanoparticles.

Here we study the potential of those batteries to be used in second-life applications to enable the expansion of intermittent renewable electricity supply in California through the year 2050. We develop and apply a parametric life-cycle system model integrating battery supply, degradation, logistics, and second-life use. We calculate and compare several metrics of second-life system performance, including cumulative electricity delivered, energy balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and energy stored on invested. We find that second-life use of retired PEV batteries may play a modest, though not insignificant, role in California's future energy system. The electricity delivered by second-life batteries in 2050 under base-case modeling conditions is 15 TWh per year, about 5% of total current and projected electricity use in California. If used instead of natural gas-fired electricity generation, this electricity would reduce GHG emissions by about 7 million metric tons of CO2e per year in 2050. © 2015, Elsevier B.V.

The two main approaches to obtain porous surfaces are the deposition of porous materials, like Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), and the modification of substrates, for example by dealloying. MOF layers have higher specific surface areas than dealloyed structures, but they are easily damaged by external forces. In this work, we report on the combination of dealloying and MOF deposition. The functionalised surfaces have a much higher specific surface area (circa 7000 m2 m-2) than the simple sum of the specific area of a MOF layer and a dealloyed one. Moreover, the MOF crystals are protected by the dealloyed structures and are not easily removed by an external force.

However, the low and direct current (DC) output from MFC is not usable for general electronics except small sensors, yet commercial DC-AC converters or inverters used in solar systems cannot be directly applied to MFCs. This study presents a new DC-AC converter system for MFCs that can generate alternating voltage in any desired frequency. Results show that AC power can be easily achieved in three different frequencies tested (1, 10, 60 Hz), and no energy storage layer such as capacitors was needed. The DC-AC converter efficiency was higher than 95% when powered by either individual MFCs or simple MFC stacks. Total harmonic distortion (THD) was used to investigate the quality of the energy, and it showed that the energy could be directly usable for linear electronic loads. This study shows that through electrical conversion MFCs can be potentially used in household electronics for decentralized off-grid communities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","AC power; DC-AC converter; Frequency; Microbial fuel cell","Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Fuel cells; Power converters; Wastewater treatment; Ac power; Alternating voltages; DC-AC converter; Electrical conversion; Energy storage layer; Frequency; Microbial fuel cells (MFCs); Total harmonic distortion (THD); Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939166405

The storage modulus (G′) of the multi-functional composite automatically increased 4 orders of magnitude when encountering external shear stimuli and the G′max was over 1 MPa, demonstrating an obvious shear stiffening effect and good safe-guarding performance. It was found that the electrical conductivity changed accordingly when shear stiffening occurred, therefore it can be applied as a force sensor during the attacking process. The rate-dependent piezoresistance effect of the composite was investigated. In quasi-static compression and high rate impact tests, different force signals can be obtained because of the negative and positive piezoresistivity effect. Self-healing tests indicated that the as-prepared composite can maintain its mechanical and electrical properties after destruction and healing treatments. Owing to the shear stiffening performance, the rate dependent conductive composite could both absorb impact energy and sense the attacking forces. Finally, a mechanism was proposed and it was believed that the glass transition induced by B-O interactions and the changes in the microstructure during the external action can be attributed to the S-ST performance and rate dependent electrical conductivity, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Carbon; Electric conductivity; Glass transition; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Polymer matrix composites; Self-healing materials; Yarn; Conductive composites; Electrical conductivity; Force sensitivity; Mechanical and electrical properties; Orders of magnitude; Piezoresistance effects; Quasi-static compression; Stiffening effect; Shear flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942928815

As batteries have transitioned from being used in portable electronics to being used in longer lifetime and more safety-critical applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and aircraft, the cost of failure has become more significant both in terms of liability as well as the cost of replacement. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis (FMMEA) provides a rigorous framework to define the ways in which lithium-ion batteries can fail, how failures can be detected, what processes cause the failures, and how to model failures for failure prediction. This enables a physics-of-failure (PoF) approach to battery life prediction that takes into account life cycle conditions, multiple failure mechanisms, and their effects on battery health and safety. This paper presents an FMMEA of battery failure and describes how this process enables improved battery failure mitigation control strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our main results include Bader charge analyses, hydrogen binding energies, and kinetic barriers for the hydrogen release reaction in the gas phase as well as in the solid. While the different substituents show varying effects on the kinetic barrier and desorption temperature, we identify Cu as a very promising substituent, which lowers the reaction barrier by approximately 38% compared to pure NH3BH3 resulting in a significantly reduced hydrogen desorption temperature. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binding energy; Desorption; Hydrogen; Desorption temperatures; Electronegative elements; Gravimetric density; Hydrogen binding; Hydrogen desorption temperatures; Hydrogen release; Protic hydrogens; Reaction barriers; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940867158

In this article, a highly-efficient electro/photo to heat conversion system of polyurethane@graphite foam (PU@GF) phase change composites was successfully fabricated through in situ polymerization of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in GF. The obtained PU presents solid-solid phase transition behavior that is different from the solid-liquid phase change of original PEG, which can prevent PU from leakage even if it was loaded in micrometer pores in the GF during application. On the other side, PU can improve the thermal stability and decrease the overcooling degree of the composites in effect. Excellent conductive network was provided by the GF, with which the light absorption and thermal conductivity of the composites were enhanced dramatically. Consequently, the solid-solid phase change composites can effectively store electricity or sunlight energy. The electro-heat storage efficiency of the composites can exceed 80% at 1.2 or 1.4. V, meanwhile, the photo-heat storage efficiency can close to 67% under simulated solar illumination. This result presents the highest efficiency for electro-to-heat conversion by PCMs techniques driven by a quite low voltage up to now, and will give rise to a new expectation of functional PCM application for energy conversion and storage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy conversion and storage; Graphite foam; Phase change material; Polyurethane","Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy conversion; Foams; Graphite; Heat storage; Light absorption; Polyurethanes; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Conductive networks; Energy conversion and storages; Graphite foam; In-situ polymerization; Solar illumination; Solid liquid phase change; Solid-solid phase transitions; Storage efficiency; Phase change materials; carbamate (ester); composite; efficiency measurement; energy conservation; foam; graphite; leakage; phase transition; polymer; polymerization; solar power; thermal conductivity; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936986173

This paper provides not only a critical review but also a thorough introduction to the analysis of heat transfer by borehole and foundation pile ground heat exchangers, with an emphasis on different analytical models. The literature is reviewed in a time-scale framework because of the diversity of the time and space scales involved in the thermal processes of ground heat exchangers. We summarize, discuss, and evaluate major advances in this field, including heat-source models, short-time models, models for energy piles, in situ thermal-response tests, indoor sandbox experiments, and parameter estimation as an inverse problem. Of particular note is that the unit-step temperature response (i.e., G-function) of a ground heat exchanger with one U-shaped pipe is calculated; and six analytical models are compared: an infinite cylinder-source model, two infinite line-source models, two finite line-source models, and a composite-medium line-source model.

However, to prevent simultaneous charging and discharging of an SLD, complementarity constraints should be included in the optimization model, which makes the problem strongly non-convex. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) methods are commonly used to solve such problems; however, this results in long solution time to achieve an approximate optimal solution. Therefore, a method to efficiently find optimal solutions of load-leveling problems with SLDs is desirable. Here, we report a load-leveling optimization model for a system with SLDs and show that the complementarity constraints can be exactly relaxed under two sufficient conditions so that a convex relaxed model can be solved instead. Moreover, the exactness of the relaxation can be determined prior to solving the relaxed model, and the sufficient conditions are usually satisfied in practical situations. The numerical studies verify the theoretical analysis and show that an equally good optimal solution of the load-leveling problem with SLDs can be obtained far more efficiently by using the proposed method than a commonly used MIP method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Complementarity constraint; Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Load leveling; Relaxation","Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Integer programming; Numerical methods; Optimal systems; Optimization; Approximate optimal solutions; Complementarity constraint; Energy storage systems; Load leveling; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Optimization modeling; Relaxation; Relaxation methods; Problem solving; complementarity; electric vehicle; mathematical analysis; optimization; storage; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928564449

Redox flow batteries have potential advantages to meet the stringent cost target for grid applications as compared to more traditional batteries based on an enclosed architecture. However, the manufacturing process and therefore potential high-volume production price of redox flow batteries is largely unquantified. We present a comprehensive assessment of a prospective production process for aqueous all vanadium flow battery and nonaqueous lithium polysulfide flow battery. The estimated investment and variable costs are translated to fixed expenses, profit, and warranty as a function of production volume. When compared to lithium-ion batteries, redox flow batteries are estimated to exhibit lower costs of manufacture, here calculated as the unit price less materials costs, owing to their simpler reactor (cell) design, lower required area, and thus simpler manufacturing process. Redox flow batteries are also projected to achieve the majority of manufacturing scale benefits at lower production volumes as compared to lithium-ion. However, this advantage is offset due to the dramatically lower present production volume of flow batteries compared to competitive technologies such as lithium-ion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the chemically functionalized CFP (f-CFP) consisting of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on its surface was produced by an oxidation reaction of CFP in a mixed concentrated acid solution of H2SO4:HNO3 (3:1 v/v) at 60 °C for 1 h. Other amide and amine groups modified CFP were also synthesized for comparison using a dehydration reaction of carboxylic modified CFP with ethylenediamine and n-butylamine. Interestingly, it was found that hydroxyl and carboxylic groups modified CFP behave as a pseudocapacitor electrode, which can store charges via the surface redox reaction in addition to electrochemical double layer capacitance. The aqueous-based supercapacitor of f-CFP has high areal, volumetric, and specific energy (49.0 μW.h/cm2, 1960 mW.h/L, and 5.2 W.h/Kg) and power (3.0 mW/cm2, 120 W/L, and 326.2 W/Kg) based on the total geometrical surface area and volume as well as the total weight of positive and negative electrodes. High charge capacity of the f-CFP stems from high ionic charge and pseudocapacitive behavior due to hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on its surface and high bulk electronic conductivity (2.03 mS/cm) due to 1D carbon fiber paper. The acid treatment process here could be used to improve the charge storage capacity of other carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","a single coin supercapacitor; Functionalized carbon fibers; Pseudocapacitors; Supercapacitors; Surface modification","Capacitors; Carbon fibers; Dehydration; Diffusion in gases; Electric conductivity; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Fibers; Fuel cells; Hydrophobicity; Ion exchange; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Redox reactions; Surface chemistry; Surface treatment; Yarn; Charge storage capacity; Double-layer capacitance; Electronic conductivity; Functionalized; Organic functional groups; Pseudocapacitive behavior; Pseudocapacitors; Super capacitor; Surface reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937798370

In this paper, by introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we successfully converted the commercial cotton fabric into free-standing, electrically conductive and electrochemically active fabric. Flexible supercapacitor based on the obtained conductive reduced graphene oxide-carbonized cotton fabric (rGO/CCF) exhibits high capacitance (87.53 mF cm-2 at 2 mV s-1), well cycling stability (89.82% capacitance retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles) and excellent electrochemical stability (90.5% capacitance retention after 100 bending cycles). Moreover, a macroscopic three-dimensional sandwich-interdigital device structure was designed to enhance the supercapacitor performance. The unique rGO/CCF based sandwich-interdigital structure (SIS) supercapacitor shows a volumetric capacitance of 5.53 F cm-3 at current density of 0.0625 A cm-3 in aqueous electrolyte, which is 1.67 and 4.28 orders higher than the traditional sandwich structure (SS) and interdigital structure (IS) supercapacitor based on the same electrode material and electrolyte.

The thermodynamic stability, transport properties of the carriers and the lithium diffusion mechanisms of LiFeSO4F compounds are calculated by using the first principles computation. According to the calculated formation enthalpies and electronic properties, it can be concluded that both LiFeSO4F and delithiated FeSO4F have high thermodynamic stability during cycling. Band structure analysis reveals that the conduction and valence bands that are mainly composed of Fe3d states are rather localized, leading to large band gaps and effective masses of the carriers. LiFeSO4F and FeSO4F thus exhibit poor electronic conductivities. To improve the electronic conductance of the materials, introduction of delocalized states in the band gap region via doping or nano-crystallization of the electrode material is still necessary. Further investigations on lithium diffusion dynamics suggest that suitable amounts of lithium vacancies at the 2i sites are particularly crucial. Under high lithium concentration conditions, these vacancies are very helpful to initiate the transfer of lithium into the empty positions by eliminating the Li-Li repulsions and then activate the diffusion of lithium through the channels. While under low lithium concentration conditions, they can act as intermediate sites effectively for several high-speed diffusion channels. As the calculated activation energies for the possible diffusion paths (0.185-0.563 eV) are very small, LiFeSO4F and FeSO4F thus show excellent ionic conductance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Activation energy; Binary alloys; Cathodes; Diffusion; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Fluorine compounds; Iron compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanocrystallization; Thermodynamic stability; Transport properties; Band structure analysis; Cath-ode materials; Computation methods; Diffusion channels; Electrode material; Electronic conductance; Electronic conductivity; Formation enthalpy; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942798857

The characterizations of structure and morphology reveal that the gadolinium doped and carbon-coated ultrathin LTO nanosheets have high crystallinity with a thickness of about 10 nm. Gadolinium doping allows the spinel LTO products to be stabilized, thereby preserving the precursor's sheet morphology and single crystal structure. Carbon encapsulation serves dual functions by restraining crystal growth of the LTO primary nanoparticles in the LTO-Gd-C nanosheets and decreasing the external electron transport resistance. Owing to the synergistic effects rendered by ultrathin nanosheets with high crystallinity, gadolinium doping and carbon coating, the developed ultrathin LTO nanosheets possess excellent specific capacity, cycling performance, and rate capability compared with reference materials, when evaluated as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

The presence of pores increased available surface area of the stacked graphene sheets available for ion adsorption and double layer formation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirms the presence of pores and reveals filler orientation around porous regions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) show an increase in specific capacitance from 39 F g-1 to 133 F g-1 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows significant decrease in bulk resistance and a 100% increase in theoretical porosity when tested in 0.4 M potassium hexaflorophosphate VI (KPF6)/propylene carbonate electrolyte solution. Shifts in imide peaks to lower wave numbers in Raman and Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) suggests presence of chemical interaction between filler and matrix confirming uniform dispersion of fillers in the material. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows thermal stability for the composite systems at temperatures above 700°C. The material is investigated for use in super capacitor applications especially in devices which require high end-use temperatures. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Cyclic voltammetry; Dispersions; Fillers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fracture; Graphene; Porosity; Resins; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectroscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Carbonate electrolytes; Chemical interactions; Double layer formation; Fourier transform spectroscopy; Polyimide composites; Selective decomposition; Specific capacitance; Uniform dispersions; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939188473

The proposed technology is able to store and release energy from redox chemical looping reactions combined with calcium looping. This process uses Fe3O4 and CaO, two low cost and environmentally friendly materials, while CH4 + CO2 serve as feed. During the reduction of Fe3O4 by CH4, both formation of carbon and metallic iron occur. CO2 acts as mediation gas to facilitate the metal/metal oxide redox reaction and carbon gasification into CO. CaO, on the other hand, is used for storage of CO2. Upon temperature rise, CaCO3 releases CO2, which re-oxidizes the carbon deposits and reduced Fe, thus producing carbon monoxide. The amount of produced CO is higher than the theoretical amount for Fe3O4, because carbon deposits from CH4 equally contribute to the CO yield. After each redox cycle, the material is regenerated, so that it can be used repeatedly, providing a stable process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, most reported ASCs (particularly for cobalt/nickel-based materials) always deviate from ideal capacitive behavior. In the present work, Co(OH)2 nanosheets arrays (NAs) are directly loaded on Ni mesh (Co(OH)2 NAs@Ni) via electrodeposition, while coral-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are successfully grown on Ni mesh (CNTs@Ni) through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Using Co(OH)2 NAs@Ni as positive electrode and CNTs@Ni as negative electrode, a novel ASC has been successfully fabricated. Due to the merits of in-situ growth for active materials, the highly-conductive Ni mesh current collector and the positive synergistic effect between the positive and negative electrodes, our Co(OH)2 NAs@Ni//CNTs@Ni ASC exhibits excellent capacitive behavior, which is quite similar to RuO2·xH2O-based supercapacitors. Notably, even when the scan rate rise up to 1 V s-1, the CV curve of the ASC device can still retains an inspiring quasi-rectangle shape from 0 to 1.5 V.

To date, some Na-storage anode materials have achieved long life span, but the rate performance still remains insufficient. Herein, we show that in some linear ether-based electrolytes, graphite can not only render unprecedented cyclability (∼6000 cycles), but also exhibit ultrahigh rate capability (up to 10 A g-1), along with a reversible capacity of ∼110 mAh g-1. By combining electrochemical measurements and structural analysis (e.g. in situ Raman and ex situ XRD measurements), we reveal that graphite undergoes a stage-evolution mechanism induced by the insertion of solvated sodium ions. Furthermore, kinetic studies have shown that this process accompanies with an intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior, which should be responsible for the obtained superior electrode properties. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A three dimensional numerical model of the novel flow battery with a flow through electrode has been developed. The electric current density and the ion current density along the electrode thickness under different specific areas and different electrode conductivities are analyzed, accounting for the electrode thickness effect on the cell performance. It can be concluded that six layers of carbon paper is the most appropriate electrode thickness. More than six layers of carbon paper provides more surface area at the expense of higher ohmic resistance, which is not appropriate. Less carbon paper cannot provide enough specific active area. The flow fields in the x direction and z direction are analyzed to account for the electric current density distribution. The high current density at the junction of the land and channel for the flow through electrode cell is related to the flow field in z direction. The simulation results are well-fitted for the experiment data. In addition, we improve the previously existing electrolyte conductivity calculation model and demonstrate that accurate electrolyte conductivity values are required for accurate modeling of the experiment. The model is validated using data obtained from combining a quinone/hydroquinone couple with a Br2/Br- redox couple flow battery system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The main obstacle hampers SnO2 from practical application is the pulverization problem caused by drastic volume change (∼300%) during lithium-ion insertion or extraction, which would lead to the loss of electrical conductivity, unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and consequently severe capacity fading in the cycling. Here, we anchored the SnO2 nanocrystals into three dimensional graphene gel network to tackle this problem. As a result of the three dimensional (3-D) architecture, the huge volume change during cycling was tolerated by the large free space in this 3-D construction, resulting in a high capacity of 1090 mAh g-1 even after 200 cycles. What's more, at a higher current density 5 A g-1, a reversible capacity of about 491 mAh g-1 was achieved with this electrode. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anode material; Lithium-ion batteries; Three dimensional graphene framework; Tin dioxide nanocrystals; Void space","Anodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Secondary batteries; Solid electrolytes; Tin; Tin dioxide; Anode material; Electrical conductivity; High-performance anodes; Lithium ion insertion; Solid electrolyte interphase; Three-dimensional graphene; Threedimensional (3-d); Void space; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936818706

To utilize this unique property to regulate oxygen-involved reactions, it is crucial to match the oxygen release-intake equilibrium with targeted reaction conditions. Here we perform a comprehensive investigation of the strategy of tuning the oxygen storage property of Ca2MnAlO5 through chemical doping. For undoped Ca2MnAlO5+δ, our first-principles calculation predicts that the equilibrium temperature at a pressure of 1 atm of O2 is 848 K, which is in excellent agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, the doping of alkaline earth ions at the Ca site, trivalent ions at the Al site, and 3d transition metal ions at the Mn site is analyzed. By the doping of 12.5% of Ga, V, and Ti, the equilibrium temperature shifts to high values by approximately 110-270 K, while by the doping of 12.5% of Fe, Sr, and Ba, the equilibrium temperature is lowered by approximately 20-210 K. The doping of these elements is thermodynamically stable, and doping other elements including Mg, Sc, Y, Cr, Co, and Ni generates metastable compounds. The doping of a higher content of Fe, however, lowers the oxygen storage capacity. Finally, on the basis of our calculated data, we prove that the formation energetics of nondilute interacting oxygen vacancy in doped Ca2MnAlO5.5 scale linearly with a simple descriptor, the oxygen p-band position relative to the Fermi level. The higher-oxygen p-band position leads to a lower vacancy formation energy and thus a lower oxygen release temperature. Understanding such a relationship between fundamental quantum chemical properties and macroscopic properties paves the road to the design and optimization of novel functional oxides. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","brownmillerite; Ca2MnAlO5.5; Ca2MnAlO5; chemical doping; oxygen storage material","Alkalinity; Aluminum compounds; Calcium compounds; Calculations; Digital storage; Highway planning; Manganese compounds; Metal ions; Nickel compounds; Oxygen; Quantum chemistry; Storage (materials); Transition metals; Brownmillerites; Ca2MnAlO5; Ca2MnAlO5.5; Chemical doping; Oxygen storage materials; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936866940

The macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was prepared by incorporation of paraffin into porous LWAs through vacuum impregnation. The sealing performance of the epoxy was evaluated by thermal cycling test while the thermal conductivity of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWAs was improved by incorporating different percentages of graphite powder into epoxy. The chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and reliability of macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was also determined. Finally, the compressive strength and thermal performance of concrete containing macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was evaluated. Test results showed that the maximum percentage of paraffin absorbed by LWA was 70%. The thermal conductivity of the macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA with 15% graphite powder was 162% higher than that of epoxy. Moreover, the developed macro-encapsulated paraffin-LWA was found to be chemically compatible, thermally stable and reliable (did not show any sign of degradation below 150. °C and sustained 1000 cycles of melting and freezing) and it has high latent heat storage capacity (102.5.

Here we report a simple sol-gel method for facile synthesis of TiO2/CNTs hybrid. The porous anatase TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly coated on the CNTs conducting network, which leads to remarkably improved electrochemical performances such as exceptional cycling stability, good high rate durability, and reduced resistance. This hybrid exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 200 mA·h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 as an anode in lithium-ion battery (LIB). As a supercapacitor (SC), it shows a specific supercapacitance of 145 F g-1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, higher than that of the previously reported TiO2 based supercapacitors. Moreover, this hybrid also exhibits excellent durability after 1000 cycles for both LIBs and SCs. Such superior performance and cycling durability demonstrate the reinforced synergistic effects between the porous TiO2 and interweaved CNTs network, indicating a great application potential for such hybrid materials in high power LIBs and SCs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This controller consisted of an ice bank model, an air temperature forecast model and an optimisation algorithm. The financial and grid utilisation benefits produced by implementation of this controller over the current state of the art in ice bank load shifting control was tested in a day ahead real time electricity pricing forecast environment. This hypothetical real time electricity price was based on the cost of electricity in the Irish wholesale market. Multiple ice bank charge levels were simulated in order to quantity the performance of two control methods for varying operating conditions. First, the ""standard controller"" was based on the current modus operandi for ice bank systems where Ice was generated for food cooling at night when the off-peak electricity tariff is available (00:00-08:00. h). Second, the ""upgraded controller"" was developed as a bespoke Demand Side Management control system for food refrigeration in a future electricity pricing environment. It consisted of a dual function load shifting optimisation algorithm, an ice bank model, and a predictive air temperature model. A preliminary study was also carried out to test the robustness of the controller's performance in an uncertain real time electricity pricing forecast scenario. Both economic and grid management benefits were found by simulating the operation of the cold thermal storage load shifting controller in a forecasted day ahead real time electricity pricing environment. The energy savings achieved for 100% ice bank charge were low, but as the desired charge level was reduced to 75%, 50% and 25% the savings potential increased.

The CCC process consumes less energy than chemical and physical absorption processes and has an energy storage capability that shifts the parasitic loss of the CCC process away from peak hours. The CCC process responds rapidly to the variation of electricity demand and has a time constant that is consistent with the intermittent supply from renewable power sources. The hybrid system of conventional and renewable power generation units and the CCC process are optimized in this investigation.

In gasoline-powered vehicles, the use of air-conditioning is known to result in higher emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants apart from decreasing the gas-mileage. On the other hand, for electric vehicles (EVs), a drain in the onboard electric battery due to the operation of heating and cooling system results in a substantial decrease in the driving range. As an alternative to the conventional climate control system, we are developing an adsorption-based thermal battery (ATB), which is capable of storing thermal energy, and delivering both heating and cooling on demand, while requiring minimal electric power supply. Analogous to an electrical battery, the ATB can be charged for reuse. Furthermore, it promises to be compact, lightweight, and deliver high performance, which is desirable for mobile applications. In this study, we describe the design and operation of the ATB-based climate control system. We present a general theoretical framework to determine the maximum achievable heating and cooling performance using the ATB. The framework is then applied to study the feasibility of ATB integration in EVs, wherein we analyze the use of NaX zeolite-water as the adsorbent-refrigerant pair.

The exploitation of these advantageous properties for use in energy storage is, however, conditioned by the effective utilization of the available surface area and the effective combination of 2D-nanosheets holding complementary properties. In this work, a 2D graphene-manganese oxide nanosheet hybrid, in which graphene was interleaved between manganese oxide nanosheets, was synthesized following a novel single-step liquid-phase co-exfoliation method. This active material was used to manufacture supercapacitor electrodes using a scalable spray deposition method. The interleaving of graphene between manganese oxide nanosheets enabled a better use of the pseudocapacitive properties of the manganese oxide nanosheets (the hybrid was tested in a 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte) achieving a geometric capacitance of 80 mF cm-2 (single electrode), volumetric capacitances of 300 F cm-3 (single electrode) and 40.9 F cm-3 (symmetric device), and volumetric energy and power of 5.5 mWh cm-3 and 2,193.1 mW cm-3 (symmetric device), respectively. This performance is promising in the context of micro-supercapacitor applications, where performance per unit area and per unit volume are relevant for miniaturization.

In this work, we studied the influence of internal and external factors, including mechanical pressure, temperature, electrolyte concentration and loaded voltage on the performance parameters, especially on the ESR and specific capacitance for carbon supercapacitor. The results indicate that the ESR is mainly contributed from the interface between electrolyte and electrode. In addition, we found that the ESR can be significantly lowered by mechanical pressures from 11 ohm at 0 N to 1 ohm at 800 N by decreasing 90%, and in consequence, the specific capacitance of supercapacitor can be improved dramatically from 19.34 F/g to 44.87 F/g by increasing 128%. Basing on the model of interface with a diffusion layer, we put forward a reasonable explanation for the variation of ESR and specific capacitance with the four factors of pressure, temperature, electrolyte concentration and loaded voltage. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon electrode material; Energy storage; Equivalent serial resistance; Mechanical pressure; Supercapacitors","Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Carbon electrode; Carbon supercapacitors; Electrolyte concentration; Equivalent serial resistances; Internal and external factors; Mechanical pressure; Performance parameters; Super capacitor; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934957266

Herein, we develop an intriguing dual-templating co-assembly/hydrothermal approach to realize nanostructure engineering in OMCs with various types of mesopores from three-dimensional (3D) cubic (OMCNW-c) to 2D hexagonal mesopores (OMCNW-h) and 0D mesoporous carbon nanospheres (OMC-S) for their electrochemical performance optimization in supercapacitors and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). The results show that OMCNW-c exhibits a specific capacitance of 215 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, higher than those of OMCNW-h and OMC-S, good capability and excellent cycling performance with no capacity fading even after 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, OMCNW-c shows much better electrocatalytic activity for ORR than OMCNW-h and OMC-S. The present investigations give strong evidence that tuning mesopore type of OMCs can contribute another important factor in enhancing catalysis and energy storage.

Here, inexpensive textile weaved by natural flax fiber is selected as raw material in preparing flexible and binder-free electrode material for supercapacitors. Although carbon fiber cloth obtained from the direct carbonization of flax textile exhibits a low specific capacitance of 0.78 F g-1, carbon fiber cloth electrode shows a very short relaxation time of 39.1 m s and good stability with almost 100% capacitance retaining after 104 cycles at 5 A g-1.

This study focused on the understanding of the synergistic effect of the V2O5@PPy nanocomposites as well as the individual role of each component on electrochemical properties. To explore the cooperative effects of individual functional materials, a classic model was applied to the V2O5@PPy nanocomposites for the first time to simulate and analyze the partitioned contributions from the electric double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance of the V2O5@PPy nanocomposites with various PPy coating amounts. The optimal ratio of PPy to V2O5 was determined to be ∼40% where the sum of the polymer's electric double-layer (EDL) capacitance and the layered oxide's subsurface Faradic capacitance could be maximized. It was also observed that overloading of PPy on V2O5 nanofibers could cause shear cracks in the nanocomposites due to localized condensation and thus cause internal stress between the electroactive materials and current collector. The resulting mechanical integration breakdown therefore restrained the overall performances of electrodes.

High quality graphene grown on NF makes the surface more suitable for deposition of 3D porous NCH and simultaneously enhances the electrode conductivity. The 3D structure can improve the electron transport ability and increase the contact of the active sites with electrolyte. The morphology and electrochemical performance of NCH/G/NF electrodes can be readily manipulated by adjusting the deposition current density and the Ni-Co ratio of the deposition solution. High capacitance with enhanced stability and rate capability is achieved and is attributed to the synergetic effect of the above factors. Specifically, at the deposition current density of 0.625 mA cm-2 and Ni-Co ratio of 1:1, the NCH11/G/NF electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 1410 F g-1 at 2 A g-1. When the current density increases to 4 A g-1, the capacitance is still 1328 F g-1 with a high capacitance retention of 94.2%. After 2500 cycles, the capacitance retention is 92.1%, which is higher than that of a common slurry-coated electrode. To research its practical applications, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated with a NCH11/G/NF electrode as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode.

In this work, we propose a strategy of lower valence-state doping for ramsdellite-MnO2 to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are effective to improve the conductivity and activity of ramsdellite-MnO2. Using DFT + U calculations, we find out that the formation energies of oxygen vacancies both in the bulk and on the surface of ramsdellite-MnO2 are decreased apparently after Zn doping. Notably, the surface oxygen vacancies could form spontaneously without any other impetus. In addition, the bulk Zn dopants will provide the enhanced electrons diffusion to the surface, and the positive surface oxygen vacancies will draw the electrons to the reaction sites. In the reaction sites, the oxygen vacancies and reduced Mn ions will improve the activity of the electrode reactions.

Recent advances in flow chemistries are enabling significantly higher energy density flow electrodes. When the same battery chemistry can arguably be used in either a flow or static electrode design, the relative merits of either design choice become of interest. Here, we analyze the costs of the electrochemically active stack for both architectures under the constraint of constant energy efficiency and charge and discharge rates, using as case studies the aqueous vanadium-redox chemistry, widely used in conventional flow batteries, and aqueous lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP)/lithium-titanium-phosphate (LTP) suspensions, an example of a higher energy density suspension-based electrode. It is found that although flow batteries always have a cost advantage ($ kWh-1) at the stack level modeled, the advantage is a strong function of flow electrode energy density. For the LFP/LTP case, the cost advantages decreases from ∼50% to ∼10% over experimentally reasonable ranges of suspension loading. Such results are important input for design choices when both battery architectures are viable options. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cost model; Electrochemistry; Flow battery; Lithium iron phosphate; Lithium titanium phosphate; Vanadium","Architecture; Chemical analysis; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Battery chemistries; Charge and discharge; Cost modeling; Electrode design; Higher energy density; Lithium iron phosphates; Performance based; Titanium phosphate; Suspensions (fluids)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931292088

In this work, multi-dimensional hybrid materials of nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) nanorods/nanosheets on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared by electrospinning technique combined with one-step solution co-deposition method. Carbon nanofiber membranes were obtained by electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) followed by pre-oxidation and carbonization. The successful growth of Ni-Co LDH with different morphologies on CNF membrane by using two kinds of auxiliary agents reveals the simplicity and universality of this method. The uniform and immense growth of Ni-Co LDH on CNFs significantly improves its dispersion and distribution. Meanwhile the hierarchical structure of carbon nanofiber@nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanorods/nanosheets (CNF@Ni-Co LDH NR/NS) hybrid membranes provide not only more active sites for electrochemical reaction but also more efficient pathways for electron transport. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements reveal high specific capacitances of 1378.2 F g-1 and 1195.4 F g-1 (based on Ni-Co LDH mass) at 1 A g-1 for CNF@Ni-Co LDH NR and CNF@Ni-Co LDH NS hybrid membranes, respectively. Moreover, cycling stabilities for both hybrid membranes are significantly enhanced compared with those of Ni-Co LDH NR and NS powders.

Regardless of the materials used, the architecture of electrodes is crucial for charge transport efficiency and electrochemical interactions. This report provides a critical review of the prototype architectural design and micro- and nano-material properties designated to electrodes of LIBs and SCs. An alternative classification criterion is proposed that divides reported hierarchical architectures into two categories: aligned and unaligned structures. The structures were evaluated and it was found that the aligned architectures are superior to the unaligned in the following characteristics: 1) highly-organized charger pathways, 2) tunable interspaces between architecture units, and 3) good electric-contacted current collectors prepared along with electrodes.

In this paper, the effect of various aspects of material selection and processing of proton exchange membranes on the operation of the Br2/H2 redox flow cell is determined. Membrane properties have a significant impact on the performance and efficiency of the system. In particular, there is a tradeoff between conductivity and crossover, where conductivity limits system efficiency at high current density and crossover limits efficiency at low current density. The impact of thickness, pretreatment procedure, swelling state during cell assembly, equivalent weight, membrane reinforcement, and addition of a microporous separator layer on this tradeoff is assessed. NR212 (50 μm) pretreated by soaking in 70 C water is found to be optimal for the studied operating conditions. For this case, an energy efficiency of greater than 75% is achieved for current density up to 400 mA cm-2, with a maximum obtainable energy efficiency of 88%. A cell with this membrane was cycled continuously for 3164 h. Membrane transport properties, including conductivity and bromine and water crossover, were found to decrease moderately upon cycling but remained higher than those for the as-received membrane. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, the continuous graphene shell may enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrodes and thus facilitate current collection and charge transfer associated with lithium storage. Second, the unique shell structure may suppress the aggregation of the core TMO particles while the void space between the core and shell may accommodate the large volume changes of the core during charge-discharge cycling, which enhances electrode stability against cycling. Third, the high specific surface area may improve the accessibility of active electrode materials to the electrolyte, which could effectively reduce the solid-state diffusion length and thus enhance Li ion transport and rate capability.

The further development of electrode materials with high capacity and excellent rate capability presents a great challenge for advanced lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a battery-capacitive synchronous lithium storage mechanism based on a scrupulous design of TiC/NiO core/shell nanoarchitecture, in which the TiC nanowire core exhibits a typical double-layer capacitive behavior, and the NiO nanosheet shell acts as active materials for Li+ storage. The as-constructed TiC/NiO (32 wt % NiO) core/shell nanoarchitecture offers high overall capacity and excellent cycling ability, retaining above 507.5 mAh g-1 throughout 60 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1 (much higher than theoretical value of the TiC/NiO composite). Most importantly, the high rate capability is far superior to that of NiO or other metal oxide electrode materials, owing to its double-layer capacitive characteristics of TiC nanowire and intrinsic high electrical conductivity for facile electron transport during Li+ storage process. Our work offers a promising approach via a rational hybridization of two electrochemical energy storage materials for harvesting high capacity and good rate performance. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","core/shell nanoarchitecture; lithium storage mechanism; lithium-ion batteries; metal oxides; titanium carbide","Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electron transport properties; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Metals; Nanowires; Secondary batteries; Storage (materials); Titanium carbide; Titanium oxides; Advanced lithium-ion batteries; Capacitive characteristics; Electrochemical energy storage; High electrical conductivity; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; Lithium storages; Metal oxides; Nano-architecture; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935886366

The research work focused on the structure of ionic liquids on charged surfaces is technologically-important for the development of new applications and in the upward of the existing ones, such electrodeposition or energy storage and conversion. Understanding EDL property will allow maximizing the specific capacitance, which in turn leads to higher energy and powering densities of the devices. The electronic interactions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate) [C4MIM][FAP] ionic liquid with Hg, Au, Pt and GC were assessed in order to get a fundamental understanding of the electrical double layer microscopic structure and its intrinsic properties at electrode/IL interface. Ionic liquids containing the [FAP]- anion exhibit a strong hydrophobic nature and wider electrochemical window than previously used ionic liquids and a good electrochemical stability. The magnitude and shape of C(E) curves revealed different orientations of the cation when the nature of the substrate is changed. The predominantly hydrophobic interactions of the imidazolium hydrocarbon chains with the Hg are traduced by the camel shape type curve. In contrast, the low and nearly constant C(E) values obtained for Au electrode point to the interfacial structure being dominated by the electrostatic π-stacking of the imidazolium ring/electrode interaction with the aromatic ring adopting an orientation more parallel to the surface. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They intrinsically have high gravimetric capacity (although low volumetric) and are typically inexpensive, since they are composed of abundant elements (i.e. C, N, O, and S). However, OSCs, specifically thiolate-containing OSCs generally suffer from slow charge transfer kinetics. To mitigate the charge transfer limitations, conducting polymers (CPs) such as poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) have been employed as electrocatalysts. In this manuscript, we have covalently modified a PEDOT film with an OSC (i.e. 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole di-lithium salt (Li2DMcT)). We have developed a synthetic strategy that employs, for the first time, a post-polymerization modification reaction as a tractable and viable technique to modify organic materials for EES electrodes. Electrochemical characterization, via cyclic voltammetry showed the expected pseudocapacitive response of PEDOT with the superimposed faradaic processes of the covalently bound DMcT. Moreover, spectroscopic characterization using Raman spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights into the electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, we electropolymerized films onto coin-cell electrodes and tested them in half-cell configurations and found that the capacity retention of the films was significantly enhanced, when compared with the PEDOT/DMcT composites (mixed but not covalently bound). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The SnO2NC particles are well accreted on the surfaces of 1D carbon fibers and 2D ultrathin carbon sheets while maintaining 3D interconnected pores of the carbon matrices for fast ionic transport. The SnO2NC@CFP hybrid electrode exhibits long-term higher energy density than the commercial graphite anode, and excellent rate capability, mainly due to good dispersion of SnO2 in the multidimensional conductive carbon. In particular, the reversible deformation of the flexible fibrous carbon matrices, as inferred from in situ Raman spectroscopy and SEM image analysis, facilitates stress release from the active SnO2NCs during discharge-charge cycling while maintaining the structural integrity of the self-supported SnO2NC@CFP anode.

Polymer colloids (10-14 nm) are obtained by time-controlled polymerization of phloroglucinol and terephthalaldehyde (P/T). UMCNs with ultramicropores in the inner core and abundant micropores in the outer shell are fabricated by the copolymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde (R/F) on the surfaces of P/T colloids with the presence of ammonia, followed by carbonization and further KOH activation. The as-prepared UMCNs have an adjustable diameter (52-74 nm) and a high specific surface area (up to 2156 m2 g-1). Inter-particle mesoporosity among UMCNs creates ion buffer reservoirs and reduces the ion diffusion distance, while micropores offer highly efficient ion channels and also show high capability for charge accumulation.

The FTIR and XRD results indicate that the phase change material n-dodecanol is encapsulated in the GO/PMF composite shell, and there is no chemical reaction between them. The SEM results show that the prepared GO-modified PMF microPCMs are spherical particles with a smooth surface. The DSC results indicate that the phase change temperature and the latent heat of microPCMs with 1 wt% of GO are 26.40 °C and 125.2 J g-1, respectively. The thermal conductivity of GO/microPCMs with 4 wt% GO increases by 66.29%, compared with that of microPCMs without GO according to the TCA results. Moreover, the thermal cycling tests show that the prepared microPCMs possess a good thermal stability. The GO-modified PMF microPCMs are sure to have great potential applications in thermal energy storage. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Atomic force microscopy; Differential scanning calorimetry; Encapsulation; Energy storage; Formaldehyde; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphene; Heat storage; Melamine formaldehyde resins; Phase change materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; X ray diffraction; Composite shell; Graphene oxides; In-situ polymerization; Melamine formaldehyde; Phase change temperature; Spherical particle; Thermal constant; Thermal cycling test; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930199694

It is highly desirable to improve the integration level and minimize unnecessary energy loss in the power-management circuits between energy harvesting and storage devices. In our work, we integrate a PVDF film into a supercapacitor as both the separator and the energy harvester. The double-sides of the polarized PVDF films are coated with H2SO4/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) gel electrolyte. Functionalized carbon cloths are assembled with H2SO4/PVA electrolyte as both anode and cathode, forming a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor. Externally mechanical impacts establish a piezoelectric potential across the PVDF films, and drive ions in the electrolyte to migrate towards the interface of the supercapacitor electrode, storing the electricity in the form of electrochemical energy. The asymmetric output characteristic of the piezoelectric PVDF film under mechanical impact results in the effective charging of the supercapacitor without any rectification device.

Under sodium catalysis, the abundant carbon atoms produced by the fast decomposition of solvothermal intermediate self-assembled to graphene. The existence of abundant ether bonds may be favorable for 3D graphene formation. More importantly, GFs were successfully obtained using acetic acid as the carbon source in the synthetic process, suggesting the reasonability of analyzing the formation mechanism. It is quite possible to determine more favorable routes to synthesize graphene under this cognition. The electrochemical energy storage capacity of GFs was also studied, which revealed a high supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 310.7 F/g at the current density of 0.2 A/g. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","alcohol-sodium; formation mechanism; graphene; pyrolysis; solvothermal","Carbon; Caustic soda; Pyrolysis; Sodium; Electrochemical energy storage; Evolution mechanism; Fast decomposition; Formation mechanism; Solvothermal; Specific capacitance; Stacking interaction; Synthetic process; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930677533

One important task for a BMS is to estimate the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) of a battery. The correlation between battery open circuit voltage (OCV) and SoC is an important reference for state estimation. The OCV-SoC correlation changes with respect to battery degradation. To improve the accuracy of state estimation, it is important to have the OCV-SoC correlation updated periodically. This work presents a solution by proposing a novel SoH(SoC) correlation as part of the battery equivalent circuit model (ECM). On-line optimization of SoH(SoC) correlation implicitly optimizes the OCV(SoC) correlation, as well as the capacity of a battery. An associated state and parameter dual estimator is proposed incorporating an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as a state observer, Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm as an internal resistance identifier, and Parameter Varying Approach as the SoH(SoC) correlation identifier. Battery experiment and simulation results validate that updating the SoH-SoC correlation effectively tracks battery SoH on-line. Furthermore, it implicitly updates OCV(SoC) function, further improving SoC estimation accuracy by 0.5%∼3%. © 2015, Elsevier B.V.

Systems aspects such as shunt current losses, pumping losses and various flow patterns through electrodes are accounted for. The system cost minimizing objective function determines stack design by optimizing the state of charge operating range, along with current density and current-normalized flow. The model cost estimates are validated using 2-kW stack performance data for the same size electrodes and operating conditions. Using our validated tool, it has been demonstrated that an optimized all-vanadium system has an estimated system cost of < $350 kWh-1 for 4-h application. With an anticipated decrease in component costs facilitated by economies of scale from larger production volumes, coupled with performance improvements enabled by technology development, the system cost is expected to decrease to 160 kWh-1 for a 4-h application, and to $100 kWh-1 for a 10-h application.

PVA-H2SO4-HQ and PVA-H2SO4-MB GPEs worked on the sides of the positive and negative electrodes of the supercapacitor, respectively. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor with optimized PVA-H2SO4-HQ and PVA-H2SO4-MB GPEs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. After the introduction of HQ and MB, the supercapacitor with PVA-H2SO4-HQ|PVA-H2SO4-MB GPEs can exhibit high specific capacitance of 563.7 F g-1 and energy density of 18.7 Wh Kg-1, increasing by about fourfold in comparison with a supercapacitor with a PVA-H2SO4 GPE. The improved energy storage is ascribed to the reversible Faradaic reactions related to HQ and MB in the corresponding gel polymer electrolytes. Additionally, the supercapacitor shows excellent cyclic durability with 90.0% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, a PCM technology was adopted to improve the mismatch between energy demand and supply on the electric grid. The proposed system was intended to operate in conjunction with existing air conditioning units within each TBS. Consequently, the running time the air conditioning units was reduced, resulting in energy and demand savings. A full scale prototype, herein referred to as latent heat storage unit (LHSU), was designed, built and tested in TBSs located in five different climatic regions in southwest and eastern China during different seasons. In addition, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the operation of the proposed LHSUs. Energy savings ratio (ESR) was used as the criterion to evaluate LHSU's energy savings. The estimated average annual ESR in five climatic regions was approximately 50%, with a maximum value of 67%.

Building-based electricity storage - to enable demand response (DR) without curtailing actual appliance usage - offers potential benefits of lower electricity production cost, higher grid reliability, and more flexibility to integrate renewables. DR tariffs are currently available in the U.S. but building-based storage is still underutilized due to insufficiently understood cost-effectiveness and dispatch strategies. Whether DR schemes can yield a profit for building operators (i.e., reduction in electricity bill that exceeds levelized storage cost) and which particular storage technology yields the highest profit is yet to be answered. This study aims to evaluate the economics of providing peak shaving DR under a realistic tariff (Con Edison, New York), using a range of storage technologies (conventional and advanced batteries, flywheel, magnetic storage, pumped hydro, compressed air, and capacitors). An agent-based stochastic model is used to randomly generate appliance-level demand profiles for an average U.S. household. We first introduce a levelized storage cost model which is based on a total-energy-throughput lifetime. We then develop a storage dispatch strategy which optimizes the storage capacity and the demand limit on the grid. We find that (i) several storage technologies provide profitable DR; (ii) annual profit from such DR can range from 1% to 39% of the household's non-DR electricity bill; (iii) allowing occasional breaches of the intended demand limit increases profit; and (iv) a dispatch strategy that accounts for demand variations across seasons increases profit further. We expect that a more advanced dispatch strategy with embedded weather forecasting capability could yield even higher profit. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based model; Batteries; Demand response; Electricity storage; Peak shaving; Smartgrid","Compressed air; Computational methods; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Profitability; Solar cells; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Weather forecasting; Agent-based model; Demand response; Electricity storages; Peak shaving; Smart grid; Magnetic storage; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy efficiency; forecasting method; numerical model; renewable resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924733069

However, whether a battery can generate profits by interacting solely in energy markets is unclear. Meanwhile, FERC order 784 requires electricity exchange markets in the U.S. to install the necessary technical equipment for batteries to supply ancillary services [12]. We suggest that current economic studies on the battery energy storage system (ESS) are limited because they do not explore possibilities to use battery storage in ancillary (reserve) markets. Applying battery ESS to ancillary service could be profitable enough to cover investment costs.In this study, we consider a battery storage operator's best strategy each day, using backwards induction. We analyze the storage device as an exhaustible resource with a limited number of charging cycles and operating years. Based on this approach, we build a revenue model to maximized the net present value of the battery energy storage system revenues by applying the three-staged-method employed by Shcherbakova et al. [14]. We found that the battery in unable to cover its costs, and it does not use all the cycles available in its lifetime.

Reversible solid oxide cells, operating sequentially between power-producing fuel cell mode and fuel-producing electrolysis mode, have the capability to provide highly efficient, scalable electricity storage. However, challenges ranging from cell performance and durability to system integration must be addressed before widespread adoption. One central challenge of the system design is establishing effective thermal management in the two distinct operating modes. This work leverages an operating strategy to use carbonaceous reactant species and operate at intermediate stack temperature (650 C) to promote exothermic fuel-synthesis reactions that thermally self-sustain the electrolysis process. We present performance of a doped lanthanum-gallate (LSGM) electrolyte solid oxide cell that shows high efficiency in both operating modes at 650 C. A physically based electrochemical model is calibrated to represent the cell performance and used to simulate roundtrip operation for conditions unique to these reversible systems. Design decisions related to system operation are evaluated using the cell model including current density, fuel and oxidant reactant compositions, and flow configuration.

However, such predictions have been shown to be inconsistent with many experiments. Herein, we have designed a novel process termed as ball milling with aerosol spraying (BMAS) to prove, for the first time, that the reaction between LiBH4 and MgH2 can indeed occur during ball milling at room temperature. Through this BMAS process we have demonstrated unambiguously the formation of MgB2 and LiH during ball milling of MgH2 while aerosol spraying of the LiBH4/THF solution. In this BMAS process, aerosol spraying of the LiBH4/THF solution leads to the formation of LiBH4 nanoparticles which decompose to form Li2B12H12. The Li2B12H12 formed then reacts with MgH2 in situ during ball milling to form MgB2 and LiH.

The common definition for battery end-of-life is when 70-80% of original energy capacity remains, however little analysis is available to support this retirement threshold. By applying detailed physics-based models of EVs with data on how drivers use their cars, we show that EV batteries continue to meet daily travel needs of drivers well beyond capacity fade of 80% remaining energy storage capacity. Further, we show that EV batteries with substantial energy capacity fade continue to provide sufficient buffer charge for unexpected trips with long distances. We show that enabling charging in more locations, even if only with 120 V wall outlets, prolongs useful life of EV batteries. Battery power fade is also examined and we show EVs meet performance requirements even down to 30% remaining power capacity. Our findings show that defining battery retirement at 70-80% remaining capacity is inaccurate. Battery retirement should instead be governed by when batteries no longer satisfy daily travel needs of a driver. Using this alternative retirement metric, we present results on the fraction of EV batteries that may be retired with different levels of energy capacity fade. © 2015 The Authors.

When evaluated as a water splitting catalyst in acidic solutions, the graphene-encapsulated Fe-doped Ni2P exhibits a low overpotential (∼50 mV) and a small Tafel slope (∼45 mV per decade) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. More importantly, the (Fe)Ni2P/graphene composite shows an excellent stability in acid solutions in contrast to conventional Ni-based catalysts.

Metal oxides (e.g., Fe3O4) usually possess high theoretical capacities, but poor electrochemical performances owing to their severe volume change and poor electronic conductivity during cycles. In this work, we develop a self-assembly approach for the synthesis of sandwich-structured graphene-Fe3O4@carbon composite, in which Fe3O4 nanoparticles with carbon layers are immobilized between the layers of graphene nanosheets. Compared to Fe3O4@carbon and bulk Fe3O4, graphene-Fe3O4@carbon composite shows superior electrochemical performance, including higher reversible capacity, better cycle and rate performances, which may be attributed to the sandwich structure of the composite, the nanosized Fe3O4, and the carbon layers on the surface of Fe3O4. Moreover, compared to the reported graphene-Fe3O4 composite, the particle size of Fe3O4 is controllable and the content of Fe3O4 in this composite can be arbitrarily adjusted for optimal performance.

Experimentally, we have developed CNT-polystyrene (PS) composites with a high degree of CNT alignment via a combination of twin-screw extrusion and hot-drawing. The aligned nanocomposites enabled a focused study of the interfacial slip mechanics associated with shear stress concentrations along the CNT-PS interface induced by the elastic mismatch between the filler and matrix. The variation of storage and loss modulus suggests the initiation of the interfacial slip occurs at axial strains as low as 0.028%, primarily due to shear stress concentration along the CNT-PS interface. Through micromechanics modeling and by matching the model with the experimental results at the onset of slip, the interfacial shear strength was evaluated. The model was then used to provide additional insight into the experimental observations by showing that the nonlinear variation of damping with dynamic strain can be attributed to slip-stick behavior. The dependence of the interfacial load-transfer reversibility on the dynamic strain history and characteristic time scale was experimentally investigated to demonstrate the relative contribution of van der Waals (vdW) interactions, mechanical interlocking, and covalent bonding to shear interactions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","damping; interfacial slip; mechanical interlocking; slip-stick","Carbon; Composite micromechanics; Damping; Dynamics; Elasticity; Energy dissipation; Extrusion; Micromechanics; Nanocomposites; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shear stress; Stick-slip; Strain; Strain energy; Stress concentration; Stresses; Van der Waals forces; Yarn; Aligned carbon nanotubes; Interfacial shear strength; Interfacial slip; Mechanical interlocking; Reinforced polymer composites; slip-stick; Storage and loss modulus; Van der Waals interaction; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929146035

The effects of additives on electrolyte are studied by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge test. The results show that a VFB using the electrolyte with NH4H2PO4additive demonstrates significantly improved redox reaction reversibility and activity, and higher energy efficiency.

This study determines the minimum cost configuration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), wind turbines, and natural gas reciprocating engines in an off-grid model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to determine the system configuration needed to achieve a variety of CO2-eq emissions targets. The relationship between total system costs and life cycle emissions are used to optimize the generation mixes to achieve emissions targets at the least cost and determine when VRFBs are preferable over wind curtailment. Different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets are defined for the off-grid system and the minimum cost resource configuration is determined to meet those targets. This approach determines when the use of VRFBs is more cost effective than wind curtailment in reaching GHG emissions targets. The research demonstrates that while incorporating energy storage consistently reduces life cycle carbon emissions, it is not cost effective to reduce curtailment except under very low emission targets (190g of CO2-eq/kWh and less for the examined system). This suggests that ""overbuilding"" wind is a more viable option to reduce life cycle emissions for all but the most ambitious carbon mitigation targets. The findings show that adding VRFB as energy storage could be economically preferable only when wind curtailment exceeds 66% for the examined system. The results were most sensitive to VRFB costs, natural gas upstream emissions (e.g. methane leakage), and wind capital cost. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Greenhouse gas emissions targets; Life cycle assessment; Vanadium redox flow battery; Wind curtailment","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Natural gas; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Wind turbines; Carbon mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment model; Life cycle emissions; Reciprocating engines; Resource configurations; System configurations; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Gas emissions; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; natural gas; redox potential; vanadium; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924705882

This paper investigates the potential for energy-cost savings and actual energy savings, by implementation of variable speed drives to ventilation fans in underground mines. In particular, ventilation on demand is considered in the study, i.e., air volume is adjusted according to the demand at varying times. Two DSM strategies, energy efficiency (EE) and load management (LM), are formulated and analysed. By modelling the network with the aid of Kirchhoff's laws and Tellegen's theorem, a nonlinear constrained minimization model is developed, with the objective of achieving EE. The model is also made to adhere to the fan laws, such that the fan power at its operating points is found to achieve realistic results. LM is achieved by finding the optimal starting time of the mining schedule, according to the time of use (TOU) tariff. A case study is shown to demonstrate the effects of the optimization model. The study suggests that by combining load shifting and energy efficiency techniques, an annual energy saving of 2. 540. 035. kW. h is possible, leading to an annual cost saving of USD 277035. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Load management; Mine ventilation; Optimization; Time of use tariff; Ventilation on demand (VOD)","Constrained optimization; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Mine ventilation; Optimization; Variable speed drives; Annual energy savings; Constrained minimization; Demand side managements; On demands; Optimization modeling; Tellegen's theorems; Time of use (TOU) tariffs; Time-of-use tariffs; Energy efficiency; demand-side management; energy efficiency; energy planning; mine; mining industry; optimization; underground storage; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924191165

This study investigates the implications of CO2 price for China's power sector decarbonization up to 2050, incorporating different scenarios of fuel prices and the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. An adapted low-carbon generation expansion planning (GEP) model is used to determine the least-cost decarbonization pathways. The implications of the CO2 price are analyzed from the technical, environmental and economic perspectives for 32 scenarios. This study finds that, first of all, a high CO2 price is conducive to achieve a high degree of decarbonization in a cost-effective way, but only if CCS technology is available. Secondly, higher fuel prices undermine or nullify the effect of CO2 pricing on the power decarbonization. Thirdly, the optimal share of renewable energy source (RES) power generation depends on its comparative cost-advantage over CCS-integrated power generation in this study, and the cost-advantage is largely influenced by CO2 prices. Hence, policy makers should coordinate the mandatory targets for RES power generation with CO2 pricing, otherwise, these targets might become redundant or entail extra costs. The findings can be used for China's policy makers regarding the design of cost-effective power sector decarbonization packages complementing CO2 pricing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); China; CO2 price; Fuel prices; Power decarbonization; Renewable energy source (RES)","Carbon; Carbon capture; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Decision making; Fuel storage; Fuels; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Carbon capture and storage; China; Comparative costs; Economic perspective; Emission trading systems; Fuel prices; Generation expansion planning; Renewable energy source; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; ecological economics; emission control; emissions trading; integrated approach; policy making; power generation; pricing policy; renewable resource; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923861424

However, CSP plants need to reduce costs to be competitive with other power generation methods. Two ways to reduce CSP cost are to increase solar-to-electric efficiency by supporting a high-efficiency power conversion system, and to use low-cost materials in the system. The current nitrate-based molten-salt systems have limited potential for cost reduction and improved power-conversion efficiencywith high operating temperatures. Even with significant improvements in operating performance, these systems face challenges in satisfying the cost and performance targets. This paper introduces a novel CSP system with high-temperature capability that can be integrated into a high-efficiency CSP plant and that meets the low-cost, high-performance CSP targets. Unlike a conventional salt-based CSP plant, this design uses gas/solid, two-phase flow as the heat-transfer fluid (HTF); separated solid particles as storage media; and stable, inexpensive materials for the high-temperature receiver and energy storage containment. We highlightthe economic and performance benefits of this innovative CSP system design, whichhas thermal energy storage capability for base-load power generation. © 2015 The Authors.

An off-grid system to cheaply convert this solar energy into electricity could improve the lives of millions of families. Waste heat from high-concentration photovoltaic arrays and solar energy from evacuated tubecollectors are potential sources of abundant low-grade thermal energy. An Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is able to convert low-grade thermal energy into electricity at a relative low cost.While traditional ORCs rely on stable thermal energy inputs (i.e. geothermal energy), solar energy is not able to provide a constant supply of thermal energy. Understanding how transient solar fluctuations affect ORC performance is crucial to the development of high-performance, stable and stand-alone solar-driven ORC systems and further integration with heat storage units.In this work, an experimental ORC testbed was designed and fabricated for small-scale low-grade thermal energy utilization for transient characterization. Of particular interest in this work is the behavior of the ORC system as it approaches the operational limits. When the mass flow rate in the cycle is too high or the thermal energy input too low, the balance of the system is disturbed and strange oscillations are encountered. This work focuses on gaining a deep understanding of this abnormal behavior and itsinfluence on ORC performance. The physical phenomena that bring about these changes in an evaporator and their effect on ORC's moving components (i.e., diaphragm pump and scroll expander) are studied and characterized. A qualitative description of the phenomena is proposed and used to describe the changes within the cycle as a result of the imbalance. Once the individual processes in the oscillations are identified, quantitative analysis is carried out to better characterize the entire cycle. This characterization may be used to predict when the heat source conditions would lead to oscillations in ORCs and the magnitude of the reactions.These oscillations hinder the ORC performance and may even cause damage to the moving components under certain circumstances. Revealing the physical mechanismof oscillations helps attain advanceddesign and energy-efficient operation of ORCsunder transient thermal energy supplies, particularly solar. Cycle modifications such as heat storage units are also discussed to coping with transient solar energy inputs and night-time operation. © 2015 The Authors.

The analysis is mainly concentrating on the circular field, because the large scale and heat storage are more suitable for the circular field that have been an irreversible trend in solar tower power plant. The two kinds of layout are compared from the following three aspects, which are the plant scale, optical efficiency and heliostat field area. Besides the two kinds of layouts, a few of combinations of both layouts are proposed and tested, such as replacing one or some zones of radial staggered field with spiral field, arranging the north field with radial staggered layout while the south part is biomimetic spiral or arranging in turn.

However, the use of graphite foam for elevated temperature applications (&gt;600 oC) is limited due to poor oxidation resistance of graphite. In the present study, oxidation resistance of graphite foam coated with silicon carbide (SiC) was investigated. A pre-ceramic polymer derived coating (PDC) method was used to form a SiC coating on the graphite foams. Post coating deposition, the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The oxidation resistance of PDC-SiC coating was quantified by measuring the weight of the samples at several measuring points. The experiments were conducted under static argon atmosphere in a furnace. After the experiments, oxidation rates (%/hour) were calculated to predict the lifetime of the graphite foams.

This high efficiency results in a system with a high possibility of meeting the DOE SunShot goal of $0.06/kWh. However, current dish-Stirling systems do not incorporate thermal storage. For the next generation of non-intermittent and cost-competitive solar power plants, we propose adding a thermal energy storage system that combines latent (phase-change) energy transport and latent energy storage in order to match the isothermal input requirements of Stirling engines while also maximizing the exergetic efficiency of the entire system. This paper reports current findings in the area of selection, synthesis and evaluation of a suitable high performance metallic phase change material (PCM) as well as potential interactions with containment alloy materials. The metallic PCM's, while more expensive than salts, have been identified as having substantial performance advantages primarily due to high thermal conductivity, leading to high exergetic efficiency. Systems modeling has indicated, based on high dish Stirling system performance, an allowable cost of the PCM storage system that is substantially higher than SunShot goals for storage cost on tower systems. Several PCM's are identified with suitable melting temperature, cost, and performance. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating Solar Power; CSP; Dish Stirling; Heat pipe; Phase change storage","Heat pipes; Heat storage; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Concentrating solar power; Dish Stirling; Dish-stirling system; Electrical generation; Exergetic efficiency; High thermal conductivity; Phase Change; Thermal energy storage systems; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943639882

Photovoltaic systems (PV) are reaching grid parity in the sunniest regions of Europe. Apart from PV, a promising technology is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with thermal storage, because it enables higher power plant availability throughout the year as well as dispatchability, a highly important and valuable feature for a power plant. However significant cost reductions are still to be achieved, for CSP to be competitive with conventional electricity production and with PV. In this paper a few technological improvements are described and a proposal is made to combine them in a system that is more efficient and has, simultaneously, the potential of being cheaper. The goal is to show the potential for advanced LFR concepts in combination with high temperature molten salt mixtures and energy storage as being also important contenders to the objective of bringing STE- Solar Thermal Electricity to the market in a competitive way. The concept presented and developed includes a higher ΔT of the heat transfer fluid (HTF), a particular storage strategy and a new optical concept based on a new Linear Fresnel Concentrator (LFR XX SMS-Simultaneous Multiple Surface, Fig.1,2, [1] enabling an important increase in the overall yearly solar to electricity conversion efficiency and generating an important potential for electricity cost reduction.

While typical capacity factors (CFs) for intermittent renewables are generally between 20% and 40%, the SolarReserve Crescent Dunes project will offer above 50%. This paper discusses how SolarReserve's CSP technology can cost-effectively produce a CF over 80%, and when hybridized with PV, can raise the CF further to roughly 90%. A detailed operational model of a hybrid system in Chile's Atacama Desert was produced, using localized data on weather and interconnection capacity, to illustrate this capability. Analysis of high CF CSP-PV hybrids leads to three important conclusions. First, it was found that effective configuration of high CF systems supported selection of fixed-tilt PV at a high angle, which is optimized for winter generation in order to minimize seasonal differences. Second, when a dispatch strategy was developed which incorporated multiple priority levels and which dispatched CSP in response to PV output, it enabled higher CF CSP-PV hybrid operations than the CSP accomplished alone. Third, it was found that average annual DNI was not a sufficient metric of solar resource, and that seasonal variability and consolidation of non-optimal days were also important to high CF designs. New metrics for solar resource measurement are proposed and discussed. © 2015 The Authors.

However, the thermocline storage system with a low-cost filler material is a more economically feasible option. In this study, a transient two-dimensional and two-temperature model is developed to investigate the heat transfer and fluid dynamics in a molten salt thermocline thermal storage system. After model validation, the effects of inlet flow boundary condition and storage medium properties including fluid and solid materials on the thermal performance of thermocline storage system are investigated. The results show that thermoclne thickness increases slowest with solar salt as heat transfer fluid (HTF) and Cofalit® as solid material in the thermocline tank. Any non-uniformity in the inlet velocity flow would only enhance mixing and widen the thermocline appreciably, which contributes to the loss of thermodynamic availability of stored energy. The thermocline thickness increases with the non-uniformity of the inlet velocity boundary condition. So smaller non-uniformity of inlet flow is better in non-uniform flow though it may causes larger fluctuations in average outlet temperature. Smaller inlet mass flow rate is better for the thermocline storage tank, while it also causes smaller discharging power. With the chosen basic design parameters such as fluid and solid materials, the size of a 2MWh thermocline tank is determined by a simple one-dimensional design method. Tank with larger H/D ratio has higher discharge efficiency. It helps to figure out the thermal stratification mechanism of a storage tank and thereby to determine optimum design and operating conditions. © 2015 The Authors.

The present work is an investigation of cobalt oxide based honeycomb structures as candidate reactors/heat exchangers in relevant compact and efficient THS systems. The formulations studied included extruded bodies from pure cobalt oxide and two different cobalt oxide/alumina composites (i.e. 95/5 wt% and 90/10 wt%) as well as cobalt oxide-coated cordierite honeycombs with two different loadings (i.e. 28% and 65%). The structures were evaluated with respect to their redox performance in the course of 5 successive cycles in the temperature window of 800-1000oC and under air flow. Based on measured oxygen evolution profiles, honeycombs from pure cobalt oxide and cobalt oxide-coated cordierites exhibited very similar normalized (i.e. μmol O2/g Co3O4) redox performance. On the other hand, the addition of alumina had a moderately negative effect on normalized redox performance versus the two aforementioned formulations but contributed to the substantial increase of the honeycombs structural stability when compared to the extruded pure cobalt oxide monolith. The particular finding was based on performing, in a separate experimental setup, 10 redox cycles under idealized (i.e. no imposed loads) conditions. Pre- (i.e. fresh/calcined) and post-characterization (i.e. after 10 redox cycles) of extruded structures via mercury porosimetry revealed measurable decrease of bulk density and increase of mean pore size, indicating a net structure expansion/'swelling' effect. © 2015 The Authors.

The installed capacities in wind and PV have reached 350 GW and 160 GW respectively while STE plants have only achieved 4 GW. The explanation is easy: the current generation costs of wind and PV plants are lower than those of STE plants and a large majority of installations were sited in industrialised countries - where no additional backup was required. Large shares of VRE bring significant reductions on the operation time of flexible conventional plants and even lead to curtailments on renewable energy sources as well. In developing countries, the situation is quite different. These must not only increase, but mainly multiply their installed capacity in the next years for meeting the demand needs at all times. Therefore, this increase of installed capacity power cannot be exclusively based, e.g. in PV and/or wind plants, as the evening peak has to be covered every day. Such investments in VRE must then be backed up by new combined cycles. This also why STE could already be selected as the best choice in several Sun Belt countries. However, the main challenge for STE plants is not only to offer some flexible dispatch features, but also to be able to respond to the requested dispatch profile under any circumstances. Achieving this goal with huge solar plans and storage systems will be certainly not cost competitive in the short term. Therefore, ""smart"" combinations between storage and hybridisation solutions will need to be developed. In this paper, different conceptual alternatives for firm supply features of STE plants are analysed and the advantages of high-performance hybrid solutions combined with storage capabilities are featured. Nevertheless, a fruitful coexistence and the reaping of synergies with VRE at large regional and seasonal scales are also addressed. Although there is still a large potential for further VRE plants deployment, policy makers everywhere will realise sooner rather than later, that the true market value of firm supply as delivered by the last generation of STE plants -besides their substantial positive macroeconomic impacts in the countries' economy. And so will hybrid STE plants with storage be the prevailing concept in the future. © 2015 The Authors.

This is a very sought after property in power generation, where a high temperature heat source is required within a narrow temperature range as heat input for the turbine. Solar tower technology provides a high temperature heat source, but unfortunately it is time dependent. A sufficient amount of this heat may be stored in a phase change storage system which can deliver dispatchable heat. In such a storage system the phase change material needs to be exposed to a sufficient heat transfer area to melt or solidify at sufficient rates. In this study this is achieved with heat pipes with metallic fins. The analysis of this design included testing an experimental module during heat absorption and heat removal cycles, as well as a numerical analysis to model the storage module. To determine the parameters for a specific phase change storage system in a high temperature solar tower application the validated numerical thermal response simulation is incorporated. Certain solar input conditions and load cases are applied to the phase change storage system model and the size and geometry of the solar thermal storage system are determined from this analysis. © 2015 The Authors.

Efforts are underway to prepare on-sun testing of this concept at King Saud University (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) as a part of the research activities in a SunShot project led by Sandia National Laboratories. A thorough study of this concept has been conducted and a prototype has been designed. This concept involves the use of proppants (CARBO Accucast ID50K) as the storage medium, and a thick, multilayered, cylindrical-shaped TES bin as the storage bin. Due to the complexity of building this first-of-its-kind TES bin, it was necessary to model the thermal performance of this design prior to completing the construction process. For this reason, a numerical model was built for the TES bin which is capable of determining the amount of energy loss. The model takes into account that, during daytime operation, the charging flow rate is higher than the discharging flow rate to allow the proppants to accumulate within the TES bin over about 7 hours. Once the charging process is completed, the discharging phase - whose duration is about 5 hours - is also modeled, followed by modeling the cooling-down process of the TES bin for 12 hours to complete a 24-hour cycle. This modeling cycle is based on an assumed initial temperature in the interior of the bin. This paper extends the modeling effort to more than one cycle, such that the initial conditions at the beginning of each cycle are based on information obtained from the previous cycle, rather than on assumed values. Results show that multi-cycle modeling is important, since it shows that the assumed initial temperature may not representative and may lead to inaccurate results. Furthermore, lessons learned from the first cycle of operation, especially excessive air leakage into the TES bin during nighttime depletion, help refine modeling of subsequent cycles. Energy loss at the end of the second cycle was found to be 4.3%. While considered large, this value is primarily due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the prototype TES bin being investigated. Preliminary analysis shows that a utility-scale TES bin using the same concept will have an energy loss of less than 1%, which conforms to the current best practice, and shows that low-cost TES solutions can be used in conjunction with the falling particle receiver concept.","cyclic energy loss; falling particle receiver; thermal energy storage; transient energy loss","Construction; Heat storage; Proppants; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Construction process; Cooling down process; Cyclic energy; High surface-to-volume ratio; Preliminary analysis; Riyadh , Saudi Arabia; Sandia National Laboratories; Transient energy; Energy dissipation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943613678

The economic and energetic performances of this so-called SUNDISC cycle are investigated in the present work. To do so, an annual hourly thermodynamic model is used with varying configurations of solar field size, steam turbine rating, storage capacity, low-pressure receiver system and hybridization modes. The conducted simulations show the lowest levelized cost of electricity for small solar components and considerable fuel co-firing rates at 0.08 USD/kWhe. However, the results were produced with exceptionally low fuel cost and, furthermore, solar power plants are expected to be limited to low fuel usage. When the co-firing rate is capped at 20% and 5%, the minimum achievable costs increase to 0.10 USD/kWhe and 0.12 USD/kWhe, respectively. These latter results are generated with high steam turbine ratings as well as large low-pressure receiver systems, solar fields and thermal energy storage systems. The resulting annual time of no power generation, as a measurement of the plant's baseload capacity, was less than 800 h. If longer plant operation is aspired either cost or fuel co-firing rate increase. The rock bed thermal energy storage system is found to add only minor costs to the plant. Large storage capacities are, therefore, viable and the technology plays a vital role in enabling baseload electricity generation from solar energy. Refinements are recommended for the component cost model and plant operation control. The latter should be made more flexible to find optimized hybridization modes. © 2015 The Authors.

Incentives range from tariff exemptions on distribution and up to a 5% guaranteed supply rights to regulated customers. Such conditions allow for a viable and fast growing environment for the developments of those generation systems based on the CSP which incorporate optimized storage systems. These systems are likely to play a vital role in meeting the increasing demand for energy from the copper mining sector in the north of Chile as well as that of the smaller electricity networks and local communities. In this direction, the University of Antofagasta, Chile, has developed the implementation and construction of a modular solar storage system, using new ternary and quaternary nitrate mixtures, where in addition to collecting the heat of industrial/mining processes and store them for later use, proposes its implementation in isolated rural systems in the Chilean Norte Grande. The new ternary and quaternary Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF), designed with the addition of Ca(NO3)2 and LiNO3 to solar salt, shows a work temperature range of 130 to 600°C. This temperature range, together with the adequate heat capacity of salt and the potential for storage approximately 175 kWh per day to this system, making it suitable to meet the demands of evaluated areas.

The novel high temperature SPR-based CSP system uses solid particles as the heat transfer medium (HTM) in place of the more conventional fluids such as molten salt or steam used in current state-of-the-art CSP plants. The solar particle receiver (SPR) is designed to heat the HTM to temperatures of 800°C or higher which is well above the operating temperatures of nitrate-based molten salt thermal energy storage (TES) systems. The solid particles also help overcome some of the other challenges associated with molten salt-based systems such as freezing, instability and degradation. The higher operating temperatures and use of low cost HTM and higher efficiency power cycles are geared towards reducing costs associated with CSP systems. This paper describes the SPR-based CSP system with a focus on the fluidized-bed (FB) heat exchanger and its integration with various power cycles. The SPR technology provides a potential pathway to achieving the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) target of $0.06/kWh that has been set by the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot initiative. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating solar power; fluidized bed; heat exchanger; high efficiency; high temperature; renewable energy; solar particle receiver; solid particles","Electric energy storage; Fused salts; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Solar absorbers; Solar energy; Temperature; Concentrating solar power; High temperature; High-efficiency; Renewable energies; Solar particle receivers; Solid particles; Fluidized beds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943599069

In this work, a thin double-layered annulus bed configuration was adopted and full-scale beds loaded with ZrCo and depleted uranium (DU) for fast recovery and delivery of hydrogen isotopes were fabricated. The properties of hydrogen recovery/delivery together with the inner structure variation in the fabricated beds were systematically studied. The effects of operation conditions on the performances of the bed were also investigated. It was found that both of the fabricated ZrCo and DU beds were able to achieve the hydrogen storage target of 17.5mol with fast recovery rate. In addition, experimental results showed that operation of employing extra buffer vessel and scroll pump could not only promote the hydrogen delivery process but also reduce the possibility about disproportionation of ZrCo. Compared with ZrCo bed, DU bed exhibited superior hydrogen delivery performances in terms of fast delivery rate and high hydrogen delivery amount, which could deliver over 16.4mol H2 (93.7% of recovery amount) within 30min at the average delivery rate of 20Pam3/s. Good reversibility as high as 10 cycles without obvious degradation tendency in both of hydrogen delivery amount and delivery rate for DU bed was also achieved in our study.

When evaluated as anode for lithium ion batteries, Zninf2/infSnOinf4/inf/G nanocomposites deliver a high specific capacity of 745 mAh gsup-1/sup after 100 cycles at 200 mA gsup-1/sup and improved cyclic stability with a capacity of 492 mAh gsup-1/sup after 500 cycles at 500 mA gsup-1/sup. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly ascribed to the synergetic effect of fine Zninf2/infSnOinf4/inf nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets. Furthermore, our work provides a simple and low-cost synthetic strategy for the controllable fabrication of various structural materials for energy storage. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fine nanoparticles; Graphene; Lithium ion battery; Tartrate; Zinc stannate","Graphene; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Crystal growth mechanism; Electrochemical performance; High specific capacity; Hydrothermal conditions; Morphology evolution; Structure directing agents; Tartrate; Zinc stannate; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922466288

Compared to the conventional HESS, the proposed multimode HESS has more operating modes and thus it could in further enhance the efficiency of the system. The rule-based control strategy and the power-balancing strategy are developed for the energy management strategy to realize mode selection and power distribution. Generally, the DC-DC converter will operate at peak efficiency to convey the energy from the batteries to the UCs. Otherwise, the pure battery mode or the pure ultracapacitors (UCs) mode will be utilized without the DC-DC converter. To extend the battery life, the UCs have the highest priority to recycle the energy and the batteries are isolated from being recharged directly during regenerative braking. Simulations and experiments are established to validate the proposed multimode HESS and its energy management strategy. The results reveal that the energy losses in the DC-DC converter, the total energy consumption and the overall system efficiency of the proposed multimode HESS are improved compared to the conventional HESS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Direct current to direct current converter; Electric vehicles; Energy management strategy; Hybrid energy storage system","DC-DC converters; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Regenerative braking; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Vehicles; Direct current converter; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy management strategies; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Power distributions; Rule-based control strategies; Total energy consumption; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922464932

Here, we discover the most stable structure of Li2S2 by using first-principles unbiased structure searching calculations. The new compound exhibits intriguing structural features, including Li-centered tetrahedrons and S22- ions.

In this paper, a series of high thermally-conductive shape-stabilized phase change materials (ss-PCMs) were tailored by blending PEG with AgNP-decorated diatomite. In order to enlarge its pore size and specific surface area and make it a suitable PEG carrier, the effect of alkali leaching on the microstructure of diatomite was studied. While PEG melted during phase transformation, the maximum load of PEG could reach 63 wt%, which was 31% higher than that of the raw diatomite. Spherical-shaped crystalline AgNPs with a diameter range of 3-10 nm were uniformly decorated onto diatomite. The XPS results for this material proved that the valence state of silver in the PEG/diatomite PCM was mainly zero. The phase change enthalpy of the PEG/diatomite/Ag PCM reached 111.3 J g-1, and the thermal conductivity of the PEG/diatomite PCM containing 7.2 wt% Ag was 0.82 W m-1 K-1, which was 127% higher than that of the PEG/diatomite composite. The reduced melting and freezing periods indirectly proved that heat transfer in the composite material during the heat storage and release process was enhanced through the thermal conductivity improvement. The composite PCM was thermally and chemically stable even after 200 cycles of melting and freezing. This indicated that the resulting composite PCMs were promising candidate materials for building applications due to their large latent heat, suitable phase change temperature, excellent chemical compatibility, improved supercooling extent, and high thermal stability. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Blending; Chemical stability; Conductive materials; Freezing; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Melting; Nanoparticles; Passive solar buildings; Pore size; Silver; Thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity of solids; Building applications; Chemical compatibility; Conductivity improvement; Enhanced thermal conductivity; High thermal stability; Phase change enthalpy; Phase change temperature; Shape stabilized phase change material; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926660118

However, just like other Li-V-O compounds, the application of the LiVO3 cathode is restricted by its poor cycling stability and rate capability. In this paper, we report, for the first time, nanoplate-stacked baguette-like LiVO3 by an in situ template method. In this unique structure, the micro-sized baguette shape can help to inhibit the dissolution of vanadium in comparison with nanosized LiVO3, and the stacked nanoplates can provide short diffusion pathways for lithium ions.

Though nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon shells have been widely used to improve the electrode performances in energy storage devices (e.g., lithium ion batteries), they have attracted less attention in energy-related electrocatalysis. Here we report the synthesis of nitrogen-enriched core-shell structured cobalt-carbon nanoparticles dispersed on graphene sheets and we investigate their HER performances in both acidic and basic media. These catalysts exhibit excellent durability and HER activities with onset overpotentials as low as ∼70 mV in both acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (0.1 M NaOH) electrolytes, and the overpotentials needed to deliver 10 mA cm-2 are determined to be 265 mV in acid and 337 mV in base, further demonstrating their potential to replace Pt-based catalysts.

The introduction of inorganic fillers to polymer matrix represents a promising avenue for the development of high energy density storage materials, which combines the high dielectric constant of inorganic fillers with supernal dielectric strength of polymer matrix. However, agglomeration and phase separation of inorganic fillers in the polymer matrix remain the key barriers to promoting the practical applications of the composites for energy storage. Here, we developed a low-cost and environmentally friendly route to modifying BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles by a kind of water-soluble hydantoin epoxy resin. The modified BT nanoparticles exhibited homogeneous dispersion in the ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) matrix and strong interfacial adhesion with the polymer matrix. The dielectric constants of the nanocomposites increased significantly with the increase of the coated BT loading, while the dielectric loss of the nanocomposites was still as low as that of the pure P(VDF-HFP). The energy storage density of the nanocomposites was largely enhanced with the coated BT loading at the same electric field. The nanocomposite with 20 vol % BT exhibited an estimated maximum energy density of 8.13 J cm-3, which was much higher than that of pure P(VDF-HFP) and other dielectric polymers. The findings of this research could provide a feasible approach to produce high energy density materials for practical application in energy storage. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","BaTiO3; energy storage; ferroelectric polymers; hydantoin epoxy resins; nanocomposites","Barium titanate; Dielectric losses; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties of solids; Electric energy storage; Electric fields; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Epoxy resins; Ferroelectricity; Fillers; Fluorine compounds; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Phase separation; Plastic coatings; Polymer matrix; Renewable energy resources; Storage (materials); BaTiO3; Ferroelectric polymers; High dielectric constants; High energy density materials; Homogeneous dispersions; Hydantoin epoxy resins; Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene); Renewable energy systems; Polymer matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928494391

In this paper, hierarchical CoSe2 nanostructures are successfully grown on conductive carbon fabrics with robust adhesion by a facile two-step method. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared hierarchical CoSe2 architectures were investigated in three- and two-electrode systems. In the three-electrode system, the hierarchical CoSe2 architectures exhibit a large specific capacitance of 332 mF cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. After charging/discharging for 5000 cycles, the electrode still showed superior stability with the capacity retention of about 95.4%. When assembled into asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on the hierarchical CoSe2 negative electrode and MnO2 nanowire positive electrode, the potential window increased to 1.6 V, larger than that of symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) based on CoSe2//CoSe2 electrodes. And a high energy density of 0.588 mW h cm-3 at a power density of 0.282 W cm-3 was also reached for the fabricated ASCs. Excitingly, the electrochemical performance of the as-assembled ASCs showed little degradation even under severe bending conditions, demonstrating excellent flexibility and mechanical stability. The as-grown CoSe2 electrode with a 3D hierarchical structure can be a potential candidate for high-performance ASCs because of its improved electrochemically active sites, electronic conductivity and the reduced ion diffusion path. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Capacitors; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Hierarchical systems; Inorganic compounds; Lithium compounds; Manganese oxide; Mechanical stability; Nanowires; Solid state lasers; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Electrochemical performance; Electronic conductivity; Hierarchical structures; High energy densities; Specific capacitance; Three electrode-system; Two-electrode systems; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926506579

The interlayer spacing of V2O5·nH2O is larger than that of orthorhombic V2O5 due to the intercalation of water molecules into the layer structure. As the cathode of a SIB, V2O5·nH2O exhibits a high initial capacity of 338 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and a high-rate capacity of 96 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1.

These materials offer a significant improvement in theoretical energy density relative to state-of-the-art aqueous chemistries. A detailed assessment of the solubility, cyclic voltammetry, and charge-discharge behavior of the complexes is presented. Their solubilities in acetonitrile vary by more than four orders of magnitude based on the structure/substituents on the acac ligand. Complexes bearing acac ligands with ester substituents have solubilities of up to 1.8 M, a significant improvement over most other metal complexes that have been considered for non-aqueous RFB applications. While the acac ligand substituents have a dramatic impact on solubility, they do not, in most cases, impact the electrochemical properties of the complexes. For instance, voltammetry for all of the V(acac)3 derivatives examined exhibit two quasi-reversible redox events separated by approximately 2.1 V. Charge-discharge testing in static H-cell and laboratory-scale flow batteries yielded energy densities that were consistent with the voltammetry and coulombic and energy efficiencies of up to 92% and 87%, respectively.

Embedding and isolating Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) into sealed amorphous carbon hollow spheres with sufficient voids is a promising strategy to accommodate the volume effect of Si. However, the created voids significantly compromise the volumetric energy density. Conversely, if insufficient voids are introduced, the inferior mechanical property of the amorphous carbon turns into the decisive factor destroying the structural integrity of the composites. Graphene is more suitable as a protective shell material due to its excellent mechanical strength. However, there still remains a formidable challenge of constructing closed graphene hollow spheres owing to their unique two-dimensional structure. Herein, we first propose a bottom-up route to controllably synthesize a polycrystalline graphene hollow sphere isolated SiNP nanocomposite (Si@void@graphene) through an in situ pyrolysis and metal-catalyzed graphitization reaction, in which glucose and metal sulfate with strictly controlled content and ratio are employed as the carbon source and catalyst precursor, respectively. The obtained graphene hollow spheres with superb mechanical properties offer a permanent structural and electrical environment for the inner SiNPs even insufficient voids are introduced while maintaining a reasonable volumetric energy density. When the void space is designed based on the assumption that Si has only 250% volume change, the Si@void@graphene electrode exhibits high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and much prolonged cycle life as compared to those of the Si@void@amorphous carbon electrode. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Amorphous carbon; Amorphous materials; Anodes; Carbon; Catalysts; Density (specific gravity); Electrodes; Graphene; Graphite electrodes; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Mechanical properties; Nanoparticles; Silicon; Spheres; Strength of materials; Carbon hollow-spheres; High lithium storages; High reversible capacities; Lithium ion storages; Polycrystalline graphene; Silicon nanoparticles; Two-dimensional structures; Volumetric energy densities; Amorphous silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926472785

Ti2Ni alloy was chemically modified by Pd and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. An objective of the present study is to provide data on hydrogenation properties of Ti2Ni-based alloys and compounds containing Pd and/or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Alloys and composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy equipped with an electron energy dispersive spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy to evaluate phase composition, crystal structure, grain size, particle morphology and distribution of catalyst element. Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation properties and hydriding kinetics of materials were measured using a Sievert's apparatus. Hydrogenation properties of nanostructured Ti2Ni-based alloy and Ti2Ni-based nanocomposites were compared with those of the binary Ti2Ni compound.

Manifestations of this failure include venting of potentially combustible gases and aerosols followed by a rapid self-heating accompanied by ejection of the battery materials. It is important to be able to quantify the dynamics and energetics of this process to ensure safety of the energy storage systems utilizing LIBs. Here we report on development of a new experimental technique for the measurement of energetics of a thermally-induced battery failure. This technique, Copper Slug Battery Calorimetry (CSBC), was employed to investigate a widely utilized LIB of 2200 mAh capacity at various states of charge (SOC). It was shown that this techniques yields time and temperature resolved data on the rate of heat production inside the failing battery. The total energy generated inside the battery was found to increase with increasing SOC to the maximumvalue of 34.0 ± 1.8 kJ. To capture the energetics of flaming combustion of the materials ejected from the battery, CSBC was coupled with a cone calorimeter, which measures heat released in a non-premixed flame.

Attempts to solve this problem have received wide attention recently. However, accessing and stabilizing high-oxidation-state catalytically active species to further improve the high performance for the OER has been considered a huge challenge. Here, we report a Ni-Fe oxide-based nanotube array electrode, novel in design, with strong durability and excellent and synergistically enhanced catalytic performance for the OER. The OER electrode, with a nanotube array nanostructure, shows the remarkable features of a small overpotential of 0.28 V, favourable electrode kinetics and high stability, comparing favorably with the reported performances of the best OER electrocatalysts (IrO2), which is attributed to the formation and stabilization of the favourable OER catalytically active species NiOOH that is produced and reinforced by the introduction of Fe into nanostructured materials. This feasible strategy affords a new strategy for the development of effective and robust OER electrodes. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electrocatalysts; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Nanotubes; Nickel; Precious metals; Reaction kinetics; Regenerative fuel cells; Secondary batteries; Stabilization; Yarn; Catalytic performance; Catalytically active species; Cathodic process; Electrode kinetics; High oxidation state; Metal-air battery; Oxygen evolution reaction; Unitized regenerative fuel cells; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925114478

This system charges heat by using cheap nighttime electricity and provides heating needs throughout all day. The effect of thermal conductivity of the PCM on energy savings and economic benefits of the system were theoretically and experimentally studied. HCE-SSPCM plates, made of (solid paraffin. +. liquid paraffin)/high density polyethylene/expanded graphite, were introduced to a test room with under-floor heating system. And the operating characteristics of the system were compared with that of the non-phase change energy storage system and the conventional air conditioning system. The results showed that enhancing the thermal conductivity of PCM in a certain range could significantly improve the energy efficiency of the heating system and reduce the thickness of thermal insulating materials. But the improving effect was not obvious when the thermal conductivity was beyond 1.0. W/m. K. The phase change energy storage system had a comfortable temperature environment and the best economic benefits among the three different heating types especially when the ratio of peak-valley electric price was high.

Energy storage technologies can be varied from an electric battery to a flywheel that can results in deliverable power based on the application. These variations are a challenge to design a reliable and efficient energy storage system. The purpose of this paper is to study the thermal-fluid effect of thermal energy storage (TES) tank design. A three-dimensional modelling of TES tank was carried out using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code by differentiate the heat source temperature and heat transfer fluid (HTF) velocity. The results predict the thermal-fluid behaviour of TES tank. Since the HTF used is water, the expected outcome of the outlet temperature is in the range of 40 to 60°C.The outlet temperature of the TES tank is compared with the experimental data. It can conclude the TES tank thermal-fluid behaviour is affected by heat source temperature and velocity HTF.

From the economic standpoint, the largest obstacle in using the hydrogen is the effective and safe storage equipment. Up to now, there is no hydrogen storage which has a satisfying performance in both capacity and thermodynamics properties. Fe-Ti alloy is promising hydrogen storage because it absorbs hydrogen in room temperature. Unfortunately, its hydrogen absorption capacity is very low (1-1.9 wt %). Aluminum is known as one among the light metals that can be promoted as a substituting agent that can improve the surface area which interact with hydrogen. Alloying aluminum with Fe-Ti alloy is suggested to enhance the hydrogen absorption capacity. The synthesis and characterization of Fe-Ti-Al alloy with the atomic ratio of 10:10:1 prepared by mechanical alloying technique and its hydrogen absorption properties has been performed. The Fe-Ti-Al elemental powders were milled together in toluene solution using a high energy ball milling for 30 hours. The milled specimen is analyzed with an X-Ray Diffractometer and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using Rietveld method developed by Fuji Izumi. On hydriding at room temperature using low pressured Sievert Type Apparatus, Fe10Ti10Al transformed into FeTiH2 and TiH2. It is exhibited that Fe10Ti10Al hydride specimen contains almost 2.5 wt% hydrogen. This is an improvement from Fe-Ti-Mg alloy by Suwarno (2011) which contains 1.75 wt.% hydrogen. Consider the high hydrogen absorption capacity and the low hydriding temperature of this alloy, Fe10Ti10Al alloy could be promoted as new hydrogen storage materials. © 2015 The Authors.

The MCS-nES was determined as MCS unit equipped with several charging poles without any energy storage. This unit connects the inlet to the power grid and undertake on-grid charging mode to assist the overload FCS. MCS-wES was determined as MCS unit equipped with energy storage so it can undertake offgrid charging to the EV outside FCS without connected to the power grid.

MCS unit should be in the form of truck-type vehicle equipped with several charging outlet to conduct charging for EVs inside or outside FCS area. When conducting off-grid charging outside FCS area, MCS power source would come from energy storage equipped inside the MCS.

However, their poor crystallization induced the low conductivity, which could largely limit the electrochemical performance of the porous CNFs. In this research, porous CNFs with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were prepared by electrospinning and high temperature carbonization. The introduction of SWCNTs into porous CNFs could largely enhance the conductivity of the porous CNF nanotextiles, thus the electrochemical performance of the composite nanotextile was largely enhanced. The specific capacitance of the composite could achieve 417 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and keep 193 F/g at the high current density of 10 A/g. Furthermore its specific capacitance could keep 96% after 2000 cycles of charge/discharge at the current density of 10 A/g.

On the other hand, optimum sizing of renewable energy based small scale hybrid systems is also a topic that is widely covered by the existing literature. In this study, the sizing of additional distributed generation (DG) and energy storage systems (ESSs) to be applied in smart households, that due to DR activities have a different daily demand profile compared with normal household profiles, is investigated. To the best knowledge of the authors this is the first attempt in the literature to investigate this issue, also including step-wise decreasing cost functions for DG and ESS, varying load and DG production profiles seasonally, and weekday-weekend horizons for a long-term analysis period. The study is conducted using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for home energy management system (HEM) modeling and techno-economical sizing.

Microgrid (MG) systems comprising of solar arrays with battery energy storage studied in this paper desire high levels of autonomy, seeking to meet desired demand at all times. Large energy storage capacity is required for high levels of autonomy, but much of this expensive capacity goes unused for a majority of the year due to seasonal fluctuations of solar generation. In this paper, a model-based study of MGs comprised of solar generation and battery storage shows the relationship between system autonomy and battery utilization applied to multiple demand cases using a single particle battery model (SPM). The SPM allows for more accurate state-of-charge and utilization estimation of the battery than previous studies of renewably powered systems that have used empirical models. The increased accuracy of battery state estimation produces a better assessment of system performance. Battery utilization will depend on the amount of variation in solar insolation as well as the type of demand required by the MG. Consumers must balance autonomy and desired battery utilization of a system within the needs of their grid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The electrochemical behaviour of oxidation and reduction reactions is measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The [Co(phen)3]2+ can be oxidized to [Co(phen)3]3+ and reduced to [Co(phen)3]+. A theoretical cell potential of 1.45 V for one-electron disproportionation reaction is obtained. The electrode reactions show quasi-reversible behaviour and are diffusion controlled. The diffusion coefficients of [Co(phen)3]2+ for oxidation and reduction reactions are calculated to be 1.35-2.34 × 10-6 cm2 s-1 and 2.50-4.35 × 10-6 cm2 s-1, respectively.

The alloys were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, pressure-concentration-temperature characterization, halfcell electrochemical tests, and sealed full-cell tests. After an annealing process at 960 °C for 5 h, the main matrix of the Al-free base alloy shifted from AB3 phase into an A2B7 phase. Annealed alloy samples incorporating Al promoted the AB5 phase over the A2B7 phase. The annealing treatment (AB3 to A2B7) increased the gaseous phase hydrogen storage capacity and lowered the plateau pressure and hysteresis in the absorptionedesorption isotherms. The addition of Al in the annealed samples (A2B7 to AB5) decreased gaseous phase hydrogen storage and electrochemical capacities, decreased high rate dischargeability, but increased cycle stability.

In the present work, we report a facile and simple hydrothermal method to synthesize the nanocomposite of SnO2 dodecahedral nanocrystals (DNCs) anchored on GS as an advanced anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Benefiting from the unique properties of graphene, the SnO2 DNCs-GS nanocomposite exhibits significant enhanced Li-battery performance compared with the pure SnO2 DNCs. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the SnO2 DNC-GS electrode are 1653.2 and 1085.6 mA h g-1, respectively. After 50 cycles, it still exhibits a high discharge capacity of 783.9 mA h g-1 at the current density of 200 mA g-1. Remarkably, the discharge capacity of the SnO2 DNCs-GS can still retain as high as 730.3 mA h g-1 at a high rate of 5 A g-1, indicating good rate capability.

Battery packs are constructed especially in energy storage devices to provide sufficient voltage and capacity. However, engineering practice indicates that battery packs always fade more critically than cells. We investigate the evolution of battery pack capacity loss by analyzing cell aging mechanisms using the ""Electric quantity - Capacity Scatter Diagram (ECSD)"" from a system point of view. The results show that cell capacity loss is not the sole contributor to pack capacity loss. The loss of lithium inventory variation at anodes between cells plays a significant role in pack capacity evolution.

Li-ion battery is one of the most important technological alternatives for high capacity energy storage and related industrial applications. State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion batteries plays a critical role in their deployment from economic, safety, and availability aspects. Most, if not all, of the studies related to SoH estimation focus on the measurement of a new parameter/physical phenomena related to SoH, or development of new statistical/computational methods using several parameters. This paper presents a new approach for SoH estimation for Li-ion battery systems with multiple battery cells: The main idea is a new circuit topology which enables separation of battery cells into two groups, main and test batteries, whenever a SoH related measurement is to be conducted. All battery cells will be connected to the main battery during the normal mode of operation. When a measurement is needed for SoH estimation, some of the cells will be separated from the main battery, and SoH estimation related measurements will be performed on these units. Compared to classical SoH measurement methods which deal with whole battery system, the proposed method estimates the SoH of the system by separating a small but representative set of cells. While SoH measurements are conducted on these isolated cells, remaining cells in the main battery continue to function in normal mode, albeit in slightly reduced performance levels. Preliminary experimental results are quite promising, and validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Technical details of the proposed circuit architecture are also summarized in the paper. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Battery management system; Health estimation; Li-ion batteries; Remaining useful life; State of","Battery management systems; Health; Ions; Separation; Circuit architectures; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Estimation methodologies; Measurement methods; Performance level; Remaining useful lives; State of; Technological alternatives; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920179250

There is a lack of a standard methodology, however, that can be used to select or compare the effectiveness of different additives. A systematic experimental survey was carried out in this study to compare a wide range of additives including transitions metals, transition metal oxides, hydrides, intermetallic compounds, and carbon materials, with respect to their effects on dehydrogenation properties of MgH2. MgH2 with various additives were prepared by using a high-energy-high-pressure planetary ball milling method and characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The results showed that additives such as Ti and V-based metals, hydride, and certain intermetallic compounds have strong catalytic effects. Additives such as Al, In, Sn, Si showed minor effects on the kinetics of the dehydrogenation of MgH2, while exhibiting moderate thermodynamic destabilizing effects. In combination, MgH2 with both kinetic and thermodynamic additives, such as the MgH2-In-TiMn2 system, exhibited a drastically decreased dehydrogenation temperature. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Dehydrogenation temperature; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Magnesium hydride","Ball milling; Dehydrogenation; Enzyme kinetics; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallics; Kinetics; Surveys; Thermogravimetric analysis; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Carbon material; Catalytic effects; Dehydrogenation properties; Destabilizing effect; Experimental survey; Hydrogen storage properties; Magnesium hydride; Planetary ball milling; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919666987

The effects of metallic cations, H+ and anions on the structures and morphologies of MnO2 were investigated systematically. The experimental results indicated that cations played a significant part in the formation of MnO2 with different structures. When K+ ions were in competition with H+ ions in solution, different MnO2 structures were formed. α-MnO2 was formed when the amount of K+ was higher than the amount of H+, whereas a higher amount of H+ was favorable for the growth of β-MnO2 structures. When the concentration of K+ was much greater than that of H+, δ-MnO2 was obtained. Possible formation mechanisms are proposed based on a series of controlled experiments. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors based on different types of MnO2 electrodes were investigated in detail. The specific capacitance measured for MnO2 strongly depended on the crystallographic structure and decreased in the order α-MnO2 &gt; δ-MnO2 &gt; β-MnO2 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. A specific capacitance of 535 F g-1 was obtained for α-MnO2, but was only 155 F g-1 for β-MnO2. α-MnO2 was more suitable for use as the working electrode at high current densities.

The electrochemical performance of the Li-O2 battery depends largely on the material and architecture of the catalytic cathode. In this work, we propose a unique design of a binder-free catalytic cathode for Li-O2 batteries. The electrode consists of a novel mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid on three-dimensional graphene (3D-G) grown directly on the skeleton of Ni foam. The Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst exhibits a good catalytic effect for Li-O2 batteries, where Au directs the growth of Li2O2 mainly on the top of mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4, and induces the crystallization of Li2O2 into the thin-flake or thin-film form that is found to decompose relatively easily compared with the large-particle form upon charging. Mushroom-like NiCo2O4 provides additional catalytic sites and acts as the support for both Au and Li2O2. A Li-O2 battery with the Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst can deliver a capacity of around 1275 mA h g-1 at 42.5 mA g-1.

To this end, we have constructed electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), also referred to as supercapacitors, using thick, ultracompressible graphene-coated carbon nanotube aerogels as electrodes. These electrodes showed a high capacitance in both aqueous and room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes, achieving between 60 and100 F/g, respectively, with the performance stable over hundreds of charge/discharge cycles and at high rates exceeding 1 V/s. This performance was retained fully under 90% compression of the systems, allowing us to construct cells with high volumetric capacitances of ∼5-18 F/cm3 in aqueous and RTIL electrolytes, respectively, which are 50-100 times higher than comparable compressible EDLCs (∼0.1 F/cm3). Further, the volumetric capacitances approach values reported for compressible pseudocapacitors (∼15-30 F/cm3) but without the degraded lifetime and reversibility that typically plague compressible pseudocapacitors. The electrodes demonstrated largely strain-invariant ion transport with no change in capacitance and high-rate performance even at 90% compressive strain. This material serves as an excellent platform for exploring the possibility for use of extremely compressible EDLCs with negligible degradation in capacitance in applications such as electric vehicles and wearable electronics. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","aerogels; carbon nanotubes; graphene; supercapacitors; ultracompressible","Aerogels; Capacitance; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Graphene; Ionic liquids; Supercapacitor; Charge/discharge cycle; Electrochemical energy storage; Emerging applications; High-rate performance; Mechanical deformation; Room temperature ionic liquids; ultracompressible; Volumetric capacitance; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924546610

The high energy density 378.5 Wh kg-1 is also obtained. Furthermore, the AC electrode in the redox active Na2MoO4 electrolyte shows the excellent capacitance retention of 88.2% for over 1000 cycles.

The flow distribution is a critical parameter affecting the thermal performance but has rarely been considered for dual-media TES systems in previous studies. This study analyzes the influence of the flow distributions at the inlet and outlet of a salt-rock dual-media thermocline TES tank on the thermal performance. The flow distribution is characterized by radial component, and a two-temperature model is used to investigate the thermal performance of the thermocline tank. The model is first validated against experiment data available in the literature and then used to study the discharge process of the thermocline thermal storage tank for various flow distributions. The results show that even with a large (80% of the area) flow blockage at the inlet, the flow distribution has only a limited influence on the useable energy output (<3% change) of the dual-media storage tank. In fact, the flow non-uniformities reduce the thickness of the thermocline layer and slightly increase the useable energy output, whereas non-uniformities at the top outlet slightly decrease the output. An entropy generation analysis, including the effects from diffusion and interstitial heat transfer, is performed to further explain these phenomena. The interstitial heat transfer is found to be the main cause for the entropy generation in the discharge. Flow non-uniformities are also found to reduce the entropy generation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Dual-media; Entropy analysis; Flow distribution; Thermal energy storage; Thermocline","Digital storage; Energy storage; Entropy; Fused salts; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Solar energy; Stream flow; Tanks (containers); Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Concentrated solar power; Dual media; Energy storage systems; Entropy analysis; Entropy generation analysis; Flow distribution; Thermocline thermal energy storages; Two Temperature Model; Inlet flow; data set; energy efficiency; entropy; heat transfer; numerical model; performance assessment; temperature effect; thermocline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921260269

This paper provides data that are useful for benchmarking and validation of numerical models that account for natural convection in the molten PCM. Two different PCMs are investigated: the free-form PCM-Rubitherm® RT 28 HC; and the microencapsulated PCM-Micronal® DS 5001 X. In terms of practical applications, the main goal is to discuss which PCM type is better for building applications. The time required for the melting and solidification fronts to reach the mid-plane of the cavities is presented as a function of the PCM type. During charging, the control-temperature value on the hot surface of the test-sample and the period of thermal-regulation are investigated. It is shown that the free PCM is preferable for the thermal control of vertical systems as both parameters are improved due to natural convection. The use of microencapsulated PCMs allows accelerating the charging process with almost no thermal stratification. However, in this case the control-temperature effect and the thermal-regulation period are both reduced. Regarding the discharging process, subcooling plays an important role during the solidification of the free PCM and its effect cannot be neglected when modelling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Heat transfer; Natural convection; Phase change material; Rectangular cavity; Subcooling","Cavity resonators; Digital storage; Energy storage; Heat transfer; Melting; Microencapsulation; Natural convection; Solidification; Temperature control; Thermal variables control; Building applications; Control temperatures; Discharging process; Melting and solidification; Rectangular cavity; Subcoolings; Thermal regulation; Validation of numerical model; Phase change materials; convection; cooling; data set; experimental study; heat transfer; melting; numerical model; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921026540

Herein, a novel rigid-flexible gel polymer electrolyte is introduced to enhance the cyclability of LiMn2O4/graphite battery at elevated temperature. The polymer electrolyte consists of a robust natural cellulose skeletal incorporated with soft segment poly(ethyl α-cyanoacrylate). The introduction of the cellulose effectively overcomes the drawback of poor mechanical integrity of the gel polymer electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the poly(ethyl α-cyanoacrylate) matrices effectively dissociate the lithium salt to facilitate ionic transport and thus has a higher ionic conductivity at room temperature. Ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte is 3.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature. The gel polymer electrolyte remarkably improves the cycling performance of LiMn2O4-based batteries, especially at elevated temperatures. The capacity retention after the 100th cycle is 82% at 55 °C, which is much higher than that of liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in carbonate solvents). The polymer electrolyte can significantly suppress the dissolution of Mn2+ from surface of LiMn2O4 because of strong interaction energy of Mn2+ with PECA, which was investigated by DFT calculation. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","Li-ion battery; LiMn2O4; poly(ethyl α-cyanoacrylate); polymer electrolyte","Cellulose; Density functional theory; Flexible couplings; Ionic conductivity; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese compounds; Cyanoacrylates; Cycling performance; Elevated temperature; Gel polymer electrolytes; LiMn2O4; Mechanical integrity; Polymer electrolyte; Rigid flexible coupling; Polyelectrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924250182

In this study, an exclusive strategy is presented toward directly in situ growing reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogels inside the 3D porous carbon fabrics for engineering the interfaces of the resulting binary 3D architectures.

Large S8 and small S2-4 molecules are successfully infiltrated into 22 nm mesopores and 0.5 nm micropores, respectively. We successfully investigate the effect of sulfur immobilization in mesopores and micropores on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery based on NDC-sulfur hybrid cathodes. The large S8 molecules in 22 nm mesopores can be removed by a prolonged heat treatment, with only small molecules of S2-4 immobilized in micropores of NDC matrices. The NDC/S2-4 hybrid exhibits excellent cycling performance, high Coulombic efficiency, and good rate capability as cathode for Li-S batteries. The confinement of smaller S2-4 molecules in the micropores of NDS efficiently avoids the loss of active sulfur and formation of soluble high-order Li polysulfides. The porous carbon can buffer the volume expansion and contraction changes, promising a stable structure for cathode. Furthermore, N doping in MOF-derived carbon not only facilitates the fast charge transfer but also is helpful in building a stronger interaction between carbon and sulfur, strengthening immobilization ability of S2-4 in micropores.

After chemical activation by 6 M HNO3, the specific surface areas decreased significantly, but the specific capacitances increased remarkably in both alkaline (3 M KOH) and neutral (0.5 M Na2SO4) electrolytes. Analysis of the surface structure and composition showed that the chemical activation introduced oxygen-containing functional groups on carbon surface, which are responsible for the enhancement of supercapacitive performances revealed by electrochemical tests.

Due to the unique encapsulated structure and continuous graphene network in the matrix, such a composite PCM holds a good shape-stable property, which prevents the leakage of paraffin above its melting point. In addition, it inherits the intrinsic thermally and electrically conductive nature of the embedded graphene, and thus shows enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity compared to pure paraffin.

However, the intrinsic insulating properties of sulfur, the dissolution of polysulfides, and the huge volume expansion during cycling still hinder their practical application. We introduced the electroactive polymer poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) into the lithium-sulfur system as a conductive matrix and sulfur reservoir. Using a facile two-step dissolution-precipitation treatment, novel core-shell sulfur quantum dot/PVK (SQD/PVK) nanocomposites were synthesized, in which a large number of SQDs (about 5 nm in size) with plenty of internal void spaces were encapsulated in the PVK shell. The sulfur core consisted of uniformly dispersed SQDs and large void spaces, which formed effective transportation pathways for both electrons and ions among the SQDs. They also acted as a buffer zone to accommodate the volume expansion during cycling and facilitated wetting of the electrolyte. The conducting PVK shell coated on the surface of the sulfur core can restrain dissolution of the polysulfide and suppress the shuttle effect.

The PVA-H2SO4-IC gel polymer has excellent bending, compressing and stretching mechanical properties. As expected, the ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte increased by 188% up to 20.27 mS cm-1 while introducing IC as the redox mediator in the PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte. Simultaneously, specific capacitance is increased by 112.2% (382 F g-1) and energy density (13.26 W h kg-1) is also increased. Furthermore, the fabricated device shows superior charge-discharge stability. After 3000 cycles, its capacitive retention ratio is still as high as 80.3%. This result may be due to the fact that the IC can act as a plasticizer and redox mediator, and the supercapacitor combines the double-layer characteristic of carbon-based supercapacitors and the faradaic reaction characteristic of batteries energy-storage processes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Activated carbon; Capacitors; Carbon; Electrolytes; Electrolytic capacitors; Mechanical properties; Polymers; Separators; Solid electrolytes; Charge-discharge; Fabricated device; Faradaic reactions; Gel electrolyte; Gel polymer electrolytes; Retention ratio; Solid-state supercapacitors; Specific capacitance; Polyelectrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922734701

Furthermore, growing interest in decreasing our dependence on petroleum necessitates the development of safe and efficient energy storage for transportation. Li-ion batteries have emerged as the premier candidate to meet these demands; however, such systems are limited by thermal hazards (runaway reactions, fires, explosions), which become increasingly dangerous in large-format batteries. We have developed an electrolyte system comprising poly(ethylene oxide), an ionic liquid and lithium salt that exhibits an intrinsic mechanism for inhibiting device operation when the temperature increases beyond a given threshold, which is attributed to polymer-ionic liquid phase separation. In the following article, we describe how the thermally activated phase separation causes a decrease in ion conductivity, thereby affecting the concentration of ions at the electrode, in addition to an increase in charge transfer resistance from the formation of a polymer coating on the porous electrode. Such mixtures provide a transformative approach to regulating electrochemical processes, which is necessary to achieve inherently safe operation of large format Li-ion batteries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Charge transfer; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Ethylene; Ionic liquids; Ions; Liquids; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Petroleum transportation; Phase separation; Plastic coatings; Polyethylene oxides; Charge transfer resistance; Electrochemical energy conversions; Electrochemical process; Elevated temperature; Intrinsic mechanisms; Polymer ionic liquids; Temperature increase; Thermally activated; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922715112

However, common practice centers on assembly with chemically reduced graphene oxide sheets, which have a tendency to severely aggregate during processing. More direct and facile is the LbL assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and their subsequent electrochemical reduction. Here, we demonstrate porous (void fraction = 0.625) LbL electrodes comprised of electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) sheets and polyaniline nanofibers (PANI NFs) for use in non-aqueous energy storage systems. Our approach is also promising for deposition onto complex surfaces, as demonstrated here by the successful assembly onto cotton fabric. Both PANI NFs and ERGO sheets store charge, bear conductivity, and provide a highly porous architecture, which facilitates the mass transport of ions. The nature of PANI NF/GO LbL assembly and growth is first presented, which we find to be affected by assembly pH. The confirmation of the electrochemical reduction step is then discussed, followed by the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrodes in a non-aqueous lithium metal battery.

Alkaline Zn-MnO2 cells, if cycled at reduced depth of discharge (DOD), have been found to achieve substantial cycle life with battery costs projected to be in the range of $100 to 150 per kWh (delivered). Commercialization of rechargeable Zn-MnO2 batteries has in the past been hampered due to poor cycle life. In view of this, the work reported here focuses on the long-term rechargeability of prismatic MnO2 cathodes at reduced DOD when exposed to the effects of Zn anodes and with no additives or specialty materials. Over 3000 cycles is shown to be obtainable at 10% DOD with energy efficiency &gt;80%. The causes of capacity fade during long-term cycling are also investigated and appear to be mainly due to the formation of irreversible manganese oxides in the cathode. Analysis of the data indicates that capacity loss is rapid in the first 250 cycles, followed by a regime of stability that can last for thousands of cycles. A model has been developed that captures the behavior of the cells investigated using measured state of charge (SOC) data as input. An approximate economic analysis is also presented to evaluate the economic viability of Zn-MnO2 batteries based on the experiments reported here. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity fade model; Cycle life; Film resistance; Rechargeable zinc-manganese dioxide battery; Zn-MnO2 battery model","Battery management systems; Cathodes; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Manganese; Manganese oxide; Zinc; Battery modeling; Capacity fade; Cycle lives; Film resistance; Zinc-manganese; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912557548

Given that no other widely available technology meets all the EES requirements, reversible (or regenerative) solid oxide cells (ReSOCs) working in both fuel cell (power producing) and electrolysis (fuel producing) modes are envisioned as a technology capable of providing highly efficient and cost-effective EES. However, there are still many challenges and questions from cell materials development to system level operation of ReSOCs that should be addressed before widespread application. This paper presents a novel system based on ReSOCs that employ a thermal management strategy of promoting exothermic methanation within the ReSOC cell-stack to provide thermal energy for the endothermic steam/CO2 electrolysis reactions during charging mode (fuel producing). This approach also serves to enhance the energy density of the stored gases. Modeling and parametric analysis of an energy storage concept is performed using a physically based ReSOC stack model coupled with thermodynamic system component models. Results indicate that roundtrip efficiencies greater than 70% can be achieved at intermediate stack temperature (680 °C) and elevated stack pressure (20 bar). The optimal operating condition arises from a tradeoff between stack efficiency and auxiliary power requirements from balance of plant hardware. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Co-electrolysis; Electrical energy storage; Reversible solid oxide cell; Solid oxide fuel cell; System modeling","Cost effectiveness; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Rhenium compounds; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Co-electrolysis; Electrical energy storage systems; Electrical energy storages; Optimal operating conditions; Reversible solid oxide cells; System modeling; Thermal management strategy; Thermodynamic systems; Density of gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912550402

However, extracting graphite from the minerals usually involves a complex and polluted purification process. Here, natural microcrystalline graphite minerals were directly used to produce high-quality graphene microsheets at a high yield of >70% through a scalable electrochemical & mechanical exfoliation approach. The graphene microsheets present the features of small sheet sizes of 0.2-0.6 μm2 and <5 atomic layers, few defects and high purity.

The graphene products were used for energy-storage electrodes for a supercapacitor and a lithium ion battery. The supercapacitor reaches a high-rate areal performance of 77 mF cm-2 area capacity at a high charge/discharge rate of 20 mA cm-2.

The obtained composite has a uniform Ni core of ∼5 to 10 nm, and a carbon surface layer of ∼2 nm, which avoids aggregation and pulverization of inner nanoparticles and serves as a protective layer of Ni cores from dissolution during electrochemical reactions. In addition, the oleate decomposition during calcination leads to the formation of mesopores, which enable sufficient interaction between electrolyte and inner active materials and provides a high surface area of 71 m2 g-1 for electrochemical reaction and efficient pathways for electrolyte diffusion. Moreover, the introduction of conductive carbon blacks to carbon fibers substrate significantly reduces the internal resistance and leads to enhanced electrochemical properties.

At present, carbon or catalyst-supporting carbon materials are widely used for cathode materials of Li-O2 battery. However, the unique electrode reaction and complex side reactions lead to numerous hurdles that have to be overcome. The pore blocking caused by the solid products and the byproducts generated from the side reactions severely limit the capacity performance and cycling stability. Thus, there is a great need to develop carbon materials with optimized pore structure and tunable surface chemistry to meet the special requirement of Li-O2 battery. Here, we propose a strategy of vacuum-promoted thermal expansion to fabricate one micron-sized graphene matrix with a hierarchical meso-/macroporous structure, combining with a following deoxygenation treatment to adjust the surface chemistry by reducing the amount of oxygen and selectively removing partial unstable groups. The as-made graphene demonstrates dramatically tailored pore characteristics and a well-tuned surface chemical environment. When applied in Li-O2 battery as cathode, it exhibits an outstanding capacity up to 19 800 mA h g-1 and is capable of enduring over 50 cycles with a curtaining capacity of 1000 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1000 mA g-1.

In the present work, a facile, cost-effective green method is developed to in situ fabricate Ni(OH)2 hexagonal platelets on Ni foam as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode with high performance. The Ni(OH)2 hexagonal platelets are self-grown on three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam by a one-step hydrothermal treatment of Ni foam in a 15 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution without the use of nickel salts, acids, bases, or post-treatments. The as-prepared Ni(OH)2 hexagonal platelets-Ni foam (HNF) electrode can be used directly as a supercapacitor electrode material, thereby avoiding the need for binders and conducting agents. The Ni(OH)2 hexagonal platelets demonstrate high capacitance (2534 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1) and excellent cycling stability (97% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1). The fabrication method developed here has the significant advantage of low-cost, facile, green, and additive-free processing, and it is therefore a promising route for preparing self-supported metal (hydr)oxide electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors and other energy-storage devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Binders; Capacitance; Capacitors; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Platelets; Capacitance retention; Electrochemical performance; Electrode material; Fabrication method; Hexagonal platelets; Hydrothermal treatments; Supercapacitor electrodes; Threedimensional (3-d); Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921492648

In a thermal storage system, a dual-media thermal storage tank is typically adopted in industry for the purpose of reducing the use of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) which is usually expensive. While the sensible heat storage system (SHSS) has been well studied, a dual-media latent heat storage system (LHSS) still needs more attention and study. The volume sizing of the thermal storage tank, considering daily cyclic operations, is of particular significance. In this paper, a general volume sizing strategy for LHSS is proposed, based on an enthalpy-based 1D transient model. One example was presented to demonstrate how to apply this strategy to obtain an actual storage tank volume. With this volume, a LHSS can supply heat to a thermal power plant with the HTF at temperatures above a cutoff point during a desired 6. h of operation. This general volume sizing strategy is believed to be of particular interest for the solar thermal power industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrated Solar Power (CSP); Enthalpy-based 1D transient model; General volume sizing strategy; Latent heat storage system (LHSS); Phase change material (PCM)","Energy utilization; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Thermoelectric power plants; Concentrated solar power; Concentrated solar thermal power; General volume sizing strategy; Latent heat storage system; Sensible heat storages; Thermal power plants; Thermal storage system; Transient model; Storage (materials); concentration (composition); electricity industry; energy planning; enthalpy; latent heat flux; power plant; solar power; storage structure; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918836117

Among anode candidate materials, hard carbon is very attractive due to its high capacity and low cost. However, hard carbon anodes often suffer a low first-cycle Coulombic efficiency and fast capacity fading. In this study, we discover that doping graphene oxide into sucrose, the precursor for hard carbon, can effectively reduce the specific surface area of hard carbon to as low as 5.4 m2/g.

In this article, we focus on a detailed study on materials matching between functional materials and their conductive substrate, as well as enhancement of the tolerance to stretch-induced performance degradation of stretchable supercapacitors, which are essential for the design of a stretchable device. It is revealed that, being widely utilized as the electrode material of the stretchable supercapacitor, metal oxides such as MnO2 nanosheets have serious strain-induced performance degradation due to their rigid structure. In comparison, with conducting polymers like a polypyrrole (PPy) film as the electrochemically active material, the performance of stretchable supercapacitors can be well preserved under strain. Therefore, a smart design is to combine PPy with MnO2 nanosheets to achieve enhanced tolerance to strain-induced performance degradation of MnO2-based supercapacitors, which is realized by fabricating an electrode of PPy-penetrated MnO2 nanosheets. The composite electrodes exhibit a remarkable enhanced tolerance to strain-induced performance degradation with well-preserved performance over 93% under strain. The detailed morphology and electrochemical impedance variations are investigated for the mechanism analyses. Our work presents a systematic investigation on the selection and matching of electrode materials for stretchable supercapacitors to achieve high performance and great tolerance to strain, which may guide the selection of functional materials and their substrate materials for the next-generation of stretchable electronics. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","MnO2 nanosheets; polypyrrole film; stretch-induced performance degradation; stretchable supercapacitors; tolerance enhancement","Conducting polymers; Electrodes; Flexible electronics; Functional materials; Manganese oxide; Nanosheets; Polypyrroles; Substrates; Supercapacitor; Composite electrode; Conductive substrates; Electrochemical impedance; Performance degradation; Polypyrrole film; Strain-induced performance; Stretchable electronics; Structural breakdown; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922417979

Herein, we created nanosized cobalt oxide anchored 3D arrays of carbon nanosheets by the control of calcination condition. The uniformly dispersed Co3O4 nanocrystals on carbon nanosheets held a diameter down to ∼5 nm.

After 500 cycles, the cobalt oxide-carbon nansheets hybrid display a reversible capacity of about 970 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1.

In this paper, a simple and convenient method is developed for improving the catalytic activity of CNTs in a controlled way. By simple heating treatment in the air, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) change with special morphologies, compositions and abundant defects (denoted as h-CNT). Those defects significantly improve the electrocatalytic performances for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which proceeds in a nearly four-electron pathway. The heating conditions have important effects on the structures and defect properties of h-CNTs which show a positive correlation between the defect levels and ORR performances. The small amounts of iron residues originated from nanotube growth and nitrogen doping during heating treatment also contribute to some catalytic activity. The inner walls of h-CNT remain intact during heating treatment and provide sufficient conductivity which facilitates charge transport during ORR. The h-CNT electrocatalyst shows better methanol tolerance and long-term durability than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media which makes it an alternative cathode catalyst in fuel cells. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","carbon nanotubes; defects; heating treatment; oxygen reduction reaction","Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Defects; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Heating; Oxygen; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Reduction; Virtual storage; Yarn; Electrocatalytic performance; Electrochemical energy conversions; Heating conditions; Heating treatments; Long term durability; Methanol tolerance; Oxygen reduction reaction; Positive correlations; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919909278

In this work, electrochemical performance for Li-rich layered oxides Li1.20Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 was systematically investigated as a function of temperature and duration. Plenty of techniques like SEM, EDS, EIS, ARC, Raman, XRD, and XPS were utilized to characterize the structures, valence states, compositions, particle sizes, and morphologies of the layered oxides with varying temperature and duration. The results reveal that room temperature storage may alter surface kinetics, but hardly influence the electrochemical performance. While in the case of high temperature storage in pristine state, cycling stability is highly dependent on the storage duration. The degradation mechanism at high temperature storage with prolonged duration is demonstrated to be the accumulation of surface species like LiF/LixPFyOz initiated by the strong reactions between LiPF6 electrolyte and electrode. The results reported here may shed light on predicting electrochemical performance by surface analysis and also provide vital hints on enhancing the high-temperature storage stability of Li-rich layered oxides. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although several defrosting methods have been reported, the frosting and defrosting processes reduced energy efficiency and resulted in, in some cases, heat pump breakdown. To solve this problem, a novel frost-free air-source heat pump water heater (ASHPWH) system has been developed, which coupled with an extra heat exchanger coated by a solid desiccant (EHECSD) with an energy storage device (ESD). Based on the previous studies, a further analysis and comprehensive research on the novel frost-free ASHPWH system is presented in this paper. The dynamic characteristics of the novel system are investigated experimentally in different ambient conditions. An experimental setup and experimental procedures are described in detail. Thereafter, the dehumidification efficiency and regeneration efficiency of EHECSD, suction and discharge pressures of the compressor, the temperature of PCM are evaluated during the heating and regeneration modes respectively. Results indicate that the system can keep the evaporator frost-free for 32, 34, 36. min during heating mode at the ambient temperatures of -3. °C, 0. °C and 3. °C and 85% RH. Compared with the reverse-cycle defrosting (RCD), COP of the frost-free ASHPWH are 17.9% and 3.4% higher at the ambient temperature of -3. °C and 3. °C respectively.

An attempt to meet this crisis was carried out by a unique, microwave-assisted method which has enabled the generation of a novel Si, P co-doped carbon (SiPDC) for supercapacitor applications. The microwave-assisted method is useful in developing SiPDC at a rapid and economical fashion that does not employ any inert or reducing gases, but is high yielding. Varying proportions of precursor materials were utilized to generate four SiPDCs (SiPDC-1, SiPDC-2, SiPDC-3 and SiPDC-4) with varying contents of dopants as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results. Surface area and pore size analysis revealed that SiPDC-2 has a surface area of 641.51 m2 g-1, abundant micropores, mesopores and macropores which are critical for electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC). Of all the SiPDCs, SiPDC-2 exhibited highest capacitance of 276 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 and 244 F g-1 in 6 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Galvanostatic charge-discharge studies performed in 6 M KOH establish the high capacitance of SiPDC-2. SiPDC-2 also exhibited excellent electrochemical stability in 1 M H2SO4 and 6 M KOH. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Within the optimization process, a preset cost function is employed to evaluate the HESS life cycle cost based on a dynamic degradation model of the LiFePO4 battery, which is initially proposed by us. For system hybridization, the battery size is optimized according to the requested minimal mileage, while the optimal configuration of the SC pack (i.e., the numbers of the SC modules in series and parallel) is determined using the DP approach. It is shown that the life cycle cost of the HESS initially decreases rapidly with the addition of SCs, though the rate of this reduction decreases as the amount of SC increases. The HESS candidates occurring in the transition area can therefore be regarded as the best solutions. For the energy split strategy, several control rules can be extracted from the DP results, and a near-optimal rule-based strategy is proposed in this paper. When compared to the battery-only configuration, the HESS controlled by the rule-based strategy can reduce 47% and 60% of the ESS life cycle cost along the typical China Bus Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, respectively. This paper also proves that a well-tuned rule-based strategy, which can be easily implemented in a vehicle, presents rather good performance when compared to the DP approach. In addition, the proposed strategy performance can be further improved by increasing the SC usage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic programing approach; Electric city bus; Hybrid energy storage system (HESS); Integrated optimization; LiFePO4 battery degradation; Optimal sizing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914165417

For wireless sensor network applications, supercapacitor energy is a critical parameter for system design and power management. However, estimation of supercapacitor energy using the rated capacitance may result in a significant error. To reduce the error, this paper proposes to use a linear capacitance for supercapacitor energy estimation based on the supercapacitor physics. A linear capacitance composed of a constant capacitance and a voltage-dependent capacitance is determined by conducting a constant power charge or discharge test. Evaluation results for a variety of supercapacitor samples with different rated capacitance and voltage demonstrate that using the proposed linear capacitance is more accurate than using the rated capacitance to estimate supercapacitor energy. Moreover, the results show that using the linear capacitance determined through a high power charge experiment can minimize the energy estimation error. This observation can serve as a guideline to design the experiment in a way that the determined linear capacitance results in the minimum supercapacitor energy estimation error. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Constant power test; Energy estimation; Linear capacitance; Supercapacitor; Wireless sensor network","Capacitance; Capacitors; Experiments; Rating; Constant capacitance; Constant power; Energy estimation; Energy storage systems; Evaluation results; Super capacitor; Voltage-dependent capacitances; Wireless sensor network applications; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911939932

The long durability, high power and energy density, and low cost needed for stationary energy storage posing constant challenges for conventional battery technology inspire people to explore new kinds of energy storage technologies. Here, we assembled an aqueous rechargeable sodium ion battery by using NaMnO2 as a cathode material and NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites as anode materials in 2 M CH3COONa aqueous electrolyte. This battery system could work in a wide voltage range from 0.5 V to 1.8 V, giving an energy density of 30 W h kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials) and could retain 75% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at the 5 C rate.

In this work, Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 was synthesized and novel coating was applied to enhance the performance. The pristine Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 powder was synthesized by an aqueous solution method, followed by calcination at 900 °C in air, and the surface was then modified by coating with samaria doped ceria (SDC). Both the pristine and the surface modified materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurements. The SDC coating with 1 wt.% was found to be the most effective in improving the discharge capacity. Specifically, it delivered 261 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C rate with lower initial irreversible capacity loss. This superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the function of SDC as protective layer suppressing the side reaction between the electrode and the electrolyte, and decreasing the electron charge transfer resistance, as evidenced by the collected electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As a low-cost, environmental-friendly material, biochar has the potential to replace more expensive synthesized carbon nanomaterials (e.g. carbon nanotubes) for use in future supercapacitors. To achieve high capacitance, biochar requires proper activation. A conventional approach involves mixing biochar with a strong base and baking at a high temperature. However, this process is time consuming and energy inefficient (requiring temperatures &gt;900°C). This work demonstrates a low-temperature (&lt;150°C) plasma treatment that efficiently activates a yellow pine biochar. Particularly, the effects of oxygen plasma on the biochar microstructure and supercapacitor characteristics are studied. Significant enhancement of the capacitance is achieved: 171.4 F g-1 for a 5-min oxygen plasma activation, in comparison to 99.5 F g-1 for a conventional chemical activation and 60.4 F g-1 for untreated biochar. This enhancement of the charge storage capacity is attributed to the creation of a broad distribution in pore size and a larger surface area.

In the synthesis of such nanocomposites, graphene is generally introduced by either thermally or chemically reduced graphite oxide (GO), which has poorer electric conductivity and crystallinity than mechanically exfoliated graphene. Here, we prepare few-layer graphene sheet (FLGS) with high electric conductivity, by sonicating expanded graphite in DMF solvent, and develop a simple one-pot hydrothermal method to fabricate monodispersed and ultrasmall Co3O4 nanocubes (about 4 nm in size) on the FLGS. This composite, consisting of homogeneously assembled and high crystalline Co3O4 nanocubes on the FLGS, has shown higher capacity and much better cycling stability than counterparts synthesized using GO as a precursor. The products in different synthesis stages have been characterized by TEM, FTIR and XPS to investigate the nanocube growth mechanism. We find that Co(OH)2 initially grew homogeneously on the graphene surface, then gradually oxidized to form Co3O4 nanoparticle seeds, and finally converted to Co3O4 nanocubes with caboxylated anion as surfactant.

The SC sizes of the different HESS topologies are optimized by using the dynamic programming (DP) approach, based on a dynamic degradation model of the LiFePO4 battery. The operation costs of different HESSs, including the electricity and the battery degradation costs over a whole CBDC, are minimized in the optimization process. Based on the DP results, near-optimal control strategies of different HESSs for on-line uses are proposed. Finally, the four HESS topologies are comprehensively compared from different aspects, including operation cost, initial cost, and DC bus voltage variation. Simulation results show that all HESS topologies have their merits and drawbacks, and can be used in different applications with different requirements. In addition, about 50% of the operation cost of the energy storage system is reduced by the semi-active HESSs when compared to the battery-only topology. Thus the effectiveness of adopting the SC in the HESS is verified. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests are performed, the results manifest the MWCNTs@PEDOT/PSS core-shell composites have superior capacitive behaviors and excellent cyclic stability, and a high areal capacitance of 98.1 mF cm-2 is achieved at 5 mV s-1 cyclic voltammetry scan. Furthermore, the MWCNTs@PEDOT/PSS composites exhibit obviously superior capacitive performance than that of PEDOT/PSS and PEDOT/Cl electrodes, indicating the effective composite of MWCNTs and PEDOT noticeably boosts the capacitive performance of PEDOT-based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. Such a highly stable core-shell 3D network structural composite is very promising to be used as electrode materials for the high-performance electrochemical capacitors. ©2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, its limited durability has become a major obstacle for its successful commercialization. In this study, 2-cell stacks, 25 cm cells and three-electrode half-cells are constructed to experimentally investigate the degradation characteristics of the air cathode. The results of electrochemical tests reveal that the peak power density for the 25 cm2 cell with a new air cathode is 454 mW cm-2, which is twice as the value of the used air cathode. The electrochemical impedance analysis shows that both the charge transfer resistance and the mass transfer resistance of the used air cathodes have increased, suggesting that the catalyst surface area and gas diffusion coefficient have decreased significantly. Additionally, the microstructure and morphology of the catalytic layer (CL) and gas diffusion layer (GDL) are characterized by scanning electron microscopes (SEM). SEM results confirm that the micropores in CL and GDL of the used air cathode are seriously clogged, and many catalyst particles are lost. Therefore, the performance degradation is mainly due to the clogging of micropores and loss of catalyst particles. Furthermore, hypotheses of degradation mechanism and mitigation strategies for GDL and CL are discussed briefly. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Air cathode; Degradation characteristics; Electrochemical impedance analysis; Zinc air fuel cell","Catalysts; Charge transfer; Degradation; Diffusion in gases; Electric impedance; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Microporosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Zinc; Air cathode; Charge transfer resistance; Degradation characteristics; Electrical energy storages; Electrochemical impedance analysis; Mass transfer resistances; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); Zinc air fuel cells; Cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908330538

Creating porous structures on CNFs yields larger surface area and enhanced capacitive performance. Herein, porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) were synthesized via centrifugal spinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solutions combined with thermal treatment and were used as binder-free EDLC electrodes. Three precursor fibers with PAN/PMMA weight ratios of 9/1, 7/3 and 5/5 were prepared and carbonized at 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively. The highest specific capacitance obtained was 144 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a rate capability of 74% from 0.1 to 2 A g-1 by PCNFs prepared with PAN/PMMA weight ratio of 7/3 at 900 °C.

The conversion efficiency is also highly dependent on the reaction pathway and product.

The molten salt medium is responsible for the formation of sheet morphology and allows efficient immobilization of nitrogen atoms in the carbon framework during thermal pyrolysis, resulting in high-nitrogen-content carbons. XPS results demonstrate that, different from other reported carbons, the carbon nanosheets largely contain pyrrolic and pyridinic groups, both of which are very suitable for Li storage. When the carbon nanosheets are used as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), they exhibit a high initial coulombic efficiency of ca. 63.1%, and a high and constant reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 even after 100 cycles. Moreover, they show a high-rate capability, e.g., a high capacity of 199 mA h g-1 was obtained at 3000 mA g-1 (full charge within 4 min). In contrast, commercial graphite has a value less than 20 mA h g-1 at 3000 mA g-1, showing one-tenth the capacity of the carbon nanosheet material. Such superior electrochemical performance is due to its high porosity, high nitrogen content of ca. 30 wt% and a unique two-dimensional (2D) structure. Thus, the proposed synthesis can be an alternative means for the preparation of high-nitrogen-content porous carbon with specific nitrogen species for energy storage applications.

Despite this, the absence of a suitable negative electrode material hinders their development. In this contribution, we synthesized monodispersed hard carbon spherules (HCS) from an abundant biomass of sucrose, and investigated the influence of the carbonization temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical performance. The initial coulombic efficiency of the HCS was increased to 83% by coating its surface with soft carbon through the pyrolysis of toluene. Interestingly, the plateau capacity at the low potential region increased with increasing carbonization temperature. The HCS carbonized at 1600 °C showed the highest plateau capacity (220 mA h g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 93% after 100 cycles. When coupled with an air-stable P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 positive electrode, the full cell exhibited a high initial coulombic efficiency of 76%, a mean operating voltage of 3.5 V and excellent cycling performance. The theoretical energy density of this system was estimated to be 200 W h kg-1. These promising properties are believed to be close to the level required for practical applications.

The resultant microcapsule samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine their chemical compositions and structures. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the TiO2 shell was verified by powder X-ray diffraction patterns. It was confirmed that the fluorinions could induce the phase transition from the amorphous TiO2 to the brookite-form crystals during the sol-gel process, thus resulting in a crystalline TiO2 shell for the microencapsulated n-eicosane. The scanning and transmission electron microscopy investigations indicated that all of the resultant microcapsules presented a perfect spherical shape with a uniform particle size of 1.5-2μm, and they also exhibited a well-defined core-shell structure as well as a smooth and compact shell. The crystalline TiO2 shell made the resultant microcapsules a photocatalytic activity, and therefore, these microcapsules demonstrated a good photocatalytic effect for the chemical degradation and an antimicrobial function for some of the Gram-negative bacteria. Most of all, all of the microencapsulated n-eicosane samples indicated good phase-change performance and high thermal reliability for latent-heat storage and release, and moreover, they achieved a high encapsulation efficiency and a high thermal-storage capability.

Emphasis has been placed on the thermal characterization of a single constituent storage module rather than an entire storage system, in order to precisely capture the energy exchange contributions of all the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms during the melting of a phase change material (PCM) with tailored optical properties. The equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy have been solved by using the control volume discretization approach, while the radiative transfer equation (RTE) was solved by the discrete ordinate method (DOM). The enthalpy-porosity method was used to track the PCM liquid/solid interface during the process. A parametric analysis has been performed in order to ascertain the effects of the optical thickness and the Planck, Grashof and Stefan numbers on the melting rate, as well as the total and radiative heat transfer rates at the inner surface of the shell.

A parametric investigation was performed on various concentrations of the nanofluids as well as various cooling rates during the DSC tests. In addition to the supercooling degree and latent heat of crystallization, the crystallization kinetics was also analyzed by both the Ozawa method and a modified Ozawa-based method. It was shown that dilute loading of CNTs or GNPs leads to reduction of the supercooling degree up to 5. °C due to the nucleating effect. The planarly-shaped GNPs featuring large contact area perform better than CNTs in facilitating heterogeneous nucleation, which greatly suppress crystal growth during the late phase of non-isothermal crystallization. In contrast to the case of GNPs, CNTs may be able to accelerate crystallization up to nearly 37% at relatively dilute loadings, especially when the cooling rate is low.

This research proposed integrating a new-type of shell-and-tube based phase change material (PCM) thermal storage system with conventional air-conditioner to increase cooling coefficient of performance (COP). The proposed PCM thermal storage unit uses two different kinds of media (water and air) for the heat transfer fluids (HTF). Water is used for charging loop while air is used for discharging loop. The two HTFs better fit the heat transfer needs of nighttime's free cooling harvest and daytime's condensing water use by the air-conditioning system. A numerical model for the PCM thermal storage unit has been developed, particularly with consideration of staged natural convection effects in PCM melting process. The numerical model equipped with a new PCM staged effective thermal conductivity has been validated by experimental data. Numerical study has evaluated the effects of HTF inlet temperature, mass flow rate and conductive fin height on the PCM thermal storage system's performance. Modeling results show that HTF mass flow rate and fin height need to be designed through an optimization process according to the cooling load profile and achieve best performance of the PCM thermal storage system. Effectiveness of this proposed PCM thermal storage system is generally higher than 0.5.

Thus, it is necessary to develop a parameter to indicate the energy efficiency of such unit. This paper firstly defines a parameter that indicates the ratio of heat storage of phase change thermal energy storage unit to energy consumed in pumping heat transfer fluid, which is called the energy efficiency ratio, then numerically investigates the characteristics of this parameter. The results show that the energy efficiency ratio can clearly indicate the energy efficiency of a phase change thermal energy storage unit. When the fluid flow of a heat transfer fluid is in a laminar state, the energy efficiency ratio is larger than in a turbulent state. The energy efficiency ratio of a shell-and-tube phase change thermal energy storage unit is more sensitive to the outer tube diameter. Under the same working conditions, within the heat transfer fluids studied, the heat storage property of the phase change thermal energy storage unit is best for water as heat transfer fluid.

We present a framework that enables GHG comparisons (well-to-wheel plus storage manufacturing) for three drivetrains (pure-electric, gasoline-hybrid, and plugin-hybrid), both for individual vehicles and for fleets. The framework captures effects of grid- versus vehicle-based electricity generation, grid transmission and charging losses, and manufacturing and carrying batteries. In contrast to previous work, GHG comparisons can be obtained for heterogeneous fleets of varying vehicle sizes (cars, vans, buses, trucks) and performances, without requiring forecasting of such vehicle specs and their respective market penetrations. Further, we show how a novel adaptation of the Utility Factor concept from plug-in-hybrids to mixed fleets of battery-only and gasoline-hybrids is crucial to quantifying battery-only-vehicles' impact on fleet-wide GHG. To account for regional variations and possible future technology improvements, we show scenarios over a wide spectrum of grid-carbon-intensities (50-1200gCO2e/kWh at wall), vehicle range (~5-500km), battery energy densities, and battery life-cycle GHG. Model uncertainties are quantified via sensitivity tests. Applying the framework to trip patterns of US passenger transportation, we find that owing to the interplay of GHG/km, battery size, all-electric range, and trip patterns, GHG reductions achievable from electrified transportation are smaller than previously considered (e.g., 55% reduction instead of 80%; scenario-dependent), even when assuming largely decarbonized grid-electricity. Optimal battery range that achieves lowest GHG for partially electrified fleets is different for plug-in hybrids versus pure electrics and furthermore varies strongly (~35 to ~200km) with the predominant carbon-intensity of the grid. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery vehicle; Electrified transportation; Fleet; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Range","Carbon; Electric batteries; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Manufacture; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicle transmissions; Battery vehicles; Electricity generation; Fleet; Heterogeneous fleet; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Model uncertainties; Passenger transportation; Range; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; traffic emission; transportation technology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910010812

In the project gross collector area is 11546m2 and capacity of the storage tank is 20381 tons. Several pilot solar heating systems with seasonal thermal energy storage (SHSSTES) built in Germany and North Europe since 1996 have been proven to provide stable performance and reliable high solar fraction. However due to construction cost and non-standard industrial manufacture. SHSSTES are not yet commercial prospects. In this project due to innovation in the solar collector system, water circulating system and tank design, the cost has fallen dramatically. Each part of the system has minimized cost without any compromise on performance. Also this project is a typical model of BOT (build-operate-transfer), with maximum benefit possible. This project is most likely to be commercially viable with payback period less than 6 years for this design. The influence of each part in the system is discussed through analysis of the data. © 2015 The Authors.","non-power driven circulation; seasonal thermal energy storage; solar heating system","Costs; Digital storage; Energy storage; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Project management; Tanks (containers); Technology transfer; Thermal energy; Build operate transfers; Collector systems; Commercial prospect; Construction costs; Operational experience; Payback periods; Solar heating system; Stable performance; Solar heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994885678

To make full use of solar energy the system is designed to store the solar thermal energy in the ground soil, using U-tube heat exchange in the seasons when the solar thermal energy is not in use. A simulation model was developed in TRNSYS to develop the ground storage model based on the design parameters of the GEL and weather conditions of Shanghai. The simulation results show that the usage of a solar collector can reduce the electricity use in the systems. This reduction is primarily due to the reduced operation time of the geothermal heat pump and by increasing the ground source temperature. During the simulation the interaction between the borehole heat exchanger, the geothermal heat pump and the evacuated tube collector was investigated. At the same time the load requirements were analyzed. To see how the geothermal storage is affected by the change of design parameters a base case was used. The results show that the systems performance is closely linked to the storage size. With intend to store heat a large number of boreholes with small spacing should be used. The heating of the GEL were established and the building was used as the heat load in the simulation. With a solar collector the electricity usage can be reduced by 26.1%. © 2015 The Authors.","Borehole storage; Heat Pump; Seasonal storage; Solar collector; TRNSYS","Boreholes; Electric energy storage; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heating; Heat exchangers; Heat pump systems; Heating; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Structural design; Thermal energy; Borehole heat exchangers; Electricity usage; Evacuated tube collectors; Heat pumps; Seasonal storage; Solar thermal energy; Systems performance; TRNSYS; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994796567

Hence, improved knowledge of thermochemical materials (TCMs) is critical to spur progress in TCS system development. Sodium sulfide hydrates (Na2S.nH2O, n=0-9) are highly interesting as TCMs because they exhibit a high energy density under operation conditions and are potentially readily available and affordable. Preparation methods for well-defined nonahydrate and pentahydrate crystals of Na2S were developed and the resulting samples were subjected to cycling experiments under conditions representative for TCS. Before and after cycling, crystal samples were taken and characterized using techniques like SEM/TEM, XRD. Mechanical strength was evaluated using a salt bed stability test. Based on the extensive characterization of sodium sulfide hydrate salts, a method has been proposed to improve the stability of the salt by blending it with cellulose. First trials on these composites yielded promising results with respect to improved material stability. © 2015 The Authors.","composite; cycling; hydrate; hygroscopic; material; salt; storage; thermochemical","Blending; Characterization; Chemical stability; Composite materials; Energy storage; Heat storage; Hydrates; Hydration; Materials; Mechanical stability; Salts; Sodium compounds; Stability; Sulfur compounds; Commercial systems; cycling; High energy densities; hygroscopic; Operation conditions; Thermo-chemical heat storages; thermochemical; Thermochemical storage; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994777377

It is particularly an attractive application for solar energy, because of the near coincidence of peak cooling loads with the available solar power. Currently, most of the solar cooling systems commonly used are the hot water driven lithium bromide absorption chillers. Solar absorption cooling systems are available from various reports, in large capacities up to several hundred kilowatts. In this paper, a minitype solar absorption cooling system was designed and installed in Shanghai Jiao tong University. The system mainly contains 96 m2 solar collector arrays, one absorption chiller with the rated cooling capacity of 8 kW, and a heat storage water storage tank of 3 m3 in volume. The chilled water can be delivered either into fan coils or into radiant cooling panels which are installed to satisfy the indoor thermal environment of the test room. As for the fan coil cooling mode, it was found that the average cooling output reached 3.62 kW during 8 h operation under typical weather condition of Shanghai. With regard to radiant cooling mode, an individual fresh air unit was installed for the purpose of preventing the cooling panels from condensation. Compared with the experimental results of the fan coil cooling mode, the average cooling output of the radiant cooling mode reached 4.47 kW, which increased by 23.5%. Furthermore, the PMV inside the test room was between -0.5 and 0.5, which showed great advantage in meeting the indoor thermal comfort. © 2015 The Authors.","Experimental investigation; Radiant cooling; Solar cooling","Cooling; Cooling systems; Environmental testing; Heat storage; Refrigerators; Solar energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Water absorption; Absorption chillers; Experimental investigations; Indoor thermal comfort; Indoor thermal environments; Radiant cooling; Solar cooling; Solar cooling systems; Water storage tanks; Absorption cooling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994709377

For this reason, we propose and analyse an alternative means of actuation: Controlled Passive Actuation. Controlled Passive Actuation aims at reducing the energy flow through electric actuators by actuating with a combination of an energy storage element and a Continuously Variable Transmission. In this work, we present a method where we apply a Continuously Variable Transmission with a storage element in the form of a mass to change the state of another mass (""the load""). An abstraction layer is created to abstract the inertia-driven Controlled Passive Actuation to a source of effort, a force actuator. On this abstracted system, feedback control can be applied to achieve control goals such as path tracking. With simulations and experiments, we show that inertiadriven Controlled Passive Actuation can be used to control the state of an (inertial) load.

This property of IPMC is useful in electrolysis of water (H2O) and produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases. This paper discusses the electrochemical fundamentals of electrolysis, which provides a linear relationship between the flow rate of hydrogen from electrolysis and the source current. An IPMC electrolyzer circuit model is developed to capture the electrical characteristic of IPMC. The model incorporates nonlinear capacitance, pseudo-capacitance, and a nonlinear resistance defined with a polynomial function. A state-space equation is then obtained to simulate the proposed circuit model for electrolysis.

Localization entails the determination of the position of the center of mass and orientation of a vehicle from the available measurements. In this paper, we focus on localization by using the range measurements available to a vehicle from the communication of its multiple onboard receivers with roadside beacons. The model proposed for measurement is as follows: The true distance between a receiver and a beacon is at most equal to a predetermined function of the range measurement. The proposed procedure for localization is as follows: Based on the range measurements specific to a receiver from the beacons, a finite LP (linear programming) is proposed to estimate the location of the receiver. The estimate is essentially the Chebychev center of the set of possible locations of the receiver. In the second step, the location estimates of the vehicle are corrected using rigid body motion constraints and the orientation of the rigid body is thus determined.

This results in time-delay equations in time domain and significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with FEM. The axial and torsional motions are coupled by bit-rock interactions.

Ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC), is a type of ionic electroactive polymer (EAP), and this material can exhibit large deflection with low external voltages (~5 V). This smart material can work in an aquatic environment without the impact from the aquatic pressure, so a swimming robot is one of popular applications of IPMC. Recently, several models in various methods have been found to simulate output deflection. For example, some typical models based on cantilever beams or system identification tools have been used to provide models of IPMC systems. In this paper, however, an electrical model with equivalent passive elements based on existing internal properties is introduced in order to model the system directly. On the other hand, the surface metallic electrodes and the internal Nafion® membrane can be modeled as equivalent resistors according to the properties. Finally, a novel linear time-variant (LTV) modeling method that is different from conventional models is introduced and applied to an IPMC electrical model, built on the basis of the internal environment such as surface resistance, thickness, and water distribution related to the unique working principle of IPMC.

Actuators are placed in the powertrain paths for active control, and passive mounts are employed such that the powertrain roll motion is dominant using the torque roll axis motion decoupling concept. To facilitate this study, a new 24 degree of freedom mathematical model for a coupled powertrain and frame is developed with versatility where passive only, active only, or combined active and passive powertrain paths can be selected. Active control forces are defined as constant, real valued amplitudes to counteract the dominate powertrain roll motion. Alternate path models are then quantitatively compared based on the global powertrain motion magnitudes. It is found that superior vibration control is achieved with combined paths, provided all powertrain paths are aligned with the torque roll axis coordinates.

This paper proposes a new integrated design method via decentralized control techniques to concurrently optimize the structure and the controller, which aims at minimizing the system H2 norm from the disturbance to the system cost. The integrated design problems have been formulated in the cases of a full state feedback controller and a full order output feedback controller respectively. Inspired by noticing that the control techniques are capable of optimizing both the parameters of passive springs and dampers and the controller for the mechanical system, we extend the current LTI control system to a more general framework suitable for the integrated design needs, where the structure design is treated as the passive control optimization tackled by decentralized control techniques with static output feedback, while the active controller is optimized by solving the modified Riccati equations. With the extended system framework, we transfer the original non-convex integrated optimization problem to an unconstrained optimization problem by introducing Lagrange multipliers and a Lagrange function. The gradient-based optimization method is employed to effectively find the optimality solution of the integrated design. Two design examples including an active-passive vehicle suspension system and an active-passive Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) system are designed by the proposed integrated design method.

The analytical model of the THUNDER is created based on the linear mechanical electrical constitutive law of the piezoelectric material, the linear elastic constitutive law of the substrate, and the Euler- Bernoulli beam theory. With these linear modal functions, the Rayleigh-Ritz approach was used to then obtain the reduced mechanical electrical coupled modulation equations. The analytical model is verified by the experimental results. Both the experimental and analytical results of the THUNDER's AC power output, DC power output with Rectifier Bridge and a capacitor, as well as the power output with a microcontroller energy harvesting circuit are reported. Based on the theoretical model, the analytical solution of the DC power is derived in terms of the vibration amplitude, frequency, and the electrical load.

Here, the flanges are introduced to elicit specific vortex-structure interactions, with the ultimate goal of modulating the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping experienced by the oscillating structure. The hydrodynamic forcing, incorporating added mass and hydrodynamic damping effects, is evaluated through boundary element method and computational fluid dynamics simulations. This allows to identify a model for the hydrodynamic forces in the form of a complex-valued function of three nondimensional parameters, describing oscillation frequency and amplitude and flange size. We find that the presence of the flanges results into larger fluid entrainment during the lamina oscillation, thus affecting the added mass. Further, we highlight the existence of a minimum in the hydrodynamic damping which is governed by complex dynamics of vortex-structure interaction.

This dangerous motion occurs when the payload is not directly beneath the overhead suspension point of the hoist cable. Given that cable suspension points are usually tens of feet, and perhaps hundreds of feet above the payload, it is very difficult for crane operators to know if the hoist cable is perfectly vertical before they start to lift the payload off the ground. Inevitably, some horizontal motion of the payload will occur at lift off. If an off-center lift creates substantial horizontal motion, then it can create significant hazards for the human operators, the crane, the payload, and the surrounding environment. This paper develops a three-dimensional dynamic model of off-centered lifts. The accuracy of the model is experimentally investigated using a 10-ton bridge crane. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Cables; Cranes; Elevator cables; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Robots; Wind power; Crane lifts; Experimental verification; Horizontal motion; Human operator; Lift offs; Surrounding environment; Three-dimensional dynamic models; Three-dimensional model; Human robot interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973360022

The controller-filter set facilitates robust thermal management with respect to model uncertainties and measurement noise. The proposed temperature control not only manages to track the fuel cell temperature reference, it can also be used to stabilize the output voltage. Voltage regulation is of great importance for open-cathode fuel cells as it guarantees a predictable and fixed fuel cell output voltage for given current values in spite of internal and external disturbances.

The standard therapeutic approach requires the patient to attempt to make use of the weak hand even though it is not functionally capable, which can result in feelings of frustration. Furthermore, hemiparetic patients also face challenges in completing many bimanual tasks, for example walker manipulation, that are critical to patients' independence and quality of life. A prototype therapeutic device with two supernumerary robotic fingers was used to determine if robotic fingers could functionally assist a human in the performance of bimanual tasks by observing the pose of the healthy hand. Specific focus was placed on the identification of a straightforward control routine which would allow a patient to carry out simple manipulation tasks with some intermittent input from a therapist. Part of this routine involved allowing a patient to switch between active and inactive monitoring of hand position, resulting in additional manipulation capabilities. The prototype successfully enabled a test subject to complete various bimanual tasks using the robotic fingers in place of normal hand motions. From these results, it is clear that the device could allow a hemiparetic patient to complete tasks which would previously have been impossible to perform. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Diagnosis; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Robotic arms; Robotics; Robots; Wind power; Hand motion; Hand positions; Hemiparesis; Manipulation task; Quality of life; Robotic finger; Human robot interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973352777

Because web strain and elastic modulus are functions of temperature distribution in the web, web tension resulting from elastic strain is affected by heating/cooling of the web. Based on a web tension governing equation that includes both elastic and thermal effects, a nonlinear tension control scheme is developed for control of tension in each tension zone of an R2R system.

As such, their behavior is difficult to characterize accurately across a wide range of operating conditions by physically meaningful models. Customarily, data-based models of wind turbines are defined in 'black box' format, lacking in both conciseness and physical intelligibility. To address this deficiency, we identify models of a modern horizontal-axis wind turbine in symbolic form using a recently developed symbolic regression method. The method used relies on evolutionary multi-objective optimization to produce succinct dynamicmodels from operational data without 'a priori' knowledge of the system. We compare the produced models with models derived by other methods for their estimation capacity and evaluate the trade- off between model intelligibility and accuracy.

To overcome this void, this paper presents a simplified discrete-system model for vibrations of a beam-like structure. A disturbance input is included in the model, along with a control input from an active patch. Localized structural damping resulting from a passive patch is modeled with an equivalent loss factor. Results from the simplified model are verified using a more detailed analytical formulation, which is based on the Ritz approximation. Verification studies include the effect of a passive damping patch on modal loss factors and broadband attenuation. Finally, a few case studies are proposed which show the efficacy of the reduced-order model for parametric design studies. These studies include determining the effect of localized damping on the control system parameters that are required for attenuation of localized and global motions. The effect of patch locations on system response is also studied. This work has potential applications in industry since compact damping patches are attractive NVH treatments that add minimal weight and complexity. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Damping; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Robots; Vibration control; Wind power; Analytical formulation; Beam-like structures; Broadband attenuation; Computational model; Passive vibration control; Reduced order models; Structural geometry; Vibration reductions; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973352386

This work is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to characterize the combined damping and beating response of power demand versus the level of TCL population parameter heterogeneity. The forced aggregate dynamics of TCLs have been shown to be bilinear when set point temperature adjustment is used as a control input. This motivates the paper's use of free response dynamics, which are linear, to characterize both the damping and beating phenomena. A stochastic parameter distribution is applied to the homogeneous power demand solution, furnishing an analytic expression for aggregate power demand.

The nonlinear impact problem has drawn researchers' interests for a long time and the investigation is still undergoing. Fully and accurately modeling impact can facilitate the understanding and improving the performance of impact wrench. Under certain circumstance, not only coefficient of restitution is interested but also the whole impact process. Hence, discrete impact model cannot fulfil these requirements and dynamic modeling is indispensable. At the same time, sufficient knowledge about contact parameters such as contact stiffness is necessary for accurately impact modeling. But these parameters are usually not readily available. Moreover, researchers mainly focused on translational impact problem while rotational impact problem is ignored. In this paper, Hunt- Crossley nonlinear contact model is applied and extended in torsional impact dynamic modeling. Based on this model, an experimental method is developed to evaluate the distribution of inertias in lumped parameter models. Contact stiffness is measured based on spectrum results. To obtain reliable experimental data, impact wrench is driven by a servo motor to generate a controllable torque impulse. Contact stiffness is acquired under different impact speed.

We present a technique for in-situ wheel imbalance detection using accelerometer data obtained from a smartphone mounted on the dashboard of a vehicle having balanced and imbalanced wheel conditions. The lack of observable distinguishing features in a Fourier Transform (FT) of the accelerometer data necessitates the use of supervised machine learning techniques for imbalance detection. We demonstrate that a classification tree model built using Fourier feature data achieves 79% classification accuracy on test data. We further demonstrate that a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation of the Fourier features helps uncover a unique observable excitation frequency for imbalance detection. We show that a classification tree model trained on randomized PCA features achieves greater than 90% accuracy on test data. Results demonstrate that the presence or absence of wheel imbalance can be accurately detected on at least two vehicles of different make and model.

Motion planning and control of such systems is a challenging problem due to the uncertainty induced by needle-tissue interactions, anatomical motions (respiratory and cardiac induced motions), imperfect actuation, etc. In this paper, we use an analogy where steering the needle in a soft tissue subject to the uncertain anatomical motions is compared to the Dubins vehicle traveling in the stochastic wind field. Achieving the optimal feedback control policy requires solution of a dynamic programming problem that is often computationally demanding. Efficiency is not central to many optimal control algorithms that often need to be computed only once for a given system/noise statistics. However, intraoperative policy updates may be required for adaptive or patient-specific models. We use the method of approximating Markov chain to approximate the continuous (and controlled) process with its discrete and locally consistent counterpart. We examine the linear programming method of solving the imposed dynamic programming problem that significantly improves the computational efficiency in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the probability of success and failure are simply the variables of the linear optimization problem and can be directly used for different objective definitions. A numerical example of the 2D needle steering problem is considered to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Algorithms; Automobile steering equipment; Computational efficiency; Energy harvesting; Feedback control; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Markov processes; Motion planning; Needles; Numerical methods; Optimization; Robots; Stochastic systems; Tissue; Wind power; Dynamic programming problems; Linear optimization problems; Needle-tissue interaction; Optimal control algorithm; Optimal feedback control; Patient specific model; Probability of success; State-of-the-art approach; Dynamic programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973333845

The selected task is to assemble a few LEGO parts into a final assembled product following specified instructions and sequence in collaboration between the human and the robot. We develop a two-level feedforward optimization strategy that determines the optimal subtask allocation between the human and the robot for the selected assembly before the assembly starts. We derive dynamics models for human's trust in the robot and the robot's trust in the human for the assembly and estimate the trusts. The aim is to maintain satisfactory trust levels between the human and the robot through the application of the optimal subtask allocation. Again, subtask re-allocation is proposed to regain trusts if the trusts reduce to below the specified levels. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that fluctuations in human's trust in the robot may cause fluctuations in human's speeds and the human may appreciate if the robot adjusts its speeds with changes in human speeds. Hence, trustbased Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed to minimize the variations between human and robot speeds and to maximize the trusts. Experiment results prove the effectiveness of the hybrid cell, the feedforward optimal subtask allocation and of the trust-based MPC. The results also show that the overall assembly performance can be enhanced and the performance status can be monitored through a single dynamic parameter, i.e. the trust. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Assembly; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Manufacture; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Robots; Wind power; Collaborative assembly; Dynamic parameters; Dynamics models; Hybrid cells; Optimization strategy; Performance status; Robot hybrid; Trust-based model; Human robot interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973333452

This system's optimal energy output often involves flying in periodic figure-8 trajectories, but the precise optimal figure-8 shape is sensitive to environmental conditions, including wind speed. The literature presents controllers that are able to adapt to uncertainties, and this work expands on the current literature by using an extremum seeking based method. Extremum seeking is particularly well-suited for this application because of its well understood stability properties. In this work, extremum seeking is used to search through a family of optimal trajectories (computed offline) that correspond to discrete wind speeds. The controller is efficient in that it only searches for the optimum trajectory over the uncertain parameter (in this paper, wind speed). Results show that the controller converges to the optimal trajectory, provided it is initialized to a stable figure-8. The speed of convergence is dependent on the difference between the initial average power output and the optimal average power output. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Control theory; Electric generators; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Robots; Stability; Thermoelectric power; Trajectories; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Wind power; Environmental conditions; Extremum seeking; Optimal trajectories; Parametric uncertainties; Speed of convergence; Stability properties; Uncertain parameters; Wind energy generators; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973333143

Hemiparesis patients suffer a sudden loss of motor skills in the upper-limb due to brain injury, such as stroke. As an emerging physio-therapy technique for hemiparesis, named repetitive facilitation exercise, or RFE, a therapist manually applies brief mechanical stimuli to the peripheral target muscles (e.g., tapping, stretching of tendon/ muscle) followed by wrist pronation/supination immediately before a patient intends to produce a movement with the muscle. In an earlier study, a robotic system that replicates the mechanical tendon stimulation part of RFE procedure in MRI with the required timing precision has been developed and tested by the authors to investigate the underlying principles of functional recovery via RFE. This work presents the design of a vane actuator that fits into the tight space in MR-scanners, and analyzes its dynamic performance via a detailed pneumatic system model.

Our control objective and framework are to make the system behave like a passive mechanical tool when interacting with the human and with the work environment with a specified power scaling factor. A virtual velocity coordination control approach casts the human power amplifier problem into one of velocity coordination by generating a fictitious reference mechanical system. Force amplification becomes a natural consequence of velocity coordination. This control has been previously demonstrated using servo valves which is a major contributor to energy loss in hydraulic system. In this paper, a hydraulic transformer, which does not rely on throttling to accomplish its control function is used instead of a servo valve to achieve human power amplification. In addition, a passivity based control approach that makes use of the natural energy storage of the hydraulic actuator is used to define the flow requirement. This approach fully accounts for the non-linearity due to the pressure dynamics. The controller was experimentally validated with good force amplification and velocity coordination performance on a single degree of freedom hydraulic human power amplifier. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Amplification; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamics; Energy dissipation; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Hydraulic equipment; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Pneumatic control equipment; Pneumatic servomechanisms; Power amplifiers; Robots; Servo amplifiers; Velocity; Virtual reality; Wind power; Control objectives; Coordination control; Force amplification; Hydraulic actuation; Hydraulic transformer; Natural consequences; Passivity based control; Single degree of freedoms; Hydraulic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973320913

With high resolution comes sensitivity to small disturbances, which has kept this technique from reaching its industrial potential. Closed loop control of E-jet printing can overcome these disturbances, but it requires an improved understanding of ink droplet spreading on the substrate and a physical model to predict printed feature locations and geometries from process inputs and disturbances. This manuscript examines a model of ink droplet spreading that uses assumptions that are important to the e-jet process. Our model leverages previous energy balance models that were derived for larger length scale droplets. At the smaller length scale, we find that viscous losses are a significant portion of the energy budget and must be accounted for; this is in contrast to models at length scales two orders of magnitude larger. Our model predicts the droplet height, base radius and contact angle in time from an initial volume and E-jet printing control parameters. The model is validated with published droplet spreading data and new measurements of E-jet printed droplets of diameter 8 μm.

The paper is motivated by earlier research showing that the speed and accuracy with which battery parameters can be estimated both improve significantly when battery inputs are optimized for Fisher identifiability. Previous research performs this trajectory optimization for a known nominal parameter set. This creates a tautology where accurate parameter identification is a prerequisite for Fisher identifiability optimization. In contrast, this paper presents an iterative scheme that: (i) uses prior parameter probability distributions to create a weighted Fisher metric; (ii) optimizes the battery input trajectory for this metric using a genetic algorithm; (iii) applies the resulting input trajectory to the battery; (iv) estimates battery parameters using a Bayesian particle filter; (v) re-computes the weighted Fisher information metric using the resulting posterior parameter distribution; and (vi) repeats this process until convergence. This approach builds on well-established ideas from the estimation literature, and applies them to the battery domain for the first time. Simulation studies highlight the ability of this iterative algorithm to converge quickly towards the correct battery parameter values, despite large initial parameter uncertainties. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Algorithms; Battery management systems; Computer control systems; Electric batteries; Energy harvesting; Fisher information matrix; Fuel storage; Genetic algorithms; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Iterative methods; Lithium-ion batteries; Optimization; Probability distributions; Robots; Trajectories; Wind power; Fisher information metric; Initial parameter; Iterative algorithm; Parameter distributions; Parameter identifiability; Parameter uncertainty; Simulation studies; Trajectory optimization; Parameter estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973315943

Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems which form a major part of the building operations contain a large number of interconnected subsystems. One of the challenges associated with implementing DMPC is the development of reliable models of individual subsystems for prediction, especially for large scale systems. In this paper an automated method is proposed to develop linear parametric black box models for individual building HVAC subsystems. The modeling method proposed identifies the significant inputs, and the upstream and downstream neighbors of each subsystem before performing regression analysis to determine the model parameters.

Learning the motion plans from human demonstrations is essential in making robot programming possible by nonexpert programmers as well as realizing human-robot collaboration. The highly complex human reaching motion is generated by a stable closed-loop dynamical system. To capture the complexity a neural network (NN) is used to represent the dynamics of the human motion states. The trajectories of arm generated by humans for reaching to a place are contracting towards the goal location from various initial conditions with built in obstacle avoidance. To take into consideration the contracting nature of the human motion dynamics the unknown motion model is learned using a NN subject to contraction analysis constraints. To learn the NN parameters an optimization problem is formulated by relaxing the non-convex contraction constraints to Linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is used to solve the optimization problem subject to the LMI constraints. For obstacle avoidance a negative gradient of the repulsive potential function is added to the learned contracting NN model. Experiments are conducted on Baxter robot platform to show that the robot can generate reaching paths from the contracting NN dynamics learned from human demonstrated data recorded using Microsoft Kinect sensor. The algorithm is able to adapt to situations for which the demonstrations are not available, e.g., an obstacle placed in the path. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Algorithms; Complex networks; Demonstrations; Digital storage; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Linear matrix inequalities; Motion estimation; Motion planning; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Robots; Wind power; Human demonstrations; Human-robot collaboration; Microsoft Kinect sensors; Neural network (nn); Optimization problems; Repulsive potentials; Robot motion planning; Sequential quadratic programming; Robot programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973311797

It plays a crucial role in many robotic applications such as ""simultaneous localization and mapping"" (SLAM), surface reconstruction, and inertial sensor calibration. The most widely used solution to this problem is based on performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) over a derived data matrix. A drawback of the SVD method is that it is a least-squares method and thus may fail to take into account the anisotropic and/or correlated noises, which often present in practical applications. A natural variation is to add a matrix weight to the least-squares problem to balance the estimation errors in different measurement directions. However, it becomes difficult to write down a closed form solution in this setup. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is presented to estimate the rigid transformation with correlated observations.

To lead to an effective and efficient predictive tool and design guide, this research develops a new analytical approach to estimate the vibration response decay and power generation of a bistable energy harvester when excited by an impulse. Enabling the prediction of time-varying snap-through dynamics, this new approach greatly extends the capabilities of the current averaging method when employed with the Jacobian elliptic functions. Comparison with values determined by the direct simulation of the governing equations shows that the analytically predicted average generated power is very accurate for a wide range of impulse strengths and load resistances.

Typically, tens of the actuated valves are instantaneously operating to regulate the amount of flow and also to avoid probable catastrophic disasters which have been observed in the practice. We focus on minimizing the amount of energy used in the system as one of the most critical design criteria to yield an efficient operation. We optimize the actuation subsystems interacting with the highly nonlinear flow loads in order to minimize a lumped amount of energy consumed.

However, the compliance, coupled with friction, can also make motion control difficult, leading to the use of more aggressive controllers, such as high-gain PID or sliding mode control, which result in stiff closed-loop system behavior. Model-based options are needed to obtain behavior that provides a better trade-off of compliance and accurate position control. In particular, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is suggested; through the use of constrained optimal control, it offers a framework for minimizing tracking error while enforcing force constraints that ensure low impedance behavior. This paper assesses the suitability of controllers for pneumatic systems to positioning applications in which humanmachine interaction is anticipated. MPC is compared against commonly-used alternatives for such scenarios: sliding mode, PID, and impedance control.

It is uncertain how neglecting these dynamics can affect fuel economy of a parallel HEV. This paper addresses this shortcoming by investigating effects of some major Spark Ignition (SI) engine dynamics and clutch dynamics on torque split management in a parallel HEV. The control strategy is implemented on a HEVmodelwith an experimentally validated, dynamic ICE model. Simulation results show that the ICE and clutch dynamics can degrade performance of the HEV control strategy during the transient periods of the vehicle operation by 8.7% for city and highway driving conditions in a combined common North American drive cycle. This fuel penalty is often overlooked in conventional HEV energy management strategies. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) of torque split is developed by incorporating effects of the studied influencing dynamics.

The deviation of these paths from the perfect circle is categorized as repeatable run-out (RRO) which needs to be tracked. An adaptive RRO following algorithm was developed in [1,2] in order to track the RRO. This algorithm uses models of the closed-loop sensitivity transfer functions, from the feedforward injection points to position error signal (PES), to estimate the feedforward control actions that are needed to track the RRO. The phase difference between these models and the actual transfer functions must be less than 90 degrees, in order to guarantee the convergence of the adaptive RRO following algorithm. The dual-stage actuators' gains and resonance modes are affected by temperature variations, which in turn affect all closed loop sensitivity transfer functions. As a consequence, the 90-degree criteria may be violated unless these transfer functions are periodically updated.

For a model having muscle contraction velocity as the input and force as the output, it is shown that the system is passive during the concentric phase. Also, it is shown that a negative strict passivity margin exists for the eccentric phase if the length and lengthening velocity of the contractile element are assumed bounded. Estimates of this margin are given by means of two alternative formulas. Further, it is shown that the mapping from contraction velocity to deviation from equilibrium force is passive in both concentric and eccentric phases. The paper discusses how these findings and the passivity theorem can be used to design controllers for a machine coupled to the muscle model by feedback interconnection. The simple case of a proportionalderivative force feedback regulator is considered as an example. A simulation example is given where the transient response of the coupled system crosses the eccentric region. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Muscle; Robots; Wind power; Contractile elements; Equilibrium forces; Feedback interconnection; Hill muscle models; Input-output properties; Muscle contractions; Passivity properties; Simulation example; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973293255

The original SPM consists of two electrodes approximated as spherical particles with spatially distributed Li-ion concentration. However, the Li-ion concentration states in these two-electrode models are known to be weakly observable from the voltage output. This has led to the prevalent use of reduced models in literature that generally approximate Li-ion concentration states in one electrode as an algebraic function of that in the other electrode. In this paper, we remove such approximations and show that the addition of the thermal model to the electrochemical SPM essentially leads to observability of the Li-ion concentration states in both electrodes from voltage and temperature measurements. Then, we propose an estimation scheme based on this SPM coupled with lumped thermal dynamics that estimates the Li-ion concentrations in both electrodes. Moreover, these Li-ion concentration estimates also enable the estimation of the cell capacity. The estimation scheme consists of a sliding mode observer cascaded with an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Simulation studies are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Battery management systems; Concentration (process); Electric batteries; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Robots; Temperature measurement; Wind power; Algebraic functions; Estimation schemes; Ion concentrations; Simulation studies; Single-particle model; Sliding mode observers; Spherical particle; Unscented Kalman Filter; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973282007

The dynamics of single degree of freedom energy harvesting system with MMR is piecewise linear due to the engagement and disengagement of one-way clutches. The energy harvesting performance of single degree of freedom system with MMR under force and motion excitation are studied and compared with ideal linear damping and non- MMR system in this paper. Under harmonic force and motion excitation, the optimal excitation frequency and output power of MMR system is less sensitive to the power takeoff inertia compared with non-MMR system. Furthermore, the output power of MMR system under harmonic motion excitation is larger than non-MMR system. The performance index of MMR, non-MMR and linear damping systems are compared under random excitation. It is found that MMR system has a better performance over both non-MMR and linear damping system, which makes it a better choice for energy harvesting. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.",,"Clutches; Damping; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamics; Electric rectifiers; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Piecewise linear techniques; Power takeoffs; Rectifying circuits; Robots; Vibrations (mechanical); Wind power; Energy harvesting systems; Optimal excitation frequency; Performance indices; Power take-off systems; Random excitations; Single degree of freedom systems; Single degree of freedoms; Vibration energy harvesting; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973281853

Optimization of the powersplit algorithm managing both torque sources can be readily achieved offline, but online implementation results often show great deviation from expected fuel economy due to traffic, hills, and similar effects that are not easily modeled. Of these external influences, the road grade for a travel route is potentially known a priori given a set destination choice from the driver. To examine whether grade information can improve the performance of a hybrid powertrain controller, we first formulate the vehicle model as a low-order dynamic model, recognizing that the primary dynamics of the energy system are slow. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy utilizing the terrain data is then developed to obtain a time-varying power split between the combustion engine and the electrical machine. Simulation results of the HEV model over multiple standard drive cycles, with different terrain profiles and different cost functions, are presented. Testing of the MPC performance compared to Argonne National Lab's powertrain simulation software Autonomie shows that the MPC strategy utilizing terrain data gives an improvement of up to 2.2% in fuel economy with respect to the same controller without terrain information, on the same route.

Although there could be other applications using a CMM like reverse engineering, however the stated inspection process is quite crucial for maintaining quality factor and to regulate merits of the manufacturing process especially with the continuous wear-tear of the involved tooling. However this inspection process, which is considered as auxiliary process, needs to have minimum cycle time in order to effectively have more quality units to be produced. In this paper we describe Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) in order to complete Computer Aided Inspection (CAI) process using CMM on the work-piece which is created through Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Manufacturing (CAM). This leads to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) process. As a result, the features, which need to be inspected, could be recognized from its corresponding CAD file and appropriate information could be culled out by the Dassault Software System to calculate the approach and retract points to inspect the features [Choudhury 03]. The main objective of this research paper is to determine the shortest collision free trajectory from the retract point of one feature being inspected to the approach point of another feature being inspected so that the sequencing for the set of trajectories could be calculated through existing Traveling Sales Person (TSP) algorithm in order to shorten the total distance travelled by the CMM probe, which in turn would linearly reflect in reducing the cycle inspection time. Further since different features in the work-piece might need to be inspected by different probes, an overhead time and displacement for probe change, needs to consider in order to shorten the cycle time. These include clustering of similar type of features, which can be inspected by the same probe. Also clustering of similar type of features need to be assessed against spatial distance of separation between the clusters that the probe has to travel. Since the CMM travels at a constant low speed and the different probes are of similar shape, size and comparatively very small weight, the motion dynamics of the CMM does not influence the total distance travelled for the inspection process. Our main contribution is in the development of a spatial algorithm which not only reduces the inter-feature distance but also does that by avoiding the potential for any collision with the feature or the artifact without the use of any computer vision or collision avoidance sensor information. The resulting spatial algorithm has implicit embedded information of feature clustering, which when fed into an optimization algorithm generates a path planning which would eventually shorten the cycle time. The illustration is done with two separate simulations. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Algorithms; Associative storage; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided design; Computer integrated manufacturing; Computer vision; Coordinate measuring machines; Energy harvesting; Fuel storage; Human robot interaction; Image segmentation; Inspection; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Manufacture; Motion planning; Optimization; Probes; Reverse engineering; Robots; Wind power; Collision-free trajectory; Computeraided process planning(CAPP); Coordinate measurement machines; Embedded information; Manufacturing lines; Manufacturing process; Optimization algorithms; Sensor informations; Computer aided process planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973277734

A practically proven method to improve contouring precision is adding a cross-coupling algorithm, which acts on contour error, to the existing position control loops. The contour error estimate (CEE) significantly affects performance of the cross-coupling al- gorithm. Conventional CEE methods rely on static single-point algorithms. A Newton-based CEE algorithm which effectively improves CEE and dramatically reduces contouring error has recently been proposed [22]. In this paper, instead of a sepa- rate cross-coupling control it is proposed to modify the position control loops, in this case integral sliding mode control, to in- corporate the contour error in the control loop. Various exper- iments to identify the effect of 1) number of required iterations of the Newton-based CEE, 2) reference feedrate and curvature, and 3) sharp corners on overall performance of the proposed cross-coupling algorithm are reported.

The storage unit is evaluated with technical limitations to reveal the parameter sensitivities when coupled with a wind farm. The main interest is the sizing of the storage unit for capacity firming purposes. A storage unit in combination with a large offshore wind farm has been simulated in time domain over the course of one year. The storage unit has been operated with the goal of firming the wind power capacity within each bid period. Different constraints have been introduced to show parameter sensitivity of the storage unit. The constraints were both technical and control oriented. An important prerequisite for the simulation was that the combined wind power plant and the storage operate in a market where the imbalance between bid and delivered energy is measured and penalized. Results show that there are several important parameters regarding storage sizing. Storage sizing is shown to be very dependent on the production forecast error and market bid length. Furthermore, technical constraints in the shape of ramping rates and power reversal dead time can be countered by choosing an appropriate control strategy. No control strategy gives significantly more reduction in grid power imbalance than the constant, fixed mode control strategy. The same reduction can however be obtained, with somewhat less energy routed through the storage by applying an alternative control strategy. © 2015 The Authors.

Overdischarge, followed by recharge, is a failure mechanism in lithium-ion batteries that can be associated with long-term storage, poor battery module design, and internal cell defects. Overdischarge is known to cause copper dissolution, SEI layer degradation, and gas generation. By itself, overdischarge does not result in catastrophic thermal runaway; however, if a battery is recharged and used following an overdischarge event, the chances of thermal runaway increase. This paper describes an on-going investigation into the link between depth and duration of overdischarge, quantitative changes to the cell as a result of overdischarge, and performance and safety characteristics in lithium-ion batteries. Through the use of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we measure copper dissolution in both an overdischarged cell and a healthy cell. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Copper; Copper metallography; Dissolution; Failure (mechanical); Ions; Safety engineering; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Copper dissolution; Failure mechanism; Gas generation; Internal cells; Lithium-ion cells; Long-term storage; Quantitative changes; Thermal runaways; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959366089

Namely, the classical evaluation (kinetic current density at fixed potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE) is only possible if the catalyst film is close to ideal (uniform and of appropriate thickness), which is sometimes difficult or even impossible to obtain. We propose an alternative way of activity evaluation, which is based on determination of potential at the fixed kinetic current density of 0.1 mAcm-2Pt. Performing a case study on ideal and purposely flawed (nonideal) PtCu/C catalyst films we prove the reliability of the proposed method and a systematically lower error compared to the the conventional fixed-voltage method.

However, slow electrode reaction kinetics and structural degradation caused by large volume changes and phase separation during cycling hinder its practical application. To solve these problems, we design and fabricate a novel, 3-D hierarchical MoO2/Ni/C architecture by a combination of a hydrothermal method with chemical vapor deposition. The nickel nanoparticles are in situ formed and disperse uniformly with flower-like MoO2 particles, which are coated by thin carbon layers. The Ni particles act as a catalyst during the carbon coating process to promote the in situ growth of graphene in the carbon layer. Together, MoO2 and nickel nanoparticles, as well as amorphous carbon and graphene sheets build a 3-D hierarchical robust MoO2/Ni/C structure with a good electronically conductive network and lots of void space. Such a 3-D hierarchical structure combines multiple advantageous features, including an enhanced 3-D electronically conductive network, plenty of tunnels for electrolyte solution penetration, void space for volume change accommodation, and more surface areas for the electrode reaction. The manufactured MoO2/Ni/C composite exhibits a high reversible capacity, and excellent rate capability of 576 and 463 mA h g-1 at current densities of 100 and 1000 mA g-1, respectively. The excellent cycling performance is recorded with a capacity of 445 mA h g-1 maintained at 1000 mA g-1 after 800 cycles.

Here we report the dopamine-mediated fabrication of ultralight graphene aerogels (UGAs) with low volume shrinkage via hydrothermal reactions at low temperature. The UGAs were fabricated by the hydrothermal reaction of the graphene oxide (GO)/dopamine colloidal solutions at 85°C in the presence of dopamine followed by freeze-drying and pyrolysis. The interaction between GO and dopamine in the aqueous phase, the effects of various parameters on the formation of the UGAs, the roles of dopamine in hydrothermal reactions as well as the wettability and electrical conductivity of the UGAs were investigated using a wide range of analytical techniques. The GO concentration, dopamine concentration, and the temperature and time of the hydrothermal reaction have great influences on the formation of the UGAs. The addition of dopamine forms crosslinking points among the GO sheets and results in the partial reduction of GO in the hydrothermal reaction. In addition, the N atoms of dopamine were doped into the graphene sheets.

In this study upright nano/submicron-sized Si wire arrays are fabricated by a mask-free deep reactive ion etching method. A fluorocarbon layer is then sputter-deposited onto the Si wire arrays to form a Si/fluorocarbon energetic composite. The morphological and compositional information of the composites is characterized by various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The energetic property is studied by thermal analysis. Orderly Si wires are obtained by tuning the passivation/etching ratio in a processing cycle. As the total processing time increases, the number density of Si wires decreases while the length increases. The effects of power density and Ar flow rate on the chemical composition of the sputtered fluorocarbon are also investigated, but neither of them show appreciable impact within the ranges studied. The Si/fluorocarbon surface is so superhydrophobic that the water drops roll easily and the contact angles can hardly be measured.

However, it has been rather difficult to find profitable business models and niche markets so far. PtG systems can be applied in a broad variety of input and output conditions, mainly determined by prices for electricity, hydrogen, oxygen, heat, natural gas, bio-methane, fossil CO2 emissions, bio-CO2 and grid services, but also full load hours and industrial scaling. Optimized business models are based on an integrated value chain approach for a most beneficial combination of input and output parameters. The financial success is evaluated by a standard annualized profit and loss calculation and a subsequent return on equity consideration. Two cases of PtG integration into an existing pulp mill as well as a nearby bio-diesel plant are taken into account. Commercially available PtG technology is found to be profitable in case of a flexible operation mode offering electricity grid services. Next generation technology, available at the end of the 2010s, in combination with renewables certificates for the transportation sector could generate a return on equity of up to 100% for optimized conditions in an integrated value chain approach. This outstanding high profitability clearly indicates the potential for major PtG markets to be developed rather in the transportation sector and chemical industry than in the electricity sector as seasonal storage option as often proposed. © 2015 The Authors.","business model; chemical industry; forestry; grid services; power-to-gas","Carbon dioxide; Chains; Chemical industry; Commerce; Diesel engines; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Forestry; Gas emissions; Grid computing; Industrial emissions; Motor transportation; Profitability; Business modeling; Electricity sector; Flexible operation; Generation technologies; Grid services; Input and outputs; Optimized conditions; Transportation sector; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948446695

However, the greatest obstacles which face electric energy comes from renewable energy systems are often referred to the intermittency of these sources as well as storage and transport problems, the need for their conversion into a versatile energy carrier in its use, storable, transportable and environmentally acceptable are required. Among all the candidates answering these criteria, hydrogen presents the best answer. In the present work, particular attention is paid to the production of hydrogen from wind energy. The new wind map of Algeria shows that the highest potential wind power was found in Adrar, Hassi-R'Mel and Tindouf regions. The data obtained from these locations have been analyzed using Weibull probability distribution function. The wind energy produced in these locations is exploited for hydrogen production through water electrolysis. The objective of this paper is to realize a technological platform allowing the evaluation of emergent technologies of hydrogen production from wind energy using four wind energy conversion systems of 600, 1250, 1500 and 2000 kW rated capacity. The feasibility study shows that using wind energy in the selected sites is a promising solution. It is shown that the turbine ""De Wind D7"" is sufficient to supply the electricity and hydrogen with a least cost and a height capacity factor. The minimum cost of hydrogen production of 1.214 $/kgH2 is obtained in Adrar. © 2015 The Authors.

The resultant material is composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (thickness, 5-30 nm). The 3DHCM has been studied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The unique three-dimensional porous structure results in a high initial charge capacity of 341 mA h g-1, stable cycling capacity of 232.8 mA h g-1 (after 100 cycles, 50 mA g-1), superior-rate performance (stable capacities of 210, 197, 128 and 112 mA h g-1 at 200, 500, 5000, 8000 mA g-1, respectively) and ultralong cycle life (116 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 3000 cycles). At the same time, an increase in the trend of the sloping capacity percentage at total discharge is observed. More obvious ""graphitic"" domains with larger interplanar spacing (∼0.46 nm) were produced in the electrochemical cycles and detected using ex situ HRTEM, further confirming that the first higher-voltage region (above 0.1 V) should be attributed to the sodium insertion between the parallel graphene layers in the hard carbon. We also find that the electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in PC) severely decomposes at the electrode/electrolyte interface during deep electrochemical cycles (6000 cycles), resulting in the deterioration of the electrode and fast capacity fading. Furthermore, a roomerature sodium-ion full cell was constructed using 3DHCM as an anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C as a cathode, (-) 3DHCM1 M NaClO4 in PCNa3V2(PO4)3/C (+), delivering a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g-1 at a current density of 500 mA g-1. We believe that our findings will be helpful in speeding up the development of roomerature high-rate, long life and low cost sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems, and even as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Anodes; Chains; Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical cycle; Electrode/electrolyte interfaces; Energy storage systems; Interconnected network; Interplanar spacings; Sodium ion batteries; Sodium polyacrylates; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947769880

However, these camps are located in remote rural areas in ARE desert where there is no grid power supply; the installed electric source typically is diesel generators. Due to the cost of fuel supply and the impacts of the generator vibrations on desert landscape, two renewable systems have been investigated. One is a conventional renewable system consisting of PVs and battery storage. The second system is a combination of PVs and fuel cell where hydrogen is provided via water electrolysis. This economical and feasibility study aims to compare the performance of both systems (Fuel cells and Batteries) using HOMER software. System capital cost and maintenance are included in the cost study. The cost of the fuel cell system is higher than the PV/battery system by about 50%.

The system comprises of the PV modules, grid, battery, HPWH, diesel generator (DG) and other domestic appliances. The PV can simultaneously feed-in the excess power to the grid and supply the loads. The battery is used as storage of cheaper-to-buy off peak grid energy dependent on the time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariff whilst the DG is a backup power source. The objective function of model is to minimize energy and fuel cost while maximizing PV energy trade-off for incentives. The TOU is an important control parameter in the model. The power flows from each source are the control variables. The optimal control showed a great potential for the realization of a practical net zero-energy building and as well as for demand side management, since the model meets both technical and operational constraints. A case study is done based on 3x16 kW HPWH installed at Pretoria hotel in South Africa. Simulations run over year on selected seasonal dates using the actual measured demand of the HPWH.

The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility and the stability of the system that could be applied into residential buildings in the actual construction. The indoor thermal environment based on the tested system is analyzed in this paper. According to the weather condition of Xi'an, the winter average solar insolation and the ambient temperature were 9.14 MJ/m2 and 8.9oC, respectively. The experimental results show that the average heating capacity of the designed system was about 1.08 kW for a typical sunny day in the winter. It was higher than the simulated heating load. As a result, the indoor air temperature reached 18oC, which sufficiently met the requirement of indoor thermal condition. It is also found that the indoor air temperature distributes uniformly and the maximum difference of the vertical temperatures was less than 3.2oC. This indicates that the indoor thermal comfort of the test room can be classified in the comfort level of A. © 2015 The Authors.

Most focus has been on the negative environmental effects of using fossil fuels. However, looking at the development there seems to be important barriers for change. Many papers and reports conclude that the renewable energy sources have the potential to run the world and the technology needed to do so is available. A relevant and important question in this paper is then why is this potential only marginally utilized? Often the high prices of renewables are said to be one barrier and that technology change will gradually increase the advantages of renewable energy. However considerations based solely on thermodynamics and energy systems analysis, no matter how simple they are, lead to a very serious conclusion, namely that the utilization of renewable energy does not support continuous growth as we know it. In order to develop pathways for change, scenarios can be used to support decision making involving all key actors in society. In this paper we outline the driving forces why we ended up in the energy systems we have today. The competition between fossil fuels and renewable energy must be analyzed at a more fundamental thermodynamic level. This analysis has also to include the links between energy and material transformation. Understanding this we can outline possible roadmaps for transitions to more sustainable energy and material systems starting from primary energy sources. The strong dependence on fossil fuels now will require long transitions periods for change. However it is important to start the transitions taking small steps forward. The problem related to fossil fuels and climate change will not be solved in due time. The only realistic options here is Carbon Capture and storage together with climate change adaption. One difficulty in making scenarios is to handle changes in technology and people's behavior. By developing evolutionary forecasting scenarios (EFS) different roadmaps can be evaluated, including continuous and discontinuous technology change. The key parameter that will determine the inevitable transitions in energy use and the future of our civilization is the emergy yield ratio we can obtain from the renewable energy sources. For material transformation conservation of low entropy states will be of high importance. © 2015 The Authors.

Mass loss during heating was monitored with a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) linked to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). This technique showed that the relative mass loss rate of all the samples is comparable and that carbon dioxide is produced during their degradation. The calcite content of each sample is estimated assuming full calcination during the process. Additionally, larger fractions of the samples were heated in a high temperature electric furnace. This experiment showed that some samples tend to agglomerate at high temperatures, thus rendering their use as heat transfer fluid media questionable. Furthermore, color change from lighter tones to whiter tones is observed. This effect may impact the radiative properties of the samples, especially their solar absorptivity values. Finally, the average heat capacity in the 150-1100°C temperature range was measured with a differential scanning calorimeter.

Box 54224, Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","An innovative concept in which a single-tank molten salt thermal energy storage arrangement also acts as a volumetric receiver is being developed in connection with the CSPonD2 (Concentrated Solar Power on Demand Demonstration) project. The tank is located at the focal point of a beam-down tower to act as both solar energy receiver and thermal energy storage. The relatively small angle subtended by rays emanating from the central reflector of a beam down optical system, together with the nature of solar energy absorption within the volumetric receiver, make use of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) or CPC-like final optical element attractive. An effective concentration of about 4 can be achieved to increase solar flux at the tank aperture from 150 to 600 suns. This paper describes preliminary designs of the CPC and tank/receiver. Optical simulations reveal that, for a given solar incident power at the tank aperture, a conical final concentrator design produces a more uniform flux distribution with better axial alignment (lower average horizontal component) of rays at its outlet compared to a conventional CPC of revolution. However the cone may require a larger outlet radius, leading to higher thermal losses through the tank aperture. With the current design of the tank, the losses through the walls correspond to 5.5% of the thermal capacity. To maximize the tank thermal efficiency, a thorough investigation will be carried out, starting with measurements of the molten salt emissivity, to determine the cone outlet radius/tank aperture and cone height that achieve maximum system efficiency with a 250-550°C molten salt working temperature range. © 2015 The Authors.

Two types of optimization problems including fixed chemical energy conversion and fixed total heat flux are discussed detail. Firstly, the formula of entransy dissipation for the process of TTES is derived based on the entransy balance equation, then a casing TTES with methane-water reforming is optimized for entransy dissipation minimization (EDM). The optimized results based on EDM are also compared with that based on entropy production minimization (EPM). The results show that: there are some similarities and differences between EDM and EPM for optimizing the TESR. The similarity is that the heating temperature along the reaction flow should be non-linear, to decrease the total irreversibility. The difference is that the EDM is focused on decreasing the irreversibility of heat transfer, and the EPM is focused on decreasing the irreversibility of reaction. The total heat consumption based on EDM is lower than that based on EPM when the chemical energy conversion is certain, and the chemical energy conversion based on EDM is higher than that based on EPM when the total heat flux is certain. © 2015 The Authors.

This research numerically analyzed the energy consumption of the re-liquefaction of BOG using the following four approaches: 1) a Claude cycle driven by electrical motor with the electricity produced by burning coal; 2) a Brayton cycle driven by a gas turbine fuelled by BOG released; 3) a Claude cycle driven by a SI engine fuelled by BOG; 4) using liquefied nitrogen produced in industry. With the efficiencies of the power system derived from industry data, the energy consumed of the re-liquefaction process was explored. The impact of heat transfer coefficient, LNG tank configuration, size, and percentage of LNG stored in tank on the rate of BOG and energy needed for the re-liquefaction of methane vapor were investigated. The primary energy ratio (PER), defined as the ratio of the energy recovered to the energy consumed, was examined and compared. The highest PER was observed using the Claude cycle driven by internal combustion engine fueled with BOG while the lowest PER was observed when BOG was cooled using liquefied nitrogen approach.

Such operation is commonly lack of optimizing, especially which is based on a comprehensive quantitative analysis. Therefore, it is difficult for renewable energy system, which employed such operation strategy, has a reasonable response to the fluctuation of building load with an optimized object, e.g. a dynamic match between supply and demand. In this paper, a renewable energy station, which is located in Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city, is studied for a centralized heating and cooling based on ground-source heat pump (GSHP) and water energy storage. The GSHP system is comprised of two heat pump units with 3550 kW cooling capacity and 4100 kW heating capacity, and 1400 boreholes with a depth of 120m and a covering area of 40000 m2. Water energy storage system is comprised of four tanks with the capacity of 750 m3 (The total volume is 3000 m3). The renewable energy system provides cooling and heating for six office buildings. The heating and cooling load are obtained via simulation, and dynamic operational performance is analysed. The load variation curve and fitting formula are presented for typical design days. Also, a building heating/cooling load prediction algorithm, which is used to meet the daily average load and the daily maximum load, is developed based on the weather information and historical operational data. Furthermore, the combined operational performance of GSHP and water, energy storage is analysed within the framework of local peak-valley price. Finally, an optimized combined operational strategy of the distributed energy system was obtained for a dynamic match between the demand and supply. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy system; dynamic simulation; energy storage; load forecast","Air conditioning; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Cooling; Curve fitting; Digital storage; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heat pump systems; Heating; Office buildings; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Distributed energy systems; Environmental-friendly; Groundsource heat pump (GSHP); Heating and cooling loads; Load forecast; Operational performance; Operational strategies; Renewable energy systems; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947081292

Integrating Energy Storage System (TES) with tri-generation system can improve the energy efficiency and reduce the installed capacity for energy supply equipment. However, it has never been an easy task to reasonably design the TES-BCHP system, in terms of that it is hard to determine the suitable installed capacity of energy supply devices considering the fluctuating loads and the influence of TES. In this paper, a thermodynamic model of BCHP system with phase change material (PCM) energy storage is established. According to practical user loads and considering the correspondingly hourly changing flow rate in charge and discharge processes, a simplified method is proposed to determine the optimal phase change temperature for BCHP-TES, aiming to minimize the primary energy consumption of BCHP-TES system. An illustrative example shows that the optimal phase change temperature can be obtained for given loads. It also indicates that compared to infinite NTU for PCM-TES, the optimal phase change temperature will increase as well as the corresponding minimal primary energy consumption for finite NTU. This work is of great importance for PCM optimization of BCHP-TES system design. © 2015 The Authors.

This paper established an emergy-based evaluation framework, simulating the emergy storage and flows, to identify the input-output of the high-end industrial park. The emergy-based indicator system of the industrial park is also set up, including structural indices and functional indices, so as to assess the environmental impacts of the industrial park on the surrounding ecosystems. The results show that the sustainability of local environment is not optimistic due to the large amount of emergy input from outside imposed on surrounding environment of the industrial park. Full of central, technical and service industries, the high-end industrial park has lower materials demand compared to the traditional parks. The major emergy inputs cover materials, energy, labor, of which labor and service emergy contribute almost 90%, fitting well with the characteristics of highly-concentrated sci-tech talents and headquarter role of the park. The high-end industrial park has a higher level of emergy density and per capita emergy, indicating a high level of regional development and emergy hierarchy. Although there are concentrated emergy flows, the emergy yield ratio is lower than 100%, implying the park has the potential to develop rapidly due to the emergy surplus. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Emergy; Environmental impacts; Industrial park","Ecology; Indexing (materials working); Regional planning; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Emergy; Emergy yield ratio; Environment protection; Evaluation framework; Industrial parks; Local environments; Regional development; Surrounding environment; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947081060

The heat transfer characteristics during phase change of paraffin play a very key role in determining the thermo-fluidic performance. However, the drawback of low thermal conductivity will hamper the broaden application. In this study, we use copper foam to enhance the thermal conductivity of paraffin, and an experimental setup is built to study the phase change heat transfer characteristics. A two-temperature energy equation is used to describe the heat transfer characteristics of the paraffin/copper foam composite. The evolvement of solid-liquid interface and temperature variation during the melting process are experimentally measured and compared with the numerical results. It is found that there is a quite large temperature difference between the paraffin and ligament of copper foam, which is due to the thermal non-equilibrium effect in heat transfer between two phases. The good agreement between the experimental and numerical results indicates that heat transfer characteristics can be well depicted by two-temperature energy equation, which can be further used to depict the heat transfer in thermal energy storage or temperature control using composite PCM. © 2015 The Authors.

DSC technology was used to confirm the actual eutectic point of this quaternary salt mixture and the result turned to be 385oC. Then, thermo-physical properties of this quaternary salt mixture were measured. Heat of fusion was up to 151.1J/g. Heat capacity of the eutectic salt mixture was calculated from DSC curves as function of temperature in the reference of sapphire standard material. The calculated heat capacity was consistent with theoretical value in the solid state and increased with increasing temperature in liquid state. After thermal circling of 10 circles at 280-500oC, negligible change were seen in the melting point and freezing point of this quaternary salt mixture which showed excellent thermal circling stability. Meanwhile, mass loss curves under isothermal conditions were determined and the result showed that the thermal stability of this novel quaternary eutectic salt mixture was excellent under 650oC, which means this new quaternary eutectic salt mixture was a good thermal energy storage and transfer media. © 2015 The Authors.

However, fabrication of this battery working at room temperature did not succeed until haloaluminate containing ionic liquids were used as electrolytes. Therefore, anions are expected to have a great effect on performance of rechargeable aluminum batteries. For a complete understanding of the anion-effect, haloaluminate containing ionic liquids prepared with different halogenated imidazole salt and AlCl3/imidazolium chloride mole ratios are studied. The electrochemical window is found to narrow with reducibility of halide ions, which is confirmed by calculation results using the density functional theory (DFT) method. For ionic liquids at different mole ratios, the coexistence of different chloroaluminate anions (Cl-, AlCl4-, Al2Cl7-) is found. When used as an electrolyte in a rechargeable aluminum battery with a V2O5 nanowire cathode, the AlCl3/[BMIM]Cl ionic liquid with the mole ratio of 1.1:1 shows the best performance. The as-assembled cell exhibits a high discharge voltage platform (1 V) and capacity (288 mA h g-1) at the first cycle. Concentration of Al2Cl7- is considered as a key factor in chloroaluminate ionic liquids when used as electrolytes. Furthermore, a slight corrosion is found on the surface of Al metal foil immersed in an AlCl3/[BMIM]Cl = 1.1 : 1 ionic liquid for 24 h, which may help remove the oxide film on the Al metal foil, so as to improve the charge/discharge performance. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aluminum; Density functional theory; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Ions; Liquids; Metal foil; Negative ions; Oxide films; Secondary batteries; Calculation results; Charge/discharge performance; Chloroaluminate ionic liquids; Density functional theory methods; Discharge voltages; Electrochemical window; Ionic liquid electrolytes; Natural abundance; Ionic liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946949605

Herein, a fully compatible and transparent polymer blend consisting of phenolphthalein poly(ether sulfone) (cPES) and cyanate ester (CE) was specially designed as the resin matrix, and then new conductor/polymer composites based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and CE/cPES were facilely prepared through melting blending. The structure, dielectric properties and We values of MWCNT/CE and MWCNT/CE/cPES composites were systematically studied. Compared with MWCNT/CE composites, MWCNT/CE/cPES composites have a much lower percolation threshold that is as low as 0.89 wt%, only about 0.25 times of that of MWCNT/CE composites; besides, MWCNT/CE/cPES composites possess greatly improved dielectric constants, much larger breakdown strength and We as well as greatly decreased dielectric loss. The origin of these desirable properties was discussed through investigating the structure and building equivalent circuits. Results show that an in situ non-covalent interaction is formed between MWCNTs and cPES during the melting blending process, while cPES is compatible with CE resin, so MWCNTs have excellent dispersion in the CE/cPES matrix, endowing MWCNT/CE/cPES composites with unique structure and desirable dielectric properties. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Blending; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Dielectric devices; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Dispersions; Energy storage; Equivalent circuits; Esters; Ethers; Melting; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Polymer matrix composites; Resins; Solvents; Yarn; Breakdown strengths; Energy storage density; High energy storage densities; Low dielectric loss; Non-covalent interaction; Percolation thresholds; Polymer nanocomposite; Transparent polymer; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946945303

Scanning electron microscopy observation results indicated graphene particles were fairly well dispersed in the nanocomposite filled with hybrid graphene/MWCNTs, while graphene sheets were prone to aggregation in the PBX filled with individual graphene. Hybrid graphene/MWCNTs modified PBX exhibited higher storage modulus in the whole temperature range. The compressive fracture energy (Wc) and tensile fracture energy (Wt) at 20°C were up to 31.6% and 89.6% higher than that of PBX without nanofillers. The creep responses of the composites were determined by short-time creep tests at various temperatures and stresses. The creep compliance curve for TATB-based PBXs showed a remarkable synergetic effect between graphene and MWCNTs in improving the creep resistance. The better dispersion of graphene nanoparticles and higher interfacial zones, which produced strong interfacial interaction between the graphene and polymer matrix to restrict the mobility of polymer chains, were considered as crucial factors for the improvement in the creep resistance for TATB-based PBXs. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Agglomeration; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Creep; Creep resistance; Explosives; Filled polymers; Fracture; Fracture energy; Nanotubes; Scanning electron microscopy; Viscoelasticity; Yarn; 1 , 3 , 5-triamino-2 , 4 , 6-trinitrobenzene; Compressive fracture; Interfacial interaction; Polymer bonded explosives; Short-time creep test; Synergetic effect; Temperature range; Tensile fractures; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946902231

Herein, we increase the capacity retention and cycle life of the Li-S battery through the addition of an interlayer made of polypyrrole (PPy)-treated carbon paper (CP) in a Li-S battery. We first quantitatively investigate the effect of the thickness of the carbon paper and then optimize a novel interlayer prepared by using PPy adhered to the carbon paper. The results show that 300 μm CP is the best choice among the three thicknesses. The CP-300 samples deliver a reversible capacity of 490 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with a 0.5 C rate and show the best rate performance. Because of the porous structure and conductivity of the as-prepared PPy interlayer, the battery incorporating the PPy interlayer exhibits more excellent cycle performance and better rate performance than the CP batteries. Surprisingly, the PPy-coated CP-200 battery displays a reversible capacity of 555 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with a 0.5 C rate.

The assembled Co-doped NiO electrode was found to deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1487.5 mA h g-1 and it retained a reversible capacity of up to 708 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 718 mA h g-1). By contrast, a pristine NiO electrode tested under the same conditions delivered a reversible capacity of 128.7 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. The doped electrode also exhibited a high Coulomb efficiency, excellent cycle stability and good rate capability when compared with an undoped electrode. This improved electrochemical performance is attributed primarily to the efficient substitution of Co2+ for Ni2+ in the metal oxide matrix, which enhanced the p-type conductivity of NiO by the generation of free holes in the valence band. Moreover, the novel nanosheet structure was also able to enlarge the electrode/electrolyte contact area and shorten the path length for lithium ion transport.

Attention is now placed on the development of high-capacity and stable electrode materials at low costs. Among them, compounds operating on the conversion mechanism represent a promising class of anode materials. Unfortunately, they are generally plagued by poor electrical conductivity and large volume changes during repeated cycling. In this study, we exploit a new type of composite material made of copper phosphide and Super P carbon black (CuP2/C) as a potential anode candidate. The final products consisted of crystalline CuP2 cores coated with carbon black nanoparticles on the surface. Electrochemical measurements and multiple ex situ studies demonstrate that CuP2/C composites are capable of fast and reversible sodiation and desodiation based on the conversion mechanism. They deliver a large capacity in excess of 500 mA h g-1, high rate capability and decent short-term cycling stability.

Herein, a convenient one-step hydrothermal method for preparing Ni(OH)2/graphene composite hydrogels (NGHs) with interconnected networks is described. This procedure includes the reduction of GO sheets by hydrazine and the in situ deposition of Ni(OH)2 nanoplates on graphene sheets. Notably, the obtained NGH7.5 (the calculated mass ratio of formed Ni(OH)2 with GO is 7.5:1) can offer a high specific capacitance of 1125.4 F g-1 at a charge/discharge rate of 0.5 A g-1, which is almost 2.2 times and 8.1 times higher than Ni(OH)2 and graphene, respectively. Meanwhile, the NGHs also present stable cycling performances with 87.3% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles, which are significantly higher than that of its counterparts of Ni(OH)2. More interestingly, the 3D structure of the NGH can be easily transmitted to NiO/graphene (NiO/G) composites utilizing a facile thermal treatment procedure. The electrode based on the NiO/G composite delivers a discharge capacity of 1349 mA h g-1 and a charge capacity of 992 mA h g-1 at the 1st cycle with a coulombic efficiency of about 73.5%.

The most common chemistries considered for use in these applications include valve regulated lead acid (VRLA), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (LI). The University of Texas at Arlington's (UTA's) Pulsed Power and Energy Laboratory (PPEL) has assembled three batteries, one of each chemistry, with ∼60 V open circuit potentials (OCPs) and is in the process of experimentally characterizing their capacity fade and impedance growth when they are used to drive a high current pulsed load in a 5 seconds on / 5 seconds off pulsed profile.

Using standard voltage, current, and thermal diagnostics as well as periodic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the capacity fade and impedance growth of each chemistry is being studied to understand how the high rate pulsed profile ages the cells. Empirical and lumped element models of the impedance rise will be developed to better understand what is aging internally and how it impacts the usable life of the batteries compared with manufacturers rated life predictions.

Recently, sodium sulfur (Na-S) batteries have gained considerable attention as a viable candidate for large scale energy storage. However, Na-S battery technology comes with the disadvantages of relatively high operating temperature, brittle insulator and safety concerns with regards to temperature management. In this study, a two-dimensional heat transfer model is integrated with a zero-dimensional, transient electrochemical model for Na-S batteries to predict the temperature distribution inside the Na-S battery during a typical operation cycle. Properties required for solving the heat transfer governing equation and electrochemical model, such as electronic and ionic conductivity, species concentrations and thermal conductivity are calculated and updated as a function of time. Additionally, the instant outputs of these combined computational tools for a single sodium sulfur battery, temperature, open circuit voltage, polarization and ohmic losses are used as input parameters for a designed Simulink model to analyze a stack of Na-S batteries. These computational tools aim to support thermal management and to complete the design procedure of storage systems made of Na-S batteries. The present model is tested against experimental results found in literature. Good agreement is achieved between current model and the available experiments. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Computation theory; Computational methods; Energy storage; Heat transfer; Open circuit voltage; Renewable energy resources; Sodium; Sodium compounds; Sulfur; Thermal conductivity; Clean energy technology; Electrochemical modeling; Electronic and ionic conductivity; High operating temperature; Renewable energy source; Species concentration; Temperature management; Two dimensional heat transfer model; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945935537

Besides, the CPCFs were superhydrophobic and showed outstanding performance in oil-absorption and good circulation for the removal of dyes from water.

Accordingly, this study investigates the chemical extraction of Zn from the spinel compositions ZnMn2-xNixO4 (x = 0, 0.5, and 1) using H2SO4 and NO2BF4. Acid treatment is able to extract Zn from the structure through a Mn3+ disproportionation reaction that is dependent on the Mn3+ content. Zn extraction decreases with increasing Ni content due to the decrease in Mn3+ content; in fact, ZnMnNiO4 does not lose any Zn upon acid treatment because all of the Mn ions are in the 4+ state. Treatment with NO2BF4, however, is unable to extract any Zn from the samples, unlike in the analogous LiMn2O4 spinel. This is believed to be due to the high electrostatic repulsion that Zn2+ ions would feel from other Zn2+ ions in neighboring tetrahedral sites as they have to diffuse through the unoccupied octahedral sites in the spinel lattice, and Zn2+ does not prefer octahedral sites. Because NO2BF4 more closely approximates the extraction mechanism experienced in a Zn-ion cell, it appears that the ideal spinel structure is not suitable as a Zn-ion battery cathode unless synthesis conditions or additional treatments were used to create vacancies in the structure that allows for easier Zn-ion diffusion without much electrostatic repulsion. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrostatics; Extraction; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese; Manganese oxide; Nickel; Nitrogen oxides; Secondary batteries; Additional treatment; Charge storage capacity; Chemical extractions; Disproportionation reactions; Electrostatic repulsion; Extraction mechanisms; Multivalent cations; Synthesis conditions; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945243301

The flame retardancy and thermal degradation behavior of the EP composites was investigated by limited oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), cone calorimeter (CONE) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy capability (SEM-EDS) was used to characterize the morphology and elements of the residual chars. A possible flame retardant mechanism of the CSPPS-APP in EP matrix was proposed based on the CONE, TGA and SEM-EDS results. The influence of CSPPS-APP content on the glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, Young's modulus, tensile strength and fracture toughness (KIC) of the material was also investigated. The results show that the CSPPS-APP microspheres lead to significant flame retardant and char formation effects on the EP. The Young's modulus and fracture toughness of the EP/CSPPS-APP composites increase with increasing CSPPS-APP content. The fracture toughness of the composite containing 15% CSPPS-APP increased by approximately 59% compared to that of the neat matrix. In addition, the critical strain energy release rate (GIC) of the epoxy increased from 159 to 409 J m-2 with the addition of 15% CSPPS-APP. The SEM images of the fracture surface indicate that the enhanced toughness of EP/CSPPS-APP composites can be attributed to the debonding of the core-shell microspheres and the subsequent plastic void growth of the matrix, as well as the crack deflection effect of CSPPS-APP. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cracks; Elastic moduli; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Flame retardants; Glass transition; Microspheres; Oxygen; Polymer matrix composites; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Strain energy; Strain rate; Tensile strength; Thermogravimetric analysis; Ammonium polyphosphates; Core-shell microspheres; Critical strain energy release rates; Degradation behavior; Flame-retardant mechanisms; Limited oxygen index; Toughening mechanisms; Vertical burning tests; Fracture toughness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944882752

The thermal properties of the [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes were also investigated in detail. The particular trapping ability of 12-crown-4 to Li+ can obviously reduce the cation-anion (Li+-I-) interaction and hence facilitate favorable electrical properties of the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, [Li∈12-C-4][I] represents ionic conductivity of 3.93 × 10-5 and 1.53 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 and 80 °C, respectively.

These structural composites maintain full energy storage capability (5-8 W h kg-1) under tensile stresses over 1 MPa, with nearly 100% energy retention after 4000 cycles. We observe this mechanical and charge storage performance to be preserved through extreme water immersion conditions in contrast to conventional polymer-based solid-state electrolytes that spontaneously lose mechanical integrity under water immersion conditions.

In this study, we conducted studies on and characterized an all-vanadium photoelectrochemical storage cell (all-V PESC) for highly efficient solar energy storage using methanesulfonic acid (MSA) as a promising supporting electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and zero resistance ammetry (ZRA) studies of the all-V PESC show greatly improved photoelectrochemical properties of MSA over conventional H2SO4. To elucidate its heightened performance, the conductivity and reaction kinetics of the system were investigated using four-probe conductivity measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. The EIS results demonstrate vastly reduced charge transfer resistance and interfacial capacitance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface via ultra-long photoelectron lifetime; while the conductivity measurements reveal a comparable bulk ionic conductivity to H2SO4. Cell efficiency tests indicate a nearly 19-fold enhancement in incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and a high faradaic efficiency (84.8%) during a continuous 60 h operation using MSA as the supporting electrolyte.

The dielectric constant of the composite with 30 vol% BT@C is 1044 at 1 kHz, which is 118 times higher than that of PVDF-HFP (8.8). The experimental results fit well with the percolation theory. The energy storage density of all composites is larger than that of pure PVDF-HFP. The influence of the carbon-shell on the dielectric properties of composites is discussed and analyzed.

The algorithm is based on the evaluation of catalyst sensitivity functions, which show how much the cell voltage or discharge current are increasing when a small amount of catalyst is added at given locations inside the catalyst layers. The catalyst sensitivity functions are evaluated with relatively low computational cost using an adjoint space approach. Using the proposed algorithm one can compute the exact, optimum, threedimensional (3-D) distribution of platinum particles inside the catalyst layers in order to maximize the overall power density of the cell. It is shown that the optimum distribution depends on the discharge conditions, on the positions of landings and openings, and on the geometry and dimensions of the layers. In general, the optimum catalyst density in the cathode catalyst layer should be larger at the membrane than at the gas diffusion layer interface. In addition, the catalyst density should be slightly larger under the gas channel and smaller under landings. © 2015 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Diffusion in gases; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Phase interfaces; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Sensitivity analysis; Adjoint sensitivity analysis; Catalyst distribution; Cathode catalyst layers; Gas diffusion layers; Large-scale optimization; Numerical algorithms; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Threedimensional (3-d); Solid electrolytes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940108170

In particular cathode exposure to atmospheric air contaminants, such as humidity, can result in long-term performance degradation issues. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the interaction between water molecules and cathodes is essential to resolve this issue and further enhance cathode durability. To study the effects of humidity on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we used in-situ 18O isotope exchange techniques to probe the exchange of water with two of the most common SOFC cathode materials, (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-x (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF). In this experiment, heavy water, D2O (with a mass/charge ratio of m/z=20), is used to avoid the overlapping of the H2O and the 18O2 cracking fraction, which both provide a peak at m/z=18. A series of temperature programmed isotope exchange measurements were performed to comprehensively study the interaction of water with the cathode surface as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and water vapor concentration. The results suggest that H2O and O2 share the same surface exchange sites. Therefore, the presence of H2O competes with O2 for the available surface sites. Our findings show that H2O prefers to exchange with LSM and LSCF at a lower temperature range, around 300-450°C. For LSM, O2 is more favorable than H2O to be adsorbed on LSM surface and the presence of O2 limits H2O exchange with the LSM surface.

The development of a new protonic ceramic fuel cell computational modeling framework is presented for a predictive cell-level, interface charge transfer PCFC model capturing the mixed conducting nature of the protonic ceramic materials. The model employs a 1-D channellevel modeling strategy where fuel depletion and flow configuration effects are resolved and coupled to a semi-empirical electrochemical model.

One of main challenges in the SOFC technology development is to suppress degradation processes, often associated with the interconnect materials, and to provide low contact resistivity in oxidizing atmospheres. The present work is focused on the studies of near-surface interdiffusion phenomena in Crofer 22 APU ferritic steel interconnects with Ni-based protective layers. Particular emphasis was centered on the area-specific resistance (ASR) between the current collectors and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) cathodes, which exhibit time dependencies governed by the protective interlayer composition and interface microstructure alterations. The ASR changes, tested during over 30, 000 hours at atmospheric oxygen pressure, can be described in terms of a model assuming that the current across the interconnector | LSM interface is essentially controlled by electron transfer via the interfacial Schottky barrier. The experimental observations validate this approach, explaining the junction resistivity and Schottky barrier height variations as a result of metal interdiffusion between the current collector and Ni-based protective coating. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electric current collectors; Electrodes; Energy conversion; Fuel storage; Lanthanum compounds; Manganese compounds; Protective coatings; Schottky barrier diodes; Strontium compounds; Area-specific resistances; Atmospheric oxygen pressure; Interconnect materials; Interface mi-crostructure; Interfacial schottky barriers; Interlayer compositions; Schottky barrier heights; Technology development; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938807385

In this paper, CH4 synthesis characteristics in tubular SOEC (TSOEC) is studied in the temperature range of 550-650°C by combining experiment and simulation. Experiments demonstrate that adding H2 increases CH4 production ratio from 0 to 4.01% at 600°C. Besides, electricity significantly promotes CH4 production, especially when H2 is added. The voltage of 1.5 V increases CH4 production ratio by &lt;0.04% in the absence of H2. But when 20% H2 is fed in cathode, a voltage of 1.5 V can increase CH4 production ratio by 3-4%. Finally, chemical reactions, thermal distribution and optimal operating condition are simulated by a well validated thermal model. A reasonable thermal distribution created by operating TSOEC in counter-flow mode and lower inlet steam partial pressure can dramatically improve CH4 production. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Energy conversion; Fuel storage; Methane; Regenerative fuel cells; Co-electrolysis; CO2 emissions; Optimal operating conditions; Renewable Power; Steam partial pressure; Temperature range; Thermal distributions; Thermal model; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938801405

Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) composed of a dense electrolyte coated with two porous electrodes on each side is generally constructed on the electrolyte. However, high operation temperatures are required to obtain acceptable performance values due to high electrolyte resistance as a result of the use of thick electrolyte layer as a mechanical support for MEA. Alternatively, the cells can be fabricated as anode-supported where the anode is responsible for supporting the cell mechanically. By doing so, the operation temperature can be lowered due to reduced electrolyte thickness. In this study, the effects of isostatic press parameters i.e. temperature and pressure for NiO/YSZ anode support on the anode-supported cell performance and the microstructure of the anode support are investigated. The experimental results reveal that the cell performance is strongly influenced by the pressing parameters.

Specifically, it is shown that Ni/GDC is stable in the presence of 10 ppm H2S, but only in the case where 100 vol% of H2 is the anode feed. In the case where CH4 and H2O (diluted in Helium carrier gas) comprise the anode feed, then at ratios equal to S/C = 2 or S/C = 0.13 the performance of Ni/GDC shows severe degradation, while the Au-Mo-Ni/GDC anode has the best and most stable electrocatalytic behavior.

Both energetic and exergetic point of views are adopted to estimate system and components performances. Preliminary results from the ongoing research are presented in this paper. Different operating conditions are evaluated via sensitivity analysis. Results are presented first for a reversible cell and then for a complete system.

Many membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) models neglect CO electrochemistry due to sluggish kinetics and the water-gas-shift reaction, but CO oxidation may be important for high CO-content syngas. The 1D-MEA model presented here incorporates detailed mechanisms for both H2 and CO oxidation, individually fitted to experimental data. These mechanisms are then combined into a single model, which provides a good fit to experimental data for H2/CO mixtures. Furthermore, the model fits H2/CO data best when a single chargetransfer step in the H2 mechanism is assumed to be rate-limiting for all current densities. This differs from the result for H2/H2O mixtures, where H2 adsorption becomes rate-limiting at high current densities. These results indicate that CO oxidation cannot be neglected in MEA models running on CO-rich syngas, and that CO oxidation can alter the H2 oxidation mechanism. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Chemical shift; Digital storage; Energy conversion; Fuel storage; Mixtures; More electric aircraft; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Synthesis gas; Water gas shift; Co oxidation; CO-rich syngas; High current densities; Membrane electrode assemblies; Rate limiting; Single models; Sluggish kinetics; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938782881

Fuel cell hybrids are a combination of energy conversion sub-systems - fuel cells and heat engines. Fuel cell hybrids are important for the future for they are the most efficient devices when converting chemical energy of methane from natural gas and renewable fuels to electricity. While the perfect fuel cell would undergo no degradation, practical fuel cells with irreversibilities will degrade. The common practice is to linearize degradation. However, experimental evidence shows that ASR(t) is commonly an ohmic parabolic function. By the principle of superposition one can easily develop the equations for degrading hybrids from those developed for hybrids. The path of maximum power can be developed for degrading hybrids as a function of ASR and temperature. The maximum power for a degrading fuel cell hybrid is given by the Gaussian hypergeometric function. The range of the operation of the SOFC is likely most conducive to hybrid operation for hydrogen oxidation as the working reaction. Each working reaction has a characteristic transition temperature and a characteristic optimal operating temperature. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Energy conversion; Engines; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Heat engines; Temperature; Experimental evidence; Gaussian hypergeometric functions; Hybrid operations; Hydrogen oxidation; Operating temperature; Parabolic functions; Practical fuels; Principle of superposition; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938781456

The RSOFC has been considered for generation of electrical power from a variety of fuels and production of chemicals such as hydrogen from steam when coupled with an energy source. The RSOFC is technologically derived from the SOFC, therefore, when the cell is operated in electrolysis mode (referred to as solid oxide electrolysis cell or SOEC mode), it is critical that electrode performance is reversible and system design is configured for efficient operation in both SOEC and SOFC modes. This paper discusses certain aspects of electrode reversibility in SOEC mode for planar RSOFCs and presents a conceptual system design for electrolysis operation. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electrodes; Electrolysis; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Regenerative fuel cells; Systems analysis; Conceptual system design; Electrical power; Electrode performance; Energy source; Operating modes; Solid oxide electrolysis cells; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938771011

However, most research work on ASCs has involved non-renewable metal oxides (or hydroxides). Herein, an all-carbon and high-energy asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is constructed using polyaniline nanotubes (PNTs) as the positive electrode and anthraquinone-functionalized porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (AQ@PNCNTs) as the negative electrode. The PNTs are prepared by a facile chemical self-assembly method, and further carbonization/activation of the PNT precursor results in the formation of the porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (PNCNTs). Under solvothermal conditions, PNCNTs serve as a conductive substrate to adsorb anthraquinone (AQ) molecules, which can contribute additional electrochemical capacitance to the overall capacitance of the electrode. The as-assembled AQ@PNCNTs//PNTs ASC exhibits excellent supercapacitive performances in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In particular, the device can deliver an energy density as high as 32.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 700 W kg-1. Even at the power density of 14.0 kW kg-1, the energy density still remains at 20.2 W h kg-1.

One of the key issues in the development of a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors is that materials showing large specific capacitance are poorly abundant. In this paper, we show that niobium doped titanium dioxide (Nb:TiO2) nanowires developed by electrospinning have an order of magnitude higher capacitance (∼280 F g-1) than pristine TiO2 (∼40 F g-1) or zirconium doped TiO2 (∼30 F g-1). The cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge cycling experiments show that the Nb:TiO2 nanowires have 100% coulombic efficiency and could be operated over 5000 cycles without any appreciable capacitance degradation. The superior charge storage capability of the Nb:TiO2 is assigned to its high electrical conductivity as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A practical supercapacitor is fabricated in asymmetric configuration using the Nb:TiO2 as anode and activated carbon as cathode. The device delivered energy densities of 16.3, 11.4 and 5.6 W h kg-1 at power densities of 770, 1310, and 1900 W kg-1, respectively.

However, these CNT-based composites usually suffer from high dielectric loss and low breakdown strength, and pose difficulties in the tailoring of the dielectric constant. The integration of a CNT cladding insulator filler layer into the polymers provides an effective way to reach a low dielectric loss and a high breakdown strength. But the insulator layer could significantly reduce the dielectric constant, thereby decreasing the energy storage density of composites. Herein, we have designed and fabricated a novel candidate composed of a semiconductor NH2-CuPc coated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-CuPc) through chemical grafting, in which dielectric CuPc layers can act not only as insulation barriers for suppressing leakage current, but also as semi-conductor layers to partially block electron motion. Thus the as-prepared composites exhibit not only a higher dielectric constant but also extremely decreased dielectric loss and excellent dielectric strength. Moreover, the dielectric properties of the composites can be easily tuned by tailoring the loading of MWCNT-CuPc. Our strategy provides a new pathway to achieve polymer/CNT composites with high dielectric performances for energy storage applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Copolymers; Dielectric devices; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Electric breakdown; Energy storage; Filled polymers; Grafting (chemical); Polymers; Yarn; Breakdown strengths; Dielectric strengths; Energy storage applications; Energy storage density; High dielectric constants; Insulation barriers; Low dielectric loss; Metalphthalocyanines; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935016309

In this study, we report for the first time a new strategy for the fabrication of a high density graphene aerogel (HDGA) through a simple multiple gel method. The results show that the density of HDGA will rapidly increase with increasing number of graphene oxide gelation cycles. The as-prepared HDGA exhibits a better mechanical strength and electrochemical property than common graphene aerogel. Interestingly, these properties are easily adjusted by controlling the number of graphene oxide gelation cycles. To further improve the electrocatalytic performance, gold nanostars were synthesized and modified on the surface of graphene sheets.

Cathode materials, as one of the most important components of LIBs, play a critical role in determining the performances of LIBs. Monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) is one of the cathode materials with most potential for LIBs because of its high theoretical capacity, high operating voltage and safety performance. However, the intrinsically low electronic and ionic conductivity of LVP limits its development in large-scale application. Various methods such as carbon coating, cation doping and reducing the particle size have usually been used to improve the electrochemical performances of LVP. Besides, the design and optimization of LVP morphology are also effective approaches to improve the electrochemical performances of LVP. In this review, we discuss the development of morphology modifications such as porous structure, spherical structure, core-shell structure, rod-like structure, plate-like structure, nanofiber structure and flower-like structure in recent years and study the effects of various morphologies on the electrochemical performances of LVP. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Lithium compounds; Morphology; Particle size; Design and optimization; Electrochemical performance; Electronic and ionic conductivity; Energy storage systems; Flower-like structures; Large-scale applications; Plate-like structure; Spherical structures; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934967749

Beside energy supply, disposal costs of animal by-products (ABP) are the main relevant cost drivers. In this study, successful implementation of a new waste and energy management system based on anaerobic digestion is described. Several limitations and technical challenges regarding the anaerobic digestion of the protein rich waste material had to be overcome. The most significant problems were process imbalances such as foaming and floatation as well as high accumulation of volatile fatty acids and low biogas yields caused by lack of essential microelements, high ammonia concentrations and fluctuation in operation temperature. Ultimately, 85% of the waste accumulated during the slaughter process is converted into 2700MWh thermal and 3200MWh electrical energy in a biogas combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The thermal energy is optimally integrated into the production process by means of a stratified heat buffer. The energy generated by the biogas CHP-plant can cover a significant share of the energy requirement of the abattoir corresponding to 50% of heat and 60% of electric demand, respectively. In terms of annual cost for energy supply and waste disposal a reduction of 63% from 1.4Miö to about 0.5Miö could be achieved with the new system. The payback period of the whole investment is approximately 9years. Beside the economic benefits also the positive environmental impact should be highlighted: a 79% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 4.5Miokg CO2 to 0.9Miokg CO2 annually was achieved.

The influence of doping type, carrier concentration and bias condition during voltammetric polarization significantly alters the mechanism of electrochemical energy storage. The formation of a carrier depleted (electrically dead) layer of n-type NWs on silicon current collector electrodes limits insertion or alloying processes and rates that ordinarily form Li-Si phases, and charge is also stored within the electric double layer via pseudocapacitive processes.

Polyimide (PI) nanocomposite films with the electrospun BT fibers were fabricated using an in situ dispersion polymerization method. The morphology and crystal structure of the BT fibers were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It was found that their diameter and length were greatly dependent on the calcination temperature. Compared to the spherical BT nanoparticles, the introduction of one-dimensional BT fibers into the PI matrix gave rise to improved thermal stability. Besides, the dielectric behaviors of the PI/BT-fiber composite films were investigated over the frequency range from 102 Hz to 106 Hz and within a temperature range of 20-150 °C. The results demonstrated that the dielectric permittivity at 102 Hz of the PI nanocomposite films with 30 vol% BT fibers was improved up to ∼27, and the corresponding dielectric loss is relatively low (∼0.015).

One of the key barriers for practical application is poor in mass and heat transfer due to large volume expansion, serious agglomeration and low thermal conductivity. A novel CaCl2/MWNT adsorbent is prepared with carbon nanotube as matrix. In the composite, a part of CaCl2 nanoparticles are adsorbed on the matrix surface, and the else hygroscopic salts are filled in the space of matrices. The nanoparticles with big specific surface areas can be fully contacted with water vapour, enhancing water uptake and adsorption rate. Furthermore, the paper has reported that hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of the MWNT is relation with the adsorption performances of the CaCl2/MWNT composite. It is found that hydrophilic matrix can enhance water-retaining property, and keep a stable porous structure of the material. Finally, a simple modified method adding PVP as a water-based adhesive into the CaCl2/MWNT composite adsorbent is also reported for the first time. The PVP powder improves water-retaining property of the CaCl2/MWNT adsorbent during adsorption process. For regeneration process, the PVP water-based adhesive makes adsorbent particles agglomerate macroscopically under unchanged their microcosmic structure. At low humidity condition, adsorption rate of CaCl2/MWNT composite is obviously enhanced by the PVP powder. Consequently, the modified CaCl2/MWNT composite with the hydrophilic matrix will promise for commercial application in water vapour extraction, thermal storage energy and other applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Adhesives; Carbon nanotubes; Gas adsorption; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hydrophilicity; Nanoparticles; Thermal conductivity; Water vapor; Adsorption performance; Commercial applications; Hydrophilic/hydrophobic; Low humidity conditions; Low thermal conductivity; Mass and heat transfers; Water vapor adsorption; Water-based adhesives; Chlorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929492273

The Ap-rGO is prepared by sonicating a suspension of rGO with aminopyrene and the filtered sediment is subjected to spectroscopy studies and electrochemical studies. Spectroscopy studies reveal the successful functionalization of aminopyrene onto Ap-rGO through π-π interactions. Electrochemical analyses of Ap-rGO show a substantial increase in the specific capacitance for Ap-rGO (160 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1) compared to the non-functionalized rGO (118 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1). The enhancement is shown to be the pseudocapacitance arising from the electron donating effect of the amine group and the electron accepting effect of rGO, which enable facile electron transfer between the surface-bound amine group and rGO. The Ap-rGO has desirable charge storage properties such as low series resistance (0.4 Ω) and superior cycling stability (85% after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the Ap-rGO has 1.5 fold higher energy density than the non-functionalized rGO electrode, thereby making it suitable as a deployable supercapacitor electrode. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Capacitors; Electric resistance; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Graphene; Suspended sediments; Electrochemical analysis; Electrochemical studies; Electron-accepting; Electron-donating effects; Higher energy density; Reduced graphene oxides; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor electrodes; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929457145

In this process, the incorporation of polypyrrole, a highly conductive material, on the surface of a binary ZnO@MnO2 core-shell structured composite is adopted to optimize the charge transfer process to further improve the electrochemical performance. Because of enhanced electron transfer capability, charge transfer resistances of the ZnO@MnO2@PPy ternary core-shell nanorod arrays are reduced and the electrochemical performances are improved. The electrochemistry tests show that these self-supported electrodes are able to deliver ultrahigh specific capacitance (1281 F g-1 at a current density of 2.5 A g-1), together with a considerable areal capacitance (1.793 F cm-2 at a current density of 3.5 mA cm-2). Furthermore, a capacitance retention of 90% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g-1 is obtained, indicating the excellent cycling stability of the ZnO@MnO2@PPy ternary core-shell electrode.

This work investigated the main reaction routes from PHB to the key intermediates and final hydrocarbons. The main sequential reactions under catalysis of phosphoric acid at moderate temperatures (200-230 °C) consist of: (1) decomposition of PHB into crotonic acid, a major monomeric intermediate, (2) deoxygenation of crotonic acid, and (3) combination of the deoxygenated molecules. The oxygen in PHB is removed as CO2 and H2O in stage (2), involving decarboxylation and ketonization of crotonic acid. The main aromatic compounds are formed in stage (3) from propylene and 2,3-dimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one as two key intermediates, the former from decarboxylation and the latter from ketonization of crotonic acid.

Retailers with light physical assets, such as generation and storage units in the distribution network, are considered. Following advances in smart grid technologies, electricity retailers are becoming able to employ incentive-based demand response (DR) programs in addition to their physical assets to effectively manage the risks of market price and load variations. In this model, the DR scheduling is performed simultaneously with the dispatch of generation and storage units. The ultimate goal is to find the optimal values of the hourly financial incentives offered to the end-users. The proposed model considers the capacity obligations imposed on retailers by the grid operator. The profit seeking retailer also has the objective to minimize the peak demand to avoid the high capacity charges in form of grid tariffs or penalties. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve the multi-objective problem. It is a fast and elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A case study is solved to illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the model for designing the incentive-based DR programs and indicate the efficiency of NSGA-II in solving the retailers' multi-objective problem. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity retail market; Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II; Retailer","Commerce; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Grid computing; Optimization; Sales; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Electricity retail markets; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Incentive-based demand response; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization models; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II; Retailer; Multiobjective optimization; algorithm; decision making; demand analysis; energy market; optimization; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928739988

Inspired by this biological phenomenon, we developed an extraordinary gas-sensitive ion channel, reconfigurable ionic diode and bionic ion pump on the basis of the growth of a gas-responsive polymer film, which can be rendered hydrophilic with CO2 stimulus and hydrophobic with N2 stimulus. In particular, by alternatively purging CO2/N2 into the solutions which are placed on both sides of the channel embedded in the polymer membrane, the smart polymer-coated channel can be either closed or opened, which is independent of voltage polarity. Most intriguingly, under asymmetric stimulation with pH pairs (pH 6.5|pH 9.0) or with gas inputs (CO2|N2) on both sides of the channel, a change in voltage polarity can switch the channel between a closed status and open status, leading to the construction of a reconfigurable fluidic diode. Furthermore, by combination of gas inputs and voltage polarity, each of the gates of the channel can be individually manipulated, which is a very important prerequisite for the construction of a bionic ion pump that can be operated under physiologically mild conditions. It is envisaged that this new progress in the bionic pore/channel field will hold great prospects for the application of this kind of biomimetic device for energy storage, sample filtration and seawater desalinization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Biomimetics; Bionics; Byproducts; Carbon dioxide; Diodes; Film growth; Gases; Getters; Ions; Mobile security; Neurons; Polymer films; Polymers; Vacuum pumps; Biological phenomena; Biomimetic devices; Cellular metabolism; Coated channels; Olfactory sensory neurons; Polymer membrane; Responsive polymer films; Voltage polarity; Semiconducting films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928530469

Controlled synthesis of CuO NPs requires information on their nanoscale structure, which is expected to vary depending on the size, shape, phase, and most importantly, on the surface morphology. In this work, we report a detailed analysis of the structure of solid and melted CuO nanoparticles as functions of size and temperature at global and local scales, using molecular dynamics simulations. Comparisons of simulated X-ray diffraction profiles, mean bond lengths, average coordination numbers, and melting points with available experimental data support the modeling results. Melting points of CuO NPs vary linearly with the reciprocal of the diameters of NPs. The long-range order seen in solid nanoparticles with diameters greater than 6 nm gradually vanishes as size decreases, indicating the loss of translational symmetry of the lattice structure and the emergence of amorphous-like structure even below the melting point. Melted nanoparticles show liquid-like characteristics with only a short-range order. Mean bond lengths and average Cu-O coordination numbers of both solid and melted NPs indicate weakening of the structural stabilization for smaller NPs that leads to an increased deformation in the local atomic arrangement because of the lack of long-range interactions. For the cases studied, most of the structural features are independent of temperature, with the notable exception of the number of oxygen atoms coordinated to Cu. This latter quantity is indeed indicative of melting phase transition and can be used to compute the melting point accurately. Atoms on the surface of solid NPs show amorphous-like behavior even at temperatures well below the melting point of the NPs due to the limited coordination environment. This study represents a useful step towards the establishment of a structure-property relationship for CuO nanoparticles. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Amorphous materials; Atoms; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Copper; Digital storage; Melting point; Molecular dynamics; X ray diffraction; Amorphous like-structure; Average coordination number; Coordination environment; Melting phase transition; Molecular dynamics simulations; Structural stabilization; Structure property relationships; X ray diffraction profile; Nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928349655

It was found that the apparent activation energy (E) and the pre-exponential factor (A) of the reaction increased for the copolymers, and the TDI-polyether amine macro-initiators presented low reactivity due to the steric effects of the multi-armed long-chain structure. The hydrogen bond and inter-molecular forces of the copolymers were weakened by the introduction of multi-branched molecular chains, which was in favor of the formation of a γ-crystal. The crystallization ability decreased for the copolymers, among which MC nylon-6-b-PP3A with an extra branched-chain showed the highest melting and crystallization temperatures and crystallinity with a relatively large crystal grain size. A pseudo-plastic fluid characteristic of flow behavior was observed for MC nylon-6. The viscoelastic moduli (G) and entanglement density (νe) of all copolymers were higher than that of neat MC nylon-6 due to severe entanglement of the large quantity of multi-branched molecular chains of the copolymers resulting in the formation of physical networks, of which MC nylon-6-b-PP3A presented the highest. In the meantime, the values of the loss factor of the copolymers increased and the storage modulus and glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased. The stress-strain curves of all copolymers showed an untypical yield point and presented obvious strain hardening behavior, while a hairy fibrous structure was observed on the fracture surface of the copolymers, indicating the notable toughening effect of polyether amine on the nylon-6 matrix. The toughening mechanism of the copolymers was deduced as a multi-layer crack extension mechanism. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activation energy; Ethers; Glass transition; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular structure; Monomers; Polyamides; Rayon; Strain hardening; Stress-strain curves; Synthesis (chemical); Apparent activation energy; In-situ polymerization; Inter-molecular forces; Melting and crystallization temperatures; Preexponential factor; Pseudoplastic fluid; Strain hardening behavior; Toughening mechanisms; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927628796

Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are latent thermal storage materials possessing a large amount of heat energy stored during its phase change stage. Porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) can serve as the carrier for PCM. In this research, a structural concrete with function of indoor temperature control were prepared by using macro encapsulated PCM-LWA. The indoor and outdoor tests were performed to determine the thermal performance of the lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) containing macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA. The compressive strength and shrinkage strain of LWAC with macro encapsulated PCM-LWA were evaluated. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of application of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong were assessed. From indoor thermal performance test, it was found that LWAC incorporated with macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA has a function of reducing the energy consumption by decreasing the indoor temperature; flatten the fluctuation of indoor temperature and shifting the loads away from the peak periods. Moreover, from outdoor thermal performance test, it was found that the performance of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in adjusting the room temperature was optimized when there was a remarkable temperature difference between the day and night. Test results showed that the compressive strengths of LWAC incorporating macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA at 28 days was higher than control LWAC (without macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA) and was found to be over 15 MPa. The shrinkage strain reduced with the incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC and therefore has a beneficial effect on the volume stability of LWAC. From simple economic evaluation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong, the recovery or payback period was found to be less than the average life span of a residential building in Hong Kong. Therefore, incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC building walls is economically feasible. Finally, from environmental prospect, a reduction of 465 kg CO2-eq/year or 12.91 kg CO2-eq/year/m2 was achieved. This reduction would contribute to mitigate Greenhouse Gases emissions over the life span of building. It can therefore be concluded that the developed macro encapsulated PCM LWAC can be used for thermal and structural applications in buildings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Lightweight aggregate concrete; Macro encapsulation; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage concrete; Thermal performance","Aggregates; Carbon dioxide; Compressive strength; Concretes; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Floors; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Housing; Investments; Light weight concrete; Macros; Paraffins; Shrinkage; Space heating; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Encapsulated phase change materials; Greenhouse gases emissions; Indoor and outdoor tests; Indoor temperature control; Light-weight aggregate concrete; Lightweight aggregate concrete(LWAC); Macro-encapsulation; Thermal Performance; Phase change materials; aggregate; building; compressive strength; concrete; encapsulation; energy budget; energy use; floor; greenhouse gas; optimization; phase transition; shrinkage; temperature gradient; temperature profile; thermal power; air temperature; carbon dioxide; economic analysis; emission control; energy conservation; environmental impact; performance assessment; residential location; return period; testing method; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927625561

However, the predictable rising cost of lithium raw materials has attracted increasing interest in less expensive rivals, such as sodium-ion battery. In this work, a tin antimony (SnSb) alloy-filled porous carbon nanofiber composite was prepared as a sodium-ion battery anode material by a simple electrospinning method with subsequent thermal treatment. The spinning solution contained antimony tin oxide nanoparticles as the SnSb alloy precursor, polyacrylonitrile as the carbon precursor, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the pore generator. The resultant SnSb@C nanofiber composite formed a continuous conductive network, which was favorable for enhancing its electrochemical performance. The presence of the SnSb alloy significantly increased the energy storage capacity of the composite due to its high theoretical capacity. The porous structure created by the decomposition of the PMMA polymer provided a free space to buffer the volume change of the SnSb alloy during the sodiation-desodiation process.

Compared with conventional high-surface area carbon nanomaterials, electroactive conducting polymers (ECPs) exhibit an increase in energy density, which is attractive for next generation supercapacitor electrode materials. When designed with micro- and nanoscale dimensions, ECP electrodes display an increase in power density by decreasing the ion diffusion length in bulk electrodes. Here, we describe a template-free method for synthesizing polypyrrole microtubes on various stainless steel meshes with a process inherently scalable to large-area substrates. Microtube growth is governed by the nucleation of hydrogen gas at the mesh joints as a result of proton reduction at the platinum counter electrode. Depending on the size and spacing of the mesh wires and the substrate proximity to the working electrode, polypyrrole microtubes can be created with cylindrical and conical shapes with diameters ranging from 50-400 μm and heights up to 1400 μm. Polymer electrodes exhibiting cylindrical structures electrochemically grown with electrode potentials below 0.8 V exhibit excellent electrochemical performance comparable to thin polymer films. The process scalability is demonstrated using larger area substrates (up to 4 cm2) by carefully controlling the spacing between the working (substrate) and counter electrodes, which also provides an increase in microtube density from 350 cm-2 to 560 cm-2 without any loss in performance. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Conducting polymers; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Polymer films; Polypyrroles; Stainless steel; Substrates; Carbon nano-materials; Cylindrical structure; Electrochemical performance; High energy densities; Large-area substrates; Platinum counter electrodes; Stainless steel mesh; Supercapacitor electrodes; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924898041

Surprisingly, electrode specific capacitance (1128 F g-1) and energy density (39.17 W h kg-1) are increased by 447% by introducing PySH as the redox mediator in the PVA-H3PO4 gel polymer. The supercapacitor with the PVA-H3PO4-PySH gel polymer shows an excellent capacitance retention of 80% for over 1000 cycles. Simultaneously, the ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte increased by 92% up to 22.57 mS cm-1 compared to that of the PVA-H3PO4 system. These improved performances are owed to the redox reaction between 2-mercaptopyridine (PySH) and 2,2′-bipyridine (PySSPy) redox couples in the PVA-H3PO4-PySH gel electrolyte, indicating the supercapacitor combines the double-layer characteristic of carbon-based supercapacitors and the faradaic reactions characteristic of batteries' energy-storage processes.

The hierarchical conductive hydrogel was prepared via in situ polymerization of aniline monomer on the surface of Sn-Cu NPs and GO nanosheets. The morphology and structure of the resulting hybrid materials have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hierarchical conductive hydrogel framework with dendritic PANi nanofibers and 2D GO nanosheets serve as a continuous 3D electron transport network and high porosity to accommodate the volume expansion of Sn-Cu NPs. The PANi coating plays an ""artificial SEI"" function to preserve the structural and interfacial stabilization of Sn-Cu NPs during the cycling processes. As a consequence of this 3D hybrid anode, an extremely long stable cycling performance is achieved with reversible discharge capacity over 693 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at current rate of 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 371 mA h g-1 retention at a much higher current rate of 2 C, suggesting that this novel Sn-Cu/PANi/GO composite is a promising candidate for energy storage applications. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electron microscopy; Electron transport properties; Hybrid materials; Hydrogels; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanosheets; Polyaniline; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary batteries; Synthesis (chemical); Tin; Tin alloys; Transmission electron microscopy; Discharge capacities; Energy storage applications; High-performance anodes; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; In-situ polymerization; Morphology and structures; Polyanilines (PAni); Threedimensional (3-d); Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923881077

Negative electrodes of lead acid batteries with AC additives (i.e., lead-carbon electrodes) display much better charge acceptance than do traditional lead negative electrodes, and are suitable for energy storage in hybrid electrical vehicles. In this paper, we discuss the electrochemical processes on AC in lead-carbon electrodes. In the charging process of the lead-carbon electrode, lead electrodeposits on AC at potentials higher than the open circuit potential of lead, and the large surface area of AC provides extra active sites for lead electrodeposition and the growth of the electrochemical active surface area of lead. Namely, AC acts as an electron bumper and electron distributor in the charging process of the lead-carbon electrode. Most importantly, at high charge rates, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on AC is prohibited by reversible hydrogen adsorption; and meanwhile the adsorbed hydrogen contributes to the charging process.

This methodology provides, for the first time, the detailed dependence of energy and entropy of sorption as a function of coverage and temperature. The enthalpy data suggest three types of adsorption events: strongest exothermic initial chemisorption at low coverage, majority moderate chemisorption at intermediate loading and weakest physisorption at highest coverage. The partial molar properties and isotherms are consistent with the presence of two different potential chemisorption mechanisms: 2:1 (amine-CO2) stoichiometry near zero coverage and 1:1 afterwards.

The electrospun carbon nanofiber core acts as an electrically conductive substrate that enables the incorporation of the graphene/polypyrrole shell. Constructing a porous and interconnected one-dimensional configuration with a carbon nanofiber core facilitates the maximum electrochemical utilization of the graphene/polypyrrole shell. The addition of graphene significantly decreases the charge transfer resistance of the electrode by reducing the distance for electron shuttling in the polypyrrole chains for rapid electrochemical redox reactions. As a consequence, the specific capacitance of the core-shell electrode was enhanced up to 386 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1. The enhanced conductivity and improved stability of the core-shell composite electrode is able to retain 84% of its initial capacitance value over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance demonstrates that electrodes with a graphene/polypyrrole-coated carbon nanofiber core-shell architecture have great potential in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Architecture; Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon; Carbon nanofibers; Charge transfer; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Graphene; Nanofibers; Polypyrroles; Redox reactions; Shells (structures); Virtual storage; Charge transfer resistance; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical energy conversions; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical redox reactions; Electrospun carbon nanofibers; Potentiostatic electrodeposition; Supercapacitor application; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922131741

In this work, we synthesize a series of TBPs via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) consisting of rigid polystyrene and ion-conducting poly(oligo-oxyethylene methacrylate) segments and explore the role of tapered interfaces on ion transport. Previous studies on TBPs have shown that manipulating the taper composition in block polymers can reduce the unfavorable polymer-polymer interactions between blocks, enabling the design for highly-processable (lower order-disorder transition temperature) polymer electrolytes. Herein, we demonstrate that the taper profile and taper volume fraction significantly impact the glass transition temperatures (Tgs) in block polymer electrolytes, thus affecting the ionic conductivity. Additionally, we find that the normal-tapered materials with ≈60 vol% tapering exhibit remarkable improvements in ionic conductivity (increase ≈190% at 20°C and increase ≈90% at 80°C) in comparison to their non-tapered counterparts.

First, a simple hydrothermal treatment in a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution was used to fabricate ginkgo-leaf like nanostructures, resulting in a superhydrophilic surface on 2024 Al. Then a low-surface-energy compound, dodecafluoroheptyl-propyl-trimethoxylsilane (Actyflon-G502), was used to modify the superhydrophilic 2024 Al, changing the surface character from superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity. The water contact angle (WCA) of such a superhydrophobic surface reaches up to 160°, demonstrating excellent superhydrophobicity. Moreover, the as-prepared superhydrophobic surface shows high stabilities in air-storage, chemical and thermal environments, and has strong resistances to UV irradiation, corrosion, and abrasion. The WCAs of such a surface almost remain unchanged (160°) after storage in air for 80 days, exposure in 250 °C atmosphere for 24 h, and being exposed under UV irradiation for 24 h, are more than 144° whether in acidic or alkali medium, and are more than 150° after 48 h corrosion and after abrasion under 0.98 kPa for 1000 mm length. The remarkable durability of the as-prepared superhydrophobic surface can be attributed to its stable structure and composition, which are due to the existence of lanthanum (hydr)oxides in surface layer. The robustness of the as-prepared superhydrophobic surface to harsh environments will open their much wider applications. The fabricating approach for such robust superhydrophobic surface can be easily extended to other metals and alloys. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","aluminum alloy; biomimetic structure; durability; hydrothermal method; superhydrophobic surface","Abrasion; Alloys; Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Biomimetic processes; Biomimetics; Corrosion; Durability; Hydrophilicity; Irradiation; Lanthanum oxides; Metallurgy; Surface properties; Biomimetic structures; Hydrothermal methods; Hydrothermal treatments; Robust superhydrophobic surfaces; Super-hydrophilicity; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophilic surface; Water contact angle (WCA); Hydrophobicity; alloy; aluminum; biomimetic material; biomimetics; chemical phenomena; chemistry; evaluation study; pH; procedures; surface property; Alloys; Aluminum; Biomimetic Materials; Biomimetics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921730788

Here we report a facile soft-template mediated approach for fabrication of nanostructured cobalt-iron double sulfides that are covalently entrapped in nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (Co0.5Fe0.5S@N-MC). Notably, with a positive half-wave potential (0.808 V) and a high diffusion-limiting current density, the composite material delivers unprecedentedly striking ORR electrocatalytic activity among recently reported nonprecious late transition metal chalcogenide materials in alkaline medium. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, are conducted to elucidate the correlation between structural features and catalytic activities of the composite. Moderate substitution and well-dispersion of iron in bimetallic sulfide composites are believed to have positive e ffect on the adsorption and activation of oxygen-containing species, thus leading to conspicuous ORR and OER catalytic enhancement compared to their monometallic counterparts. Besides, the covalent bridge between active sulfide particles and mesoporous carbon shells provides facile pathways for electron and mass transport. Beneficially, the intimate coupling interaction renders prolonged electrocatalytic performances to the composite. Our results may possibly lend a new impetus to the rational design of bi- or multimetallic sulfides encapsulated in porous carbon with improved performance for electrocatalysis and energy storage applications.

Herein, we developed a multifunctional nanomaterial for chemo-photothermal therapeutics based on silica and graphene core/shell structure (SiO2@GN) because of the ability of GN to convert light energy into heat. Serum protein was further modified onto the surface of GN (SiO2@GN-Serum) to improve the solubility and stability of GN-based nanoparticles in physiological conditions. The as-synthesized SiO2@GN-Serum nanoparticles (NPs) have been revealed to have high photothermal conversion efficiency and stability, as well as high storage and release capacity for anticancer drug doxorubicin (SiO2@GN-Serum-Dox). The therapeutic efficacy of SiO2@GN-Serum-Dox has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo for cervical cancer therapy. In vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrate that SiO2@GN-Serum NPs have excellent biocompatibility. However, SiO2@GN-Serum-Dox NPs show higher cytotoxicity than SiO2@GN-Serum and free Dox under irradiation with NIR laser at 1.0 W/cm2 for 5 min owing to both SiO2@GN-Serum-mediated photothermal ablation and cytotoxicity of light-triggered Dox release. In mouse models, the tumor growth is significantly inhibited by chem-photothermal effect of SiO2@GN-Serum-Dox.

Analysis indicated that MgH2 doped with 10 wt% K2ZrF6 is the best composite for the improvement of the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The results showed that the onset desorption temperature after the addition of 10 wt% K2ZrF6 was 250 °C, which experienced the reduction of 100 °C and 200 °C from 350 °C and 450 °C for as-milled and as-received MgH2, respectively. The re/dehydrogenation kinetics also significantly improved compared to the un-doped MgH2. The results of the Arrhenius plot exhibited that the activation energy for the hydrogen desorption of MgH2 was reduced from 164 kJ mol-1 to 80 kJ mol-1 after the addition of 10 wt% K2ZrF6. Moreover, the X-ray diffraction spectra displayed the formation of new phases of KH and ZrH2 by the doping of K2ZrF6 with MgH2 after the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation processes.

High catalytic effectiveness of the co-precipitated Fe, Co or V depends not only on its intrinsic activity, but also on its distribution state, which may be entirely different from previous composites prepared through physical routes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Activation energy; Desorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Catalytic efficiencies; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen desorption temperatures; Hydrogen sorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage properties; Hydrogen-absorption kinetics; Intrinsic activities; Nanocomposites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920836589

The features of GM were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Then, a batch system was applied to study the adsorption behaviors of lead ions (Pb2+) and methylene blue (MB) by GM in single and binary systems. The results showed that GM possessed a higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area than GO. In a single system, the maximum adsorption capacities of GM for MB and Pb2+ were 350 and 285 mg g-1, respectively. With increasing the storage days, the BET specific surface area and the maximum adsorption capacity of GM remained approximately unchanged, while that of GO dramatically decreased. For a binary system, the presence of MB in water provides additional binding sites for Pb2+, promoting the adsorption of Pb2+ on GM. The presence of Pb2+ in water would compete with MB on GM during the adsorption process, resulting in a decrease in the adsorption of MB.

We consider a hypothetical microgrid consisting of 21 single-family detached homes and three transformer-level community energy storage (CES) battery units ranging in size from 25. kW. h to 75. kW. h. To describe the performance of CES batteries, we implement a dynamic behavioral circuit model capable of describing voltage transients and rate-capacity effects. We use one-minute electricity production and consumption data collected from the smart grid test bed in 2012 to assess how the timing of an electric outage affects the islanding lifetime of a residential microgrid. We contrast our results with the average outage duration reported by U.S. electric utilities to quantify how often a residential microgrid could withstand a typical outage. Our results show that increasing the amount of rooftop PV in a residential microgrid does not significantly increase how often it can withstand an average-duration outage. However, combining PV with CES extends the median islanding lifetime by up to 11.6. h during morning outages. Based on our results, 50. kW. h CES provides the best tradeoff between the cost of a CES system and its reliability benefit, allowing downstream loads to withstand an average-duration outage approximately 93% of the time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Microgrid; Photovoltaics; Smart grid; Solar","Battery management systems; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Equipment testing; Housing; Outages; Solar power generation; Transients; Average outage duration; Community energy storages (CES); Electricity production; Micro grid; Photovoltaics; Single-family detached; Smart grid; Solar; Smart power grids; electrical power; hypothesis testing; photovoltaic system; Austin; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912533347

Thus, the feasibility analysis of abandoned salt caverns located in salt beds to be used as Underground Gas Storage (UGS) facilities is full of challenges. In this paper, we introduce the feasibility analysis of China's first salt cavern gas storage facility using an abandoned salt cavern. The cavern is located in Jintan city, Jiangsu province, China. The mechanical properties and permeability of the bedded salts are obtained by experiments. Based on the results of the analyses, it appears to be quite feasible to convert the abandoned salt caverns of Jintan city to UGS facilities. The stability of the cavern is evaluated by the 3D geomechanical numerical simulations, and the operating parameters are proposed accordingly. Results indicate that the maximum volume shrinkage of the cavern is less than 25% and the maximum deformations are less than 2% of the caverns' maximum diameters after operating for 20. years. It is recommended that the weighted average internal gas pressure be maintained as 11. MPa to control the extent of the plastic zones to a safe level. Safety factors decrease with operating time, especially those of the interface between rock salt and mudstone layers decrease significantly. Effective strain is generally greater than 2%, and locally is greater than 3% after operating 20. years. The maximum pressure drop rate should be kept to less than 0.55. MPa/day. Based on above proposed parameters, China's first salt cavern gas storage facilities were completed, and gas was first injected, in 2007. To check the status of the caverns after operating for 6. years, the volumes of the caverns were measured in 2013 by Sonar under working conditions. Measurement results show that the cavern shapes did not change much, and that volume shrinkages were less than 2%. Comprehensive results show that the feasibility analysis method proposed in this paper is reliable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Abandoned salt cavern; Energy storage; Field monitoring; Numerical simulation; Stability; Underground gas storage","Caves; Computer simulation; Convergence of numerical methods; Energy storage; Mechanical permeability; Numerical models; Safety factor; Salt deposits; Sedimentary rocks; Shrinkage; Feasibility analysis; Field monitoring; Internal gas pressure; Maximum pressure drops; Operating parameters; Salt cavern gas storages; Salt caverns; Underground energy storages; Underground gas storage; abandoned land; bedding plane; cavern; field survey; gas storage; mudstone; permeability; rock salt; shrinkage; underground storage; volume; China; Jiangsu; Jintan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912521275

The system captures excess power prior to electricity generation so that electrical components can be downsized for demand instead of supply. Energy is stored in a high pressure dual chamber liquid-compressed air storage vessel. It takes advantage of the power density of hydraulics and the energy density of pneumatics in the ""open accumulator"" architecture. A liquid piston air compressor/expander is utilized to achieve near-isothermal compression/expansion for efficient operation. A cycle-average approach is used to model the dynamics of each component in the combined wind turbine and storage system. Standard torque control is used to capture the maximum power from wind through a hydraulic pump attached to the turbine rotor in the nacelle. To achieve both accumulator pressure regulation and generator power tracking, a nonlinear controller is designed based on an energy based Lyapunov function. The nonlinear controller is then modified to distribute the control effort between the hydraulic and pneumatic elements based on their bandwidth capabilities. As a result, liquid piston air compressor/expander will loosely maintain the accumulator pressure ratio, while the down-tower hydraulic pump/motor precisely tracks the desired generator power. This control scheme also allows the accumulator to function as a damper for the storage system by absorbing power disturbances from the hydraulic path generated by the wind gusts. A set of simulation case studies demonstrate the operation of the combined system when the nonlinear controller is utilized and illustrates how this system can be used for load leveling, downsizing electrical system and maximizing revenues. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bandwidth limitation; Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES); Hydraulics; Load leveling; Pneumatics","Bandwidth; Compressed air; Compressibility of liquids; Controllers; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric machine theory; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulics; Liquids; Lyapunov functions; Pistons; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Turbine components; Wind turbines; Accumulator pressures; Bandwidth limitation; Compressed air energy storage; Compressed air storage; Electricity generation; Isothermal compressions; Load leveling; Non-linear controllers; Hydraulic accumulators; compressed air; electricity generation; high pressure; pressure drop; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912125617

While a great deal of work to date has focused on determining the effect of these nanoparticles on a PCM's solid phase thermal properties, little is known about their effect on its liquid phase thermal properties. Thus, in this study, the effect of implanting randomly oriented herringbone style graphite nanofibers (HGNF, average diameter=100nm, average length=20μm) on the bulk thermal properties of an organic paraffin PCM (IGI 1230A, Tmelt=329.15K) in both the solid and liquid phase is quantified. The bulk thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and thermal diffusivity of HGNF/PCM nanocomposites are obtained as a function of temperature and HGNF volume loading level. It is found that the property enhancement varies significantly depending on the material phase. In order to explain the difference between solid and liquid phase thermal properties, heat flow at the nanoparticle-PCM and nanoparticle-nanoparticle interfaces is examined as a function of HGNF loading level and temperature. To do this, the solid and liquid phase thermal boundary resistances (TBRs) between the nanoparticles and the surrounding PCM and/or between contacting nanoparticles are found. Results suggest that the TBR at the HGNF-PCM interface is nearly double the TBR across the HGNF-HGNF interface in both solid and liquid phases. However, both the HGNF-PCM and HGNF-HGNF TBRs are at least an order of magnitude lower when the PCM is in its solid phase versus when the PCM is in its liquid phase. Finally, the effect of nanofiber concentration on the PCM's latent heat of fusion and melt temperature is investigated in order to determine the applicability of the HGNF/PCM nanocomposite in a wide variety of energy systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Herringbone graphite nanofiber; Phase change material; Thermal boundary resistance; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Thermal energy storage","Graphite; Heat storage; Liquids; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Nanoparticles; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Thermal energy; Bulk thermal conductivity; Carbon Nano-Particles; Graphite nano fibers; Nanoparticle interfaces; Paraffin phase-change material; Temperature-dependent thermal property; Thermal boundary resistance; Volumetric heat capacity; Phase interfaces; graphite; heat capacity; heat flow; temperature effect; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912125203

Various heating temperatures of 240°C, 250°C, and 260°C and cooling temperatures of 30°C, 70°C, and 110°C were employed in the study, so as to extensively reveal the heat transfer characteristics during heat storage and retrieval. It was found that natural convection was very dominant during heat storage in the case of pure molten-salt, especially when the heating temperature was higher, and it was weakened in the case of molten-salt with metal foam; while the heat retrieval process was enhanced by the presence of the metal foam. The numerical results were compared with the experimental results, showing reasonable agreement, which indicated that such numerical model could be used for the further study of the performance of the LTES system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Eutectic molten salt; Heat storage/retrieval; Heat transfer characteristics; Metal foam; Thermal non-equilibrium","Eutectics; Foams; Fused salts; Heat transfer coefficients; Metals; Solar energy; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Eutectic molten salt; Heat transfer characteristics; Metal foams; Storage/retrieval; Thermal non-equilibrium; Heat storage; energy conservation; heat transfer; latent heat flux; numerical model; oil; phase transition; solar power; temperature anomaly; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912123027

The supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system is deployed in a solar energy system to improve the reliability of delivered power. The combination of batteries and supercapacitors makes use of complementary characteristic that allow the overlapping of a battery's high energy density with a supercapacitors' high power density. This hybrid system produces a straightforward benefit over either individual system, by taking advantage of each characteristic. When the supercapacitor caters for the instantaneous peak power which prolongs the battery lifespan, it also minimizes the system cost and ensures a greener system by reducing the number of batteries. The resulting performance is highly dependent on the energy controls implemented in the system to exploit the strengths of the energy storage devices and minimize its weaknesses. It is crucial to use energy from the supercapacitor and therefore minimize jeopardizing the power system reliability especially when there is a sudden peak power demand. This study has been divided into two stages. The first stage is to obtain the optimum SVM load prediction model, and the second stage carries out the performance comparison of the proposed SVM-load predictive energy management system with conventional sequential programming control (if-else condition). An optimized load prediction classification model is investigated and implemented. This C-Support Vector Classification yields classification accuracy of 100% using 17 support vectors in 0.004866. s of training time. The Polynomial kernel is the optimum kernel in our experiments where the C and g values are 2 and 0.25 respectively. However, for the load profile regression model which was implemented in the K-step ahead of load prediction, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel was chosen due to the highest squared correlation coefficient and the lowest mean squared error. Results obtained shows that the proposed SVM load predictive energy management system accurately identifies and predicts the load demand. This has been justified by the supercapacitor charging and leading the peak current demand by 200. ms for different load profiles with different optimized regression models. This methodology optimizes the cost of the system by reducing the amount of power electronics within the hybrid energy storage system, and also prolongs the batteries' lifespan as previously mentioned. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery; Load prediction; Solar application; Supercapacitor; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Capacitors; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Mathematical models; Mean square error; Power electronics; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Storage management; Support vector machines; Vectors; Battery; Complementary characteristics; Hybrid energy storage systems; Load predictions; Solar applications; Squared correlation coefficients; Super capacitor; Support vector classification; Energy management systems; classification; cost analysis; energy planning; energy resource; management practice; numerical model; renewable resource; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912117174

To fully melt and solidify over daily cycles, PCMs must be incorporated as thin layers placed longitudinally within the walls. The thin PCM layer was integrated into the wall via a thermal shield, whereby the PCM was contained in thin sealed polymer pouches, arranged in sheets laminated with aluminum foil on both sides. This system is herein referred to as ""PCM thermal shield (PCMTS)"". The optimal location of the PCMTS within the wall cavities is critical for heat transfer reduction and management. The thermal performance of south and west facing walls with and without PCMTS was evaluated experimentally using two identical test houses. The PCMTS was installed at various depths, one at a time, within the wall cavities. Each location depth was numbered from 1 to 5 starting at next to the wallboard surface facing the wall cavity (location 1) and proceeding to the exterior side of cavity at intervals of 1.27. cm. The results showed that the optimal location for a PCMTS in the south wall was location 3 (2.54. cm from the wallboard), while the optimal location for a PCMTS in the west wall was location 2 (1.27. cm from the wallboard). At these locations, the peak heat flux reductions were 51.3% and 29.7% for the south wall and the west wall, respectively. The maximum peak heat flux time delays were 6.3. h for location 1 in the south wall and 2.3. h for location 2 in the west wall.

Due to the large quantities of thermal energy and high quality electricity requirements for water purification, the desalination industry depends on waste heat resources and renewable energy sources such as solar collectors, photovoltaic arrays, geothermal and wind and tidal energy sources. Considering the mismatch between the source supply and demand and intermittent nature of these energy resources, energy storage is a must for reliable and continuous operation of desalination facilities. Thermal energy storage (TES) requires a suitable medium for storage and circulation while the photovoltaic/wind generated electricity needs to be stored in batteries for later use. Desalination technologies that utilize thermal energy and thus require storage for uninterrupted process operation are multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), multi-effect evaporation (MED), low temperature desalination (LTD) and humidification-dehumidification (HD) and membrane distillation (MD). Energy accumulation, storage and supply are the key components of energy storage concept which improve process performance along with better resource economics, and minimum environmental impact. Similarly, the battery energy storage (BES) is essential to store electrical energy for electrodialysis (ED), reverse osmosis (RO) and mechanical vapor compression (MVC) technologies.This research-review paper provides a critical review on current energy storage options for different desalination processes powered by various renewable energy and waste heat sources with focus on thermal energy storage and battery energy storage systems.

The end-users at power demand side can actually make use of their demand reduction potentials to contribute to the grid power balance. Conventional demand responses of end-users can provide considerable power demand reductions, but the demand responses are usually subject to significant delay and cannot fulfill the needs of grid real time operation. In this paper, a fast chiller power demand response control strategy for commercial buildings is therefore proposed which facilitates buildings to act as grid ""operating reserves"" by providing rapid demand responses to grid request within minutes. However, simply shutting down some essential operating chillers would result in disordered chilled water flow distribution and uneven indoor thermal comfort degradation. This strategy has therefore taken essential measures to solve such problems effectively. Simulation case studies are conducted to investigate the operation dynamics and energy performance of HVAC systems in the demand response events controlled by the strategy. Results show that fast and significant power demand reductions can be achieved without sacrificing the thermal comfort too much. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Building demand response; Building thermal storage; Chiller power demand limiting; Fast demand response; HVAC system control; Smart grid","Cooling systems; Flow of water; Heat storage; Office buildings; Thermal comfort; Demand response; HVAC system; Power demands; Smart grid; Thermal storage; Smart power grids; air conditioning; building; control system; cooling; demand-side management; energy conservation; heating; storage structure; strategic approach; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908576817

Reducing the distance between wells in large-scale application of ATES increases the total amount of energy that can be provided by ATES in a given area. However, due to thermal interference the performance of individual systems can decrease. In this study a novel method is presented that can be used to (a) determine the impact of thermal interference on the economic and environmental performance of ATES and (b) optimize well distances in large-scale applications. The method is demonstrated using the hydrogeological conditions of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Results for this case study show that it is cost-effective to allow a limited amount of thermal interference, such that 30-40% more energy can be provided in a given area compared to the case in which all negative thermal interference is avoided.

However, supercapacitors also known as Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLCs) are affected by high leakage or self discharge. The leakage is mainly dominated by redox reactions at the electrode surface through which electrons cross the double layer. Experiments have shown that a very thin blocking layer coating on the electrodes improves the energy storage capability by reducing the leakage, but it reduces the specific capacitance. The detrimental effect of the blocking layer on the capacitance requires the study of the blocking layer thickness' impact on the performance of the supercapacitor. In this work we have developed a mathematical model to study such effects. The model is a combination of simple quantum mechanical and electrochemical phenomena that occur during the self-discharge process. Using the developed model, a computational method was applied to simulate the discharge profile and specific energy in devices with various thicknesses in the blocking layer. The simulation approach can be used to study supercapacitor performances for practical applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Leakage current; Modeling; Self-discharge; Simulation; Supercapacitors","Capacitance; Electrodes; Energy storage; Leakage currents; Life cycle; Models; Quantum theory; Redox reactions; Supercapacitor; Surface reactions; Electrochemical phenomena; High power density; Model and simulation; Self-discharges; Simulation; Simulation approach; Specific capacitance; Storage capability; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908101873

Our approach is based on a liquid dispersion comprising of silicon quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) as a polymer additive. Coating of this dispersion onto copper foil followed by annealing in inert atmosphere allows the realization of a structure with good electrical conductivity, high specific surface area and with a carbon-based coating preventing the direct contact between the silicon particles and the electrolyte. This structure maintains a specific charge capacity of approximately 1000 mAh g-1 for 200 cycles and reaches a coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The addition of PVP is a simple and scalable way of realizing, after annealing, a carbon-based matrix which surrounds the silicon particles and which greatly enhances the stability of the battery. The proposed process is based on commercially available carbon nanotubes, on silicon quantum dots which are produced using a scalable plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition technique, and is compatible with large area coating and processing techniques.

While supercapacitor self-discharge is usually considered because it causes voltage decay and energy loss, supercapacitor charge redistribution has not been well examined although this process may result in a greater voltage change than self-discharge. This paper studies the supercapacitor voltage change during charge redistribution. The supercapacitor voltage may increase, decrease, or remain almost constant during charge redistribution depending on the initial state. Three approaches are employed to investigate the supercapacitor voltage change during charge redistribution: analytical estimations, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements. Both the supercapacitor voltage change after a charge process and that after a discharge process are examined. Various parameters of the charge or discharge process such as charge current and discharge time that affect the initial state of supercapacitor charge redistribution are swept. The results obtained using different approaches are consistent. These results can be utilized by wireless sensor network application designers to estimate the supercapacitor voltage change during charge redistribution. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It accounts for both irreversible and reversible heat generation rates resulting from the transient electrodiffusion of ions within the electrolyte. Detailed numerical simulations of EDLCs with planar electrodes and binary and asymmetric electrolytes were performed under galvanostatic cycling. The irreversible Joule heating decreased with increasing valency and/or diffusion coefficient of either ion. The local reversible heat generation rate near a given electrode was determined by the properties of the counterion. It increased with increasing counterion valency and/or decreasing counterion diameter. As a result, the electrode with the counterion of smaller diameter and/or larger valency experienced significantly larger temperature oscillations during galvanostatic cycling than the opposite electrode. In general, EDLC electrolytes featuring ions with large valency and/or small diameter produce large capacitance but also large reversible heating. The present study suggests that EDLC electrolytes should feature large bulk ion concentrations and at least one ion with a large diffusion coefficient to minimize both irreversible and reversible heating. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
