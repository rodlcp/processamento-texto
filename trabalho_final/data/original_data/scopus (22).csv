This past year the ALS served over 1000 users and that number is expected triple in the next three years. Currently there are seven insertion devices in operation including an Elliptically Polarizing Undulator (EPU) that mechanically shifts between left and right circularly polarized radiation at 0.5 Hz. A third harmonic cavity system has been installed and is providing longer lifetimes. A number of important machine developments are underway such as the inclusion of three superconducting magnets for the generation of high brightness, broadband, high energy photons; a fast orbit feedback system for improved orbit stability; and the inclusion of a second elliptically polarizing undulator. Future development plans include installation of more EPUs, and a narrow gap short period insertion device. In addition, several ""complementary"" sources are being studied such as a storage ring to produce far infrared radiation and sources to generate femtosecond x-ray pulses.

The current VLHC design foresees a 2-staged approach, where the second stage (referred to as VLHC-2) has a proton energy up to 100 TeV at a peak luminosity of 2·1034 cm-2sec-1. The protons are guided through a large 233 km circumference ring with 10 T bending magnets using Nb3Sn superconductor at 5 K. The synchrotron radiation (SR) power emitted by the beam in such a machine is -5 W/m/beam. However, other VLHC scenarios (e.g. [2]) with smaller rings and higher luminosity result in SR power levels exceeding this value, reaching 10 or even 20 W/m/beam. Intercepting and removing this power in a cryogenic environment is a major challenge. In this paper a discussion of SR in the VLHC-2, and various approaches to the issue, are presented. One possibility is the use of a beam screen (BS) to intercept the synchrotron radiation power. The BS operating temperature is chosen to balance thermodynamic efficiency, cryogenic-, vacuum-, beam-stability- and magnet-aperture issues. Another approach is to intercept the radiation in discrete points between the magnets with photon-stops (PS). The PS-s, having to intercept much higher power densities, are challenging components from engineering, vacuum, and beam-stability viewpoints.",,"Optimization; Proton beams; Storage rings; Superconducting magnets; Vacuum; Beam screen (BS); Very large Hadron colliders (VLHC); Synchrotron radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035572587

Most of them are accelerator physics applications that require intensive data processing and analyzing efforts, with moderate tasks of interfacing with the control system. The basic idea of developing applications using a commercial Web Browser is to truly realize object orientated design and platform independence, thus making development efforts more affordable. To implement this concept, common graphic services and methods of interfacing with control systems and various modelling codes are the two essential pieces. As a start, a small package of Java applet classes is developed to provide basic graphic service, and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is used for interfacing the control system, etc., with the Web server, as only light interfacing is required. For more dynamic graphic user interface approaches, Java servlets are used to replace CGI scripts and communicate with applets. Two accelerator physics applications (beam-based ring optics modelling and beam position monitor (BPM) center offset calibration), and an operational program for scaling the ring energy, are presented to illustrate this method.

The tune shifts of the rings are already about twice the design numbers of 0.03. This requires constant adjustments from the operators during fills and top-offs. A tune feedback was envisioned first, but the wide, multi-peaked tune signals make it tricky even for a human to adjust the tunes correctly. Since tunes are strongly correlated with the currents in the high and low energy rings (HER and LER), a tune feed-forward system was implemented. Each ring uses the measured dependences on its own current of about + or -0.018 per Ampere for the x- or y-tune. There is also a provision to adapt to the other beam's current. This parameter is usually a factor of ten lower. How these parameters change for different scenarios like optimizing the visual tune profile, the luminosity, or the measured single beam tune peak is discussed.",,"Electrons; Feedback; Optimization; Particle beam bunching; Low-energy rings (LER); Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035571919

In the SPring-8 storage ring, coherent synchrotron oscillation with amplitude of 0.2mmp-p was observed by BPM located in a dispersive section. Since the energy oscillation amplitude is proportional to the product of the phase noise amplitude and the inverse of the momentum compaction factor, the energy oscillation amplitude is enhanced by low momentum compaction factor. To make the amplitude of this synchrotron oscillation as low as possible, we checked the performance of synthesiser by measuring the noise level around the synchrotron frequency, and selected a synthesiser with best performance.

In high energy physics, low frequency (200 - 400 MHz) cavities are envisioned to accelerate muons for intense neutrino beams and muon colliders (200 - 1300 MHz). For storage ring based light sources, superconducting cavity systems (500 MHz) will upgrade the Taiwan Light Source and provide high voltage and high power for new storage rings under construction for the Canadian Light Source (CLS), DIAMOND in England, and SOLEIL (350 MHz) in France. Similar systems are envisioned for BEPC in China and for the new Shangai Light Source.

While further improvements in performance may still be expected, the performance of these machines is constrained by radiation fluctuations and by the Touschek effect. The practical effect of the radiation fluctuations is to limit the minimum 6D emittance of the rings in general, and particularly the bunch length. The Touschek effect limits the lifetime and the bunch charge density. These effects can be ameliorated by using a linac to accelerate the beam to the requisite energy before passing it through undulators to produce the x-rays. If the beam is discarded after producing x-rays, radiation and collision effects are no longer limiting. This approach has not been used because prohibitive amounts of energy would be required to produce the beam. However, by using energy recovery in a superconducting linac, the energy can be recycled to accelerate new electrons. This would allow the use of currents comparable to those in storage rings, but with superior emittance, bunch length and flexibility. The concept of a 5-7 GeV facility using this principle is described and parameter goals given.",,"Particle beam bunching; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; X rays; Energy recovery linac (ERL); Insertion devices; Semiconducting diamonds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035570949

Photon Beam Position Monitors (PBPM) have been developed for this purpose. The most common is the so-called blade-type-monitor which is based on the photoemission principle. Unfortunately when it is used into an undulator beamline, it suffers from a background contamination due to the dipole radiation. So, a more complex device has been successfully developed at Elettra for counteracting this effect. The novel detector is based on spectroscopic techniques and collects signals essentially due to the undulator radiation only. In fact the residual error due to the dipoles is less than 0.1%. Moreover it is easily tuneable on any desired working energy.

The differentially pumped, Viton O-ring sealed flange requires a low sealing force, allowing remotely controlled mechanical engagement. This provides flexibility and improved safety for the existing CLEO Be-beam pipe and attached silicon vertex (SVX) detector during installation of the CESR IR UHV system. To ensure acceptable vacuum performance of the flange joint over the operational lifetime, the radiation degradation and the outgassing properties of the Viton O-rings were investigated. We concluded that there was no significant seal degradation when the Viton O-rings were exposed to 5×106 Rad of γ radiation. The Viton O-ring outgassing rates were measured as a function of pumping time for various ambient air exposure times. One-dimensional finite element calculations showed that O-ring outgassing would have virtually no impact on the UHV operation. The flange also forms an axial RF seal with a canted coil spring and a radial RF seal with a electric conductive O-ring. This allows the joint to carry image currents from a storage beam up to 1 Amp. The IR UHV system including this so-called 'magic' flange joint has been operated successfully for two years, and has been successfully engaged and disengaged twice for upgrades of the CLEO detector.",,"Finite element method; High energy physics; Particle accelerators; Radiation; Permanent magnet quadrupoles (PMQ); Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035570608

Most of the available evidence, based on measurements of the unstable proton beam motion, is consistent with an electron-proton two-stream instability. The need for higher beam intensity at PSR and for future high-intensity, proton drivers has motivated a multi-lab collaboration (LANL, ANL, FNAL, LBNL, BNL, ORNL, and PPPL) to coordinate research on the causes, dynamics and cures for this instability. Important characteristics of the electron cloud were recently measured with retarding field electron analyzers and various collection electrodes. Suppression of the electron cloud formation by TiN coatings has confirmed the importance of secondary emission processes in its generation. New tests of potential controls included dual harmonic rf, damping by higher order multipoles, damping by X,Y coupling and the use of inductive inserts to compensate longitudinal space charge forces. With these controls and higher rf voltage the PSR has accumulated stable beam intensity up to 9.7 μC/pulse (6×1013 protons), which is a 60% increase over the previous maximum.",,"Computer simulation; Electrodes; Electron beams; Electron energy analyzers; Particle beam dynamics; Perturbation techniques; Protons; Titanium nitride; Field electron analyzers; Storage rings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035570515

Pbars originate from a primary 30 GeV proton beam of 1.5 * 1013 particles. A dedicated collector ring (CR) serves for pre-cooling of RI's at 740 MeV/u and of pbars at 3 GeV. Active debunching and stochastic cooling provide beams of sufficient quality.

Isochronous RI mass measurements are possible in the CR, too. A second ring, the New Experimental Storage Ring, serves for beam accumulation and, in the case of RI beams, internal experiments. Optimum conditions for RI experiments are reached by electron cooling.

Under study and experimental development are production targets handling intense proton beams (1-4 MW), phase rotation systems to reduce beam energy spread, cooling channels to reduce transverse beam emittance for the acceleration system, and storage rings where muon decays in a long straight section provide a neutrino beam for a long-baseline (3000 km) experiment. Critical experimental activities include development of very high gradient normal conducting RF (NCRF) and superconducting RF (SCRF) cavities, high-power liquid-hydrogen absorbers, and high-field superconducting solenoids. Components and instrumentation that tolerate the intense decay products of the muon beam are being developed for testing. For a high-luminosity collider, muons must be cooled longitudinally as well as transversely, requiring an emittance exchange scheme.

We achieve a head-on collision through the use of a central magnetic dipole field that generates a large horizontal bending field. This field is also the central field of the detector. The large energy range of the VLER, in order to maximize the center-of-mass energy range, complicates the collision point geometry. In order to maintain the beam orbits near the collision point two techniques are used. The first is to scale the central dipole field up and down with the energy of the VLER and the second is to use passive shielding to decrease the integral B·dl of the dipole field seen by the VLER.

We describe a program of improvements to the CESR injector chain and injection process which have resulted in a reduction in the CESR fill time of ∼40%. This has in turn allowed shorter high-energy-physics run lengths so that a higher average luminosity is maintained. Shorter fill times have resulted from increased linac beam intensity, stability and reliability, improved synchrotron transmission, faster machine condition switching time, improved CESR injection efficiency and a change to the CESR filling cycle in which both the positron and electron beam currents are topped up at the end of a run.",,"Accelerator magnets; High energy physics; Particle accelerators; Particle beam bunching; Targets; Luminosity; Particle beam injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035569415

Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States","The front IR quadrupole absorbers (TAS) and the IR neutral particle absorbers (TAN) in the high luminosity insertions of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) each absorb approximately 1.8 TeV of forward collision products on average per pp interaction (∼235W at design luminosity 1034cm-2s-1). This secondary particle flux can be exploited to provide a useful storage ring operations tool for optimization of luminosity. A novel segmented, multi-gap, pressurized gas ionization chambers is being developed for sampling the energy deposited near the maxima of the hadronic/ electromagnetic showers in these absorbers. The ionization chamber must be capable of resolving individual bunch crossings at 40MHz. The ionization chamber is segmented into quadrants; each quadrant consists of sixty (40×40)mm2 Cu plates 1.0mm thick, with 0.5mm gaps. The 0.5mm gap width has been chosen so that the time for the ionization electrons to drift across the gap, is short enough to produce at the out put of the shaping amplifier, a signal that returns to the base line is less than the 25ns bunch spacing of the LHC. From noise considerations in the presence of a cable the stack of plates are connected electrically 10 in parallel, 6 in series to achieve an equivalent detector capacitance Cd∼50pF. This type connection forms an electrode inductive Le and electrode capacitive Ce network that must be optimized to transfer charge from the chamber to the sensing amplifier. This paper describes the design of the collection electrodes optimized for 40 MHz operation.",,"Capacitance; Electrodes; Ionization chambers; Ionization of gases; Particle beam bunching; Particle detectors; Storage rings; Gas ionization chambers; Large hadron colliders (LHC); Colliding beam accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035571336
