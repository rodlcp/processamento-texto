The technical solutions covered in this chapter to attain this objective include: charging at low and medium power; charging at home, at work, and at other locations; and using fleets with small, medium, and large battery sizes. The driving behavior of the fleet is modeled using an availability analysis based on statistical data from Flanders and The Netherlands. The fleet itself is based on data of the Flemish vehicle segmentation, while the electric consumption of each segment is determined based on realistic vehicle data and driving cycles. This data is combined into different scenarios for which the utility factor, the energy consumption, the grid impact, and the battery utilization is investigated. Based on these scenario guidelines concerning the appropriate charge power at different locations and the distribution of charge locations, the expected grid impact and utility factor of different fleets are formulated. © 2014 by IGI Global.

It runs at a speed of 454MHz with a power of only 29 pJ/access or 114 fJ/access/bit. Retention mode leakage is only 86 μW. Combining three novel techniques with proven methods assures a design which can cope with the challenges introduced by deep submicron technologies. The first technique, an integrated charge pump, enables low swing signals to be used to save active energy while only one external supply is required. A second novelty is the use of a low swing scheme for both read and write. This results in simplified local periphery which reduces area overhead to a very low 4 %. Last, segmented horizontal control lines ensure correct operation in the presence of large RC-delays on long metal lines. The design was fabricated in a 40nm low standby power technology.

Actuator arm is mechanical part to move heads that fly over a track from any position to the target track. Accuracy signal and access time are the key parameters to control the actuator seeking position. However, the accuracy signal and access time are adverse when actuator moves faster and then the system create the residual vibration at the target track. The causes of the vibration are part from the fact that the reference signals, which are acceleration, velocity, and position, have high power spectrum energy over wide frequency range including over the actuator's natural frequency. The input shaping is convolved two signals at referent position signal and properly designed impulse signal. The impulse sequence produces an input signal to cancel residual vibration, then the result is smoother and the residual vibration is canceled in actuator-arm movement. Hence the residual vibration should be reduced by the recommended input shaping. © 2013 IEEE.","Hard disk drive; Input shaping; Track seeking; Vibration","Hard Disk Drive; Impulse sequences; Input-shaping; Reference signals; Residual vibrations; Track seeking; Vibration; Wide frequency range; Communication; Computer control systems; Information technology; Mechanical actuators; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891065987

The MPPT tracks the maximum power point (MPP) of the PV by tracking the PV voltage. Then the output signal of the voltage controlled MPPT is modulated by the level-shifted PWM modulation. Each level of the level-shifted PWM is used for a particular energy storage element, for example, the highest level is used for charging the battery, whereas the lowest level is used for discharging the battery. The proposed technique makes the PV produce the power at its MPP while the load can draw the power from the system without interruption.

Measurements of dynamic surface tension by maximum bubble pressure tensiometry and drop profile tensiometry are carried out for alkali aqueous solutions over a wide concentration range and for surface ages spanning from milliseconds to hours. Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) value, standard free energy of adsorption and other physicochemical properties are calculated based on static (equilibrium) surface tension measurements. Dynamic surface tension data are analyzed using approximate solutions of the Ward and Tordai model to estimate diffusion coefficients for short and long adsorption times. For concentrations above the CMC, the effective diffusion coefficient (D*) of monomers is also estimated. Diffusion coefficients for short adsorption times lie in a physically reasonable range whereas for long adsorption times the computed very low values indicate the presence of an adsorption barrier. Interfacial dilatational storage modulus and loss modulus measurements indicate a dominant elastic character of the adsorption layer for all the examined concentrations and oscillation frequencies. Local peaks in the values of both moduli, below and above CMC, imply that structural changes in the adsorption layer might be partially affected by the presence of micelles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption kinetics; Diffusion coefficients; Dilatational viscoelasticity; Dynamic surface tension; Micelles","Adsorption; Amino acids; Critical micelle concentration; Ethers; Glycerol; Micelles; Solutions; Surface tension; Adsorption kinetics; Critical micelle concentration (cmc); Dynamic surface tensions; Effective diffusion coefficients; Maximum bubble pressure tensiometry; Physicochemical property; Standard free energy of adsorption; Surface tension measurements; Diffusion; alkali; monomer; surfactant; tyrosine glycerol ether; unclassified drug; adsorption kinetics; aqueous solution; article; chemical parameters; chemical structure; critical micelle concentration; diffusion coefficient; elasticity; mathematical model; molecular mechanics; oscillation; physical chemistry; pressure measurement; priority journal; surface tension; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887820465

In this work, we focus on the role of the droplet deformations in the vertical bouncing dynamics by neglecting the deformation of the surface of the bath. To be under this favorable condition, low viscous oil droplets are dropped over a highly viscous oil bath that is vibrated. These droplets bounce vertically on the surface of the bath and exhibit many periodic trajectories and resonant modes when tuning the forcing parameters, i.e., the oscillation of the bath. This complex dynamics emphasizes the interplay between elastic energy storage and energy dissipation in droplets at each bounce. We propose to model droplets using a bouncing mass-spring-damper system that mimics a deformable droplet bouncing on a non-deformable liquid bath. From the experimental measurements, we constructed bifurcation diagrams of the bouncing trajectories and challenged our bouncing spring model. The agreement between experiment and the spring model reveals that this model can be used to rationalize and predict a variety of bouncing droplets behaviors involving multi-periodicities. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Deformation; Dynamics; Emulsification; Energy dissipation; Bifurcation diagram; Double emulsions; Droplet deformation; Droplet dynamics; Elastic energy storage; Favorable conditions; Mass-spring-damper system; Periodic trajectories; Drop breakup",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886257800

To contribute to the solution of this problem, it is suggested to use the greenhouse soil as an energy storage medium, where warm liquid passes during the daytime to heat the soil and then the heat is recovered by a cold liquid at night. This paper presents a mathematical model that tests the heat storage efficiency of a greenhouse ground, for two typical Egyptian soil types, where one is clay based and the other is sand based. The model is simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b and compares the effectiveness of heat transfer when using three different pipe materials, copper, HDPE and PVC, over a 10 hours period. The results obtained indicate that the sandy soil is Egypt exhibits a higher heat absorption capacity than the clay soil. Also, from the three pipe materials simulated, copper is by far the most effective, followed by HDPE then PVC, both of which show comparable heat propagation trends.","Greenhouse; Heat conduction; Soil heat storage; Soil temperature; Thermal conductivity","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Clay; Greenhouses; Heat conduction; Heat storage; Polyvinyl chlorides; Thermal conductivity; Agriculture sectors; Comsol multiphysics; Greenhouse soil; Heat absorption capacity; Heat propagation; Soil heat storage; Soil temperature; Storage efficiency; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924798710

By the law of 11 January 1991 and the implementing Royal Decree of 16/10/1991, ONDRAF/NIRAS has been entrusted with a mission concerning the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. This mission involves the collection and assessment of data concerning decommissioning forecasts for nuclear facilities, the approval of facilities' decommissioning programmes, the establishment - in consultation with operators - of financing conditions for decommissioning, as well as the implementation of these programmes on request by the operator, or in the case of its failure to do so. This is the case for the company Best Medical Belgium SA located at Fleurus (MDS Nordion SA, till April 2011), which produced radioisotopes for medical applications and went bankrupt in 2012. These installations have been entrusted to ONDRAF/NIRAS. A plan of action was developed for takingover the operations in the framework of remediation and decommissioning. Steps have been taken to integrate his new role as a nuclear operator. The installations of Best Medical Belgium SA are now referred to as the ""O/N - Site Fleurus."" Nuclear facility operators, or any person requesting to operate a nuclear facility, are obliged to provide ONDRAF/NIRAS, under their responsibility and in due time, with all the necessary information concerning these facilities' decommissioning forecasts, the nature, quantities and dates of transfer of the resulting waste, and the financing conditions for these facilities' decommissioning. In order to make the necessary funds available for decommissioning a nuclear facility when it will be shut down, operators are obliged to establish provisions during the facility's active life. These provisions are calculated in such a way that the total amount established at the time of the final shutdown covers all costs resulting from the facility's final phase, namely the preparation of decommissioning, decontamination, more or less long-term maintenance, dismantling, treatment, conditioning and disposal of waste produced during this phase. In order to face to multiple and repeated evaluation processes, the Agency, already in the early 90's, started with the implementation of its own integrated data processing system, recording the physical and radiological inventories of nuclear facilities, and allowing the evaluation of the quantities of decommissioning materials and wastes as well as of the decommissioning costs of these facilities. The cost evaluations cover all decommissioning activities from final shutdown of the facility until final release from nuclear control, as well as conventional demolition and site restoration if required. Beside the information related to the inventories, the database involves so called auxiliary tables integrating unit prices of the various decontamination and dismantling techniques, unit rates for radioactive waste processing, interim storage and final disposal.

FM stands for ferromagnetic and NM for non-magnetic. Spin-valve theory is based on theoretical predictions made over a decade ago, but the mechanism by which spins align is not well understood, if indeed spins are the mechanism for lowering the GMR. The question is whether switching in spin-valves is caused by another mechanism. In this regard, QED induced conductivity is proposed as the resistive switching mechanism. QED stands for quantum electrodynamics. Finding basis in QM that precludes the atoms in submicron FM layers from having the heat capacity to conserve Joule heat by an increase in temperature, conservation proceeds by QED induced frequency up-conversion of Joule heat to non-thermal EM radiation at the TIR resonance of the FM. QM stands for quantum mechanics, EM for electromagnetic, and TIR for total internal reflection. The EM radiation has sufficient Planck energy to create excitons (holon and electron pairs) that as charge carriers significantly lower the GMR by the dramatic increase the conductivity of the FM layers. Extensions of QED induced conductivity in spin-valves to memristors, PCRAM films, and 1/f noise in nanowires are briefly summarized. © 2013 IEEE.","conductivity; Joule heat; quantum electrodynamics; quantum mechanics; Spin-valves",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894141603

However, these powers systems are under additional pressure due to the variable operational characteristics of RES. Consequently, capital investments in grid reinforcement, interconnection, additional gas generators and smart grid initiatives have been proposed and implemented. Moreover, an increased interest in energy storage technologies has evolved due to their various economic and operational benefits to power systems.

The integration of a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a wind turbine doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) can make these intermittent in wind power more dispatchable. This paper focuses on the development of a control strategy for optimal use of the BESS for this purpose. A rule-based control scheme is considered as a solution of this optimal control problem defined, to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge current limits, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS provides power as much smoothing as possible so that the output power of the DFIG can be maximized at all wind speed independent of the estimated grid power required. Two objectives are targeted in the paper. The first objective is to obtain the maximum output power out of the existing wind regime. This is achieved by controlling the voltage injected to the rotor terminals. The second objective is to supply the demand power commitment to the grid. This is achieved by controlling the battery power flow. The size of the battery is calculated to accommodate excess power and to compensate for the deficit power according to the wind regime and the grid power demand. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery storage; Doubly fed induction generator; Power coordination; Wind energy","Battery energy storage systems; Battery storage; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Doubly fed induction generators; Energy storage systems; Meteorological condition; Optimal control problem; Power coordination; Electric fault currents; Energy storage; Optimal control systems; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893751995

The increased penetration of wind power into the utility grid brings challenges such as voltage and frequency fluctuations, generator torque ripples, and grid faults to power converter design in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). Multiphase PM generators offers a promising solution to many challenges due to their inherited advantages over the three phase counterparts including reduced converter per leg rating and reduced torque ripples, which directly affect the lifetime of the drive train. In high power applications, direct drive PM generators are usually employed. Among different topologies of power converters, current source converter features a simple converter structure, low switching dv/dt, and reliable short circuit protection. In this paper, a new wind energy conversion system is proposed based on a direct drive five-phase PMSG connected to the grid using current source converters (CSCs). The generator side converter, operating in the rectification mode (CSR), is controlled to control the DC-link current, while the grid side converter, operating in the inversion mode (CSI), controls the active and reactive powers injected to the grid. The five-phase generator side converter is controlled using sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM), while conventional space vector modulation is employed to control the three-phase grid side.

The power consumption in the power-saving state is almost 0, thus it is always desirable to allocate as many VMs as possible to some active servers and leave the rest to power-saving state in order to reduce the energy consumption of the data center. In this paper, we study such a VM allocation problem. Given a set VMs and a set of servers in a data center, each VM has a resource demand (CPU, memory, storage) and a starting time and a finishing time, and each server has resource capacity. There is an additional energy cost for a server to switch from power-saving state to active state. The servers are non-homogeneous. The problem of our concern is to allocate the VMs onto servers, such that the VMs resource demands can be met and the total energy consumption of servers is minimized. The problem is formulated as a boolean integer linear programming problem. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate our proposed method can significantly save the energy consumption in data centers. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Data Center; Energy Saving; Virtual Machine Allocation","Allocation problems; Data centers; Extensive simulations; Integer Linear Programming; Resource capacity; Resource demands; Total energy consumption; Virtual machine allocations; Boolean algebra; Cloud computing; Computer simulation; Computer systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Problem solving",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893261166

Many companies worry over the changes by the implementation of this solution because these changes could have a negative impact on the company, or, in the case of establishment of new companies, this worry results from an unfamiliar environment. Data accessibility, integrity and security belong among basic problems of cloud computing. The aim of this paper is to offer and scientifically confirm a proposal of an accessibility solution of cloud by implementing of solar energy as a primary source. Problems with accessibility rise from power failures when data may be stolen or lost. Since cloud is often started from a server, the server dependence on power is strong. Modern conditions offer us a new, more innovative solution regarding the ecological as well as an economical company solution. The Sun as a steady source of energy offers us a possibility to produce necessary energy by a solar technique - solar panels. The connection of a solar panel as a primary source of energy for a server would remove its power dependence as well as possible failures. The power dependence would stay as a secondary source. Such an ecological solution would influence the economical side of company because the energy consumption would be lower.

In such applications, hierarchical memory organizations reduce energy consumption by exploiting the nonuniformity of memory accesses and assigning the frequentlyaccessed data to low levels of the hierarchy. Moreover, within a given level, power can be reduced by memory partitioning-whose principle is to divide the address space in several smaller blocks, and to map these blocks to physical memory banks.

Ideally, a detection of damage, including consistent calibration can be expected to be carried out by monitoring the operational vibrations of wind turbine towers. When the boundary condition of the tower changes at the base significantly, the detection can often be visual. However, when the boundary conditions are relatively consistent, but the damage introduces local reduction of stiffness of the tower near its base, the detection process becomes challenging. In a wide number of damage detection schemes, an increase in damage in the form of local stiffness reduction gives rise to consistent damage calibration markers. These markers are usually related to the statistics of the vibration response. In this paper, we highlight non-detection and masking issues when such an approach is made for wind turbine towers. A Lagrangian approach has been taken for modelling the wind turbine and a number of simulations have been carried out to demonstrate this particular issue of non-detection. This observation is independent of the location of observation. A comparison of 100 second vibration responses of the tip of the wind turbine tower in terms of displacement is presented, for a 10% equivalent stiffness change at the base. Different approaches of detection were considered in this regard. Of particular interest is the approach of storing the response as energy through a possible energy harvesting system and using it as a damage calibration marker. The choice is guided by the fact that the physical storage of energy will capture the integrated global effects of the response for different damage conditions and a large sample of responses will statistically provide the variation of the marker for changing damage extents. Non-monotonous relationship of the distribution of harvested energy for damage calibration is observed. The damage effects are masked and this becomes an interesting pitfall in the field of damage detection of structures in ambient vibration. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Damage calibrations; Energy harvesting systems; Equivalent stiffness; La-grangian approaches; Operational vibration; Stiffness reduction; Vibration response; Wind turbine towers; Boundary conditions; Calibration; Lagrange multipliers; Reliability; Safety engineering; Stiffness; Towers; Wind turbines; Damage detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892381889

This tariff includes a component for energy and a component for using the grid. The latter represents the costs for network operation. Yet, this system is not suited for rising levels of self-generation of energy. Lower off-take will lead to a redistribution of grid costs. A possible solution might be a grid tariff based on load in kW instead of energy off-take. Such tariffs exist, but are not used for residential customers. In this paper, it is analyzed whether these existing tariffs are suited for high shares of self-generation. Results indicate that a load-based tariff is a reasonable solution. Yet, if storage is considered, a combination of a fixed component, an energy component and a load component offer better results. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Energy components; Load components; Network operations; Residential customers; Self-generation; Commerce; Housing; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891604405

Two different charging conditions are considered depending on the temperature of the water entering the tank. The first charging scheme corresponds to a constant inlet temperature and the second one to a variable inlet temperature, simulating heating provided by solar collectors. Two conceptually different LES codes were employed and the results are compared against available unsteady RANS simulations, a semi-analytical one-dimensional model and experimental data. The mixing mechanisms in the store and the efficiency of storage have been quantified using appropriate dimensionless factors. LES simulations provided a significant insight into the charging process and the associated energy losses, especially during the early stages of the process.

However, their high dielectric constants and outstanding energy densities are accompanied by large dielectric loss due to ferroelectric hysteresis and electrical conduction, resulting in poor charge-discharge efficiencies under high electric fields. To address this long-standing problem, here we report the ferroelectric polymer networks exhibiting significantly reduced dielectric loss, superior polarization and greatly improved breakdown strength and reliability, while maintaining their fast discharge capability at a rate of microseconds. These concurrent improvements lead to unprecedented charge-discharge efficiencies and large values of the discharged energy density and also enable the operation of the ferroelectric polymers at elevated temperatures, which clearly outperforms the melt-extruded ferroelectric polymer films that represents the state of the art in dielectric polymers. The simplicity and scalability of the described method further suggest their potential for high energy density capacitors. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

For several considerations, local wind turbine (WT) energy storage is preferred. Flywheel energy storage is among the most promising storage systems regarded for wind applications. This paper proposes a new architecture for flywheel energy storage based on doubly fed induction machine (DFIM) where the open winding stator of the machine is connected in series between the grid and the wind turbine grid side converter. In this architecture, the flywheel-converter is of partial power rating, and is connected to the DFIM rotor. The paper proposes the control concept and thorough simulations test the performance parameters of the system under normal and abnormal operating conditions.

Box 80200, Jeddah-21589, Saudi Arabia","This paper presents the details of the installation of an energy management system in the buildings of a typical university campus in Saudi Arabia and the consequent reduction in the electrical energy consumption. The electrical load demand in the universities is getting increased recently at an accelerated pace because of the rapid expansion of the campus infrastructure due to the increase in the intake of students, starting of new courses, research centers and laboratories. The majority of the electrical energy consumption in the universities in Saudi Arabia is for air-conditioning and lighting purposes. The installed building energy management system (BMS) continuously monitors the electrical load demand of the air handling units (AHUs) and the room lighting in the buildings and reduces the load demand through the appropriate setting of the thermostats of the AHUs based on the work schedule in a day and the On/Off control of lights based on the occupancy in different rooms through the Ethernet from a remotely located server room. The preliminary investigations reveal that significant reduction in load demand can be achieved in any university campus in Saudi Arabia through the implementation of BMS, thus contributing to the reduction in the domestic oil consumption of the country. If majority of the universities in the country set up BMS in their campuses, then it would be possible for the electrical utility to utilize the real-time meter data, technology-enabled dynamic pricing, and deterministic direct load control for the energy management in such campuses. The paper also highlights the future trend in the implementation of BMS in universities in which the demand response can be effectively utilized in the university DSM by having a secure campus area network that are enabled by high bandwidth, two-way, end-to-end communications in a smart grid environment. © 2013 IEEE.","Building Energy Management System; Campus Area Network; Demand Side Management; Saudi Arabia Introduction","Building energy management systems; Demand side managements; Direct load control; Electrical energy consumption; Electrical utilities; End-to-End communication; Saudi Arabia; University campus; Digital storage; Education; Electric loads; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Lighting; Societies and institutions; Telecommunication systems; Electrical engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887330914

Wave energy converters generally produce mechanical power twice per wave cycle and therefore depending on the storage available, the electrical power output has half the period of the input resource. These regular power changes induce a voltage change at the point of connection (POC) which is proportional to the amplitude of the power change and at the same frequency. Therefore the coupling of the input resource to the output power of a wave energy converter will cause voltage flicker at the POC, which may exceed the permitted limits under specific conditions. This study establishes the nature of the flicker issue from wave energy converters. Some practical tools for the evaluation of flicker from a device are introduced. These tools are suitable for early stage flicker assessment to assist in the design process only. They are not meant of substitutes for existing codes and standards which are outlined in this study. This study concludes that wave energy converters may exceed flicker emission limits as a result of the coupling of the resource to the output power, and this may be particularly severe when connected to weak grids. Some potential strategies for overcoming this problem are presented also. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,"Codes and standards; Electrical power output; Flicker assessments; Flicker emission; Mechanical power; Point of connection; Voltage flickers; Wave energy converters; Tools; Wave power; Wave energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887275519

Meanwhile, more and more users enjoy the multitasking feature of mobile devices and concurrently run a number of applications. Given these two trends and the fact that extended battery life remains to be a critical factor for small form factor devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, it is imperative to understand the energy impact of multiple applications running concurrently on such platforms. In this paper, we characterize and understand the energy and performance impact of concurrent applications via a comprehensive set of carefully designed experiments. Specifically, we focus on network-intensive applications since most usage models today are driven by always-on communication activities. We make several significant contributions to shed light on understanding the energy behavior of concurrent applications. Firstly, we find out that running multiple network-intensive applications concurrently can significantly improve energy efficiency, up to 2.2X compared to running them separately. Secondly, we observe that power consumption from CPU and System on Chip (SoC) are the primary culprits of power dynamic for network-intensive applications; while communication components, including Network Interface Card (NIC), poses very little power consumption variation with different throughput. Thirdly, we investigate, in detail, the significant impact of signal strength on the energy consumption and throughput performance. Our findings and analysis can be applied to provide helpful guidance for a wide range of research aiming to optimize mobile device energy efficiency, e.g. transmission scheduling and protocol design in cellular networks.

System identification is earned out to identify suitable reduced-order models that are able to predict and simulate the thermal response of a residential building. Both grey-box models, based 011 physical knowledge, and statistical black-box models are considered and identified 011 data obtained from simulations with a detailed physical model, deployed in the Integrated District Energy Assessment Simulation (IDEAS) package in Modelica. The robustness of identified black-box and grey-box models for day-ahead predictions and simulations of the thermal response of a dwelling is analysed. Whereas accurate day-ahead predictions are obtained for both grey-box and black-box models, the simulated indoor temperatures for the grey-box models tend to gradually deviate from the validation data. Thereby the influence of the data period used for the identification process is found to be of significant importance.

The aim of the specific case study is to examine the impact on the building retrofit measures on the dwelling carbon footprint, pre- and post- retrofit. The analysis was carried out using EnergyPlus. The baseline for the case study is the pre-retrofitted dwelling which was based on a mixture of energy supply sources including: fossil fuel for space heating, electricity for household equipment and a conventional gasoline car for transportation. Following the retrofit measures, space heating is provided by a ground source heat pump and transportation by an electric vehicle. Other retrofit measures include the installation of PV electric panels, heat recovery ventilation and increase in thermal energy storage capabilities.

Their energy needs should be significantly covered by renewable energy sources. As a consequence, it is important to identify which combinations of technologies will be suitable in order to reach such objectives. Climate conditions, final energy and investment costs, technological maturity and stakeholders' services quality are key elements for the final choice. This paper presents the first results of a more general survey the purpose of which is to study different combinations of heating - cooling systems integrated in single-family dwellings under the Belgian climate conditions. Eight representative dwellings and one heating system composed of solar collectors and an air-to-water heat pump were selected. The dwellings were chosen in such a way that different insulation levels may be studied: we considered houses with an insulation level that just respects the 2008 EPBD legislation (arête du gouvernement wallon, 2008) as well as very low energy houses. The heat pump and solar collectors are connected to a heat storage water tank as well as to a DHW reservoir. A design procedure based on energy needs is proposed and applied to each dwelling-system. The design characteristics of the system are then integrated in a simulation software (TRNSYS 17) to perform a one-year energy performance calculation (Klein, S.A, et al.,2000). The results show that the solar coverage ratio for DHW production ranges from 52% (very low energy buildings) to 76% (EPBD buildings). The solar coverage ratio for space heating ranges from 3% (very low energy buildings) to 9% (EPBD buildings). Whatever the kind of building, the seasonal performance factor of the heat pump is about 3.45. The total non renewable primary energy that is used is about 57% of the total heat demand.

The lipid composition of a membrane determines the activities of these enzyme/transporters as well as the degree of coupling of phosphorylation to transport. We have investigated mechanisms of PTS permease biogenesis and identified cytoplasmic (soluble) forms of these integral membrane proteins. We found that the catalytic activities of the soluble forms differ from those of the membrane-embedded forms. Transport via the latter is much more sensitive to lipid composition than to phosphorylation, and some of these enzymes are much more sensitive to the lipid environment than others. While the membrane-embedded PTS permeases are always dimeric, the cytoplasmic forms are micellar, either monomeric or dimeric. Scattered published evidence suggests that other integral membrane proteins also exist in cytoplasmic micellar forms.

The PLA composites were subjected to water absorption and instrumented falling weight impact tests. The thermomechanical and creep properties of the composites were determined using thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis and short-time creep tests. It was found that the modified PLA and its composite increased the impact resistance compared with the unmodified PLA. Incorporation of flax decreased resistance to thermal degradation and increased water uptake. The impact energy and stiffness value of PLA/flax composites were markedly higher than that of PLA but reflect the effects of composite structures and flax content.

The discrete transfer method and Gebhart absorption factor method are used for the shape factor estimation and multiple reflection calculation, respectively. The surface energy balance model is evaluated against existing field measurements that pertain to idealized urban geometry. It performs well in terms of predicting surface temperature and heat fluxes by allowing for detailed urban surface properties and meteorological conditions. The compressed row storage scheme is applied to calculate the transfer of surface thermal radiation, which dramatically reduces the computational requirements. This strategy permits the rigorous consideration of multiple reflections in a realistic urban area with hundreds of buildings. The result illustrates that considering only the first reflection is a good approach when the urban area is comprised of typical urban materials, e.g. materials with high emissivity and low albedo, because relatively accurate computational results can be obtained rapidly by avoiding the multiple reflection calculation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Microscale urban heat island; Surface energy balance; Thermal radiation; Urban surface energy balance model; Urban thermal environment","Computational requirements; Surface energy balance modeling; Surface temperature distribution; Surface thermal radiation; Urban heat island; Urban surface energy balances; Urban surface temperature; Urban thermal environment; Atmospheric temperature; Energy balance; Heat radiation; Interfacial energy; Surface properties; Three dimensional; boundary layer; energy balance; heat flux; heat island; surface energy; surface temperature; three-dimensional modeling; urban climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884984535

According to the EKC-theory, the process of economic growth is expected eventually to limit the environmental degradation created in the early stages of development. The EKC concept leads many researchers from the early 1990s to assume that each economy should focus on its growth, and any environmental problems will be eventually eliminated by the process of economic growth. Several studies attempt to test empirically the EKC-hypothesis using data on many countries and examining various types of environmental degradation, while other studies examine the underlying factors that may drive such a relationship. This article reviews the evolution of the EKC-concept and the possible causes of an EKC-pattern, like the distribution of income, the international trade (pollution haven hypothesis), structural changes, technical progress and improvements in energy efficiency, institutions and governance and consumer preferences. As CO2 emissions are a pollutant with global effects, several studies deal with the possible EKC-pattern for CO2 emissions and these studies are discussed separately. The various critiques on the EKC-concept are reviewed in the second article of this work. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; EKC literature","Consumer preferences; Economic growths; EKC literature; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental problems; Pollution haven hypothesis; Technical progress; Underlying factors; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; International trade; Pollution; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental protection; Kuznets curve; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884972923

A transient model is a set of time differential equations in mass, energy and momentum balances. These transient equations contain parameter values for validation. The parameter such as thermal capacitances of the room chamber, heat transfer coefficient of room panel, heat transfer coefficient of evaporator are difficult to determine because they are related to unsteady condition and have to be considered to account for room energy storage. Many researchers have been studied the transient model for HVAC system by setting an assumption that there parameters are already known. None of them has been investigated into the parameter identification. This research work focused into the parameter identification technique to determine the thermal capacitances of the room chamber, heat transfer coefficient of room panel, and heat transfer coefficient of evaporator. The transient model of a refrigeration unit for an air-conditioned room was analyzed. Block diagram technique along with computer simulation technique were applied for the task.

A proof of concept prototype was designed in a 90nm bulk CMOS technology with an integrated 1.8mm dipole antenna using the surrounding energy available in the 5.8GHz ISM band. In order to achieve the large voltage conversion under aim of less than 100mV to 10V, a two stage approach is found necessary as the input impedance mismatch of a single stage passive voltage multiplier with the antenna would render the solution infeasible. First, the antenna voltage is passively rectified and multiplied to an intermediate system supply voltage VPMU of 1.2V, aftwer which this voltage is pumped up to the storage voltage level Vbat of 10V by an active DC-DC converter.

These adverse events are a considerable clinical problem and the mechanisms underlying them are multifactorial and poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota has a key role in energy regulation and disease states such as obesity. Moreover, we recently showed that chronic olanzapine altered the composition of the gut microbiome in the rat. It is thus possible that treatments that alter gut microbiota composition could ameliorate olanzapine-induced weight gain and associated metabolic syndrome. To this end, we investigated the impact of antibiotic-induced alteration of the gut microbiota on the metabolic effects associated with chronic olanzapine treatment in female rats. Animals received vehicle or olanzapine (2 mg kg -1 per day) for 21 days, intraperitoneal injection, two times daily. Animals were also coadministered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail consisting of neomycin (250 mg kg -1 per day), metronidazole (50 mg kg -1 per day) and polymyxin B (9 mg kg -1 per day) by oral gavage, daily, beginning 5 days before olanzapine treatment. The antibiotic cocktail drastically altered the microbiota of olanzapine-treated rats, and olanzapine alone was also associated with an altered microbiota. Coadministration of the antibiotic cocktail in olanzapine-treated rats attenuated: body weight gain, uterine fat deposition, macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, plasma free fatty acid levels, all of which were increased by olanzapine alone. These results suggest that the gut microbiome has a role in the cycle of metabolic dysfunction associated with olanzapine, and could represent a novel therapeutic target for preventing antipsychotic-induced metabolic disease. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","antipsychotics; metabolism; microbiota; obesity; olanzapine; weight gain","CD68 antigen; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; metronidazole; neomycin; olanzapine; polymyxin B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; antiinfective agent; benzodiazepine derivative; fatty acid; metronidazole; neomycin; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; polymyxin B; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; antibiotic therapy; antigen expression; article; body weight; cell infiltration; controlled study; enzyme blood level; fatty acid blood level; female; Firmicutes; food intake; gene expression; intestine flora; lipid storage; locomotion; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index; rat; uterus; weight gain; animal; blood; drug effect; immunology; intestine; intraabdominal fat; microbiology; microflora; Sprague Dawley rat; weight gain; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Benzodiazepines; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Intestines; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Macrophages; Metronidazole; Microbiota; Neomycin; Polymyxin B; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885135911

In some giant-genomed bulb geophytes, this tolerance is explained by their ability to pre-divide cells in the dormant stages or by the selective advantage of larger cells in the rapid growth of their fleshy body. In this study, a test shows that the tendency for genome size expansion is a more universal feature of geophytes, and is a subject in need of more general consideration.MethodsDifferences in monoploid genome sizes were compared using standardized phylogenetically independent contrasts in 47 sister pairs of geophytic and non-geophytic taxa sampled across all the angiosperms. The genome sizes of 96 species were adopted from the literature and 53 species were newly measured using flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining.Key ResultsThe geophytes showed increased genome sizes compared with their non-geophytic relatives, regardless of the storage organ type and regardless of whether or not vernal geophytes, polyploids or annuals were included in the analyses. Conclusions The universal tendency of geophytes to possess a higher genome size suggests the presence of a universal mechanism allowing for genome expansion. It is assumed that this is primarily due to the nutrient and energetic independence of geophytes perhaps allowing continuous synthesis of DNA, which is known to proceed in the extreme cases of vernal geophytes even in dormant stages. This independence may also be assumed as a reason for allowing large genomes in some parasitic plants, as well as the nutrient limitation of small genomes of carnivorous plants. © 2013 The Author.

Differentiation of murine 3T3-F442A preadipocytes (12 days after reaching confluence) into mature adipocytes in vitro was promoted in the presence of tolylsam (10-100 μmol/L). De novo development of fat tissue in nude mice injected with preadipocytes and kept on a high-fat diet was significantly impaired following treatment with tolylsam (100 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks). Adipose tissue development in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 deficient mice, kept on a high-fat diet, was significantly impaired following administration of tolylsam (100 mg/kg per day for 15 weeks). This was associated with markedly enhanced metabolic rate. Treatment of MMP-2-deficient mice with tolylsam (100 mg/kg per day, 15 weeks) was associated with the preservation of collagen and a reduction in blood vessel size in adipose tissues in vivo. Furthermore, plasma levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids were reduced by tolylsam treatment of MMP-2-deficient mice (100 mg/kg per day, 15 weeks), whereas nutrient adsorption in the intestine was not affected. The results of the present study indicate that tolylsam promotes preadipocyte differentiation in vitro, but impairs adipose tissue development in vivo. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Adipocyte; Adipogenesis; Adipose tissue; Gelatinase; Matrix metalloproteinase; Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; Obesity","adiponectin; beta actin; fatty acid; fatty acid transporter; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; gelatinase inhibitor; glucose; high density lipoprotein; insulin; leptin; low density lipoprotein; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; tolylsam; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cell death; cell differentiation; controlled study; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; gene expression; glucose blood level; housekeeping gene; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; obesity; proadipocyte; triacylglycerol blood level; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; gelatinase; matrix metalloproteinase; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; obesity; 3T3 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gelatinases; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Nude; Oxadiazoles; Sulfonamides; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884683556

This is achieved by integration PV array, inverter, and LC filter with storage batteries and their charge controller. The system design is based on assessing the total electric power demand and the load profile during day and night hours. During day hours, the output from PV array charges the batteries and feed the load. During the night hours, the batteries feed the load. The system has been implemented and the output voltage waveforms have been recorded for different load demand values. A complete harmonic analysis has been done with and without using the filter at day and night hours. The results show that the designed system succeeded in feeding the household appliances during day and night hours. Without using LC filter, the inverter output voltage waveforms are close to be square in waveform with total harmonic distortion (THD) values of 38.85% and 41.2% during day and night hours respectively, which exceeds the IEEE standard limits. By using LC filter, The inverter output voltage waveforms are close to be sinusoidal in waveform with THD values of 6.85% and 7.2% during day and night hours respectively, which match the IEEE standards limits for harmonic distortions in the low voltage class (voltage less than 2.3 kV). © 2013 IEEE.","Charge regulator; Harmonics; Push pull inverter; PV array","Charge regulator; Design and operations; Electric power demands; Harmonics; Push-pull inverters; PV arrays; Residential PV systems; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Domestic appliances; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884601923

Progressive intralysosomal accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids in a variety of cell types triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events including cellular death, compromised energy metabolism, small vessel injury, K(Ca)3.1 channel dysfunction in endothelial cells, oxidative stress, impaired autophagosome maturation, tissue ischemia and, importantly, development of irreversible cardiac and renal tissue fibrosis, leading to major multisystemic manifestations. Cardiovascular complications of the disease are very frequent and contribute substantially to disease-related morbidity and mortality in men. Cardiovascular involvement is the leading cause of premature death in heterozygous female patients with FD. Left ventricular hypertrophy is the most prominent cardiac manifestation followed by conduction system disease, valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, vessel disease and coronary microvascular dysfunction. The diagnosis of subclinical forms of the disease, before the development of cardiac hypertrophy, using newer techniques (tissue doppler imaging, strain rate and cardiac magnetic resonance) is crucial to the early initation of the treatment. Greatest benefit of the enzyme replacement treatment is achieved when started at an early stage of the disease before extensive fibrosis or other irreversible tissue damage takes place. Fabry disease should be included in the differential diagnosis algorithm of idiopathic hypertrophy. Determination of Alpha-Gal A activity on plasma and peripheral leukocytes in males and genetic testing in females are the diagnostic gold-standards. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Anderson-fabry disease; Cardiomyopathy; Enzyme replacement treatment; Fabry; Fabry disease; Fibrosis; Hypertrophy; Left ventricular hypertrophy","alpha galactosidase; angiotensin receptor; antiarrhythmic agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; gadolinium; abdominal pain; albuminuria; analgesia; angina pectoris; apoptosis; article; atherosclerosis; atrioventricular block; autonomic dysfunction; autophagosome; basilar artery; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cause of death; cell death; cerebrovascular accident; clinical genetics; cold tolerance; cornea opacity; diarrhea; diastolic dysfunction; disease course; dyspnea; ECG abnormality; electron microscopy; endothelium cell; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme replacement; exercise; Fabry disease; fever; flatulence; gastrointestinal symptom; genetic counseling; genotype; glomerulus filtration rate; hearing impairment; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium arrhythmia; heart contraction; heart disease; heart failure; heart function; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle fibrosis; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle oxygen consumption; heart palpitation; heart rate variability; heart repolarization; heart right ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle hypertrophy; heat intolerance; histopathology; hospital patient; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; ischemia; kidney failure; kidney fibrosis; kidney transplantation; leukocyte; lysosome storage disease; microvascular endothelial cell; mitral valve regurgitation; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; nausea; neuropathic pain; newborn screening; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; priority journal; proteinuria; renal protection; seizure; sex difference; sinus node disease; tinnitus; transient ischemic attack; transthoracic echocardiography; visual acuity; white matter lesion; X chromosome inactivation; Age Factors; alpha-Galactosidase; Coronary Vessels; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrocardiography; Endothelium, Vascular; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Fabry Disease; Fibrosis; Humans; Myocardium; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884251505

The aim of this study was to determinate relationships between groups of fatty acids and body condition score change in Czech Fleckvieh cows. Fatty acids were classificated along its length of chain and its origin. A total of 50 Czech Fleckvieh cows with different parity were included to observation. During the first 4 weeks of lactation, milk samples were collected at a weekly interval and body condition score was assessed. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office Excel and the procedures MEANS and GLM of SAS 9.1. During the first four week of lactation, the proportions of short- and medium-chain fatty acids as well as de novo synthesised fatty acids increased. Moreover the cows with a greater body condition score change mobilized storage depot fat more intensively, which resulted in higher proportions of dietary and fatty acids originating in depot fat since week 1 of lactation, and long-chain fatty acids since week 2 of lactation. On the contrary, the animals with only a small body condition score change exhibited high proportions of short- and medium-fatty acids as well as de novo synthesised fatty acids in the most part of the period analysed. This indicates negative energy balance in early part of lactation and its compensation during observed period. So, the results confirm the relationships between different groups of milk fatty acids proportion, body condition score and negative energy balance. Both methods of FA sorting were confirmed as appropriate for evaluation of negative energy balance intensity. Further, results emphasize importance the monitoring of body condition, milk composition and good level of herd management in first part of lactation. © Journal of Central Europian Agriculture 2013.","Body condition score; Czech Fleckvieh; Dairy cows; Fatty acids; Lactation; Milk",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884392247

However, due to the use of unreliable wireless media, WBANs are exposed to a variety of attacks. The prevention of these attacks depends upon the cryptographic techniques. The strength of cryptography is based on the keys used for encryption and decryption in the communication process. Security is still an alarming challenge for WBANs and needs attention of the research community. The proposed work introduces a hybrid key management scheme for both intra-WBAN and inter-WBAN communications. The proposed technique is based on preloaded keys as well as keys automatically generated from biometrics of the human body. The biometric-based calculations are of linear time complexity to cater the strict resource constraints and security requirements of WBANs. The proposed security mechanism provides an efficient solution for the security of both intra-WBAN and inter-WBAN communications.

The results show significant improvement over the results produced by BARI+ in terms of storage, communication, energy overhead, and security. © 2013 Sarah Irum et al.",,"Automatically generated; Communication process; Cryptographic techniques; Encryption and decryption; Growth and development; Linear time complexity; Ubiquitous healthcare system; Wireless body area network; Biometrics; Communication; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884221648

Samples of freshly harvested medium-grain rice (M202) with different initial moisture contents (MCs) ranging from 20.2% to 25.1% (w.b.) were used for this study. To create rough rice with varying quality, the samples were dried from their initial MC to a moisture content of 13.1% ±0.3% (w.b.) using air at different temperatures. Before milling, the MC of the samples was measured using three different methods: standard oven method, Dickey-John GAC 2100 (DKJ), and single-kernel moisture meter (SKM). The samples were milled using a McGill No. 3 mill. Three milling procedures were used: the standard western milling procedure, referred to as normal milling (NM), the southern milling procedure (SMP), and low-temperature milling (LM). The effect of storage after drying on quality appraisals was evaluated. Milling quality was compared based on total rice yield (TRY), head rice yield (HRY), whiteness index (WI), and lipid content (LC). HRY was found to be significantly affected by variation in initial MC, drying temperature, storage time after drying, and milling procedure. WI and LC were not significantly affected by these parameters. HRY decreased significantly with increased initial MC and drying temperature. The LM and SMP procedures significantly improved HRY up to 4.8% and 2.8%, respectively. HRY significantly increased with increase in storage time of dried rice up to four days, after which HRY was not affected by storage time. Regression models were successfully developed to predict HRY under tested rice conditions and milling procedures. The DKJ and SKM instruments, which are widely used in the rice industry, need to be calibrated at the full moisture range to ensure accurate results in MC measurement. The obtained results provide valuable information to achieve consistent, accurate, and reliable milling quality appraisals. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Appraisal; Drying; Milling quality; Rice; Sample preparation; Storage; Tempering","Appraisal; Drying temperature; Initial Moisture Content; Milling procedures; Milling quality; Quality appraisals; Rice; Sample preparation; Drying; Energy storage; Moisture determination; Regression analysis; Tempering; Milling (machining); measurement method; milling; moisture content; qualitative analysis; regression analysis; rice; sample preparation; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884171893

To realize such a smart grid, large scale pilot projects are currently implemented and evaluated. Such pilot projects generate an excessive amount of data that needs to be processed: energy measurements, information on available flexibility from smart devices that can be shifted in time, control signals, dynamic prices, environmental data, etc. To validate and analyze the gathered data and adjust the running experiments in real-time, an optimized data management infrastructure is needed as well as comprehensive visualization tools. In this paper we present a data management infrastructure optimized for the follow up of the large scale smart grid project called Linear. In this project a pilot in over 200 households is implemented to evaluate several business cases including the balancing of renewable energy supply and the mitigation of voltage and power issues in distribution grids. By decoupling the gathering of the incoming data, the processing and storage of the data, and the data visualization and analysis on different servers, each with their own, optimized database, we obtain an efficient system for validation of the generated data in the pilot, management of the deployed set-ups and follow-up of the ongoing experiments in real-time. © 2013 IFIP.",,"Data processing and analysis; Information and Communication Technologies; Management infrastructure; Power grid technology; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy; Visualization and analysis; Visualization tools; Data handling; Data visualization; Digital storage; Experiments; Information technology; Network management; Optimization; Smart power grids; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883475884

The migration technique dynamically moves write-intensive and read-intensive data between STT-RAM and SRAM to explore the advantage of hybrid cache. Meanwhile, migrations induce extra read and write overhead during data movements. For loops with intensive data array operations, we observe that migration overhead is significant and migrations closely correlate to the interleaved read and write access pattern in a memory block.

The use of renewable energy sources for electricity production has been increasingly brought into attention. Basically, the power generated from these sources may cause the fluctuation of the electrical power affecting the quality and reliability of the power system. Therefore, the proportion of electrical power generated by renewable energy sources into the power grid must be controlled appropriately. The appropriate ratio of the renewable power generation can be evaluated from the Power Ramp Rate (PRR). The value of PRR that initiates the power system to become unstable is called the critical PRR. In this paper, to find the minimal required energy for frequency stabilization from the battery system, PRR is considered in the evaluation. The simulation results demonstrate that PPR is very useful index in determining the appropriate size of power and energy of the battery system to keep the frequency deviation of the power system within the standard limit. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery System; Frequency Control; Microgrid System; Power Ramp Rate; Renewable Energy Resources","Battery energy storage systems; Battery systems; Frequency stabilization; Micro-grid systems; Power ramp rates; Renewable energy source; Renewable power generation; Use of renewable energies; Electric frequency control; Electric power distribution; Information technology; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883107708

Recent findings: Historically, research linking intestinal bacteria with nutritional status focused on the degradation of indigestible food components by bacterial enzymes and metabolites. Of late, emerging evidence suggests an independent role of the gut microbiota in the regulation of glucose and energy homeostasis via complex interactions between microbially derived metabolites and specific target tissue cells. In addition, novel findings highlight specific microbial species involved in the production of a number of micronutrient components, which could potentially improve nutritional status in certain population groups, if available to the host at sufficiently abundant levels. Summary: New insights into the role of the gut microbiota and its holistic effects on the host are now emerging. High-throughput technologies allow for a greater insight into the role of the intestinal microbiota and the mechanisms by which it can contribute to overall nutritional status.

The aim of the present study was to compare and relate regional DXA variables with absolute tissue masses obtained by computer tomography (CT) scanning of the lower limbs in elderly persons. Methods: Eleven well-preserved white Caucasian adults (seven male and four female cadavers) with a median age of 79.0. years (ranging from 68 to 96. years) were fully scanned with DXA and CT. Separate densities of skin tissue, AT, muscle tissue and bone were obtained by hydrostatic weighing. Results: The leg DXA-variables were significantly related (rho-values between 0.60 and 0.98, P&lt;0.01) to CT-derived tissue counterparts, but showed significant systematic differences except for subcutaneous AT mass (P=0.773). After controlling for other AT depots, fat as measured by DXA (fatDXA) related only to intermuscular AT (rho=0.82, P&lt;0.01) in males and to subcutaneous AT (rho=0.84, P&lt;0.05) in females. Conclusion: Although significantly interrelated, DXA and CT variables should not be used interchangeably since they have different quantitative and physiological significance. Our results suggest that fatDXA represents different parts of AT depots in elderly men and women.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of battery storage on the economics of hybrid wind-diesel power systems in commercial applications by analyzing wind-speed data of Dhahran, East-Coast, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A.). The annual load of a typical commercial building is 620,000 kWh. The monthly average wind speeds range from 3.3 to 5.6m/s. The hybrid systems simulated consist of different combinations of 100-kW commercial wind machines (CWMs) supplemented with battery storage and diesel generators. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) (HOMER Energy's) Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software has been employed to perform the economic analysis. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system comprising of 100-kW wind capacity together with 175-kW diesel system and a battery storage of 4 h of autonomy (i.e. 4 h of average load), the wind penetration (at 37-m hub height, with 0% annual capacity shortage) is 25%. The cost of generating energy (COE, $/kWh) from this hybrid wind-battery-diesel system has been found to be 0.139 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/L). The investigation examines the effect of wind/battery penetration on: COE, operational hours of diesel gensets. Emphasis has also been placed on un-met load, excess electricity, fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for wind-diesel without battery storage, wind-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), cost of wind-battery-diesel systems, COE of different hybrid systems, etc. The study addresses benefits of incorporation of short-term battery storage (in wind-diesel systems) in terms of fuel savings, diesel operation time, carbon emissions, and excess energy.

To address this problem, we build a thermal model for hybrid storage clusters that are comprised of HDDs and SSDs. We start this study by generating the thermal profiles of hard drives and solid state disks. The profiling results show that both HDDs and SSDs have profound impacts on temperatures of storage nodes in a cluster. Next, we build two types of hybrid storage clusters, namely, inter-node and intra-node hybrid storage clusters. We develop a model to estimate the cooling cost of a storage cluster equipped with hybrid storage nodes. The thermal model is validated against data acquired by temperature sensors.

Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) and Continuous Casting (CC) slags prove ideal for mineral carbonation as their powdery morphology forgoes the need for milling and provides sufficient surface area for high reactivity towards direct aqueous carbonation. Experiments were undertaken using two methodologies: unpressurized thin-film carbonation, and pressurized slurry carbonation. The influence of process parameters (temperature, CO2 partial pressure, time, and solids loading) on the slag carbonation conversion are investigated, seeking the optimal conditions that maximize the potential of the slags as carbon sinks. It was found that CC slag carbonates more extensively than AOD slag at essentially every processing condition due to differences in particle microstructure; still, it was possible to reach up to 0.26 and 0.31g,CO2/g,slag uptake with AOD and CC slags, respectively, at optimal processing conditions via pressurized slurry carbonation. Mineral carbonation conversion was accompanied by significant reduction in basicity, as much as two pH units, and stabilization of heavy metals leaching, meeting regulatory limits (borderline for Cr) for safe waste materials re-use. Via quantitative mineralogical analyses, it was possible to differentiate the carbonation reactivity of several alkaline mineral phases, and to discern the preferential formation of certain Ca- and Mg-carbonates depending on the processing route and operating conditions. Slurry carbonation was found to deliver greater mineral carbonation conversion and optimal treatment homogeneity, which are required for commercial applications. However, thin-film carbonation may be a more feasible route for the utilization of slags solely as carbon sinks, particularly due to the elimination of several processing steps and reduction of energy demand. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sink; Heavy metal leaching; Mineral carbonation; Mineralogy; Stainless steel slags; Waste valorization","Argon oxygen decarburizations; Carbon sink; Commercial applications; Influence of process parameters; Metal leaching; Mineral carbonation; Particle microstructure; Waste valorizations; Alkalinity; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Carbonation; Continuous casting; Crystallography; Energy management; Heavy metals; Leaching; Mineralogy; Minerals; Optimization; Stainless steel; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Slags; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; experimental study; landfill; leaching; reduction; steel; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878041573

The aim of the study was to calculate the life-cycle costs (LCC) of 12 energy management systems and compare the prices. Surprisingly, the most polluting and commonly used solution, combination of district heating and grid electricity, was also the most expensive solution. The main reason for this is the increase in energy prices in Finland in the twenty-first century. According to the calculations, when considering a facility the size of the Espoo Hospital, the most affordable solutions were biogas energy, wood chip heating and ground source heating. The differences were relatively small between all solutions other than biogas. Biogas energy is by far the most affordable solution. However, it is only suitable for large-scale projects and some uncertainty risk has to be added because the system is not yet commonly used. Regarding the other unorthodox systems, solar electricity was the most expensive method; similar to the situation with snow storage cooling, which needs to entail certain societal benefits for it to be cost-effective.

The existing power system of the island of Milos, which is based on fossil fuel generators and a small wind park, is assessed in the context of this paper. System level simulation results, from both technical and economic point of view, are presented for the currently existing and the proposed island's hybrid power system. The latter integrates a higher number of wind turbines and hydrogen technologies as energy storage medium, and the two system architectures are being compared taking into account not only technical and economic parameters but also Green House - Gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuels consumption and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration increase. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to determine the contribution of hydrogen technologies equipment costs; with the cost of energy produced (COE) being the critical parameter. Results show that COE for the proposed power system is higher than the existing one, but on the other hand GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption are significantly reduced. In addition, RES penetration increases dramatically and the sensitivity analysis indicates that a further reduction in hydrogen technologies equipment and subsidy on wind turbine costs would make RES & Hydrogen-based systems economically competitive to the existing power system of the island.

Thermochromic coatings were developed by using thermochromic pigments into an appropriate binder system. The color-changing temperature was 30oC. The same binder system was used for the production of highly reflective (cool) and common coatings, in order to investigate and compare the thermal and optical characteristics of colormatched thermochromic, cool and common coatings. The results demonstrated that during the experimental period, surface temperatures of thermochromic samples were lower than the temperatures of color-matched cool and common. Issues concerning the photodegradationof thermochromic coatings are also discussed. The performance of organic PCMs used as latent heat storage materials, when they are incorporated in building coatings is also studied. Comparative testing proved that all PCM doped infrared reflective coatings present lower surface temperatures than cool and common coatings of the same color. Studying the daily temperature differences it was noticed that peak temperature differences occur between PCM and common or cool coatings from 7am-10am.These peak temperature differences are not noticed for common and cool coatings. Moreover investigating the temperature gradient it was shown that for this time period the values for the PCM coatings is much lower compared to cool and common. Coatings containing PCMs store heat in a latent form maintaining constant surface temperatures and discharge with a time delay. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

The fresh food markets and households were the point sources of Phetchaburi municipal wastewater that flowing newly construction sewage system in order to receive them to four sub stations on both sides of Phetchaburi river before pumping to Klongyang collection pond. The storage wastewater has been pumped about 3,600 cu.m./day through the 18.5 km. HPDE pipe and putting into sedimentation pond 1 and another four consecutive ponds (oxidation ponds 2, 3, 4, and 5) before the effluent flowing into the mangrove forest. However, the results of experiment found the values of BOD that showing drastic decreasing from Klongyang collection pond through the tip of 18.5 km. HPDE pipe to the sedimentation pond 1 then after it was gradually decreased from one oxidation pond to the next one. Highlight was placed on the obtained effluent after treated wastewater flowed over weir crest that finding BOD under standard and also the decreasing of total coliform bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria, particularly the pathogenic bacteria decreasing down to almost zero MPN/100mL. The question came up how total coliform bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria disappeared after the treated wastewater flowing over weir crest of the oxidation pond 3. The hypothesis was set on the effect of solar radiation to DO and H2O2 which were employed for bacterial organic digestion process in wastewater treatment ponds by taking the measurement randomly on 19 May 2011 that solar radiation showing the solar energy between 0-750 W/m2 all together with UV-A, UV-B, spectrum and net radiation. In order to accomplish the objectives of study, the wastewater quality indicators were found BOD in sedimentation pond 1 67.5 mg/L and oxidation pond 3 16.6 mg/L for 13 hours measurement. In the same manner, the values of DO and H2O2 for 13 hours measurement found in oxidation pond 3 greater than sedimentation pond 1 in respect to 8.9 and 7.6 mg/L for DO and 2.27 and 0.31 μg/L for H2O2. Moreover, the polynomial correlation was studied in order to determine the relationship between net radiation and DO and found very high correlation coefficients in both sedimentation pond 1 and oxidation pond 3. For the quantity of H2O2, it was obtained the relationship between net radiation and H2O2 in higher correlation coefficient in sedimentation pond 1 than oxidation pond 3 because of smaller amount of dissolved organic and inorganic matters in oxidation pond 3. It would be the reason that oxygen which occurred from phytoplankton and algae photosynthesis were not employed by organic digestion and respiration of bacteria. Therefore, it had to exist DO and accumulation only in water instead of producing H2O2 in oxidation pond 3 during daylight time. This is why H2O2 in oxidation pond 3 was not varied directly to net radiation, and also causing an indication on the relationship between net radiation and H2O2 in oxidation pond 3 lower than sedimentation pond 1. Summarily speaking, the nature of solar radiation plays vital role in encouraging producing DO and H2O2 which are the important factors in bacterial organic digestion for community wastewater treatment with high efficiency.","Dissolved oxygen; Hydrogen peroxide; Oxidation pond; Solar radiation; Wastewater",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881588537

Households or users cooperate to trade these goods, in this case, their real-time energy supplied by utility company and their stored energy in order to minimize consumption cost. Difference in pricing mechanisms adopted by utility companies that serve the locality gives incentive for users to trade real-time energy. Households schedule their storage devices to be charged during low-price off-peak hours and sell the surplus stored energy to neighbours during peak hours to generate additional income. This creates a trading environment or a market where users exchange real-time energy and stored energy at certain prices. Preference relations of users capture how energy is valued in an economy by each user. We model these preferences as a utility that is a continuous, monotonic, quasi-convex function of energy. Given a set of endowments, consumption profiles and energy prices in the market for each user, we show that a market is created where real-time energy and stored energy are exchanged between users and such an exchange takes place at the competitive equilibrium. We analyze a simple two-user two-good exchange economy market to illustrate the concepts discussed above and prove that the trading prices of the goods in the market regulate themselves in such a way that trading results in reduced costs for both users. © 2013 IEEE.","competitive equilibrium; cooperative game theory; Energy pricing; exchange economy; smart grids","Competitive equilibrium; Cooperative game theory; Energy pricing; Exchange economies; Smart grid; Costs; Economics; Energy storage; Functions; Industry; Information science; Smart power grids; Virtual storage; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881529543

Also known as coal seam gas (CSG), CBM has become an important source of energy because of increasing global demand for cleaner fuels. CBM is distinct from conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs as methane is stored within coals by adsorption. With matrix porosity generally lower than 4%, cleats and fractures are the main conduits for production from coals. Given differences in structure compared to conventional reservoirs, drilling into coal seams requires the use of minimum overbalance and nondamaging fluids. In addition, evaluation of CBM reservoirs has many technical challenges. One of the main challenges is to ascertain coal cleat behavior and estimate permeability and ultimately productivity of a target zone. Traditionally this has been done by production or injection tests using conventional testing techniques. In Australia, a wireline-deployed straddle packer configuration was used to address this challenge, with demonstrated benefits for determining permeability and productivity. Unlike traditional methods of conducting a closed chamber test across a large interval, this methodology uses a straddle packer with a downhole pump in a toolstring deployed on wireline. The packer spacing can be adjusted prior to deployment to suit the expected height of the coal bed to be tested. The tool is capable of both injection into and production from a coal bed interval with a much smaller storage volume compared to conventional test strings. Pressure is continuously monitored in real time ensuring that acceptable limits are not exceeded during either the injection or drawdown phases, to avoid excessive force on a coal seam while maintaining single-phase flow.

Mg nanorods are first prepared by glancing angle deposition. CuO is then deposited around the Mg nanorods by reactive magnetron sputtering to realize the core/shell structure. Various characterization techniques are used to investigate the prepared Mg/CuO core/shell nanoenergetic arrays, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis. Uniform mixing and intimate contact between the Mg nanorods and CuO are confirmed from both visual inspection of the morphological images and analyses of the heat-release curves. The nanoenergetic arrays exhibit a low-onset reaction temperature (∼300 C) and high heat of reaction (∼3400 J/g). Most importantly, the nanoenergetic arrays possess long-term storage stability resulting from the stable CuO shell. This study provides a potential general strategy for the synthesis of various Mg nanorod-based stable nanoenergetic arrays. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","facile green in situ synthesis; high heat of reaction; long-term storage stability; Mg/CuO core/shell; nanoenergetic arrays","Core/shell; High heat of reactions; In-situ synthesis; Long-term storage stability; nanoenergetic arrays; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ionic liquids; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Thermoanalysis; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Nanorods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882764023

Excessive diversion of fat for storage is a key risk factor for many fat-related human diseases. Dietary lipids are absorbed from the intestines and transported to various organs and tissues to provide energy and maintain lipid homeostasis. In humans, disparity between triglycerides (TG) synthesis and removal, via mitochondrial β-oxidation and VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) secretion, causes excessive TG accumulation in the liver. The mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans KLF-3 leads to high TG accumulation in the worm's intestine. Our previous data suggested that klf-3 regulates lipid metabolism by promoting fatty acid β-oxidation. Depletion of cholesterol in the diet has no effect on fat deposition in klf-3 (ok1975) mutants. Addition of vitamin D in the diet, however, increases fat levels in klf-3 worms. This suggests that excess vitamin D may be lowering the rate of fatty acid β-oxidation, with the eventual increase in fat accumulation. We also demonstrate that mutation in klf-3 reduces expression of C. elegans dsc-4 and/or vit genes, the orthologs of mammalian microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B, respectively. Both microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B are essential for mammalian lipoprotein assembly and transport, and mutation in both dsc-4 (qm182) and vit-5 (ok3239) results in high fat accumulation in worm intestine. Genetic interactions between klf-3 and dsc-4, as well as vit-5 genes, suggest that klf-3 may have an important role in regulating lipid assembly and secretion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","assembly and secretion; C. elegans; fatty acid; klf lipoprotein; β-oxidation","apolipoprotein B; fatty acid; klf3 protein; kruppel like factor; messenger RNA; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein; vitamin D; article; Caenorhabditis elegans; fatty acid oxidation; gene interaction; intestine; lipid analysis; lipid metabolism; lipoprotein secretion; liver; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein localization; Caenorhabditis elegans; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879913534

The first cooling system is an integrated cooling plant having both free cooling system and solar powered single-effect lithium bromide-water absorption chiller in operation since August 2002. A floor space of 270 m2 is air-conditioned by the plant. The plant includes 35.17 kW cooling absorption chiller, vacuum tube collectors' aperture area of 108m2, hot water storage capacity of 6.8 m3, cold water storage capacity of 1.5m 3 and a 134 kW cooling tower. For this solar driven cooling plant, the performance data show that free cooling in some cooling months can be up to 70% while it is about 25% during the 5 years period of the plant operation. Moreover, for sunny clear sky days with equal incident solar radiation, the daily solar heat fraction used to drive the chiller ranged from 0.33 to 0.41; collectors' field average efficiency ranged from 0.352 to 0.492 and chiller COP varies from 0.37 to 0.81, respectively. The monthly average value of solar heat fraction varies from 31.1% up to 100% with five years average value of about 60%. The monthly average collectors' field efficiency value varies from 34.1% up 41.8% and the five-year average value amounts about 28.3%. The second solar driven cooling system is a steam jet ejector chiller (SJEC) driven by parabolic trough collector. The chiller has a capacity of one kW cooling. The experiments show that the particular characteristics of a SJEC with the strong influence of the condenser cooling water temperature and evaporator temperature on the system coefficient of performance. The coefficient of performance reaches high values in part load and at good re-cooling conditions, so that the mean efficiency is clearly higher than the nominal efficiency of the system.

Plants have strong cell wall, formed by cellulose and lignin. Cell membrane isolates the cell from its surroundings, starch acts as storage and enzymes enable synthesis of new compounds. Membrane pumps allow penetration of cell membrane and pigments capture of light energy. We call enzymes, membrane pumps and pigments as functional substances. The biochemical regulation system changes the concentrations and activities of the functional substances: In summer, metabolism is very active, but in winter, vegetation is dormant and tolerates low temperatures. The action of the biochemical regulation system generates emergent regularities in the functional substances, called the state of the functional substances. The effect of environmental factors on metabolism is built in the complex chain of enzymes, membrane pumps and pigments, acting in each metabolic task. The process-specific state of functional substances and the environmental factors determine the rate of each metabolic process. Microbes have dominating role in the soil. Together with soil fauna, microbes break down macromolecules with extracellular enzymes to small molecules that can penetrate the microbial cell membrane through membrane pumps. The microbial metabolism utilises the small carbon-rich molecules for the energy needs, growth and synthesis of the extracellular enzymes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This degradation is characterized by the appearance of S-shape features in the reverse bias region of current-voltage (J-V) curves that increase in amplitude over time. Conversely, BHJ solar cells fabricated from low Mn PBDTTPD do not develop S-shaped J-V curves. However, S-shapes identical to those observed in high Mn PBDTTPD solar cells can be induced in low M n devices through intentional contamination with the TPD monomer. Furthermore, when high Mn PBDTTPD is purified via size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to reduce the content of low molecular weight species, the JSC of polymer devices is significantly more stable over time. After 111 days of storage in the dark under inert conditions, the J-V curves do not develop S-shapes and the JSC degrades by only 6%. The S-shape degradation feature, symptomatic of low device lifetimes, appears to be linked to the presence of low molecular weight contaminants, which may be trapped within samples of high Mn polymer that have not been purified by SEC.

On the one hand, Hong Kong is facing a controversial debate over the implementation of proposed landfill extension (LFE) and advanced incineration facility (AIF) to curb the MSW disposal issue. On the other hand, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is taking concerted efforts to reduce the carbon intensity in this region. This paper discusses the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from four proposed waste disposal scenarios, covering the proposed LFE and AIF within a defined system boundary. On the basis of the data collected, assumptions made, and system boundary defined in this study, the results indicate that AIF releases less GHG emissions than LFE. The GHG emissions from LFE are highly contributed by the landfill methane (CH4) emissions but offset by biogenic carbon storage, while the GHG emissions from AIF are mostly due to the stack discharge system but offset by the energy recovery system. Furthermore, parametric sensitivity analyses show that GHG emissions are strongly dependent on the landfill CH4 recovery rate, types of electricity displaced by energy recovery systems, and the heating value of MSW, altering the order of preferred waste disposal scenarios. This evaluation provides valuable insights into the applicability of a policy framework for MSW management practices in reducing GHG emissions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Incineration; Landfill; Municipal solid waste; Policy making","Discharge systems; Energy recovery system; Greenhouse gas accountings; Hong kong special administrative regions; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Parametric sensitivity analysis; Policy framework; Policy making; Climate change; Gas emissions; Incineration; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Waste disposal; Greenhouse gases; carbon; methane; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; management practice; methane; municipal solid waste; policy making; pollution control; sensitivity analysis; waste disposal; waste management; air pollution control; article; combustion; electricity; energy recovery; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; greenhouse gas; heating; Hong Kong; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; pollution monitoring; practice guideline; priority journal; product recovery; Air Pollutants; Conservation of Natural Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Hong Kong; Incineration; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878203541

RES add further complexity because their power output may be intermittent, seasonal and non-dispatchable. Owing to this characteristic, reliability evaluation of a RES-based SIPS cannot be implemented using the traditional deterministic and analytical methods. Moreover, this evaluation has to be done within a cost-benefit framework. This study models and investigates the effect of customer worth of interrupted supply (customer damage cost) on the optimal design of SIPS with storage and increased RES penetration. The SIPS optimal design is implemented with a genetic algorithm combined with local search procedure. In addition, this study examines the effect of the forced outage rate of SIPS components on SIPS optimal design via Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the proposed hybrid optimisation methodology is investigated for a large number of alternative scenarios via sensitivity analysis, which study the effect on the results because of the uncertainty on weather data, components efficiency and cost data. The results show that the optimal design of a RES-based SIPS depends largely on the consideration of customer damage cost as well as the inclusion of components forced outage rate. The method and results presented in this article should be valuable in planning and operating SIPS with RES. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,"Analysis and design; Analytical method; Forced outage rates; Isolated power system; Optimal design; Reliability Evaluation; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy source; Costs; Digital storage; Monte Carlo methods; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Uncertainty analysis; Optimal systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880692681

We present here a facile chemical process to produce polyaniline nanostructures with three different morphologies (i.e., nanofibers, nanospheres, and nanotubes) by utilizing the corresponding tunable morphology of MnO2 reactive templates. A growth mechanism is proposed to explain the evolution of polyaniline morphology based on the reactive templates. The morphology-induced improvement in the electrochemical performance of polyaniline pseudocapacitors is as large as 51% due to the much enhanced surface area and the porous nature of the template-guided polyaniline nanostructures. In addition, and for the first time, a redox-active electrolyte is applied to the polyaniline pseudocapacitors to achieve significant enhancement of pseudocapacitance.

The RE options are photovoltaic (PV) and micro-wind turbine. This paper mainly focuses on the situation when grid feed-in is not available, but a brief economic analysis with grid feed-in is also conducted at the end of the paper. This paper specially investigates the influence of electrical storage in batteries and thermal storage in a domestic hot water (DHW) tank with suitable RE-DHW recharging strategies. The simulation results show that the recharging strategy of excess renewable electricity to a DHW storage tank with one day's DHW volume is more technically and economically effective than using electrical battery in reducing annual mismatch. Even without battery, the improvement in reducing mismatch can be 12.7-23.3% simply by using the RE-DHW recharging strategy. Furthermore, PV with 2-axis solar tracking strategy is not economically feasible in the Nordic climate, whereas south-facing PV with a 45 fixed tilt angle is recommended. Moreover, from both the energy and economic points of view, the increased hub height with multiple turbines is preferable for the application with a 6.64-16.2% improvement in reducing mismatch. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As SSDs write data out-of-place, garbage collection (GC) is required to erase and reclaim space with invalid data. However, GC poses additional writes that hinder the I/O performance, while SSD blocks can only endure a finite number of erasures. Thus, there is a performance-durability tradeoff on the design space of GC. To characterize the optimal tradeoff, this paper formulates an analytical model that explores the full optimal design space of any GC algorithm. We first present a stochastic Markov chain model that captures the I/O dynamics of large-scale SSDs, and adapt the mean-field approach to derive the asymptotic steady-state performance. We further prove the model convergence and generalize the model for all types of workload. Inspired by this model, we propose a randomized greedy algorithm (RGA) that can operate along the optimal tradeoff curve with a tunable parameter. Using trace-driven simulation on DiskSim with SSD addons, we demonstrate how RGA can be parameterized to realize the performance-durability tradeoff.

To stabilize frequency oscillation, the dynamic power flow control devices can be exploited. This paper focuses on a new robust decentralized fixed structure H∞ frequency stabilizer design of power control devices based on overlapping decompositions. The tie-line between two interconnected systems can be treated as the overlapped variable so that the original system can be decomposed into two subsystems. The frequency stabilizer equipped with the power control device can be designed in each subsystem independently. The structure of frequency stabilizer is specified as the 2nd-order lead/lag compensator. To augment the system robust stability, the multiplicative uncertainty is employed to represent all unstructured system uncertainties. As a result, the multiplicative stability margin (MSM) can be used to guarantee the system robust stability. The control parameters of frequency stabilizer are optimized by a tabu search, so that the desired damping ratio of the target inter-area mode and the highest MSM are achieved. Two examples of power flow devices, i.e., high-voltage direct current transmission system and superconducting magnetic energy storage, are used to show the high performance and robustness against load disturbances and system parameters variation. © 2013 ICIC International.","Frequency stabilization; H∞ control; Overlapping decompositions; Robust stability; System uncertainties; Tabu search","Frequency stabilization; High voltage direct current; Multiplicative uncertainty; Overlapping decomposition; Robust stability; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; System parameters variations; System uncertainties; Circuit oscillations; Control; Electric energy storage; Power control; Tabu search; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880063249

However, the power fluctuations generated by most wave energy converters with little to no storage means or without suitable control strategies may deteriorate the power quality of the local network to which wave farms will be connected. They may in particular generate an excessive level of flicker. The minimum amount of storage required for a wave farm to be grid compliant with respect to typical flicker requirements was investigated and is presented in the first part of this study. Besides giving rise to power quality issues, the rapid and high amplitude power peaks generated by wave devices may also render more complex the optimal dimensioning of the wave farm electrical components, whose cost is highly dependent on their power rating. This statement applies also to submarine cables, as the maximum current flowing potentially through them seems to be no longer a relevant criterion for determining their optimal current rating. Hence, the second part of the presented study focuses on the minimum current rating required from a submarine cable to avoid its thermal overloading. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Control strategies; Current flowing; Electrical components; High amplitudes; Local networks; Optimal current; Power fluctuations; Wave energy converters; Automobile exhibitions; Complex networks; Ecology; Lead acid batteries; Rating; Submarine cables; Wave energy conversion; Cables",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879957307

While the harvested power is often less than 1 mW, the commercial-off-the-shelf power management circuits designed for conventional battery applications operate in much higher power. A designated power management module for sub-mW energy harvester is proposed in this article to increase the energy conversion efficiency and extend the energy storage lifetime for small input power. The proposed module consists of discrete component-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) controlled synchronous boost converter structured impedance matching circuit and supercapacitor/micro- battery hybrid energy storage. The synchronous boost converter-based power management circuit achieves 79% conversion efficiency at the input power of 0.5 mW. The power loss during the energy conversion is significantly reduced and thus allows wireless sensor nodes to be powered from a minimum of 120 Lux fluorescent light with a photovoltaic cell smaller than a credit card. The supercapacitor/micro-battery energy storage provides lifetime of more than 73 h when no external energy is available.

The hybrid TE solar collector system described in this report is composed of transparent glass, an air gap, an absorber plate, TE modules, a heat sink to cool the water, and a storage tank. Incident solar radiation falls on the CPC, which directs and reflects the radiation to heat up the absorber plate, creating a temperature difference across the TE modules. The water, which absorbs heat from the hot TE modules, flows through the heat sink to release its heat. The results show that the electrical power output and the conversion efficiency depend on the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TE modules. A maximum power output of 1.03 W and a conversion efficiency of 0.6% were obtained when the temperature difference was 12°C. The thermal efficiency increased as the water flow rate increased. The maximum thermal efficiency achieved was 43.3%, corresponding to a water flow rate of 0.24 kg/s.

The research was conducted by computer simulations with Matlab Simulink software. According to the simulation results load compensation reduces the required current rating of the supply grid transformer and cables by approximately 30 %, and the maximum drop of the reference point (RP) voltage to 2 % compared to 15 % caused by the non-compensated case. The conventional STATCOM attenuates the RP voltage flicker by a factor of 5.9 and the ESTATCOM by a factor of 11.7. The voltage source converters (VSC) of both compensators could be designed for the same rated current, despite the active power compensation capabilities of the ESTATCOM. The system losses are minimized when a 3-level VSC is used instead of a 2-level VSC, and the compensating device is connected to the lowest studied network voltage of 690 V. The energy storage system losses are minimized when the energy storage is connected to the dc link using two separate DC/DC converters instead of a large single converter.

There are two commonly used basic indices for matching analysis: on-site energy fraction (OEF) and on-site energy matching (OEM). OEF indicates the proportion of the load covered by the on-site generated energy, while OEM indicates the proportion of the on-site generated energy that is used in the load rather than being dumped or exported. However, with rapid development of energy technology, matching problems become more complicated when a system involves different energy forms, energy conversions, storages, and hybrid grid connections. In order to meet these challenges, six matching indices are defined based on the extension of the two basic indices. Four examples at one time-step are presented for the usage of these extended indices' equations. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the applicability of these extended indices in a dynamic simulation process, the hourly and daily matching situations of one Finnish single-family house with hybrid grid connections are simulated for one summer's day. It shows that the extended matching indices are powerful tools for assessing the matching situation of increasingly complicated on-site energy systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Finnish forestry technology is advanced and the same machinery which is used in timber harvesting is often used in energy wood harvesting. A change in the forest industry has however caused some new expectations concerning the wood energy supply chain. One of the basic requirements for woodchips is low moisture content. In the transportation of wood chips high moisture content, and therefore a high weight, may limit the carrying capacity of vehicles and roads. Also in syngas and charcoal production dry raw material is needed to be able to control the combustion process. The reduction of moisture content under natural drying conditions means an extended storage time. With Finnish climate conditions this normally means a storage period of at least one year. The various types of energy wood: stems, whole tree harvested stems, logging residues or stumps are piled in storage sites and covered. The raw material is chipped or crushed at these intermediate storage sites and after that transported to bio-refineries. In the measurement of the energy wood's quality and quantity there are some differences compared to timber measurements. Normally the timber measurements are based on solid volume in cubic metres. The forest harvesters are equipped with on-line measurement systems. This on-line measurement is more complicated to carry out in the case of energy wood. Especially difficult are the volume measurements in whole tree and stump harvesting. A new method used in the measurement of energy wood is weight.","Drying; Logistics; Moisture content; Transport; Weight measurements; Wood energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879040143

The higher saline water temperature was achieved by the active stepped solar still compared to the passive solar still due to the additional thermal energy supplied by hot air.

The proposed system can use parabolic trough solar collectors (among other options) to produce 700. kW thermal energy with temperatures up to 400. °C at peak conditions. Thermal energy is delivered to the SORC which uses hexamethyldisiloxane (MM) as the working organic fluid and could achieve cycle efficiency close to 21%. The SORC condensation process is undertaken by the feed seawater to reduce thermal pollution. Due to the elevated temperature of the preheated seawater, the RO unit specific energy consumption decreases.The proposed system has two modes of operation: (1) electricity only; and (2) water-electricity co-generation; based on variable incident solar radiation. This system can reduce the negative impact of intermittent solar energy without thermal energy storage by converting solar energy to desalinated water. The proposed system is ideal for small/medium applications of a few hundred kW, providing a solution to two important issues: fresh water scarcity and electricity, in an efficient way. However, its cost-effectiveness is left to be proved in a future study. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Co-generation; Desalination; Organic Rankine cycle; Parabolic trough collector; Reverse osmosis; Supercritical","Co-generation; Organic Rankine cycles; Parabolic trough collectors; Parabolic trough solar collectors; Seawater desalination; Specific energy consumption; Supercritical; Supercritical organic rankine cycle (SORC); Desalination; Electricity; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Rankine cycle; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Water; Water filtration; Solar collectors; cogeneration; desalination; electricity generation; filtration; solar power; solar radiation; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876979795

Given the inelastic nature of the supply capacity and the high volatility of demand, storage acts as a buffer that facilitates physical delivery at peak demand periods and also smooths the price of gas. Operational efficiency is important for the overall cost-effectiveness of gas and electricity networks and is therefore deserving of study. We study the effects of competition when firms share space, the injection/withdrawal of resources and game-theoretic behavior.We present a game-theoretic model in which strategic interaction occurs between firms due to the interdependencies that arise given the uniform pressure level in the store. In our model, firms are traders that seek to lock in the intrinsic value of storage at the outset of the term by buying and selling forward contracts subject to physical flow constraints. We conduct an empirical analysis using fictitious play and a setup representative of actual facilities and observable forward curve prices. Our results indicate that large losses can occur during the withdrawal season when the forward curve has a specific shape. This motivates the need for alternative economic mechanisms to counteract strategic manipulation. © 2013, Infopro digital. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065527445

Ex ante modeling - which took account of the reductions in emissions resulting from meeting the renewables target and the inlow of project-based credits - indicated that this would result in an approximate allowance price of 30 per tonne of CO2, which was judged to provide the necessary financial incentive to abate emissions, to support carbon capture and storage and innovation in alternative energy suplies, and to discourage member states from doing their own thing in terms of price support and other measures. The only linkage was the acceptance for compliance purposes of Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation credits. But in 2013, all has changed; the allowance price is approximately 75% less than what was anticipated, a friends-of-coal lobby has emerged in the EU, and opportunities to link with other ETS are now becoming a reality.

Once inside the cell, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis is known to survive harsh microenvironments, especially those inside activated macrophages. To improve our understanding of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis pathogenesis, we examined phagosome maturation associated with transcriptional responses of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis during macrophage infection. Monitoring cellular markers, only live M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis bacilli were able to prevent phagosome maturation and reduce its acidification. On the transcriptional level, over 300 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genes were significantly and differentially regulated in both naive and IFN-γ-activated macrophages. These genes include the sigma factor H (sigH) that was shown to be important for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis survival inside gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-activated bovine macrophages. Interestingly, an sigH-knockout mutant showed increased sensitivity to a sustained level of thiol-specific oxidative stress. Large-scale RNA sequence analysis revealed that a large number of genes belong to the sigH regulon, especially following diamide stress. Genes involved in oxidative stress and virulence were among the induced genes in the sigH regulon with a putative consensus sequence for SigH binding that was recognized in a subset of these genes (n=30), suggesting direct regulation by SigH. Finally, mice infections showed a significant attenuation of the δsigH mutant compared to its parental strain, suggesting a role for sigH in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis virulence.

This research evaluates the potential to improve the balance between the electricity use for heating and local electricity production of a nearly zero energy building (nZEB), by active use of structural thermal storage capacity of the building.To quantify the DSM potential of structural thermal storage, the cover factors and peak electricity demand of a single family dwelling equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system are chosen. Detailed representations of the PV system and the dwelling itself, heated by an air-water heat pump, are implemented in the modeling environment of Modelica and simulated for the heating-dominated climate of Belgium. The influence of the insulation level and the embedded thermal mass of the construction on the DSM potential is evaluated. The impact of the heat emission system is estimated by comparing a floor heating system with a radiator emission system.Results show that although the influence on the cover factors is limited, the use of the structural storage capacity for demand-side management shows strong potential to shift the peak electricity use for heating to off-peak hours. Furthermore, it is shown that not only the availability of the thermal mass, but also the interaction between the heating system and the thermal mass is of significant importance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy simulations; Demand-side management; Renewable energy; Thermal storage","Building energy simulations; Demand side managements; Electricity production; Peak electricity demand; Renewable electricity production; Renewable energies; Thermal storage; Zero energy building (ZEB); Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Housing; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Electric utilities; building; demand-side management; electricity; energy use; heating; insulation; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877000660

Cryptographic techniques, k-anonymitybased approaches, spatial obfuscation methods, mix-zones, pseudonyms, and dummy location signals have been proposed to enhance location privacy. In this chapter, the authors propose an approach, called STS (Share The Secret) that segments and distributes the location information to various, nontrusted, entities from where it will be reachable by authenticated location services. This secret sharing approach prevents location information disclosure even in situation where there is a direct observation of the target. The proposed approach facilitates end-users or location-based services to classify flexible privacy levels for different contexts of operation. The authors provide the optimal thresholds to alter the privacy policy levels when there is a need for relaxing or strengthening the required privacy.

TLR4-/- and C57BL/6J wild-type mice (WT) were fed with chow or HFD (45% calories from fat) during 18 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance-test was performed. The animals were sacrificed in a fasted state and the tissues were removed. TLR4 deletion protected from body weight gain and glucose intolerance induced by HFD whereas energy intake was higher in transgenic mice suggesting larger energy expenditure. HFD induced an ER stress in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue of WT mice as assessed by BiP, CHOP, spliced and unspliced XBP1 and phospho-eIF2α. TLR4-/- mice were protected against HFD-induced ER stress. Then, we investigated the main signaling downstream of TLR4 namely the NF-κB pathway, expecting to identify the mechanism by which TLR4 is able to activate ER stress. The mRNA levels of cytokines regulated by NF-κB namely TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6, were not changed after HFD and phospho-IκB-α (ser 32) was not changed. Our results indicate that TLR4 is essential for the development of ER stress related to HFD. Nevertheless, the NFκ-B pathway does not seem to be directly implicated. The reduced fat storage in TLR4-/- mice could explain the absence of an ER stress after HFD. © 2013 Pierre et al.",,"glucose regulated protein 78; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; I kappa B alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; initiation factor 2alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor alpha; X box binding protein 1; fatty acid; toll like receptor 4; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; controlled study; diet restriction; endoplasmic reticulum stress; energy expenditure; glucose intolerance; lipid diet; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; protection; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; weight gain; animal; blood; deficiency; endoplasmic reticulum stress; energy metabolism; genetics; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; knockout mouse; metabolism; obesity; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 4",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878567455

While common SRAMs can be protected from soft-errors using error-correcting codes (ECC), CAMs are much harder to protect against such effects. The main problem is that the comparison of a stored memory word to a search word, when both are encoded by ECCs, is far too complicated and expensive to be performed directly by circuits at each row of the CAM. The proposed design uses a modified NAND-type, dual match-line organization which keeps track of up to 1 bit mismatch per row. As CAM words are encoded using an ECC of Hamming distance of 3, a single bit error can be ""corrected"" during the search operation, by ignoring any single-bit mismatch. The design is analyzed in detail with regard to charge-sharing noise, speed and power and the cost of error-tolerance is investigated against a state-of-the art NAND-type CAM.

New material or new battery system development is an alternative approach to achieve the goal of new high-energy storage system with energy densities 5 times or more greater. A series of SeSx-carbon (x = 0-7) composite materials has been prepared and evaluated as the positive electrodes in secondary lithium cells with ether-based electrolyte. In situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction was utilized to investigate the crystalline phase transition during cell cycling. Complementary, in situ Se K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis was used to track the evolution of the Se valence state for both crystalline and noncrystalline phases, including amorphous and electrolyte-dissolved phases in the (de)lithiation process. On the basis of these results, a mechanism for the (de)lithiation process is proposed, where Se is reduced to the polyselenides, Li2Sen (n ≥ 4), Li2Se2, and Li2Se sequentially during the lithiation and Li2Se is oxidized to Se through Li2Sen (n ≥ 4) during the delithiation. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated the reversibility of the Li/Se system in ether-based electrolyte and the presence of side products in the carbonate-based electrolytes. For Li/SeS2 and Li/SeS7 cells, Li 2Se and Li2S are the discharged products with the presence of Se only as the crystalline phase in the end of charge. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Alternative approach; Carbonate-based electrolytes; Crystalline phase transition; Electrical energy storages; High energy x-ray diffraction; In-situ synchrotrons; Non-crystalline phasis; X-ray absorption near-edge structure; Amorphous materials; Crystalline materials; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Ethers; Photoelectrons; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Lithium; electrolyte; lithium; article; crystal structure; electric battery; lithiation; synchrotron; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878416571

Thermal emission from dust provides a valuable tool for determining important physical properties of the dense structures within molecular clouds. Aims. We attempt to map the distributions of dust temperature and H2 column density of IRAS 05399-0121/SMM 1, which is a dense double-core system in Orion B9. We also search for substructures within the cores through high-resolution submillimetre imaging. Methods. The source was mapped with APEX/SABOCA at 350 μm. We combined these data with our previous LABOCA 870-μm data. The spatial resolution of the new SABOCA image, 3400 AU, is about 2.6 times better than provided by LABOCA, and is therefore well-suited to our purposes. We also make use of the Spitzer infrared observations to characterise the star-formation activity in the source. Results. The filamentary source remains a double-core system on the 3400 AU scale probed here, and the projected separation between IRAS 05399 and SMM 1 is 0.14 pc. The temperature map reveals warm spots towards IRAS 05399 and the southeastern tip of the source. Both IRAS 05399 and SMM 1 stand out as peaks in the column density map. A simple analysis suggests that the density profile has the form r-(2.3 -0.9+2.2), as determined at the position of SMM 1. The broadband spectral energy distribution of IRAS 05399 suggests that it is near the Stage 0/I borderline. A visual inspection of the Spitzer/IRAC images provides hints of a quadrupolar-like jet morphology around IRAS 05399, supporting the possibility that it is a binary system. Conclusions. The source splitting into two subcores along the long axis can be explained by cylindrical Jeans-type fragmentation, but the steepness of the density profile is shallower than what is expected for an isothermal cylinder. The difference between the evolutionary stages of IRAS 05399 (protostellar) and SMM 1 (starless) suggests that the former has experienced a phase of rapid mass accretion, supported by the very long outflow it drives. The protostellar jet from IRAS 05399 might have influenced the nearby core SMM 1. In particular, the temperature map features are likely to be imprints of protostellar or shock heating, while external heating could be provided by the nearby high-mass star-forming region NGC 2024. © 2013 ESO.","ISM: individual objects: IRAS 05399-0121; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars; Submillimeter: ISM","Infrared observations; ISM: individual objects; Isothermal cylinders; Spectral energy distribution; Star-forming region; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars; Submillimeter: isms; Digital storage; Dust; Source separation; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877886631

However, in the face of the high system nonlinearity, the PID controller with fixed parameters may fail to provide satisfactory control performance. To enhance the PID control effect, a new design of the fuzzy gain scheduling of PID controller (FGS-PID) is presented in this paper. The proposed technique is applied to design FGS-PID controllers of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) for power system stabilization. Without trial and error, the scale factors, membership functions and control rules of the FGS-PID controller are automatically tuned by a bee colony optimization. With the optimal FGS-PID controller, the PID parameters can be adjusted automatically according to various system operating conditions. As a result, the high robustness of the FGS-PID controller can be expected. Simulation study confirms that the stabilizing effect and robustness of the proposed SMES with an optimal FGS-PID controller are much superior to those of the SMES with an optimal PID controller. © 2013 ICIC International.","Bee colony optimization; Fuzzy gain scheduling; PID controller; Power system stabilization; Superconducting magnetic energy storage","Bee colony optimizations; Fuzzy gain scheduling; PID controllers; Power system stabilization; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Electric control equipment; Electric energy storage; Optimization; Stabilization; Superconducting devices; Three term control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877828191

Very few of these studies have included physiology, yet including physiological studies may help learning about the mechanistic base of such synergisms at the life history level and identify synergistic interactions not translated in life history traits. We studied in Enallagma cyathigerum damselfly larvae potential synergistic effects between exposure to the pesticide glyphosate and predator cues on a key life history trait, growth rate, its associated behavioural trait, food intake, and three types of physiological traits known to be affected by both stressors in isolation: the stress protein Hsp70, energy storage and variables related to oxidative stress and damage. The pesticide and predator cues reduced growth rate in an additive way. Food intake increased under pesticide exposure and was not affected by the predator cues, indicating physiological mediation of the growth reduction. One potential physiological mechanism was that both stressors additively increased Hsp70 levels, this may also have contributed to the reduced levels of total carbohydrates when exposed to predator cues. Chronic exposure to predator cues reduced oxygen consumption, possibly to avoid too high costs of an increased metabolic rate. This reduction did not occur in the presence of the pesticide, reflecting the need for energetically expensive defence mechanisms (such as Hsp70 upregulation). When both stressors were combined, there was a reduction of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) and an associated increase of oxidative damage in lipids. While synergistic interactions were not present for growth rate and food intake, they were identified for antioxidant defence and oxidative damage. This novel type of ""hidden"" synergistic interaction may have profound fitness implications, and when ignored will lead to underestimations of the impact of pollutants in natural populations where predators are omnipresent. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant defence; Damselfly larvae; Multiple stressors; Oxidative damage; Pesticide; Synergistic interactions","carbohydrate; catalase; glyphosate; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 70; pesticide; superoxide dismutase; antioxidant; damselfly; food intake; glyphosate; life history; pesticide; physiology; pollution effect; animal behavior; article; carbohydrate analysis; cell damage; chemical stress; concentration response; controlled study; damselfly; defense mechanism; electron transport; Enallagma cyathigerum; energy; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; female; food intake; growth rate; life history trait; metabolic rate; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; physiology; predation; predation risk; priority journal; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Food Chain; Glycine; Herbicides; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Insect Proteins; Netherlands; Odonata; Olfactory Perception; Oxidative Stress; Random Allocation; Visual Perception; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874780724

Modern light-weight buildings with high-thermal-resistance envelopes are prone to overheating in the summer due to both solar and internal heat gains. This problem is often solved by installing mechanical cooling (air-conditioning) that leadsto an increase in the energy consumption and, since electricity is mostly used to power the air-conditioning systems, the increase in the energy consumption for cooling can offset the heating-energy savings in terms of primary energy. A lot of attention has therefore been paid to the other means of temperature control in buildings, such as night-time ventilation and/or the building-integrated thermal storage. The phase-change materials that can store a rather large amount of heat in a narrow temperature interval around their melting point seem to be particularly suitable for this purpose. There are many ways of integrating PCMs into the building structures as well as the techniques that employ that extra thermal-storage capacity to provide thermal comfort for the occupants. This paper deals with the results of the laboratory testing of selected organic and inorganic phase-change materials for integration into building structures.

It is the major energy source for many cell types, which are dependent on a steady glucose supply. With the diabetes epidemic affecting the world population, there is an increasing demand for means to regulate glucose metabolism. This chapter is intended to give an overview about glucose uptake and transport mechanisms, highlighting some important aspects of their regulation focusing, lastly, on the role of bone cells in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Uptake and storage of glucose via glycogenesis, its release via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and its catabolism via glycolysis are complex mechanisms strictly regulated. Knowledge of how signaling and trafficking pathways of these processes are adjusted and regulated will be essential to better understand a wide range of metabolic disorders. Cellular uptake of glucose and transport across cell membranes is mediated by two families of specialized carrier proteins: the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the sodium-coupled glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). The various transporters exhibit different substrate specificities, kinetic properties, and tissue expression profiles. The whole family of human GLUT proteins consists of at least 14 members, indicating that glucose delivery into cells is a procedure of considerable complexity. There is substantial amount of data confirming that the skeleton participates in the regulation of energy metabolism, mainly by controlling glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, and fat mass. Although other bone derived molecules and/or hormones cannot be excluded, osteocalcin is a main osteoblast-derived hormone through which bone signals to pancreas and adipose tissue to exert this function. Since bone is a metabolically highly active tissue which requires a large amount of energy for remodeling; it becomes an important player in coordinating global energy utilization. In view of an increasing number of investigations, presented are further in this chapter studies addressing glucose uptake and transport regulation in bone cells by hormones and growth factors. This information can be essential to understanding the pathophysiologic derangements that may result from glucose uptake or transport disorders. Conditions such as diabetes are characterized by an imbalance in glucose regulation, causing chronic hyperglycemia and ultimately leading to multiorgan damage. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The approach chosen here applies selective laser ablation of the front anti-reflection coating (ARC), then forming self-aligned nickel silicides (NiSix) contacts, and thickening the lines by Cu plating to achieve the desired line conductivity. A successful implementation of this scheme requires annealing to form NiSi x with low contact resistance. However, it has been shown that industrial shallow emitters can be damaged severely upon conventional annealing of nickel. In this paper, we show that by using large area excimer laser annealing (ELA), NiSix contacts can be formed on industrial shallow emitters without the associated junction degradation. On the basis of sheet resistance, transmission electron microscopy, and lifetime measurements, we demonstrate that NiSix formation by ELA can be achieved in narrow contact openings without damaging the passivation and reflectance properties of the neighboring ARC. In addition, the thresholds for NiSix formation for different Ni thicknesses are quantified by rigorous finite element simulations and compared with experimental data. Finally, high efficiency passivated emitter and rear cell type solar cells featuring a shallow 85 Ω/sq emitter have been processed on large area CZ-Si using laser ablation of the ARC and subsequent NiSix formation by ELA. These cells show an average efficiency gain of 0.4%abs compared with cells processed with reference SP contacts. In this work, the best performing cell with the ELA process reached 20.0% energy conversion efficiency.

Energy storage, mainly as glycogen in liver and triglycerides in adipose tissue, is regulated by the anabolic actions of insulin. On the other hand, mobilization of stored energy during infection, trauma or stress is served by the temporary inhibition of insulin action (insulin resistance) in target tissues by proinflammatory cytokines and stress hormones. In the current environment, high energy intake, low physical activity, and chronic stress favor the storage of surplus fat in adipose tissue depots that far exceeds their storage capacity and liporegulation. Lipid overload in central fat depots initiates an inflammatory response and adipocyte dysfunction with resultant low-grade systemic inflammation and lipid overflow to peripheral tissues. In turn, proinflammatory cytokines and non-oxidized lipid metabolites, accumulated in liver and muscle cells, activate the mechanism of insulin resistance as would occur in the case of infection or stress. The same factors together with the ensuing insulin resistance further contribute to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and ultimately to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The present review supports the hypothesis that insulin resistance evolved as a physiological adaptive mechanism in human survival and that the same mechanism is inappropriately activated on a chronic basis in the current environment, leading to the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Central obesity; Low-grade inflammation; Metabolic syndrome; Selfish brain; Type 2 diabetes","cytokine; stress hormone; adipose tissue; body fat distribution; caloric intake; chronic stress; human; immune response; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; muscle cell; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; protein metabolism; review; target organ; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biological Evolution; Environment; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Models, Biological; Stress, Physiological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876673360

Our proposed approach enables a comparison of pump operations with and without the OEEP, yielding accurate estimates for kWh energy and kW capacity savings that are useful in evaluation, monitoring, and verification of the program.

Thus, the main focus is on the adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis occurring both in the typical depots of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in UCP1-containing cells that could be induced in white adipose tissue (WAT). Because contribution of WAT to resting metabolic rate is relatively small, the possibility to reduce adiposity by enhancing energy expenditure in classical white adipocytes is largely neglected. However, several pieces of evidence support a notion that induction of energy expenditure based on oxidation of fatty acids (FA) in WAT may be beneficial for health, namely: (i) studies in both humans and rodents document negative association between oxidative capacity of mitochondria in WAT and obesity; (ii) pharmacological activation of AMPK in rats as well as cold-acclimation of UCP1-ablated mice results in obesity resistance associated with increased oxidative capacity in WAT; and (iii) combined intervention using long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated FA (omega 3) and mild calorie restriction exerted synergism in the prevention of obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet; this was associated with strong hypolipidemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, as well as prevention of inflammation, and synergistic induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FA oxidation, specifically in epididymal WAT. Importantly, these changes occurred without induction of UCP1 and suggested the involvement of: (i) futile substrate cycle in white adipocytes, which is based on lipolysis of intracellular triacylglycerols and re-esterification of FA, in association with the induction of mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, β-oxidation, and energy expenditure; (ii) endogenous lipid mediators (namely endocannabinoids, eicosanoids, prostanoids, resolvins, and protectins) and their cognate receptors; and (iii) AMP-activated protein kinase in WAT. Quantitatively, the strong induction of FA oxidation in WAT in response to the combined intervention is similar to that observed in the transgenic mice rendered resistant to obesity by ectopic expression of UCP1 in WAT. The induction of UCP1-independent FA oxidation and energy expenditure in WAT in response to the above physiological stimuli could underlie the amelioration of obesity and low-grade WAT inflammation, and it could reduce the release of FA from adipose tissue and counteract harmful consequences of lipid accumulation in other tissues. In this respect, new combination treatments may be designed using naturally occurring micronutrients (e.g. omega 3), reduced calorie intake or pharmaceuticals, exerting synergism in the induction of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and stimulation of lipid catabolism in white adipocytes, and improving metabolic flexibility of WAT. The role of mutual interactions between adipocytes and immune cells contained in WAT in tissue metabolism should be better characterised.

In discussing the properties of these systems, researchers typically refer to the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied MOs, which are π MOs. The characteristic properties of aromatic systems, such as their low ionization potentials and electron affinities, high polarizabilities and stabilities, and small band gaps (in spectroscopy called the N → V1 space), can easily be explained based on their electronic structure. These one-electron properties point to characteristic features of how aromatic systems interact with each other.Unlike hydrogen bonding systems, which primarily interact through electrostatic forces, complexes containing aromatic systems, especially aromatic stacked pairs, are predominantly stabilized by dispersion attraction. The stabilization energy in the benzene dimer is rather small (∼2.5 kcal/mol) but strengthens with heteroatom substitution. The stacked interaction of aromatic nucleic acid bases is greater than 10 kcal/mol, and for the most stable stacked pair, guanine and cytosine, it reaches approximately 17 kcal/mol. Although these values do not equal the planar H-bonded interactions of these bases (∼29 kcal/mol), stacking in DNA is more frequent than H-bonding and, unlike H-bonding, is not significantly weakened when passing from the gas phase to a water environment.Consequently, the stacking of aromatic systems represents the leading stabilization energy contribution in biomacromolecules and in related nanosystems. Therefore stacking (dispersion) interactions predominantly determine the double helical structure of DNA, which underlies its storage and transfer of genetic information. Similarly, dispersion is the dominant contributor to attractive interactions involving aromatic amino acids within the hydrophobic core of a protein, which is critical for folding.Therefore, understanding the nature of aromatic interactions, which depend greatly on quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, is of key importance in biomolecular science. This Account shows that accurate binding energies for aromatic complexes should be based on computations made at the (estimated) CCSD(T)/complete basis set limit (CBS) level of theory. This method is the least computationally intensive one that can give accurate stabilization energies for all common classes of noncovalent interactions (aromatic-aromatic, H-bonding, ionic, halogen bonding, charge-transfer, etc.). These results allow for direct comparison of binding energies between different interaction types. Conclusions based on lower-level QM calculations should be considered with care. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon; benzene; DNA; article; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; hydrogen bond; thermodynamics; Benzene; Binding Sites; DNA; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Hydrogen Bonding; Models, Molecular; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876217928

Here we investigate the extent to which the connectivity evolution of a network might be predicted by mere topological features. We show how a link/community-based strategy triggers substantial prediction improvements because it accounts for the singular topology of several real networks organised in multiple local communities - a tendency here named local-communityparadigm (LCP). We observe that LCP networks are mainly formed by weak interactions and characterise heterogeneous and dynamic systems that use self-organisation as a major adaptation strategy. These systems seem designed for global delivery of information and processing via multiple local modules. Conversely, non-LCP networks have steady architectures formed by strong interactions, and seem designed for systems in which information/energy storage is crucial.",,"brain; connectome; organization; prediction; storage; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; cytology; human; metabolism; methodology; nerve cell network; protein analysis; structure activity relation; nerve protein; proteome; Animals; Computer Simulation; Connectome; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Protein Interaction Mapping; Proteome; Structure-Activity Relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879948383

Both obesity and diabetes are the epicenter of important medical issues, representing a major international public health threat. Accumulation of fat in adipose tissue, muscles and liver and/or the defects in their ability to metabolize fatty acids, results in insulin resistance. This triggers an early pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In mammals, lipid metabolism involves several organs, including the brain, adipose tissue, muscles, liver, and gut. These organs are part of complex homeostatic system and communicate through hormones, neurons and metabolites. Our study dissects the importance of mammalian Krüppel-like factors in over all energy homeostasis. Factors controlling energy metabolism are conserved between mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans providing a new and powerful strategy to delineate the molecular pathways that lead to metabolic disorder. The C. elegans intestine is our model system where genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology are used to identify and understand genes required in fat metabolism. Thus far, we have found an important role of C. elegans KLF in FA biosynthesis, mitochondrial proliferation, lipid secretion, and β-oxidation. The mechanism by which KLF controls these events in lipid metabolism is unknown. We have recently observed that C. elegans KLF-3 selectively acts on insulin components to regulate insulin pathway activity. There are many factors that control energy homeostasis and defects in this control system are implicated in the pathogenesis of human obesity and diabetes. In this review we are discussing a role of KLF in human metabolic regulation. © 2013 Hashmi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","β-oxidation; C. elegans; Ce-KLF-1; Ce-KLF-3; Diabetes; Fat storage; Fatty acids; Insulin; KLF; Krüppel-like factors; Leptin; Lipid metabolism; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Transcription factor; Triglycerides","Caenorhabditis elegans; cytology; diabetes mellitus; energy; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; food intake; genetic algorithm; glucose metabolism; lipid metabolism; metabolism; molecular biology; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; review; Caenorhabditis elegans; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875689037

However, due to the limitations of WSNs in terms of memory, energy, computation, communication, and scalability, efficient management of the large number of WSNs data in these areas is an important issue to deal with. There is a need for a powerful and scalable high-performance computing and massive storage infrastructure for real-time processing and storing of the WSN data as well as analysis (online and offline) of the processed information under context using inherently complex models to extract events of interest. In this scenario, cloud computing is becoming a promising technology to provide a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable and virtualized manner at low cost. Therefore, in recent years, Sensor-Cloud infrastructure is becoming popular that can provide an open, flexible, and reconfigurable platform for several monitoring and controlling applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of representative works on Sensor-Cloud infrastructure, which will provide general readers an overview of the Sensor-Cloud platform including its definition, architecture, and applications.

This study analyses the modification of the bouncing mechanism of running when approaching a barrier. The forces exerted by the feet on the ground are measured by a 13-m-long force platform during the four to nine running steps preceding the jump over a 0.45- to 0.85-m-high barrier, at an approaching speed between 9 and 21 km h-1. The movements of the COM are evaluated by time-integration of the forces and the stiffness of the bouncing system by computer simulation. The running mechanism is modified during the two steps preceding the barrier. During the contact period, two steps before the barrier, the leg-spring stiffness decreases; consequently, the COM is lowered and accelerated forward. Then during the contact period preceding the obstacle, the leg-spring stiffness increases and the COM is raised and accelerated upwards, whereas its forward velocity is reduced. During this phase, the leg-spring acts like a pole, which stores elastic energy and changes the direction of the velocity vector to release this energy in a vertical direction. At high speeds, this storage-release mechanism of elastic energy is sufficient to provide the energy necessary to leap the obstacle. On the contrary, at low speeds, the amount of elastic energy stored and released in the leg-spring is not sufficient to jump over the obstacle and additional positive muscular work must be done. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Jump; Locomotion; Mechanical work; Muscular stiffness; Running","adult; analysis of variance; article; biomechanics; computer simulation; gait; human; male; motor activity; physiology; running; skeletal muscle; time; videorecording; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Gait; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Muscle, Skeletal; Running; Time Factors; Video Recording; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876285031

Studies on adipose tissue fatty acid (FA) composition have made no distinction between these two depots. The aim of this study is to determine whether DSAT and SSAT differ in FA composition. We studied the FA composition of DSAT and SSAT in 17 male and 13 female volunteers using non-invasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to differentiate between DSAT and SSAT. Adipose tissue spectra were analysed for lipid unsaturation, or double bond (DB) content, and polyunsaturation (PU), according to previously validated methods. The DSAT depot was more saturated than the SSAT depot, in both men (0.833±0.012 vs 0.846±0.009 DB, P<0.002) and women (0.826±0.018 vs 0.850±0.018 DB, P<0.002). In contrast, PU did not differ between DSAT and SSAT in either men (0.449±0.043 vs 0.461±0.044 PU, P=0.125) or women (0.411±0.070 vs 0.442±0.062 PU, P=0.234) and displayed a close correlation between the depots (R=0.908, P<0.001, n=30). The higher saturation in DSAT compared with SSAT can be attributed to a higher ratio of saturated to monounsaturated FAs. These results should be taken into account when determining the FA composition of SAT. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

While increasing evidence in the literature points to an effect of internal stress on the equilibrium H-uptake, it is still an open question to what extent the hydriding kinetics can be affected by stress. Here, the hydriding kinetics of nanocrystalline Pd thin films is studied with varying degrees of growth-induced internal stress levels. The experimental technique consists of a high-resolution curvature measurement set-up. After mounting the sample inside a high-vacuum chamber, a H-containing gas mixture is introduced to generate instantaneously a given hydrogen partial pressure (pH2) inside the chamber. The resulting interaction of H with the Pd layer then leads to an expansion of the thin-film system constrained by the underlying substrate, inducing in turn a change in the sample curvature. The curvature evolution, obtained in situ at different pH2, is first interpreted with a self-consistent kinetic model in order to identify the different rate-limiting steps during a hydriding cycle. Next, the corresponding rate constants are calculated, as well as their variation with internal stress. The internal stress does not affect the rate constant of the adsorption-limited regime in the range 60-450 MPa, leading to an average value of 1.1 ± 0.2 × 1021 mbar-1 s-1 over the experimentally covered pH2 range, 1-10 mbar. As to the absorption-limited regime, a significant stress effect was recorded on the absorption rate constant of the very initial stages of hydriding, leading to an activation volume of 17.6 ± 2.3 Å3 for H-absorption into our Pd thin films. This value, combined with an initial internal tensile stress of the order of 450 MPa, leads to a decrease of the activation energy for H-absorption of 3 kJ mol-1. This effect induces up to a factor 3 increase in the room-temperature absorption rate in the initial stages of hydriding.","Adsorption; Hydriding; Internal stress; Kinetics; Pd-H","Absorption rate constants; Curvature measurement; Experimental techniques; High-vacuum chambers; Hydriding; Hydrogen partial pressures; Pd-H; Rate-limiting steps; Activation energy; Adsorption; Enzyme kinetics; Growth kinetics; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Rate constants; Residual stresses; Thin films; Kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875227271

Because the costs of maintaining low-temperature storage can be prohibitively expensive in developing countries, this study explored alternatives to low-temperature storage at the Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization (ECHO) Asia Impact Center Seed Bank in Northern Thailand. Specifically, this research compared the effects of vacuum sealing and refrigeration on stored seed viability in both laboratory and field settings. While seed species was an influential factor in determining seed longevity, the relative importance of vacuum sealing and refrigeration differed for the dependent variables of seed moisture content, germination rate, mean time to 50% germination and field emergence. Although the combination of vacuum sealing and refrigeration was most effective at conserving seed quality as measured by each of these variables, the storage of seeds in vacuum-sealed packages at ambient temperatures was more effective than unsealed but refrigerated packets at conserving low moisture content and high germination and field emergence rates across species. This suggests that for resource-constrained seed banks in the tropics, vacuum sealing with or without refrigeration may represent a viable alternative to other expensive and energy-intensive storage techniques.

'Kanzi', 'Jonagold' and 'Braeburn' under controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions. A new criterion for the local O2 partial pressure beyond which there is a risk of cell death due to energy shortage was established as the local O2 partial pressure at which the oxidative ATP production becomes smaller than the maximal ATP production by fermentation. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km,O2) of oxidative respiration of apple tissue at 1°C was within 0.13-0.17kPa. At an O2 partial pressure of 0.46-0.78 times the Km,O2 at a storage temperature of 1°C, energy production for cell maintenance could be still secured in the three cultivars. The effect of natural variability of the maximal respiration rate and tissue gas diffusivities inside apple fruit was further studied by means of a Monte Carlo analysis.

The problems include the allocation of a number of forest biomass procurement chains to an energy plant during different periods. In Finland district and roadside terminals are commonly used as forest fuel buffers of energy plants. However, due to the complex nature of the decentralized procurement problem, it is recently considered as an inefficient procurement chain. Therefore we tested the developed terminal planning system using plant terminal technology and forest fuel buffer decisions to better describe the combinatorial complexity of energy flows. We decoded the dynamic linear optimization program to the decision support system. This makes the approach usable by managers without requiring them to learn advanced programming skills. The total operating costs decreased 14.1% from 5.9 to 5.1 million Euros when the plant terminal technology was included. The properties of the decision support system are discussed and we present two examples of how the system works based on real-world data and plant terminal technology rate (500%) as an optional terminal buffer constraint. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Decentralized wood procurement; Forest energy; Optimization; Plant terminal technology","Buffer constraints; CHP plant; Combinatorial complexity; Complex nature; Energy flow; Energy plant; Finland; Finnish; Forest biomass; Forest energy; Forest fuel; Linear optimization; Programming skills; Real world data; Scheduling problem; Sustainable energy; Terminal Planning; Wood procurement; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Forestry; Fuels; Optimization; Technology; Cogeneration plants; biomass; combined heat and power; cost-benefit analysis; decision support system; forest resource; fuelwood; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; resource allocation; storage; wood; Artificial Intelligence; Cogeneration; Decision Making; Finland; Forests; Optimization; Technology; Wood; Finland; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869864501

A promising method to enhance heat capacity of a fluid is by introducing phase change particles in a flow system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate heat capacity enhancement in a microchannel flow with the presence of phase change material (PCM) particles. Design/methodology/approach - Discrete phase model (DPM) and homogeneous model have been compared in this study. Water is used as the carrier fluid and lauric acid as the PCM particles with different volume concentrations, ranging from 0 to 10%. Both the models neglect the particle-particle interaction effects of PCM particles. Findings - The DPM indicates that presence of 10% volume concentration of PCM particles does not cause an increase in the pressure drop along the channel length. However, prediction from the homogeneous model shows an increase in the pressure drop due to the addition of nanoparticles in such a way that 10% volume concentration of particles causes 34.4% increase in pressure drop. Research limitations/implications - The study covers only 10% volume concentration of PCM particles; however, the model may be modified to include higher volume concentrations. The laminar flow is considered; it may be extended to study the turbulence effects. Practical implications - This work provides a starting framework for the practical use of different PCM particles, carrier fluid properties, and different particle volume concentrations in electronic cooling applications. Originality/value - The work presented is original and the findings will be very useful for researchers and engineers working in microchannel flow in cooling and thermal storage applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Flow; Heat transfer; Microchannels; Phase change particles","Design/methodology/approach; Flow; Particle volume concentrations; Particle-particle interactions; Phase Change; Phase Change Material (PCM); Phase change material particles; Solar thermal energy conversion; Channel flow; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Phase change materials; Pressure drop; Solar energy; Specific heat; Microchannels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875331897

Undeveloped storage infrastructure presents a special challenge in northern Afghanistan, where food security is undermined by highly variable water supplies, inefficient water allocation rules, and a damaged irrigation system due three decades of war and conflict. Little peer-reviewed research to date has analyzed the economic benefits of water storage capacity expansions as a mechanism to sustain food security over long periods of variable climate and growing food demands needed to feed growing populations. This paper develops and applies an integrated water resources management framework that analyzes impacts of storage capacity expansions for sustaining farm income and food security in the face of highly fluctuating water supplies. Findings illustrate that in Afghanistan's Balkh Basin, total farm income and food security from crop irrigation increase, but at a declining rate as water storage capacity increases from zero to an amount equal to six times the basin's long term water supply. Total farm income increases by 21%, 41%, and 42% for small, medium, and large reservoir capacity, respectively, compared to the existing irrigation system unassisted by reservoir storage capacity. Results provide a framework to target water infrastructure investments that improve food security for river basins in the world's dry regions with low existing storage capacity that face ongoing climate variability and increased demands for food security for growing populations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Food security; Policy; River basin; Storage","Economic performance; Food security; Integrated Water Resources Management; Reservoir storage capacity; River basins; Storage infrastructure; Water infrastructure investments; Water storage capacity; Climatology; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Energy storage; Expansion; Investments; Population statistics; Public policy; Reservoirs (water); Water resources; Water supply; Watersheds; Food supply; climate change; economic analysis; food security; irrigation system; performance assessment; population growth; profitability; reservoir; resource allocation; river basin; sustainability; water management; water resource; water storage; water supply; Afghanistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875396382

To achieve optimum results, multi-dimensional AE analysis has been performed, combining Time Driven Data (TDD), Hit Driven Data (HDD) and long waveform streams acquired simultaneously. High-frequency AE sensors proved to be adequately sensitive to flat defects, and the received AE signal level fluctuations were in agreement with the single defect rotational frequency. Combined analysis of all available types of AE data in the time and frequency domain with specialized software reveals the full potential, of the method in providing high accuracy defect detection.

To improve stability, resistive type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) can be effectively used. This paper proposes a new optimization of multiple SFCL and SMES units for transient stabilization in a multimachine power system based on kinetic energy control. Two applications of the proposed optimization are studied in the West Japan six-area interconnected power system. First, the SFCL is applied to solve the inevitable problems of SMES used for transient stability enhancement, i.e., required large power and energy capacities, and fail-operational performance due to the large voltage drop at the SMES bus. When the fault occurs, the SFCL swiftly reduces the increase in the kinetic energy of all generators by limiting the fault current. Subsequently, the SMES handles the remaining unbalanced kinetic energy. The optimization problem of the resistive value of the SFCL is formulated, considering energy dissipation in combination with the power controller parameters of SMES with optimal coil size. A simulation study shows the superior effect of the combined SFCL and SMES over either device separately. With SFCL, the low voltage ride-through capability of SMES can be enhanced. The MW and MJ capacities of the SMES are also significantly reduced. Second, a new optimization of multiple SFCL units considering optimal locations, optimal number, optimal resistive values, and energy dissipation during quenching state is presented. The optimization problem is formulated by maximizing the decreasing rate of energy function during fault in combination with minimizing the energy dissipation of the SFCL during quenching state. A simulation study confirms the superior effect of optimal SFCL units over nonoptimal SFCL units. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Energy function; optimization; power system stability; superconducting fault current limiter; superconducting magnetic energy storage","Coil sizes; Energy capacity; Energy functions; Large power; Loss of synchronism; Low-voltage ride-through; Multi machine power system; Optimal locations; Optimal number; Optimization problems; Power controllers; Power system stability; Power system transients; Rate-of-energy; Resistive type superconducting fault current limiter; Simulation studies; Stability enhancement; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Transient stabilization; Voltage drop; Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Energy dissipation; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Optimization; Problem solving; Quenching; Stabilization; Superconducting devices; Superconducting electric lines; System stability; Superconducting fault current limiters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874591546

Both the as-cast and powdered alloys were hydrided in a 6 M KOH solution at 80 °C for 120-480 min. The structures and phase compositions of the alloys, both before and after hydriding, were studied using optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. Differential scanning calorimetry and mass spectrometry were used to study the dehydriding process. In the case of as-cast alloys, the best combination of hydriding parameters (maximum hydrogen concentration on surface; depth of hydrogen penetration) was achieved in the Mg-26Ni alloy. In the case of powdered alloys, the Mg-34Ni alloy absorbed the highest amount of hydrogen, nearly 4.5 wt.%. The only hydride formed during hydriding was the MgH 2 hydride.

The basic scenario examined in this work assessed possible electricity unit cost taking into account the penetration of PV modules of about 5 to 10 kW PV systems as roof-tops for residential use, without storage capability in prevailing local conditions in the northern region of KSA, i.e. city of Arar. Based on the input data and assumptions made, the simulations indicated that the scenario to meet the electrical demand of Arar would require installing at least 20-30 central modules, with a capacity of about 10 MW each. But it is not possible to meet the total electrical demand by employing distributed PV modules. In addition, the cost The estimated cost of produced electricity is about 0.1-0.12 US$/kWh and considered very high compared with the current prices of about US$ 0.013 per kWh. Without government incentives, i.e. feed-in-tariff or any other financial scheme aiming to encourage the utilization of renewable energy resources, such systems will not be feasible or find its way in KSA. However, the sensitivity analysis on current fuel prices, used for power generation, showed that increasing the local fuel prices would make such plants more economically attractive compared with conventional systems. © 2013, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

For prevention of damage and losses by insects infestation, all insects present in the stored product must be eliminated at any stage of their development. Preservation methods which applied to food products for insect pests control, as chemical method, resulted in several problems and hazard for consumers. Heat treatment is one of the safe alternative measures for storage insects control but it is costy and requires special facilities for application. Therefore, the aim of this study is to utilize solar radiation as source of heat for thermal control of storage insects, in an attempt to find out a safer effective control measure at minimal cost. To study the effect of material, black paint, and transparent cover on heat observation, four groups of containers were made from differernt materials (plastic, polythene, metal and jute). Two containers from each group (out of three) were painted black and one from these two black containers was covered with transparent polythene.

The effect of the C vacancy on the physisorption modes of H2 was investigated as a function of H2 binding energy within the energy window (-0.2 to -0.6 eV) targeted by the Department of Energy (DOE), and as functions of a variety of other physicochemical properties. The results indicate that the preferential orientations of H2 in the defect-free (i.e., no C vacancy) C60TiH2 complex are along the x- and y-axes of C60 (with adsorption energies of -0.23 and -0.21 eV, respectively), making these orientations the most suitable ones for hydrogen storage, in contrast to the results obtained for defect-containing fullerenes. The defect-containing (i.e., containing a C vacancy) C 59TiH2 complex do not exhibit adsorption energies within the targeted energy range. Charge transfer occurs from Ti 3d to C 2p of the fullerene. The binding of H2 is dominated by the pairwise support-metal interaction energy E(i)Cn.Ti, and the role of the fullerene is not restricted to supporting the metal. The C vacancy enhances the adsorption energy of Ti, in contrast to that of H2. A significant reduction in the energy gap of the pristine C60 fullerene is observed when TiH2 is adsorbed by it. While the C n fullerene readily participates in nucleophilic processes, the adjacent TiH2 fragment is available for electrophilic processes.

The theoretical characterization has been carried out in terms of H2 adsorption energies that are lying in the desirable energy window (-0.2 to-0.6 eV) recommended by DOE, as well as a variety of physicochemical properties. A remarkable and significant change in H2 adsorption energy is observed under the effect of only (1%) axial strain. Axial relaxation leads to H2 adsorption energies within the recommended energy range for hydrogen storage, in contrast to axial compression. Simultaneous weakening of π and σ interactions, due to the effect of axial relaxation and loss of spatial orbital overlap, is in favor of hydrogen adsorption in the recommended energy range, and dominates the effect of charge transfer from Ti 3d to C 2p of the SWCNT. The calculated pairwise and non pairwise additive components confirm that the role of the SWCNT is not restricted to supporting the metal. Polarizability and hperpolarizabilty calculations as well as spectral analysis characterize the relaxed structure (Z = 1.02), for which H2 adsorption energy (-0.34 eV) is in the recommended energy range for hydrogen storage, to be energetically more preferable than the compressed structure (Z = 0.99).

As a by-product, we establish a necessary matching condition to characterize the limit of failure recovery, that is, unless the matching condition is satisfied, a failure case is impossible to recover. In addition, we define a maximally recoverable (MR) property. For all ERC schemes holding the MR property, the matching condition becomes sufficient, that is, all failure cases satisfying the matching condition are indeed recoverable.

The radiofrequency emission which occurs when these particles interact in the glacial ice is detected by an array of antennas spread out over an enormous area, over 100 km2 and embedded in the ice at depths of 200 m to increase sensitivity. Signals from the antennas are digitized by specialized electronics and must be time synchronized with accuracies of order 50 ps or less for event reconstruction to function properly. A system has been proposed which digitizes the impulse waveforms in situ in the ice and sends the data to the surface using high-speed serial links. This requires distribution of a low-jitter clock to each hole but has substantial advantages in cost and power which drive our development effort to realize this technology. Last year we implemented a first version of a long distance clock synchronization system using electrical signaling over CAT5. This year we have updated our solution to optical fiber using high speed transceiver blocks in Spartan 6 FPGAs. The master clock is embedded into the data stream and distributed to the various holes where a phase-locked derivative is recovered. In this way, we have implemented a 1.25 Gbps data link over a bi-directional communication system fulfilling the requirements of the project.

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes-polystyrene nanocomposites were prepared at different multiwalled carbon nanotubes weight ratios to investigate the effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes loadings on the electrical, optical, and rheological properties of polystyrene matrix. The obtained results revealed that incorporation of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes into polystyrene improved the electrical, optical, and rheological properties of neat polystyrene which indicated that multiwalled carbon nanotubes were well dispersed in the polymer matrix. Results obtained from DC and AC electrical measurements revealed that the percolation threshold was around 0.8-wt% multiwalled carbon nanotubes and incorporation of 3% multiwalled carbon nanotubes into polystyrene increased polystyrene electrical conductivity up to six orders of magnitude. Besides, increasing of multiwalled carbon nanotubes loadings increased the relative dielectric permittivity, dielectric loss, and loss tangent while decreased the total impedance of polystyrene matrix. Rheological results indicated that incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes into polystyrene elevated the magnitudes of storage modulus and loss modulus up to two orders of magnitude with increasing of multiwalled carbon nanotubes loadings up to 3-wt%.

The establishment, production and harvest costs were investigated to calculate the net present value (NPV) and the equivalent annual value (EAV) of the SRWC cultivation when the biomass chips were sold at a price of 40 € Mg-1 with a moisture content (m. c.) of 50 %. The calculated NPVs were 229 and -485 € ha-1, and the EAVs equalled 16. 3 and -34. 6 € ha-1 year-1 for the farmer's and investor's scenario, respectively. The break-even price at which the produced biomass could be sold at the farm gate excluding transport, handling, storage and profit margins of the involved companies was calculated using the levellised costs (LC) method and equalled 78. 4 and 83. 5 € oven-dried ton (odt)-1 for the farmer's and investor's viewpoint, respectively. Three harvesting strategies, applied on a SRWC plantation of 18. 1 ha in Flanders (Belgium), were studied and compared. It became clear that preference should be given to more economic, small-scale harvesters instead of large-scale self-propelled harvesters, given the relatively limited surface available for SRWCs in Belgium. Furthermore, the inclusion of transportation over a distance of 50 km by truck increased the LC by 15. 1 € odt-1.

Its walls consist of multiple layers of insulation materials and gypsum plasterboard panels containing Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage purposes. A detailed matrix of sensors was installed in different locations of all external walls of the house, as well as indoors, in order to provide detailed temperature measurements and thus lead to a thorough depiction of the house's thermal behaviour. In this work, experimental data obtained during the first year of monitoring (2011) are presented. Throughout this particular monitoring period the house purposely remained closed, unoccupied and no energy systems were installed. Hence the presented analysis focuses on the thermal characterization of the house's walling system. Average monthly temperature, decrement factor and time lag values are presented for each room-wall and are discussed with respect to their orientation and exposure to the external weather conditions.

Despite the many advantages of DG, this can lead to voltage problems, especially in times of a high local generation and a low local load. The traditional solution is to invest in more and stronger lines, which could lead to massive investments to cope with the huge rise of DG connection. Another common solution is to include hard curtailment; thus, on-off control of DG units. However, hard curtailment potentially leads to on-off oscillations of DG and a high loss of the available renewable energy as storage is often not economically viable. To cope with these issues, applying a grid-forming control in grid-connected DG units is studied in this paper. The voltage-based droop control that was originally developed for power sharing in islanded microgrids, enables an effective way for soft curtailment without communication. The power changes of the renewable energy sources are delayed to more extreme voltages compared to those of the dispatchable units. This restricts the renewable energy loss and avoids on-off oscillations. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Distributed generation (DG); droop controllers; on-off control; voltage control; voltage oscillations","Droop controllers; Economically viable; Electrical power system; On-off control; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Voltage oscillation; Voltage problems; Distributed power generation; Economics; Electric power systems; Energy dissipation; Voltage control; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875645124

Design/methodology/approach - In hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the power flow control and the powertrain component sizing are strongly related and their design will significantly influence the vehicle performance, cost, efficiency and fuel economy. Hence, it is necessary to assess the power flow management strategy at the powertrain design stage in order to minimize component sizing, cost, and the vehicle fuel consumption for a given driving cycle. In this paper, the PSO algorithm is implemented to optimize the design and the power management control of fuel cell/supercapacitor (FC/SC) and fuel cell/battery (FC/B) HEVs for a given driving cycle. The powertrain and the proposed control strategy are designed and simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, a comparative study of fuel cell/supercapacitor and fuel cell/battery HEVs is analyzed and investigated for adequately selecting of the appropriate HEV, which could be used in industrial applications. Findings - The results have demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve the hydrogen consumption in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs) by applying the PSO approach. Furthermore, by analyzing and comparing the results, the FC/SC HEV has slightly higher fuel economy than the FC/B HEV. Originality/value - The addition of electrical energy storage such as supercapacitor or battery in fuel cell-based vehicles has a great potential and a promising approach for future hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This paper is mainly focused on the optimal design and power management control, which has significant influences on the vehicle performance. Therefore, this study presents a modified control strategy based on PSO algorithm (CSPSO) for optimizing the power sharing between sources and reducing the components sizing. Furthermore, an interleaved multiple-input power converter (IMIPC) is proposed for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle to reduce the input current/output voltage ripples and to reduce the size of the passive components with high efficiency compared to conventional boost converter. Meanwhile, the fuel economy is improved.

However, the nature of adhesion between titanium and the adhesive luting materials remains unclear. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treating surfaces with chemical etching solution on the adhesion of titanium-resin cement systems as determined by strain energy release rate (G-value, J/m2). Material and methods One hundred and eighty commercially pure titanium (cp Ti) plates were prepared. The specimens were divided into 5 test groups according to the surface treatment used; Gr C (machined; control), Gr A (airborne-particle abrasion), Gr E15, Gr E30, and Gr E60 (experimental etching solution applied for 15, 30, or 60 minutes). For strain energy release rate testing, each group was further divided into 2 equal subgroups according to the type of resin cement used (i CEM or Multilink Speed). The strain energy release rate was evaluated after 24 hours of storage in distilled water or after thermocycling (10 000 cycles, 5°C to 55°C). The treated surfaces were characterized by AFM and SEM. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and the Tukey HSD test (α=.05). Results Strain energy release rate values were significantly affected by type of cement, surface treatment, and thermocycling (P&lt;.05). After thermocycling, the cp Ti/i CEM (E30 and E60) groups showed the highest G-values among the groups. AFM and SEM analyses showed that the surface topography of cp Ti was modified after treatments. Conclusions The strain energy release rate (G-value, J/m2) between resin cement and cp Ti can be improved by the use of experimental hot etching solution before cement application. © 2013 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",,"aluminum oxide; dental material; hydrochloric acid; inorganic compound; methacrylic acid derivative; multilink adhesive system; resin cement; silicon carbide; silicon derivative; titanium; water; algorithm; article; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; comparative study; dental acid etching; dental bonding; dental etching; dental procedure; equipment; heat; human; materials testing; mechanical stress; methodology; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; temperature; time; tooth brushing; Acid Etching, Dental; Algorithms; Aluminum Oxide; Carbon Compounds, Inorganic; Dental Bonding; Dental Etching; Dental Materials; Dental Polishing; Dental Stress Analysis; Hot Temperature; Humans; Hydrochloric Acid; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Resin Cements; Silicon Compounds; Stress, Mechanical; Surface Properties; Temperature; Time Factors; Titanium; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873586935

This hypothesis was tested by exposing different Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindel.) cultivars to 0.5μLL-1 1-MCP at 0°C for 24h. Following 1-MCP treatment, fruit were stored at 0 or 10°C for 10, 20, or 30d, respectively. A new application technology was tested by applying 1-MCP during forced-air cooling (FAC), reducing the application duration from 24 to 6h without affecting treatment performance. This new 1-MCP application system is compatible with current postharvest handling, rendering it easily adopted by the tree fruit industry. 1-MCP had no detrimental effect on consumer acceptance of low-acid plums ripened properly prior to consumption, but it reduced the acceptance of high acidity plums. Thus, 1-MCP use on plums should avoid cultivars with high acidity and/or plums picked early when fruit have titratable acidity of 0.9% or more. 1-MCP-FAC treatment followed by storage at 10°C is a promising new methodology to avoid chilling temperatures and provide considerable energy savings without reducing postharvest life and consumer quality of low-acid plums. Our results encourage testing this new technology at commercial scale to accurately quantify energy savings and consumer reactions for specific operations and markets. © 2012.","Chilling injury; Cold storage; Forced-air cooling; High acidity; In-store consumer test; Liking; Ripening; Shelf life; Softening","Prunus; Prunus domestica; Prunus salicina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866534990

The initial dose of acetate, under anaerobic conditions varied to achieve different PHA (poly-hydroxyalkanoates) saturation of PAO (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) cells. Increased acetate dosage under anaerobic conditions led to higher phosphate release and increased PHA storage by PAOs and, also, to greater phosphate uptake rates under the following aerobic and/or anoxic conditions. The experimental results also indicated that when organic carbon is limited under anaerobic conditions, more internal glycogen supplementary to polyphosphate cleavage is utilized by the biomass, resulting in less phosphate release and more PHA stored per acetate taken up. In the subsequent aerobic and/or anoxic phase PAOs demonstrate an improved EBPR (enhanced biological phosphorus removal) performance, with regard to PHA consumption per phosphate taken up, for reduced initial biomass PHA content under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. The examination of EBPR biomass under controlled operational conditions, where experimental analysis of the relevant compounds in the bulk phase (PO43-, NO3- and/or O2) in conjunction with the biomass intracellular products (PHA, glycogen), contributes to an improved understanding of the PAOs metabolic behavior, with regard to organic substrate availability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"Anaerobic conditions; Anoxic conditions; Bulk phase; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Experimental analysis; Intracellular products; Operational conditions; Organic substrate; Phosphate release; Phosphate uptake; Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms; Polyphosphates; Bacteria; Denitrification; Metabolism; Volatile fatty acids; Wastewater treatment; Biomass; dissolved oxygen; glycogen; organic carbon; phosphate; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyphosphate; activated sludge; aerobic metabolism; article; bacterial metabolism; bioaccumulation; biomass; biotransformation; denitrifying bacterium; energy yield; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; fluorescence in situ hybridization; nonhuman; priority journal; stoichiometry; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Acetates; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Extracellular Space; Intracellular Space; Kinetics; Oxygen; Phosphates; Phosphorus; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Sewage; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872407028

The proposed technique is applied to design an FGS-PID controller of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) for stabilization of inter-area power system oscillation. Without trial and error, the scale factors, membership functions and control rules of the FGS-PID controller are automatically tuned by a bee colony optimization. With the optimal FGS-PID controller, the PID parameters can be adjusted automatically according to various system operating conditions. As a result, the high robustness of the FGS-PID controller can be expected.

Based on the climatically diverse dataset from the 2004 to 2010 period, the objectives of the work presented here are to characterize the interannual variability in water vapor exchange and to understand the linkage between energy and CO2 exchange from this perennial crop during two extreme growing seasons. Correcting the measured soil heat flux by accounting for the change in heat storage above the heat flux plates helped close the energy balance at this site. Interannual variability in ecosystem processes of energy and CO2 exchange were attributed primarily to marked differences in the amount and distribution of seasonal precipitation. Differences in the phonological development of the crop during seasons with contrasting climatic conditions were reflected in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from the radiation instruments installed on the tower. Wet years were characterized by an even distribution of seasonal precipitation, low to moderate air and soil temperatures, lower solar and net radiation intensities (owing to reduced number of bright sunshine hours and therefore, higher amount of diffuse sky radiation), moderate to saturated soil moisture conditions and lower vapor pressure deficit. These climatic conditions resulted in high bulk surface conductance (gs), high evapotranspiration (ET) and low sensible heat flux with a peak seasonal Bowen ratio (β=0.1). These conditions were favourable for a high uptake of atmospheric CO2. Dry years, on the contrary, were marked by long dry spells during important phases of crop growth, climatic and soil moisture stress leading to high evaporative demand, low gs values, reduced evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux (β=0.3-0.4). On a seasonal basis, the ET losses during a dry year were 13% lower compared to those during a wet year. The corresponding reduction in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), however, was to the extent of 21%. Owing to the ability of this perennial crop to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon into its above- and below-ground biomass, the water use efficiency (defined as the slope of the linear regression of monthly values of GEP against ET) of this cultivation system was found to be 9.1g CO2 per kg of H2O lost as ET. The results stemming from this work further support our earlier conclusions that this bioenergy system is a suitable land use option on drained and abandoned cutover peatlands with a high potential for offsetting CO2 load to the atmosphere. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal environment; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Gross ecosystem productivity; Peatland drainage; Radiation balance","aboveground biomass; air temperature; annual variation; belowground biomass; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; climate change; drainage network; ecosystem response; eddy covariance; energy balance; energy crop; evapotranspiration; grass; growing season; NDVI; net ecosystem production; organic soil; peatland; radiation balance; sensible heat flux; soil moisture; soil temperature; water vapor; Finland; Phalaris; Phalaris arundinacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867063838

Passive cooling is achieved by the use of techniques for solar and heat control, heat amortization and heat dissipation. Modulation of heat gain deals with the thermal storage capacity of the building structure, while heat dissipation techniques deal with the potential for disposal of excess heat of the building to an environmental sink of lower temperature, like the ground, water, and ambient air or sky. The aim of the present paper is to underline and review the recent state of the art technologies for passive cooling dissipation techniques in the built environment and their contribution in the improvement of the indoor environmental quality as well as in the reduction of cooling needs. The paper starts with a short introduction in passive cooling and continues with the analysis of advanced heat dissipation techniques such as ground cooling, evaporative cooling, and night ventilation in the built environment.

Energy optimization, by throttling power consumption, is an essential operational goal. Since processors are the most demanding of the components constituting a server, energy optimization has focused on regulating processor consumption. However, more recently memory and storage are increasingly becoming more demanding, collectively accounting for more than 40% of the overall energy consumption in typical system configurations. We argue that this trend necessitates tracking overall energy consumption rather than focusing on any single component. Although currently only processors expose energy-related controls at a fine granularity, we demonstrate that with a more holistic approach we can obtain significant efficiency benefits. Specifically, our feedback-based controller for Linux detects I/O-intensive phases in workloads, and adjusts processor operating frequencies accordingly, in a more effective manner than the standard CPU governors. © 2013 USENIX Association.

The pilot project plans to implement at Mae Sariang (MSR), Mae Hong Son, Thailand in the next three years. The expected architecture of the Micro-Grid system composes of Distributed Energy Storage System (DESS; Pumped Hydro Storage and Battery Storage) and Micro-Grid master controller. MSR district is served by one distribution feeder from PEA substation, the location is quite far from substation and the feeder runs through the forest. Outage recovery is very difficult from the long distance and trees problem. As a result, the reliability indices, System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), in this area is the highest of Thailand. Then the first objective to deploy the Micro-Grid project is to serve energy to the customers (5 MW of peak load) in area where conventional power system approached cannot satisfy reliability needs, islanding mode. The second objective is to support the intermittent resource (Photo Voltaic; PV 4 MW), intermittent resource integration mode. The third objective is to cut the peak in area which can postpone the distribution feeder overload problem, peak shaving mode. In addition, the expected Micro-Grid system also decreases the distribution system losses and improves the voltage level dramatically. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) will be used for Micro-Grid operation cost management to optimize economic power dispatch. Economic analysis, cost/benefits, is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the project. The procedure is to determine the benefits and savings expected from the project and compare them with the investment costs.

In this work, attempt has been made to demonstrate that logistics techniques can offer a significant reduction in energy and cost. The main objective of this work is to identify and demonstrate possible approaches to improving energy efficiency and reducing operating cost for a dried corn warehouse operator. Three main problems are identified: (i) relatively high fuel consumption for internal transfer process, (ii) low quality of dried corn, and (iii) excess expenditure on outbound transportation. Solutions are proposed and implemented using logistics operations. Improvement is achieved using plant layout and shortest path techniques, resulting in a reduction of almost 50% in energy consumption for the internal transfer process. Installation of an air distributor in the grain storage unit results in a decrease in loss due to poor-quality dried corn from 17% to 10%.

The storage facilities within a RES station enhance its output power “creditability”, since primary energy variations can be effectively compensated, while the available energy becomes controllable and dispatchable by the station or system operator, e.g. with the potential to be time-shifted to the hours of peak demand. In this paper, the concept of a PV-battery station is explored, from an energy efficiency and economic viability perspective.

The Climate Doctrine adopted in 2009 acknowledges the anthropogenic nature of climate change, setting principles and goals for mitigation and adaptation policies. The adoption of the Doctrine coincided with the development of a comprehensive framework for energy efficiency and energy conservation which, if fully implemented, will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation policies should also be urgently formulated, as according to the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, climate change, alongside some bene fi ts, will bring more droughts, fl oods and other extreme events as well as negative consequences for infrastructure, agriculture and other sectors of the economy. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960264173

For >20 years, electronics has been dominated by one material (Si) and one architecture (metal oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), despite the presence of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the use of III-V semiconductors for some specific applications. However, in order to tackle the new challenges in terms of miniaturization, power consumption, power density, and processing speed, new inorganic semiconductor materials (Ge, InP, InGaAs, GaN, SiC, etc.) and new 3D architectures (multiple gates FETs, nanowire TFETs, etc.) are developed and progressively introduced. The two main goals of this revolution are to overcome the current limitations in terms of mobility (in order to increase the operational speed of the devices) and of junction leakage (in order to reduce the power consumption). These new architectures are typically three-dimensional and involve multiple materials. With the continuous decrease of dimensions, they also represent extremely confined volumes into which statistics and quantum effects start to play an increasing role. Beyond the standard logic/memory applications, there is also a very strong increase in More than Moore developments targeting energy (photovoltaic, energy storage), imaging (e.g., quantitative medical imaging), sensor/actuators linked to CMOS base circuitry, biochips, etc. In all these cases, the dopant/carrier distribution still plays a dominant role necessitating adequate 3D fabrication and metrology concepts. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Biochips; Electric power utilization; Gallium alloys; III-V semiconductors; Indium alloys; Indium phosphide; Medical imaging; Metals; Microelectronics; MOS devices; MOSFET devices; Oxide semiconductors; Quantum electronics; Semiconducting indium gallium arsenide; Semiconducting indium phosphide; Semiconductor alloys; Semiconductor junctions; Si-Ge alloys; Silicon carbide; Wide band gap semiconductors; Bipolar junction transistors (BJT); Current limitation; Inorganic semiconductors; Junction leakages; Multiple materials; Nanoelectronic devices; Processing speed; Quantitative medical imaging; Bipolar transistors",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948814427

This problem is often solved by installation of air-conditioning that leads to increase of energy consumption. A lot of attention has therefore been paid to other means of temperature control in buildings such as night-time ventilation or/and building integrated heat storage. For thermal energy storage can be considered sensible or latent heat storage. The latent heat storage technology uses phase change materials (PCMs) as a storage medium. Phase change materials can store large amount of heat in a narrow temperature interval around their melting range. There are many ways of integration of the PCMs into building structures, e.g. penetration of porous building materials, macro encapsulation, micro encapsulation and shape stabilized PCMs. Structures with integrated PCMs exhibit higher thermal storage capacity and allow to use directly renewable energy sources for heating, e.g. solar radiation. Team of investigators at Faculty of Civil engineering BUT deals with the design and evaluation of PCMs integrated in building structures. In experiments are used commercial PCMs that are available in European market. The current experiments use gypsum plaster with microencapsulated PCMs as storage medium. The activation of heat storage core is provided by the system of capillary tubes with cooled water. For the water cooling system is utilized off-peak electricity and thus system contributes to the operating cost savings.

Energy storage technologies can be used in a wide variety of applications to address concerns by providing a valuable source of ancillary services2 and flexibility to the energy system, but storage deployment is restricted by high capital costs, inherent round-trip losses and market and regulatory barriers. Pumped hydro is the most common storage technology at present. Other storage technologies, including mechanical and chemical conversion devices, struggle to compete with conventional electricity system technologies in cost and performance. However, in certain cases where the competing technologies are expensive, the value of storage can outweigh its cost. Electricity system concerns may create new opportunities for storage technologies in the development of a decarbonised electricity system, enabling increased levels of variable renewable deployments, while ensuring secure and reliable system operation.

It not only can operate bi-directionally, it can also provide three different working modes: buck, boost and buck-boost modes. The buck and boost mode can provide lower and higher voltage transfer ratio than traditional Buck and Boost converters respectively. Its buck-boost mode can provide positive output voltage.

The pump was powered by hot air-water vapour produced from a flat plate collector coupled with the auxiliary electric heater substituting for an evacuated tube solar collector. The solar water pump system comprised a flat plate solar collector (SC), an overhead tank (OT), a hot water storage tank (ST), an electric heater tank (HT), a liquid piston tank (LT), and a one-way valve for water circulation control. One metre discharge head and 1-3 m suction heads were tested. The LT was filled with the 10% air and 90% water. The pump could operate at the LT temperature of about 98 oC. It was found that, for the suction heads of 1 and 3 m, the total pump efficiency was around 0.0140-0.0301%, and the thermal efficiency was around 32.5-36.3%, respectively. The pump could suck around 7-8 l water from a well in a cycle. The energy inputs were 18 MJ of which 55% was from the auxiliary electric heater and about 45% from solar energy, during 2-h period. The average temperature in storage tank (ST) was around 42.9-46.7 oC sufficiently high for residential use. It was concluded that the suction heads affected the pump efficiency. Increasing air into the system could reduce some energy consumption. Moreover, the pump of 240 l capacity was tested. The energy inputs were only taken from auxiliary electric heater. System operation was controlled by hand. Suction heads of 1, 2, 3 and 5 m were tested. It was found that the pump could suck water of about 80-90% of pump volume. In addition, temperature, pressure and water pumped per cycle were presented.","Flat plate solar collector; Heater; Hot water; Hybrid; Thermal water pump","Air; Efficiency; Electric heat treatment; Electric heating; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Heating equipment; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Water vapor; Flat-plate solar collectors; Heater; Hot water; Hybrid; Thermal waters; Pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903625381

The deployment of these computer systems in large numbers and in very dense configurations in a data center had resulted in very high power densities at room level. These computer systems are deployed in a rack. A standard 2-meter high rack can accommodate an equivalent of 34 thin desktop systems. If the maximum power dissipation from each system is 300W, a single rack in a data center can be assumed to dissipate 7.2 KW. A data center can have hundreds of these 7.2 KW racks. Due to such high heat loads, designing the air conditioning system in a data center using simple energy balance is no longer adequate. Moreover, the data center design cannot rely on intuitive design of air distribution. It is necessary to model the airflow and temperature distribution in a data center. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics model of a prototype data center is presented to make the case for such modeling. The present paper is devoted to investigate the air flow patterns, temperatures and relative humidity in large compute density data centers. Computational fluid dynamics software is utilized to simulate the data center flow pattern. The paper used the simulation techniques as embedded in the commercially available CFD code (FLUENT 6.2).

Among them, energy storage could contribute significantly in recovering wind energy excess that will in the absence of other facilitating measures (e.g. sufficient cross-border energy trading) normally appear during off-peak load demand periods. At the same time however, energy storage suggests capital intensive investments that hinder market integration for such systems. In view of the above, a novel operation strategy is currently proposed for large-scale energy storage systems used to recover wind energy amounts and deliver them back to the electricity grid in times of peak demand. Furthermore, a socioeconomic cost-benefit model is developed in order to value such a strategy through State support. In this context, socially just feed-in-tariffs are produced for both pumped hydro and Na-S energy storage and are then compared with the respective system electricity production cost. Based on this comparison, investing opportunities in energy storage are investigated under increased amounts of wind energy excess expected in the future.","Battery storage; Feed-in-tariffs; Production cost; Pumped hydro storage; Wind power","Commerce; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Investments; Battery storage; Capital intensive investment; Cost-benefit models; Electricity production costs; Energy storage systems; Feed-in-tariffs; Market integration; Production cost; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903462540

Recently, gypsum plasterboards with incorporated paraffin-based PCM blends have become commercially available. In the high temperature environment developed during a fire, the paraffins, which exhibit relatively low boiling points, may evaporate and, escaping through the gypsum plasterboard's porous structure, emerge to the fire region, where they may ignite, thus adversely affecting the fire resistance characteristics of the building. Aiming to assess the fire safety behaviour of such building materials, an extensive experimental and computational analysis is performed. The fire behaviour and the main thermo-physical physical properties of PCM-enhanced gypsum plasterboards are investigated, using a variety of standard tests and devices (Scanning Electron Microscopy, Thermo Gravimetric Analysis, Cone Calorimeter). The obtained results are used to develop a dedicated numerical model, which is implemented in a CFD code. CFD simulations are validated using measurements obtained in a cone calorimeter. In addition, the CFD code is used to simulate an ISO 9705 room exposed to fire conditions, demonstrating that PCM addition may indeed adversely affect the fire safety of a gypsum plasterboard clad building. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013.",,"Energy efficiency; Fire resistance; Fires; Gypsum; Heat storage; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Building energy efficiency; Computational analysis; Computational technique; Cone calorimeter; Fire safety assessment; High-temperature environment; Porous structures; Resistance characteristics; Computational fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903443893

Materials and methods: Composite resin disks, 6 mm diameter, 3 mm thickness were prepared from Filtec Z350 XT, Tetric EvoCeram and Filtec Z250 XT. Specimens fr/8om each material were tested after aging with Red Bull, Bison and Power Horse energy drinks and distilled water as a control. Specimens were stored at 37°C in dark containers for 1, 3 and 6 months. Surface roughness Ra was assessed using a surface scanning interferometry before and after each storage period. Surface roughness differences ΔRa and Ra among specimens were measured. Mean values were statistically analyzed using multiple repeated measured (ANOVA), variance and multiple comparisons of the mean values were done with Bonferroni test, with p < 0.05 as significance level. Results: The surface roughness degradation change ΔRa and Ra value before and after occurred by Red Bull, Bison and Power Horse energy drinks was significantly different for all tested materials at all three times p < 0.05. All specimens showed increase in surface roughness changes after aging periods of 1, 3 and 6 months.

Conclusion: Energy drinks used in this study had surface degradation effect on the tested composite resin materials. The surface roughness increased with aging time however, it was clinically acceptable in all test groups after 6 months. The effect of energy drinks solutions on the surface roughness parameter of resin composites depends on type of solution and its acidity contents.","Aging; Energy drinks; Nanofilled composite resins; Surface roughness","dental material; filtek Z350; nanocomposite; resin; resin cement; Tetric EvoCeram; water; chemistry; classification; energy drink; human; interferometry; materials testing; pH; surface property; temperature; time; Composite Resins; Dental Materials; Energy Drinks; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Interferometry; Materials Testing; Nanocomposites; Surface Properties; Temperature; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903133291

Assuming that transmitting data from a base station to a mobile user consumes more energy than transmitting data between two mobile users, we show that it can be beneficial to use redundant storage to ensure that data files stay available to the community even if some of the storing users leave the network. We derive a tractable closed-form equation stating when redundancy should be used in order to minimize the expected energy consumption of data retrieval. We find that replication is the preferred method of adding redundancy as opposed to regenerating codes.

Operational policies of storage devices considered in literature focus solely on network balance. Here, the consumed network capacity is also considered. A linear network model with uncertain power and storage elements is supplemented with three possible models of line losses. Policy computation is formulated in each case as a convex optimization problem. The different solutions are compared in terms of computational complexity and policy structure. A single solution shows preference for local energy storage and remains computationally efficient. Other solutions either do not respond to uncertainty or attempt to reduce uncertainty using unnecessary power transmissions.

However, this consumes energy, induces transmission costs and results in unnecessarily long time-to-first-fix. These issues can be alleviated using mobile-based, or offline, mode. In this mode the device carries a subset of the global radio map in memory for fast positioning without data connection. The challenge of this approach is the large size of the offline radio map that needs to be downloaded, stored and updated periodically in the mobile device. This paper presents a method to find the significant APs in the global radio map and proposes using only those in offline positioning in order to compress the size of the required offline radio map. We also propose a method to further compress the size of the offline radio map by hashing the globally unique AP BSSIDs into locally unique shortened BSSIDs.

Incorporating storage devices with RES is technically an effective means to mitigate this concern by allowing fluctuating RES to be as stable as traditional power plants. Storage is an even more consumer-friendly solution with greater control over electricity consumption time and price compared to e.g. demand-side management which offers limited control over the price for end users. It can also contribute to lower the electricity price, peak-shave the demand, defer upgrade investments, provide ride-through solution for (momentary) faults, contribute to voltage/frequency control, increase the share of green energy and thus reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, improve power quality by reducing harmonic distortions and voltage sags/surges, facilitate utilization of more efficient off-peak generation units, etc. This paper assesses the technical applicability and economical viability of different storage devices to the Belgian power network, focusing on the structure of the Belgian electricity market.

The input substrate contained cattle slurry, corn silage, haylage, rye grain for 12 months and for 14 months the input substrate was without the rye grain content.

Liveness, reliability and conformance to SLAs may all be achieved by moving a VM that creates excessive work from its current physical machine (PM) to a less busy node. Despite its promising features, live migration is an expensive operation in terms of resources. The situation gets further exacerbated when the movement involves PMs working off different file-systems which is often the case in shared-nothing IaaS-cloud infrastructures. In this paper, we suggest an approach that adapts the migration operation based on the I/O activity of the originating-VM. We introduce LiveFS, a FUSE-file system which traps all I/Os and helps determine how to best ship virtual disk segments across PMs in a share-nothing IaaS-cloud. Through prototyping and experimentation, we show that LiveFS can improve the shipment of VMs for diverse types of workloads. In particular, LiveFS succeeds in reducing the Total Migration Time by up to 64% compared to the ""pre-copy"" live migration technique. Furthermore during migration, we attain up-to 19% less I/O-delay if compared to the ""post-copy"" live-migration approach. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud Storage; Distributed Systems; Share-Nothing IaaS Cloud; Storage","Energy storage; Ships; Cloud storages; Distributed systems; Iaas clouds; Live migrations; Load-Balancing; Shared nothing; Total migration time; Vm migrations; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899712930

However, in order to widely integrate microgrids within the distribution networks, a shift in the philosophy of interconnecting them with the utility grid seems necessary. A grid-connected microgrid is required to possess Faults Ride-Through (FRT) capabilities, as well as provide ancillary services during abnormal grid operation. In this paper, a control strategy for improving the ability of an inverter-based microgrid to ride though symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults is proposed. The microgrid is formed of several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), which utilize Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) as primary renewable energy source, each combined with a Supercapacitor Energy Storage System (SCESS). During balanced and unbalanced grid voltage sags, aim of the proposed control strategy is to keep the microgrid connected to the grid, according to the FRT requirements, while maintaining an acceptable voltage profile within the common ac bus. Each DER is controlled to support the voltage within the microgrid by injecting reactive power, without any physical communication. During unbalanced utility voltage conditions, the DERs operate collectively in order to compensate the undesirable negative and zero sequence voltage components. Thus, a set of balanced three-phase voltages is provided within the common ac bus. Simulation results demonstrate that the microgrid can ride through heavily balanced and unbalanced utility voltage sags, while supplying its loads with a high quality voltage profile. © 2013 IEEE.","Dynamic voltage support; Fault Ride-Through; Microgrids; Negative sequence control; Supercapacitor Energy Storage System Introduction; Wind Turbine Generator","Capacitors; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Turbogenerators; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Wind turbines; Dynamic voltage support; Fault ride-through; Micro grid; Negative sequence; Supercapacitor energy storages; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899123030

However, the inevitable problems of DFIG wind turbine are low voltage ride through (LVRT) due to the occurrence of faults as well as the power fluctuation. To overcome both problems, a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit which is able to provide fast control of active and reactive power, can be used. This paper applies a SMES unit to enhance LVRT performance and alleviate the power fluctuation of DFIG wind turbine in the DC microgrid. The SMES circuit is mainly composed of the DC chopper.

However, such incentives are disappearing and the need of market revitalization is apparent. Providing energy storage in PV installations is considered as an attractive option from a technical point of view, since it may help reduce uncertainties and make such power source dispatchable. However, energy storage is not attractive to investors yet. In fact, several factors should be taken into consideration when performing a techno-economic analysis of an energy storage option in a PV installation. Such factors include, for example, the minimum allowable State Of Charge (SOC) and capital costs related to energy and power capacity. In this paper, we propose to incorporate clustering techniques when storage options are evaluated in a PV installation. With this approach, the basic input to calculations (i.e. the PV power output) is not simulated from archive meteorological data, but the actual power produced is taken into account for existing PVs. Historical data of power production from a PV station are grouped into clusters with representative power curves called centroids. In this way, evaluating storage options becomes less time consuming and simpler. This paper takes real data from a PV installation and formulates clusters using several techniques. After a comparison of the methods used, a discussion of how such clustering formulation may be used for optimization problems is presented. © 2013 IEEE.","clustering; energy storage; optimization; Photovoltaic power","Digital storage; Economic analysis; Meteorology; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; clustering; Clustering techniques; Meteorological data; Optimization problems; Photovoltaic power; PV installations; Renewable energy source; Techno-Economic analysis; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899077253

Appropirate voltage and reactive power control is provided by the D-STATCOM and the SCESS provides the active power required to minimize the power fluctuation from the wind. A vector control strategy was developed for active and reactive power control between the D-STATCOM/ SCESS and the Point of common coupling (PCC). The control system developed has two independent modes. One mode controls the D-STATCOM and the other the DC-DC Converter. The DC-DC converter is a buck-boost converter to exchange active power between the SCESS and the PCC through the DC link capacitor of the D-STATCOM. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was tested in MATLAB/SIMULINK and a laboratory prototype. © 2013 IEEE.","D-STATCOM; Fluctuation; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; DC-DC converters; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; HVDC power transmission; Reactive power; Wind power; Active and reactive power controls; Distribution static compensator; DSTATCOM; Fluctuation; Super capacitor; Supercapacitor energy storages; Voltage and reactive power control; Wind energy conversion system; Electric power factor correction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899057791

The special geometry of these thin-walled members of high slenderness and their non linear behaviour require specific rules for a successful and accurate modeling. The design of these non-traditional steel structures is even more complicated in seismic zones, where they must be able to withstand horizontal and vertical dynamic forces. Furthermore, the analysis must represent the additional limit state of the fall of pallets, which would lead to the subsequent damage to goods, people and to the structure itself. Bracing systems are widely used to enhance the stiffness of the structures under seismic loads. Braced systems exhibit, however, unwanted phenomena, such as torsional dynamic modes. On the other hand, unbraced systems have translational modes and uncoupled behaviour, but they are very flexible. In this paper, the earthquake performance of such structures is investigated using pushover analyses. The work presented, is a part of a research project which is carried out within the framework of the European Research Program SEISRACKS 2. Detailed analyses of components using finite elements software are performed in order to clarify their failure and post-failure behaviour. Finally, a comparison of the available q factor and the used value during the design takes place to verify the efficiency of the design procedure.","Behaviour factor; Braced; Pallets; Pushover; Racking; Racks; Storage; Unbraced","Civil engineering; Computational methods; Design; Energy storage; Engineering geology; Pallets; Research; Seismology; Structural dynamics; Behaviour factors; Braced; Pushover; Racking; Racks; Unbraced; Seismic design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899008133

ALHN-LR consists of improved Lagrange relaxation (ILR) and augmented Lagrange Hopfield network (ALHN). For solving the HTS problem, the proposed method applies enhanced ILR for finding thermal unit scheduling, ALHN for solving constrained economic dispatch (CED), and heuristic search-based algorithms in earlier papers for committing hydro and pumped-storage units, repairing ramp rate, emission, and transmission constraint violations, and refining the obtained result. The proposed ALHN which is a continuous Hopfield network with its energy function based on augmented Lagrangian function can properly handle both equality and inequality constraints in CED problem. The proposed ALHN-LR is tested on a hydrothermal system with 17 thermal, two hydro and two pumped-storage units, and the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system over the 168-hour schedule time horizon.

In desert climate, where naturally occurring fresh water is scarce, seawater or brackish water from wells is often more abundant. Since water desalination approaches are energy intensive, a strong motivation exists for the design of cost-effective desalination systems that utilize the abundant renewable energy resource; solar energy. This paper presents an optimization model of a solar-powered reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system. RO systems rely on pumping salty water at high pressure through semi-permeable membrane modules. Under sufficient pressure, water molecules will flow through the membranes, leaving salt ions behind, and are collected in a fresh water stream. Since RO system are primarily powered via electricity, the system model incorporates photovoltaic (PV) panels, and battery storage for smoothing out fluctuations in the PV power output, as well as allowing system operation for a number of hours after sunset. Design variables include sizing of the PV solar collectors, battery storage capacity, as well as the sizing of the RO system membrane module and power elements. The objective is to minimize the cost of unit volume produced fresh water, subject to constraints on production capacity.

Lately, though, energy efficiency in buildings is strongly related with the increasing need to utilise renewable energy sources either solar thermal energy or wind and solar generated electricity for heating or cooling applications. For that effort to become feasible and practical a different approach in the perception of heat emission indoors, thermal comfort, energy efficiency and thermal energy storage is required. Hydronic radiant building surfaces provide that different approach since they achieve thermal comfort by heating directly the building and the people and not the indoor air and in addition, they utilise low temperature heating water that increases the efficiency of solar thermal collectors and electricity driven air to water heat pumps while they present the feature of thermal energy storage embedded in their construction. Thus, by using such equipment a totally different view on the building as a system is possible where the building elements themselves act as heat emitters and thermal energy storage facilities. In this chapter, after an introduction to the main features of radiant heating systems and the perception of thermal comfort, several hydronic radiant building surfaces (floors, walls and ceilings) are compared with common convective heat emitters using as criteria the energy consumption and thermal comfort achieved. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These resources are offered as Web services deployed on the cloud. The coordination of the interactions between these services is one of the key challenges of cloud architecture. Any failings in these services could lead to lack of availability, which may violate Service Level Agreements causing financial penalties, customer dissatisfaction, or lack of energy. Therefore, it is essential, from a performance perspective, to propose a technique that will insure on-line coordination of services deployed on the cloud. This paper introduces a coordinating service known as a Protocol service. The approach harnesses the capability of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) to automate the creation and integration of Protocol services, which are deployed into the cloud in order to avoid nonavailability or overuse of services. As a proof of concept, the method presented in this paper is implemented as a plugin that automatically produces new Protocol services and integrates them with existing services; it also configures the cloud interface to forward requests to Protocol services. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Energy consumption; Model driven architecture; Quality of service; Web services","Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Network architecture; Quality of service; Web services; Websites; Cloud architectures; Customer dissatisfaction; Emergent technologies; Financial penalty; Management architectures; Model driven architectures; Proof of concept; Service Level Agreements; Software architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894140710

Utilisation of low temperature process heat from capture plant, air separation unit or CO2 compression in district heating system and/or industrial solutions offers significant potential to increase overall efficiency and feasibility of CCS processes. The effects of CCS on the local CHP systems were included within the studied system boundaries in order to evaluate the economics and emissions from investor's (local energy company) point of view. Effect of CCS on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operation economics of the CCS cases are compared to the reference system with varying parameters of operation. Regarding the GHG emissions, besides the site emissions, the main effects on global GHG emissions are also taken into account by using system modeling and streamlined LCA. In the case studies the whole CCS chain, including CO2 capture, processing, transport and storage, was included. Carbon capture processes were modeled using Aspen Plus and Prosim process modeling software and the results were used in CCS plant economics toolkit (CC-Skynet™) to estimate CO2 emission reduction possibilities and carbon abatement costs. Studied case studies included three main applications which were studied in different operational situations. The properties of reference plants and CHP systems are based on the real operational CHP units and steel mill in Finland. The first presented application is retrofit of about 1000 MWfuel CHP plant with post combustion capture technology. Natural gas fired GTCC plant is part of relatively large district heating network including also other CHP units in the same network. The plant is situated on the coastal area of Southern Finland and it emits approximately 1.3 Mtn CO2 / year. The second application is a greenfield about 500 MWfuel CHP plant situated on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and emitting approximately 1.5 Mtn CO2 / year. The plant is based on a modern CFB-boiler which is equipped with oxyfuel technology in the CCS case. The studied fuel-shares with and without CCS consisted of pure biomass, pure peat and biomass-peat co-firing. In the study it is assumed that the economic incentive for negative CO2 emission is included in EU ETS for Bio-CCS. The plant is connected to the existing district heating network where older CHP plant already exists. Another plant and limited district heat consumption in the area limits the benefits obtained from CCS heat recovery. The third application is an integrated steel mill situated on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and emitting approximately 4.0 Mtn CO2 / year altogether. The mill is retrofitted for post combustion capture and implications of different capture amounts, different solvents and process integration levels are compared to the base case steel production with varying operational parameters. Process heat is utilized also as district heat but heat consumption in the district heat network is smaller than the amount of recoverable process heat in the mill. The results showed that significant improvements can be achieved by CHP in plants utilizing CCS, especially in the case of oxy-fuel. The feasibility of CCS is heavily dependent not only on the characteristics of the facility and the operational environment but also on the chosen system boundaries and assumptions. In combined heat and power plants, major improvements can be obtained with heat integration, especially, in the production of district heat. In the near future particularly large, new and flexible CHP plants, which can burn coal, biomass or peat, are seen as promising candidates for CCS in Finland.","Biomass; CCS; CHP; Feasibility; GTCC; Steel mill",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893083964

This situation in the energy market has bolstered the interest in the development of heating and cooling systems utilizing renewable energy sources, especially solar energy. The utilization of renewable energy sources in residential and office buildings very often requires an effective way of thermal energy storage. Thermal energy storage is an essential part of most of the solar heating and cooling systems. The solar gains through the transparent part of the building envelope can reduce energy consumption for heating during the heating season thus saving the energy from conventional heat sources (electricity, natural gas, coal). On the other hand, solar heat gains through the building envelope contribute to overheating in summer or during the sunny days in spring and autumn. From this point of view the energy storage capacity of building structures plays an important role in indoor temperature control in a building. That means that building structures can be employed to store solar heat during the sunny and warm part of the day and release it at night when the outdoor temperature decreases. This approach is applicable only on sunny days with relatively high outdoor temperatures during the day and low outdoor temperatures at night. The sensible heat storage capacity of common building structures depends on the weight of the structure, its thermal capacity and the temperature difference between the start and the end of the heat storage process. Because of the thermal comfort requirements that limit the indoor temperature swing during the day the thermal capacity of common building materials is usually insufficient to provide thermal storage for this purpose.

Multi-layer memory hierarchies are used to reduce the energy consumption, but also to enhance the system performance. The energy-aware optimization of a hierarchical memory architecture implies the addition of layers of smaller and faster memories used to store the intensely-used data, in order to better exploit the non-uniform memory accesses. This paper presents an electronic design automation (EDA) methodology for energy-efficient signal assignment to the memory layers of a hierarchical storage organization. This approach starts from the behavioral specification of a given application and, employing algebraic techniques specific to the data-dependence analysis used in modern compilers, identifies those parts of (multidimensional) arrays intensely accessed. Tested on a two-layer memory hierarchy, this EDA methodology led to savings of storage energy consumption from 40 % to over 60 % relative to the energy used in the case of flat memory designs. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Data transfer; Design; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; Signal processing; Algebraic techniques; Behavioral specification; Electronic design automation; Energy-aware optimizations; Hierarchical storage; Multidimensional signal processing; Multimedia processing; Non uniform memory access; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890891299

In this paper, a power factor correction (PFC) converter is proposed to solve the problems that appear when using LED lamps, such as reducing harmonic currents and reshaping the input current to be a sinusoidal waveform without using line voltage sensor, so the total cost can be reduced and increasing the efficiency. Thus, this technique is considered a simple and easy method which reduces the number of sensors required and achieves the noise isolation between the power circuit and the controller. Also, the proposed method is implemented using a zero-crossing processing, which allows a greater accuracy than other methods. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed circuit which show that the proposed control method has low inrush input current, high power factor (near unity), and fast dynamic response under transient operation. Also, a sinusoidal current waveform under a non-sinusoidal input voltage condition can be achieved. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.","LED lamp; PFC; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Voltage sensorless; Zero-crossing detector","Data storage equipment; Light emitting diodes; Power converters; Fast dynamic response; LEd lamps; Power factor correction converters; Reducing harmonic current; Sensorless; Sinusoidal waveforms; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Zero-crossing detectors; Electric power factor correction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889680810

We present a detailed study of the structural evolution of FLGO and also non-oxidized graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) during electrochemical treatment. Two phases of the process can be traced tentatively in the case of FLGO by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and both ex situ and in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first phase is irreversible and dominated by a fast removal of oxygen-bearing functional groups accompanied by a structural ordering, while the second phase shows only a slow irreversible progressive reduction and the major changes in the Raman spectra caused by lattice expansion/contraction upon doping or a mild oxidation/reduction are reversible this time. In GNP, no irreversible reduction is observed, i.e. the first phase is absent, leaving only the reversible variations traceable in the Raman spectra. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

One of the benefits of introducing electric and hybridelectric vehicles into the fleet is the reduction of exhaust and to a lesser extent evaporative emissions from vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. Such reductions are often based on average emissions rates of the regulated pollutants. In reality, electric vehicles are being introduced in a rather selective manner, with preference to low speed, short distance urban trips, due to energy storage limitations. As a coincidence, during such operating regimes, the internal combustion engines are at their worst not only in terms of efficiency and emissions of regulated pollutants, but, more importantly, in terms of the health effects caused by these emissions. Deployment of electric drive vehicles in congested urban areas, where it appears most advantageous technically and economically, is therefore expected to have relatively high benefits to human health due to reduced exhaust emissions. Current patterns of electric drive deployment therefore already appear to be close to optimal in terms of their benefits to air quality. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",,"Air quality; Fleet operations; Internal combustion engines; Optimization; Pollution; Vehicles; Electric-drive vehicles; Evaporative emission; Hybrid-electric vehicles; Operating regimes; Prague , Czech Republic; Regulated pollutants; Storage limitation; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Electric drives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887477879

As Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus) tend to aggregate in order to feed around these reefs, energy profiling and trophic markers were applied to study their feeding ecology in a wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea. The proximate composition (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed significantly between liver and muscle tissue but not between fish species or between their potential prey species. Atlantic cod showed to consume more energy than pouting. The latter had a higher overall energy reserve and can theoretically survive twice as long on the available energy than cod. In autumn, both fish species could survive longer on their energy than in spring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in high concentrations in fish liver. The prey species Jassa and Pisidia were both rich in EPA while Jassa had a higher DHA content than Pisidia.Energy profiling supported the statement that wind farm artificial reefs are suitable feeding ground for both fish species.

Considering energy networks and systems, improvements can be achieved by optimizing the structure of the energy chains and distribution networks. For instance, in the case of district heating, it is possible to find an optimal choice of energy supply and design of piping networks to provide the energy required by the customers. Additionally, heat storages and local small-scale energy contributions from e.g. heat pumps could provide benefits and should be taken into consideration. The complexity of the optimization problem increases when the choices of technologies and capacities as well as the network topologies need to be considered. Furthermore, a level of intricacy is added by the large differences in energy demand and temperature conditions between day and night and different seasons. A mixed-integer linear programming model for optimizing distributed energy systems, which takes into account the above mentioned aspects, is being developed and is presented herein.

The use of power conversion system (PCS) is very common in the aforementioned areas. A cascaded control scheme based on four proportional-integral (PI) controllers is widely used in the control of the PCS unit. Setting the parameters of the four cascaded PI controllers simultaneously is cumbersome, especially when the application is in the area of electrical power system which is difficult to express using a mathematical model or transfer function due to its nonlinear properties. This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the cascaded controller of the PCS unit using Taguchi method. To apply the design parameters obtained from Taguchi method, a renewable energy application is chosen where a variable-speed wind turbine generator system is connected to the power grid through two back-to-back PCS units. The effectiveness of the designed parameters using Taguchi method is then compared with that obtained using response surface methodology and genetic algorithm (RSM-GA) method under the grid fault condition. © 2012 IEEE.","Frequency converter; Genetic algorithm; Optimum design of proportional-integral (PI) controller; Renewable energy; Response surface methodology; Taguchi method; Wind energy conversion system","Flexible AC transmission system; Power conversion systems; Proportional integral controllers; Renewable energies; Renewable energy applications; Response surface methodology; Variable-speed wind turbine; Wind energy conversion system; Electric power transmission networks; Electric properties; Frequency converters; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical models; Power electronics; Surface properties; Taguchi methods; Two term control systems; Wind power; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886386568

A method of integrating the voltage-current dynamics of the asynchronous and synchronous generators in the multimachine system has been proposed. Decoupled real and reactive power control of supercapacitor energy storage device interfaced through a STATCOM has been implemented. The supercapacitor compensates any unbalance in real power during a disturbed condition, while the STATCOM caters for the reactive needs. Dynamic behavior of the wind generator has been simulated under very low voltage conditions for both the single machine and multimachine system configurations. The studies demonstrate that the supercapacitor STATCOM energy storage system can provide significant low voltage withstand capability for reasonable durations.

Therefore, KevlarTMreinforced benzoxazine-urethane alloys as ballistic impact resistance composites were developed in this research. The polybenzoxazine alloy composites were fabricated by compression molding at 200°C and 5 MPa by a compression molder. The amount of urethane fraction in the alloy matrix was ranging from 0-40wt% while the fibercontent was kept constant at 80wt%. The mechanical properties of the matrix alloys and their Kevlar™ fiber composites were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis and universal testing machine. The results revealed that storage modulus at room temperature of the composites was reduced from 16.82 GPa when using the neat polybenzoxazine as a matrix to the value of 11.89 GPa at 40wt% of urethane content in the alloy matrix. Moreover, the more urethane in the alloy matrix resulted in lower flexural modulus of the Kevlar™composites i.e. 22 GPa when using the neat polybenzoxazine as a matrix to the value of 12 GPa when using 40wt% of urethane in the alloy matrix. Interestingly, glass transitiontemperature (Tg) obtained from the maximum peak of the loss modulus was observed to be in the range of 187-247°C, which was significantly higher than those of the two parent polymers. Furthermore, the activation energy of the alloys was found to increase with increasing urethane content, which corresponded to the observed Tgvalue enhancement. The observed synergism in Tg of Kevlar™reinforced benzoxazine-urethane was an outstanding characteristic for a wide range of applications, which requires high thermal stability.","Ballistic armor; Benzoxazine; Fiber-reinforcement; Mechanical properties; Urethane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885200398

The DR control algorithm proposed rests on the Linear Programming (LP) approach. The objective is to minimize the overall energy cost without deteriorating the thermal comfort. The optimization is based on the dynamic pricing that follows power exchange prices. Nevertheless, any price signal can be set by aggregator/retailer companies enabling them to obtain certain objectives as long as the thermal comfort requirement is not violated. We perform a case study to investigate the effect of degree of storage on the flexibility of electric storage space heating load control and to analyze the impact of storage losses and demand uncertainty on the DR control optimality. The simulation results verify the optimization model.

Evaporative cooling systems are considered to be efficient and environmentally friendly. This paper studies the application of PCMs to an industrial Evaporative cooling system to enable the capture and storage of night-time sensible free-cooling, as a means of reducing energy costs and improving demand-side management. The stored cooling is subsequently utilised in the cooling water system during a day-time peak demand to achieve the required cooling capacity at the required temperature, resulting in a reduction of the day-time refrigeration requirements. A computer model has been created using Matlab/Simulink, to simulate the operation with and without the PCM. The PCM, Chiller and Circulation Pump were simulated using manufacturer's data. The Cooling Tower performance was approximated from historical weather data and recorded electrical data. The output of the model demonstrates that the system is functional and successfully achieves a 67% reduction in chiller peak-time operation.

The attractiveness depends on the subsidy systems (if existing), the electricity price and the purchase cost of a PV installation and a battery system. Since the electricity price may not remain constant during the lifetime of the storage system, a financial cash flow calculation is needed including discount rate and inflation. In this research the optimal PV-battery system is determined as a function of the remuneration (discerning a subsidised region, a ""market"" price region and no fees at all), the investment year (2012, 2017 and 2021) and the electricity price increase rate (0%, 4%, 6%) (including the general inflation rate). The analysis is based on available battery energy storage systems on the market and on real household measurement data. All these degrees of freedom secure the accuracy of the analysis. The article shows also the battery throughput cost with a direct comparison to the electricity cost. It becomes clear that batteries can already be cost-effective today without subsidies and irrespective of the electricity price increase, but without a return on investment if the electricity price does not increase more than the inflation. An investor cannot recommend batteries today. However, if the electricity price increases with 4% than batteries become quickly attractive and do not need subsidies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Batteries; Cash flow analysis; Economical analysis; Electric energy storage; Photovoltaic system","Commerce; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electricity; Energy storage; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar cells; Battery energy storage systems; Cash flow analysis; Economical analysis; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; Photovoltaic systems; PV installations; Costs; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; photovoltaic system; price dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883053301

Methanol and ethanol are compatible with the existing fuelling and distribution infrastructure and are easily stored in a vehicle. They can be used in internal combustion engines with only minor adjustments and have the potential to increase the efficiency and decrease noxious emissions compared to gasoline engines. In addition, methanol can be synthesized from a wide variety of sources, including renewably produced hydrogen in combination with atmospheric CO2. Presently, during the production of ethanol or methanol a dehydration step is always applied. This step accounts for a significant part of the entire production process' energy consumption and thus, from an economical point of view, methanol and ethanol could become more interesting alternative fuels if the costs related with dehydration could be reduced. Also, methanol and ethanol are prone to absorb water when they are exposed to the atmosphere for a considerable amount of time, for example during transport or storage. The present study gives insights into the advantages that could exist with methanol-water blends and compares the brake thermal efficiencies and engine-out emissions from a production-type four-cylinder SI gasoline engine running on gasoline, pure methanol and methanol-water blends. Methanol-water blends of 2.5% v/v, 5% v/v and 10% v/v water are tested. It is shown that the brake thermal efficiency does not differ significantly for all methanol fuels and is still higher than the efficiency on gasoline. NO x emissions are reduced substantially for the fuels with higher water content.

The analytical properties of these polynomials are exploited to allow the accurate computation of the derivatives of the Green's function as well as the Green's function itself. For lossy materials, the proposed computation strategy is provably robust.

The plant consisted of a pre-cooler in the first stage that utilised ground water as a cooling medium and an ice bank that provides ice chilled water for the second cooling stage. The control system comprised of two proportional integral derivative controllers applied to each cooling stage in tandem. The set point of the first controller was the desired milk pre-cooling temperature while the set point of the second controller was the desired final milk temperature. Eight different precooling set points (13°C-20°C) were tested for feedback and feedback-feedforward controller configurations. Selection of low temperature pre-cooling set points resulted in larger volumes of ground water being consumed in the first stage per unit milk in comparison to the selection of higher temperature set points (three times higher). However, low pre-cooling temperatures resulted in less ice storage utilisation and therefore less power consumption. Introduction of a feedforward loop to the controllers reduced the disturbance from the varying milk flow and by doing so reduced the final milk temperature deviation from the set point. Optimum water utilisation rates were calculated for varying water cost at the current price of electricity. These points represent the ideal combination of ground water and power consumption per unit milk to produce the most financially efficient means of cooling. Potential cost reductions of up to 34.5% through the selection of the ideal water rates were discovered. © 2013 IAgrE.",,"Cooling; Cost reduction; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedback; Groundwater; Ice; Milking machines; Proportional control systems; Temperature; Two term control systems; Cooling control; Cooling plants; Feed-forward controllers; Feedforward loops; Low temperatures; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Temperature deviation; Water and energies; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880345659

Water level overtops El-Salam Pump Station (2) and banks upstream it. Flooding then takes place as Wadi El Noqra Canal, Egypt. This necessitates discharging the excess water to protect the pump station and the canal from water flooding when the electricity is shut down.

The growth and development of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) stands on a fertile site (Oxalis-myrtillus) in central Finland (Joensuu region: 62°39'N, 29°37'E) was simulated for two consecutive rotation periods (80 + 80 years/160 years). Stemwood and energy biomass production, carbon sequestration, and average storage and emission dynamics related to the entire production process of biomass were assessed. The assessment was done by employing a life cycle assessment tool, which combines simulation outputs from an ecosystem model and the related technosystem emissions. It was found that stump and root harvesting constituted 21-36% of the total biomass production (energy biomass and stemwood) depending on the thinning regimes and rotation period. No considerable effect was found in stemwood production when stump and root extraction was compared to the regime in which stumps and roots were left at the site. Stump and root extraction did not affect carbon sequestration on the following rotation and, in fact, an increase in forest growth was found for the unthinned and 30% increased thresholds compared to the first rotation. The results also showed that if current thinning threshold is increased, win-win situations are possible, especially when climate change mitigation is the main concern. The substitution of coal with energy biomass is possible without reducing carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. The utilization of energy biomass, including stumps and roots, instead of coal could reduce up to 33% of emissions over two rotation periods depending on the thinning regimes. Even if stumps and roots were excluded, a maximum of 19% carbon emissions could be reduced by using only logging residues. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon stock; Climatic impact; Life cycle assessment; Stump harvest; Substitution; Thinning regime","Biomass; Carbon capture; Climate change; Coal storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; Extraction; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Plants (botany); Rotation; Substitution reactions; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Climatic impact; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Thinning regimes; Forestry; Myrtillus; Oxalis; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878716377

The BMS performs several functions concerning to the battery system, its key task being balancing the battery cells. Battery cell unbalancing hampers electric vehicles' performance, with differing individual cell voltages decreasing the battery pack capacity and cell lifetime, leading to the eventual failure of the total battery system. Quite a lot of cell balancing topologies have been proposed, such as shunt resistor, shuttling capacitor, inductor/transformer based and DC energy converters. The shuttling capacitor balancing systems in particular have not been subject to much research efforts however, due to their perceived low balancing speed and high cost. This paper tries to fill this gap by briefly discussing the shuttling capacitor cell balancing topologies, focusing on the single switched capacitor (SSC) cell balancing and proposing a novel procedure to improve the SSC balancing system performance. This leads to a new control strategy for the SSC system that can decrease the balancing system size, cost, balancing time and that can improve the SSC balancing system efficiency. © 2013 by the authors.","Battery balancing; Battery management system; BMS; Cell equalization; MATLAB/simulink; Shuttling capacitor; Single switched capacitor; SSC","Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Topology; Balancing system; Battery systems; Control strategies; Energy converters; Individual cells; MATLAB /simulink; Research efforts; Switched capacitor; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877322815

Paper mills are one of the key targets for wood procurement companies, and the wood paying capability of a mill is one key factor in determining wood raw material flows. We studied the cost structure of a virtual paper mill, which produces 300,000 air-dry metric tonnes of supercalendered magazine paper annually. We used the activity-based costing (ABC) method for cost modelling and analysis. Paper production was divided into ten sub-processes: receive, unload and debarking; TMP mill; stock preparation; headbox and former; press section; dryer section; reeler; calender; winder; and roll storage. The total annual production cost was 88.3 million euros. The TMP mill and dryer processes incurred most of the production costs, approximately 34% and 18% respectively. The main source of fibre was Norway spruce, and we tested two cases where the fibre was procured from clear cuttings and thinnings. Our study indicates that the prices of paper and energy but also basic densities of wood and bark and bark percentage of wood can have an effect on the net profits of the paper mill. When the Norway spruce was procured from clear cuttings, the mill level annual net profit was 31.3 million euros, which was 13.3% higher than when the wood came from thinnings. Generally, our results proved that the ABC is a pragmatic cost calculation method and with the parameters used, it was estimated that papermaking can still be profitable in Nordic conditions.","Activity-based costing; Paper mill; Profitability; Wood properties","Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Dryers (equipment); Paper and pulp industry; Paper and pulp mills; Papermaking; Papermaking machinery; Plants (botany); Profitability; Thermomechanical pulping process; Wood; Activity based costing; Annual production; Paper mill; Paper production; Stock-preparation; Supercalendered magazine papers; Wood properties; Wood raw material; Costs; Costs; Paper Making; Paper Mills; Plants; Profitability; Thermomechanical Pulping; Wood Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877288522

On the other hand, the entire Mediterranean region has significant solar potential, which is almost unexploited. In this context, the current paper investigates the opportunities of combined electricity and clean water production on the basis of the available solar potential. To that effect the currently proposed energy system comprising of photovoltaic (PV) generators and energy storage is combined with a small desalination unit. Actually, the maximization of the properly defined solar energy ""value"" is attempted on the basis of an appropriate allocation and planning of the PV generators either for covering directly the electrical demand of the local society or by providing the energy required for the seawater desalination process. According to the results obtained from the application of the proposed solution to a representative small Aegean Sea island, the production cost of both electricity and clean water through the desalination plant are favorably compared with the respective cost of the already existing electricity and water supply solutions. © 2013 Desalination Publications.","Desalination; Energy autonomy; Solar potential; Stand-alone",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875786356

Adsorption desalination (AD) is a promising new technology that has great potential to reduce the need for conventional power, to use solely renewable energy sources, and to reduce the overall cost of water treatment. This technology can desalt seawater or water of even higher salinity using waste heat, solar heat, or geothermal heat. An AD system can operate effectively at temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 °C with perhaps an optimal temperature of 80 °C. The generally low temperature requirement for the feedwater allows the system to operate quite efficiently using an alternative energy source, such as solar power. Solar power, particularly in warm dry regions, can generate a consistent water temperature of about 90 °C. Although this temperature is more than adequate to run the system, solar energy collection only can occur during daylight hours, thereby necessitating the use of heat storage during nighttime or very cloudy days. With increasing capacity, the need for extensive thermal storage may be problematic and could add substantial cost to the development of an AD system. However, in many parts of the world, there are subsurface geothermal energy sources that have not been extensively used. Combining a low to moderate geothermal energy recovery system to an AD system would provide a solution to the thermal storage issue. However, geothermal energy development from particularly Hot Dry Rock is limited by the magnitude of the heat flow required for the process and the thermal conductivity of the rock material forming the heat reservoir.

Good spectral overlap of PtTFPP emission and α-naphtholphthalein absorption at around 650 nm provides efficient energy transfer from PtTFPP via FRET mechanism, thus reducing its phosphorescence lifetime. Experiments were carried out to optimize the composition and working characteristics of such a sensor for the measurement of headspace CO2 in foods packaged under modified atmosphere. The resulting thin film sensor coatings showed robust optical responses to CO 2, response (1 min, 99.9%) and recovery times (4 min, 99.9%) from 0 to 100% CO2. As expected, the CO2 sensor showed significant cross-sensitivity to O2 quenching, and this was accounted for by a tandem O2 sensor having similar phosphorescent characteristics but no CO 2 sensitivity. Upon storage in an open container, the sensors were stable for at least 14 days at 4 °C and 50 days at -20 °C, however at room temperature they were seen to deteriorate within 7 days loosing colour and sensitivity to CO2. At the same time, in food and modified atmosphere environment the sensor retained its sensitivity to CO2 for 21 days at 4 °C which is sufficient for many packaged products. Migration of sensor components examined with a standard set of standard food stimulants was only detectable in 95% ethanol and in olive oil for PtTFPP (0.06-0.13 μg/ml) and in 50% and 95% ethanol for α-naphtholphthalein (9.86-21.65 μg/ml). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Paraffin/DP composite PCM was firstly fabricated at mix proportion (paraffin: DP) of 0.9:1.0. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) results show that paraffin can be well impregnated into DP pores and has good compatibility with it. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results reveal that paraffin/DP composite PCM has melting temperature and latent heat of 41.11. °C and 70.51. J/g, respectively. Good thermal stability is observed for this fabricated composite PCM by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method. Furthermore, paraffin/DP composite PCM was incorporated in cement-based composite at 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%, by weight of cement. It is found that in comparison with control normal cement-based composite, maximum reductions on 28-day compressive strength and flexural strength, drying shrinkage strain and thermal conductivity by incorporation of paraffin/DP composite PCM are 48.7%, 47.5%, 80.7% and 33.6%, respectively.

However these short fibres possess excellent properties suitable for many other applications. The objective of this work was to use them for the preparation of nanoparticles/nanofibres as fillers in biodegradable composite applications such as food packaging, agriculture mulch films, automotive plastics, etc. The present paper concerns with jute fibres as a source of nanocellulose for reinforcement of PVA mulch films. Jute fibres were first refined to micro/nanoscale particles in form of nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) by high energy planetary ball milling process in dry and wet condition. Wet milling was observed more efficient than dry milling in terms of unimodality of size distribution with reduction in size below 500 nm after milling for 3 hours. Later the obtained particles were used as fillers in Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) films and their reinforcement evaluated based on thermal properties. It was observed that glass transition temperature (Tg) of PVA films improved from 84. 36 °C to 95. 22 °C after addition of 5 % jute particles without affecting % crystallinity and melting temperature (Tm) of PVA. Dynamic mechanical analysis of composite films with 5 % jute particles showed higher value of 14×108 Pa for storage modulus in comparison to 9×108 Pa of neat composite film. The percolation effect was observed more above glass transition temperature which consequently resulted in improved transfer of stiffness from jute particles to PVA matrix above 50 °C. The percolation phenomena also explained the improvement in thermal stability by 10 °C for every increased loading of jute particles due to formation of hydrogen bonds with PVA matrix. © 2013 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Jute nanoparticles; Nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC); Particle size distribution; Short fibres; Wet milling","Agricultural robots; Ball milling; Biodegradable polymers; Cellulose; Cellulose nanocrystals; Crystallinity; Film preparation; Glass; Glass transition; Hydrogen bonds; Jute fibers; Milling (machining); Nanoparticles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Plastics applications; Plastics fillers; Reinforcement; Size distribution; Solvents; Stiffness matrix; Temperature; Textile industry; Biodegradable composites; Dry and wet conditions; Nanofibrillar cellulose; Percolation phenomenon; Planetary ball milling; Preparation of nanoparticles; Short fibre; Wet milling; Nanocomposite films; Cellulose; Fibers; Grinding; Hydrogen Bonds; Jute; Polymers; Reinforcement; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873122266

Hardness in fresh fish was 2.908 N, in fish stored 28 days 1.238 N, after 56 days 0.505 N, and after 84 days 0.491 N. Cohesiveness (dimensionless unit) in fresh fish was 0.838, after 28 days 0.740, after 56 days 0.720, and after 84 days 0.712. Springiness (dimensionless unit) in fresh fish was 0.682, after 28 days 0.625, after 56 days 0.577, and at 84 days of storage 0.534. The texture profile analysis effect was determined by several regression and linear models. It is possible to calculate a certain time period in which changes develop up to the level of 50% of deteriorationin hardness 17.5 days and in cohesiveness 12.9 days, as this was proven to a defined significance level (P > 0.01). Only changes in springiness showed a linear regression in the level of 0.002 (rounded) for each day. Studies showed that the intensity of the most important changes in instrumental textural properties occurred during the initial 56 days after freezing and after up to 84 days of storage the changes continued at a lesser rate.

This system has been promoted as a viable mean of energy storage for power system applications as grid frequency support/control, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), power conditioning, and voltage sag mitigation. This paper presents a simple power control strategy based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to charge/discharge a flywheel DFIM (FW-DFIM) storage system while maintaining controllable grid side power. The proposed controller is based on conventional vector control system supplemented by an ANN-based current decoupling network used to develop the required rotor current components based on the required grid power level and flywheel instantaneous speed. The controller is designed to avoid overloading both stator and rotor circuits while the flywheel is charged/discharged. Additionally, it avoids using the required outer power loop or a hysteresis power controller, hence, simplifies the overall control algorithm. The validity of the developed concept along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy in power system applications is confirmed by computer simulation using Matlab/Simulink for a medium voltage 1000hp FW-DFIM.

The stochastic nature of the energy systems on the supply side requires increased flexibility at the demand side. We present a model that determines the theoretical maximum of flexibility of a combined heat and power system coupled to a thermal energy storage solution that can be either centralized or decentralized. Conventional central heating, to meet the heat demand at peak moments, is also available. The implications of both storage concepts are evaluated in a reference district. The amount of flexibility created in the district heating system is determined by the approach of the system through delayed or forced operation mode. It is found that the distinction between the implementation of the thermal energy storage as a central unit or as a collection of local units, has a dramatic effect on the amount of available flexibility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cogeneration; Demand-side management; District heating; Flexibility; Smart grids; Thermal energy storage","District heating; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Power generation; Thermal energy; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power system; Demand side managements; Demand-side; District heating system; Energy landscape; Energy systems; Flexibility; Heat demands; Increased flexibility; Intermittent operation; Operation mode; Peak moments; Smart grid; Stochastic nature; Heat storage; combined heat and power; demand-side management; energy resource; heating; numerical model; renewable resource; stochasticity; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871409197

Liquefaction of gasses is being looked into as a means of energy storage. This liquid can then be expanded in a Rankine cycle in order to recover the stored energy when it is needed. If waste heat is used as input for the boiler, this can be an interesting technology to compactly store energy. In this paper an analysis is made of the efficiency of storing liquefied air. Starting from the thermodynamics of the basic cycle, a more complex combined cycle is studied. It is clear the ideal cycles have a high efficiency. Taking real expander efficiencies into account however considerably reduces the actual output. Furthermore, using combined cycles for liquefaction and energy production do not raise efficiency in a significant way, unless isothermal expansion can be well approached. Conversion efficiencies range from 20 to 50%, making these cycles comparable to hydrogen storage and compressed air storage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The method involves a small power auxiliary circuit which exists as an energy buffer to provide a smooth absorption and release of excess energy from and to the main dc-dc converter during transients. In the method, the regulation of the current magnitude of the converter and energy storage of the auxiliary circuit are guaranteed by the relevant control schemes. The cost and size of the auxiliary circuit will be relatively small as it only operates intermittently. In this paper, the voltage deviation analysis and the auxiliary circuit design guideline are provided.

However, among the hard coal mining industry in particular, it is still not a popular choice. Destress blasting is used as a standard proactive technique in areas of high rockburst risk in longwall mining in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (UCSB). Destress blasting is carried out in rigid competent rocks adjacent to coal seams at depths of 700 to 1000 m below the surface. Groups of boreholes (from 2 to 10) are fired with explosive charges of 500 to 4500 kg during longwall mining of thick coal seams (thickness from 4 to 6 m) ahead of the longwall face. The main goals of destress blasting are the softening of the competent rock layers for better caving, reduction of strain energy storage and rock mass stress release. Induced rockburst can be provoked in favourable conditions and such cases from locations in the USCB are described in the paper. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Coal seams; Explosive charges; Hard coal mining; Longwall faces; Proactive measures; Rock layers; Rock mass stress; Silesian coals; Thick coal seam; Anthracite; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Explosives; Longwall mining; Rock bursts; Underground structures; Blasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869175013

A chemical composition that substantially accelerates hydrogen desorption was found. It was observed that carbon improves the hydrogen desorption kinetics significantly. Its beneficial effect was found to be optimum close to the carbon concentration of about cC ≅ 5 wt.%. With this composition, stored hydrogen can be desorbed readily at temperatures down to about 485 K, immediately after hydrogen charging. This can substantially shorten the hydrogen charging/discharging cycle of storage tanks using Mg-Ni-based alloys as hydrogen storage medium. For higher carbon concentrations, unwanted phases precipitated, likely resulting in deceleration of hydrogen desorption and lower hydrogen storage capacity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Monitored before and after pasteurisation, oxygen concentration was observed to drop as oxygen diffused into the beer. Oxygen levels between 0% and 5% were present in the bottle headspace pre-pasteurisation. Oxygen diffusion into the beer was monitored over time under refrigeration (∼4 °C) and a sensory panel was used to determine the effect of residual oxygen on the sensory quality of the beer. The headspace in the bottles was also monitored over time where oxygen increased to a level of ∼0.5% on average over the course of the shelf life. Interestingly, results showed that beer samples possessing higher levels of oxygen present prior to pasteurisation also possessed the most negative sensory attributes associated with the beer, particularly those consistent with beer staling. The developed optical sensor was shown to act as a predictor of sensory quality and may have on-line applications in the beer packaging sector. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Beer; Optical; Oxygen sensor; Packaging; Sensory; Storage","Beer samples; Bottled beers; Headspaces; On-line applications; Optical; Optical oxygen sensors; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen diffusion; Oxygen levels; Packaging sectors; Pasteurisation; Residual oxygen; Sensory; Sensory attributes; Sensory panels; Sensory qualities; Shelf life; Energy storage; Glass bottles; Oxygen; Oxygen sensors; Packaging; Pasteurization; Beer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866399068
