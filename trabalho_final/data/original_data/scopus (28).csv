To the extent that the animal patient exposure is reduced, there is usually a proportional decrease in the occupational exposure to personnel. The Report provides guidance for the development of an effective radiation safety program and recommendations for the design of radiological facilities and for the use of radiographic, fluoroscopic and therapeutic equipment in veterinary medicine. Included are recommendations for the use of radiopharmaceuticals in diagnosis and therapy, and for the use of lasers and ultrasonic equipment. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) provided recommendations for the limitation of exposure to ionizing radiation in Report No. 116 (NCRP, 1993). These recommendations are designed to achieve the objectives of radiation protection: (1) to prevent the occurrence of clinically significant acute radiation damage, and (2) to limit the risk of stochastic effects such as cancer and genetic effects. Radiation exposure to individuals from external radiation sources may be controlled and limited by any one or any combination of the following measures: (1) increasing the distance of the individual from the source (distance), (2) reducing the duration of exposure (time), and (3) using protective barriers between the individual and the source (shielding). For x- and gamma-ray equipment used by veterinarians, shielding and distance are the factors most readily controlled. Exposure to dispersed radioactive material from unsealed sources can be controlled and limited by using precautions in the handling of these materials. Although x-ray machines are widely used in veterinary medicine, the workload, and thus the potential exposure of both the practitioner and the technical assistants is, on the average, low. However, because practices such as restraining animals and holding film cassettes introduce risks of unnecessary exposure of staff, special attention is given in this Report to proper practices. Radiation safety program requirements are specified in Section 3. In summary, this radiation safety program should be commensurate with the hazards to personnel and to the general public, should be well documented, and should be reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether it continues to meet the operational needs and is effective. All veterinary personnel shall receive training in radiation safety commensurate with the individual's anticipated risk from radiation exposure. Individual monitoring will be required for some staff. However, when the number of staff is small, it is reasonable to provide individual monitoring for all employees. It is not likely that the potential for exposure to dispersed radioactive material will be sufficient to require a bioassay program to assess internal exposure. However, at veterinary facilities where 131I is used for radiation therapy, consideration should be given to instituting periodic thyroid counting of potentially exposed persons. Surveys to evaluate the radiation safety characteristics of x-ray machines and gamma-ray irradiators are necessary and are especially required for all new installations. Radiation safety surveys shall be made when radioactive materials are administered to animals. Although unlikely to be necessary, air sampling should be performed when appropriate to determine whether individuals caring for the animals are subjected to airborne contamination and whether bioassay is indicated. Warning signs, including instructions written in ""plain"" and unambiguous language, shall be used for radioactive material containers, radiation-producing devices, animal cages and pens, stalls, laboratories, and other areas in which radioactive materials or radiation-producing devices are used or stored. Recommendations for the design of facilities that use fixed and portable radiographic and fluoroscopic equipment, therapy equipment, and radionuclides are detailed in Section 4. For radiographic and fluoroscopic facilities, the required shielding barriers should be an integral part of the building or permanently affixed to the equipment. In the event that movable or portable barriers are required due to multiple uses of the room or mobile applications, the operators shall receive specific training in the placement of the shields. Structural shielding design for x- and gamma-ray equipment used for therapy and operating at energies up to 10 MeV is approached in a somewhat different way than the design for diagnostic x-ray equipment, although the same basic model is used. Leaded wallboard can be used to shield interior walls of diagnostic radiographic and therapy facilities operating at ≤150 kVp. For x-ray therapy facilities with operating potentials &gt;150 kVp and for gamma-ray facilities, poured or precast concrete is generally the preferred shielding material. Under some circumstances lead and steel can also be used. The models used to determine shielding requirements are discussed in Section 4. The basic concepts and terminology used in the design of shielding barriers include the shielding design goals, the workload for the x-ray unit, the distances to the areas to be shielded, occupancy factors for the areas to be shielded, and the use factor. These quantities are defined in the Glossary and examples of their use are given in Appendices A and B. The selection of shielding design goals is based on the recommendations of NCRP (2004) for controlled and uncontrolled areas. It is clear that implementation of the shielding design goals requires that the management of each facility evaluate the use of its space relative to exposure of its employees and members of the public. A discussion on shielding design goals is presented in Section 4.1.5.1. For diagnostic facilities, shielding requirements for barriers are given in Appendix A of this Report for lead, gypsum wallboard, and concrete. Typical workloads and operating potentials for veterinary facilities indicate that primary barriers would rarely exceed 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) of lead for both controlled areas and uncontrolled areas. For therapy facilities, shielding requirements for barriers are given in Appendix B of this Report for lead, steel and concrete. Recommendations for the design features for facilities in which the handling and administration of unsealed radioactive materials take place are based on those unique aspects of the radioactive materials that will be used. Design considerations include preventing or facilitating the removal of contamination, minimizing exposure, preventing airborne and sanitary sewer contamination, and providing for safe and effective radioactive waste disposal. When animals receive high administered activities of gamma-ray-emitting radionuclides, such as radioiodine for treatment of thyroid cancer, facility walls should be shielded to control radiation levels in surrounding occupied areas. In some instances, it would be acceptable to use mobile shields positioned close to the animals or their holding cells to protect areas of concern. Individuals who handle radioactive materials for administration to animals shall be protected from unnecessary exposure. Shields shaped like an ""L,"" with a lead base and a lead wall between the source and the radiation worker, can provide substantial reduction of potential doses to the worker and specific shields are indicated for syringes used to inject radioactive materials. Almost all radionuclides used in veterinary practice have a half-life &lt;120 d and lend themselves to decay-in-storage as an effective and safe method of disposal. However, waste radionuclides with half-lives &gt;120 d might have to be processed for transfer to a commercial disposal facility. Radioactive animal carcasses present a special problem as radioactive waste because there is not a shallow land disposal facility that will accept them. For disposal at a licensed radioactive waste disposal facility, animal carcasses are first incinerated at a licensed facility that has the capability of retrieving the radionuclides in ash and processing the ash in a manner that makes it acceptable for shallow land disposal. For those carcasses that can be processed via decay-in-storage, the carcasses can be disposed in the manner used for nonradioactive carcasses. However, steps shall be taken to ensure that animals used in radionuclide experiments are not subsequently consumed by human beings. A qualified expert (see Glossary) shall evaluate the shielding and radiation safety requirements of any new or modified installation (i.e., room redesigns or changes in shielding configurations) prior to the use of the facility (NCRP, 2004). The evaluation will normally involve direct measurements of the radiation transmitted through each of the shielding barriers. The measurement results shall be used to confirm that the shielding design goals have not been exceeded and therefore the respective annual values for effective dose recommended for controlled and uncontrolled areas (NCRP, 2004) have not been exceeded. Visual inspection during construction is important to verify that the specified type and thickness of shielding material and the safety systems are properly installed. Sections 5, 6 and 7 present details of the design, performance and operation of radiographic [including computed tomography (CT)] (Section 5), fluoroscopic (Section 6), and radiotherapy equipment (including brachytherapy sources) (Section 7), that relate to radiation safety and the protection of staff and visitors. Quality-assurance procedures for radiographic applications (i.e., x-ray equipment used for imaging) are given in Appendix C.",,"emergency health service; gamma radiation; human; nonhuman; quality control; radiation exposure; review; veterinary medicine; X irradiation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051912729

A novel technique for making non-intrusive measurements of species concentration and temperature using FTIR spectroscopy was presented. This tool enables the study of flame structure in real silicon devices without having to alter them to install optical access, which would be likely to change their performance. The concept was demonstrated in a CH 4/air flame stabilized in a micro-channel formed by two silicon wafers spaced 1-2 mm apart. The crystalline silicon walls of the channel were transparent in the mid-IR, allowing the use of traditional spectroscopic methods for quantification of CH 4 and CO 2 concentration as well as gas temperature. Problems with aliasing, slow acquisition times, and instabilities in the spectrometer due to fluctuating light levels from the flame, made low-resolution spectra more accurate. The implications of this diagnostic for understanding flame structure and stabilization in microchannels, as well as the performance of MEMS power system combustors were discussed.

Res.

Activities to address these concerns are sometimes called critical infrastructure protection (CIP), a concept that is somewhat different from the one of ""energy security,"" which focuses on politically and economically motivated supply interruptions. Different elements of the energy infrastructure are characterized by distinct vulnerabilities. Breaches of security in nuclear plants can lead to large-scale environmental disasters - but the infrastructure is concentrated and relatively easy to guard. Oil and gas production, transportation, and refining infrastructures are often spatially concentrated, and disruptions can lead to shortages if supply is not restored before stockpiles are exhausted. Traditional electricity infrastructures suffer from the need for system-wide integrity to ensure supply reliability, having critical facilities spatially concentrated (substations), and insignificant storage capacity for emergency supply. This review discusses how energy infrastructure and security are related, how this relationship differs from traditional energy security concepts, and what it may mean for private and policy decisions. Key concepts include redundancy, diversity, resilience, storage, decentralization, and interdependence. The concept of CIP is still relatively new and is likely to evolve over time, possibly away from a ""guards, gates, and guns"" defensive approach and toward a design approach that yields systems that are inherently harder to successfully attack. Such survivable systems may feature distributed intelligence, control, and operations.","Critical infrastructure protection; Energy security; Terrorism","Critical infrastructure protection; Decentralization; Energy security; Terrorism; Decision making; Disasters; Electricity; Environmental impact; Intelligent control; Public policy; Redundancy; Energy management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444290723

The use of very tin-rich solder alloys as most promising alternatives, resulted from the prohibition of lead and cadmium in the solder for all electronics products sold in the European Union, valid starting from 2006. The favored two and tree metal alloys on basis of tin-silver and/or tin-copper possess however a substantially higher melting point than tin-lead solder and lead thus in the manufacturing to higher soldering peak temperatures from 235°C to 250°C for Reflow soldering. Thus and due to the prohibition of certain halogens as flame retardants in the plastics and polymer materials, used formulated at the same time, so far altogether new and more pollution free concepts and materials are necessary for different electronics products. These must correspond however concerning reliability, moisture-sensitiveness and temperature stability if possible to the materials and components used today. For the assembly of new memory modules for the PC market investigations were accomplished, containing of lead free solder contacts of the EGAs and new green Plastics, which cause an improvement of the adhesion during the Packaging process. Since it came frequently to delaminations in the Packaging process with these new materials of the memory chips during the mold processes, solder ball attach or the SMT reflow soldering, special plasma pre-treatment was introduced. With this plasma pre-treatment a significant improvement of the surface energies of the involved silicon chip (Si), BT interposer material and solder mask and thus a better adhesion of the mold compound were reached. For the proof the measurement of the contact angle and the computation of the surface energy on the surfaces treated in the plasma served the improvement as well as the comparison to untreated samples.","Adhesion; Green package; Plasma treatment; Surface energy","Green packages; Memory packages; Plasma treatment; Solder masks; Surface engineering; Adhesion; Cadmium; Data storage equipment; Delamination; Electronic equipment; Interfacial energy; Plasmas; Polymers; Soldering; Surface treatment; Tin alloys; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Electronics packaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444285245

We find that CCS is technically feasible, with current costs of about $200 to $250 per ton of carbon. Although currently a relatively expensive mitigation option, CCS could be attractive if we have a stringent carbon policy, if CCS turns out unexpectedly inexpensive relative to other options, or if it is otherwise desired to retain fossil fuels as part of the energy mix while reducing carbon emissions. Near-term prospects favor CCS for electric power plants and certain industrial sources with storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as opposed to aquifers. Deep aquifers may provide an attractive longer-term-storage option, whereas ocean storage poses greater technical and environmental uncertainty.

The parameter variations are random in nature and are expected to be more pronounced in minimum geometry transistors commonly used in memories such as SRAM. Consequently, a large number of cells in a memory are expected to be faulty due to variations in different process parameters. In this paper we analyze SRAM cell failure under process variation and propose a new fault tolerant cache architecture suitable for high performance applications. The faulty cells are dynamically detected and replaced by adoptively resizing the cache. The granularity of our resizing technique is low and hence, the technique can handle a large number of faults. This scheme is transparent to processor architecture and has negligible energy and area overhead. This scheme also does not affect the cache access time and has minimum effect on processor performance. Experimental results on a 64K cache implemented using BPTM (Berkeley Predictive Technology Model) 45 nm technology show that using our technique the effective yield can be increased to 94% from its original 33%.",,"Built-in-self-test (BIST); Fault tolerant cache; Gaussian distribution; Process parameter variations; Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Mathematical models; Nanotechnology; Networks (circuits); Probability density function; Static random access storage; Threshold voltage; Fault tolerant computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444251734

Our proposed BTF modeling approach is based on (1) conducting an analytical study that relates a sensor resolution to the size and shape of elements forming material surface, (2) developing a robotic system for laboratory BTF data acquisition, (3) researching an application of the Johnson family of statistical probability distribution functions (PDF) to BTF modeling, (4) selecting optimal feature space for statistical BTF modeling, (5) building a database of parameters for the Johnson family of PDFs that after interpolations forms a high-dimensional statistical BTF model and (6) researching several statistical quality metrics that can be used for verification and validation of the obtained BTF models. The motivation for developing the proposed statistical BTF modeling approach comes from the facts that (a) analytical models have to incorporate randomness of outdoor scene clutter surfaces and (b) models have to be computationally feasible with respect to the complexity of modeled interactions between light and materials. The major advantages of our approach over other approaches are (a) the low computational requirements on BTF modeling (BTF model storage, fast BTF model-based generation), (b) flexibility of the Johnson family of PDFs to cover a wide range of PDF shapes and (c) applicability of the BTF model to a wide range of spectral sensors, e.g., color, multi-spectral or hyperspectral cameras. The prime applications for the proposed BTF model are multi-sensor automatic target recognition (ATR), and scene understanding and simulation.","Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Statistical modeling","Automatic target recognition (ATR); Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Bidirectional texture functions (BTF); Statistical modeling; Cameras; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Computer vision; Data acquisition; Interpolation; Kinetic energy; Light propagation; Mathematical models; Object recognition; Probability density function; Robotics; Statistical methods; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444237297

Algorithms that imply a very low dissipation are required for new applications where the energy source is limited, e.g. mobile phones including a camera and video features. Whereas it can be observed that video standards are mainly designed around coding efficiency, we propose to take into account power consumption characteristics directly when designing the algorithm. More precisely, we give some guidelines for the design of low-power video codecs in the scope of modern hardware architectures and we introduce the notion of power scalability. We present an original encoder based on so-called 'Collocated Motion Estimation' designed using the proposed methodology. Experimental results show that we remain close to the coding efficiency of the reference H.264 baseline encoder while the power consumption is largely reduced in our solution. Moreover this encoder is scalable in memory transfer and computational complexity.","Battery life; Low power; Motion estimation; Power scalability; Video coding","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motion estimation; Video cameras; Video signal processing; Battery life; Low power video schemes; Memory access; Power scalability; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444233456

This paper presents a technique in video coding to decrease the power consumption at a standard video decoder. Coupled with a small dedicated video internal memory cache on a decoder, the technique can substantially decrease the amount of data traffic to the external memory at the decoder. A decrease in data traffic to the external memory at decoder will result in multiple benefits: faster real-time processing and power savings. The encoder, given prior knowledge of the decoder's dedicated video internal memory cache management scheme, regulates its choice of motion compensated predictors to reduce the decoder's external memory accesses. This technique can be used in any standard or proprietary encoder scheme to generate a compliant output bit stream decodable by standard CPU-based and dedicated hardware-based decoders for power savings with the best quality-power cost trade off. Our simulation results show that with a relatively small amount of dedicated video internal memory cache, the technique may decrease the traffic between CPU and external memory over 50%.","Embedded Systems; Low Power; Video Coding","Cache management; CPU; Low power dissipation; MPEG-4; Cache memory; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Embedded systems; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Motion compensation; Multimedia systems; Real time systems; Telecommunication traffic; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444228028

Tunable laser sources in the 2-3 μm region include Cr 2+-doped chalcogenide lasers; cryogenic systems, such as color center lasers; limited tunability devices, such as Tm and Ho lasers, gas or chemical lasers, and diode lasers; and nonlinear optical devices such as OPOs. Transition-metal-doped chalcogenide lasers are of high interest because of their high versatility, broad room-temperature wavelength tunability, high optical efficiencies, and their potential to be scaled to high powers via direct diode or fiber laser pumping. To date, continuous-wave, gain-switched, Q-switched and mode-locked laser operation has been demonstrated. Material advantages include broad absorption and emission bands, high fluorescence quantum efficiencies at room temperature, high gain cross-sections, and minimal loss mechanisms such as excited-state absorption or upconversion. Additionally, the materials can be produced by a variety of methods, including several direct growth techniques and diffusion doping. The principal material disadvantages include a relatively large change in refractive index with temperature (large dn/dT), which can induce thermal lensing, and a short, microseconds, energy storage time.

By default these rendering systems point sample rendered pixels. For highly resolved objects, this sampling is adequate to represent the object accurately, but when the object has a relatively small projected area that is on the order of a few pixels, the object intensity is corrupted with aliasing. Hardware anti-aliasing such as multisampling provides minimal relief by offering 4, 8, or 16 samples within a single pixel. However, for hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) scene generation where accurate energy conservation of unresolved sub-pixel objects must be maintained, standard hardware anti-aliasing is not good enough. Zoom anti-aliasing 1, 2, 3 (ZAA) has been proven as a viable solution for rendering objects that would otherwise be grossly under-sampled. Techniques in the past have focused on processing the zoom window pixels in the CPU because the graphics processor unit (GPU) was not general purpose enough to support the zoom window processing. However, this is no longer the case because of the new capabilities of modern graphics processors. This paper presents a modern GPU-based zoom window approach and compares the results to a classic CPU-based approach.","Anti-aliasing; Graphics; Hardware-in-the-loop; Real-time scene generation; Zoom window","Hardware-in-the-loop; Pixel transfers; Real-time scene generation; Zoom window; Anti-aliasing; Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Data storage equipment; Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Program processors; Programmed control systems; Real time systems; Computer graphics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044267741

Much research has been devoted to specific hardware, software, or algorithmic components of these networks with very little work having been done on full system implementation for real-world problems. The multitude of WSN components that have been developed result from different tradeoffs made among the parameters governing WSN systems. This paper introduces and analyzes these governing parameters and how tradeoffs are made among them. Ultimately, a matching metric presented helps WSN designers use specifications on these parameters to find and integrate appropriate WSN components for implementing real-world WSN solutions.","Metrics; Tradeoffs; Wireless sensor networks","Computer hardware; Computer software; Energy storage; Metric system; Network protocols; Parameter estimation; Wireless telecommunication systems; Media access control (MAC); Network latency; Tradeoffs; Wireless sensor networks (WSN); Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044266519

Technologies for capturing CO2 from major stationary sources (power stations, industrial plants, etc) and storing that CO2 for long periods of time is one of few near term options for decreasing CO2 emissions. This transition to low carbon intensity energy and possibly the hydrogen economy through renewables and in the long-term technological developments such as artificial photosynthesis. Capture of CO2 from post combustion emissions can be done using a range of technologies though costs are currently high and dependent on the concentration of CO2 in the emissions. Techniques include solvents, pressure swing adsorption and the use of membranes. Options for decreasing capture costs by increasing the concentration of CO2 in the emission stream include the use of oxyfuels (in pulverized fuel types boilers) and by moving to integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) operations either simply for power generation or for poly-generation opportunities. Once the CO2 has been captured it can be stored using a variety of methods. Storage in the ocean has been suggested but is considered an unlikely option because of environmental uncertainties and political opposition. Mineral storage is a niche opportunity. The greatest potential lies in geological storage of CO 2 and this option is commanding increased attention from the Australian and international community. In Australia, the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) is an important new initiative that will support energy companies and energy intensive industries in meeting challenges posed by greenhouse gas issues and assist them in their efforts to reduce their emissions profile.

The main power of isotopic analyses is the ability to study both specific processes and also to trace sources of materials and flows of energy through complex ecological webs. It focuses on the proper sampling protocols for accurately determining the natural abundance and distribution of stable isotopes, particularly carbon and nitrogen, in ecological systems and does not address methods that include the addition of isotopically labeled compounds at enriched levels. Different types of samples require different methods of collection and storage, and the choice of methods will be influenced by the location of the ecosystem, the availability of cold storage, and the kinds of analyses to be performed.

This paper proposes novel Markov based models for analyzing the reliability and availability of different fault-tolerant memory arrangements under the operational scenario of an SEU. These arrangements exploit redundancy (either duplex or triplex replication) for dynamic fault-tolerant operation as provided by arbitration (for error detection and output selection) as well as in the presence of dedicated circuitry implementing different correction/detection codes for bit-flips as errors. The primary objective is to preserve either the correctness, or the fail-safe nature of the data output of the memory system for long mission time. It is shown that a duplex memory system encoded with error control codes has a higher reliability than the triplex arrangement. Moreover, the use of a code for single error correction and double error detection (SEC-DED) improves both availability and reliability compared to an error correction code with same error detection capabilities.",,"Duplex systems; Fault tolerant memory systems; Markov models; Single high energy particles; Coding errors; Data storage equipment; Error correction; Error detection; Markov processes; Reliability theory; Fault tolerant computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044293121

The development of wireless monitoring systems has been of great interest because wireless transmission has been proven as a convenient means to transmit signals while minimizing the use of many long wires. However, the wireless transmission systems need sufficient power to function properly. Conventionally, batteries are used as the power sources of the remote sensing systems. However, due to their limited lifetime, replacement of batteries has to be carried out periodically, which is inconvenient. In recent years, piezoelectric materials have been developed as sensing and actuating devices mostly, and power generators in some cases. In this paper, a self-powered piezoelectric sensor is studied, in which one piece of piezoelectric material will be simultaneously used as a sensor and a power generator under vibration environment. Concurrent design with piezoelectric materials in sensor and power generator is integrated with energy storage device. We evaluate sensing and power generating abilities individually, and then their concurrent sensing and energy harvesting performances. The possibilities of the piezoelectric sensor to power wireless transmission systems are discussed. Experimental efforts are carried out to study the feasibility of the self-powered piezoelectric sensor system.","Energy harvesting; Piezoelectric sensor; Remote sensing; Self-powered","Energy storage; Failure (mechanical); Piezoelectric devices; Reliability; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectric sensors; Self-powered; Microsensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044263459

In most face recognition systems, the recognition process is performed after a face has been located and segmented in the input scene. This face detection and segmentation process however is prone to errors which can lead to partial faces being segmented (sometimes also due to occlusion) for the recognition process. There are also cases where the segmented face includes parts of the scene background as well as the face, affecting the recognition performance. In this paper, we address how these issues can be dealt efficiently with advanced correlation filter designs. We report extensive set of results on the CMU pose, illumination and expressions (PIE) dataset where training filters are designed in two experiments: the training gallery has 3 images from extreme illumination the training gallery has 3 images from near-frontal illumination. In the testing phase however, we test both filters with the whole illumination variations while simultaneously cropping the test images to various sizes. The results show that the advanced correlation filter designs perform very well even with partial face images of unseen illumination variations including reduced-complexity correlation filters such as the Quad-Phase Minimum Average Correlation Energy (QP-MACE) filter that requires only 2 bits/frequency storage.","Correlation filters; Face recognition","Correlation filters; Face images; Face verification; Frequency storage; Correlation methods; Database systems; Error analysis; Gaussian noise (electronic); Illuminating engineering; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Face recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844239303

In this paper we discuss scientific and technological advances that promise to accelerate the merging of body and machine, including the development of actuator technologies that behave like muscle and control methodologies that exploit principles of biological movement. We present a state-of-the-art device for leg rehabilitation: a powered ankle-foot orthosis for stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis patients. The device employs a force-controllable actuator and a biomimetic control scheme that automatically modulates ankle impedance and motive torque to satisfy patient-specific gait requirements. Although the device has some clinical benefits, problems still remain. The force-controllable actuator comprises an electric motor and a mechanical transmission, resulting in a heavy, bulky, and noisy mechanism. As a resolution of this difficulty, we argue that electroactive polymer-based artificial muscle technologies may offer considerable advantages to the physically challenged, allowing for joint impedance and motive force controllability, noise-free operation, and anthropomorphic device morphologies.","Artificial muscle; Human rehabilitation; Orthosis; Prosthesis","Artificial muscles; Energy-storage devices; Orthosis; Actuators; Elasticity; Joints (anatomy); Mathematical models; Muscle; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Problem solving; Prosthetics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844234334

For this purpose, the behaviour during several centuries of every material constituting the barrier between wastes and environment must be predicted. In addition to modelling and laboratory simulations, the only mean to study corrosion systems formed during several centuries is to analyse archaeological ferrous artefacts buried in soil. Precedent studies on this kind of artefacts have shown that the corrosion system is formed by the metallic core, a dense corrosion product layer, a transformed medium constituted of a mix of corrosion products and soil compounds, and the soil itself. Moreover, analytical and electrochemical studies seem to show that the corrosion mechanisms are driven by the species transport in the dense product layer (DPL) and especially by oxygen migration in the DPL pores. Thus, it seems necessary to precise the species transport properties in the DPL. A characterisation study on ferrous artefacts coming from the site of Glinet (16 th AD) have been carried out. The rust layers have been studied using several techniques. The composition analyses were performed with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) coupled to the Scanning Electron Microscope, and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). Structural information have been obtained by X-ray microdiffraction (μXRD) and microRaman spectroscopy. The aim of this communication is to present the results of a study performed with markers in order to better understand the species transport in the DPL. Experiments focus on an archaeological artefact part from Glinet excavation. The migration in the DPL of I and Na ions (which have roughly the same diffusion coefficient in water than oxygen) will be studied by immersion of an archaeological analogue with his DPL in a saturated iodide (NaI) aqueous solution. After different immersion times (1h, 3h, 7h and 168h), the concentration profiles of Na and I in the DPL will be determinate using spectral mapping by EDS. The obtained profiles allow proposing apparent diffusion coefficients and corrosion rates.","Aqueous corrosion; Archaeological analogues; Diffusion","Apparent diffusion coefficient; Aqueous corrosion; Archaeological analogues; Archaeological artefacts; Composition analysis; Concentration profiles; Corrosion mechanisms; Corrosion products; Electrochemical studies; Environmental challenges; Laboratory simulation; Long-term corrosion; Metallic cores; Micro Raman Spectroscopy; Oxygen migration; Product layer; Rust layers; Safe storage; Scanning Electron Microscope; Species transport; Spectral mappings; Structural information; X ray microdiffraction; XRD; Diffusion; Electron probe microanalysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Iron; Oxygen; Photomapping; Radioactive wastes; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; Transport properties; X ray diffraction; Corrosion rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867248923

Unlike in Marx scheme where the top stages get high voltage potential at erection, all the LTD stages keep ground potential during the shot. This means that the insulation inside the LTD stage has to be designed to withstand the charge voltage only thus allowing to reduce the thickness of insulation between the conductors that defines the inductance of the discharge circuit, reduce the pulse width and increase the output power of the generator.

Basically, this is determined by the relatively low energy stored per unit mass of capacitors the main storage in overwhelming majority of accelerator designs. Magnetic cumulative generator (MCG) as energy source together with high-voltage pulse generator on the basis of inductive storage (IS) and electro-explosive opening switch (EEOS) allows abandoning bulky capacitive storages at all and developing compact accelerators capable to generate voltages at Megavolt level. Relatively low efficiency of pulse compression circuit caused by considerable energy losses in EEOS is not a problem, since high energy gain ratio of MCG makes up for it easily. Much more complicated problem is MCG matching to high-inductive load. For efficient operation of EEOS MCG must be capable to generate current pulse with effective length of a few microseconds only and e.m.f. better than 50 kV. Carried out both mathematical and physical simulations contributed into successful solution of given problem. In result, a generator of 0.1 m 3 in volume (including MCG) is developed, which is capable to produce voltage pulses of above 800 kV and energy about 1-2 kJ. Installation was used for generation of high-voltage pulses on the capacitive load, as well as for driving microwave generators, such as resonant relativistic BWO and reflex triode. © 2004 D.V.

Event data are collected at various sensors and sent to selected storage nodes for further in-network processing. Since sensor nodes have strong constraints on their energy usage, this data transfer needs to be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensor database systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules message transmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to the schedule, their radios can be off most of the time and they only wake up during well-defined time intervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically with the scheduling decisions, resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher latency.

This will make DRAM cost, the space and the power it consumes a serious problem. The main question raised in this research is how cost, size, and power consumption can be reduced by transforming traditional flat main-memory systems into a multi-level hierarchy. We make the case for a multi-level main memory hierarchy by proposing and evaluating the performance of an implementation that enables aggressive use of memory compression, sharing of memory resources among computers, and dynamic power management of unused regions of memory. This paper presents the key design strategies to make this happen. We evaluate our implementation using complete runs of applications from the Spec 2K suite, SpecJBB, and SAP - typical desktop and server applications. We show that only 30% of the entire memory resources typically needed must be accessed at DRAM speed whereas the rest can be accessed at a speed that is a magnitude slower. The resulting performance overhead is shown to be only 1.2% on average.

S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the University of Colorado's Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CADSWES) have partnered to develop a software package called RiverWare for use in modeling multipurpose reservoir systems. RiverWare now offers three different modeling approaches: interactive simulation, rulebased simulation, and optimization. TVA implemented the interactive simulation software in April 1996 for scheduling both power and nonpower reservoirs in the TVA system. In May 2000, TVA implemented optimization modeling for scheduling the reservoir system. Prior to this, optimization modeling had been used in parallel with interactive simulation modeling in scheduling the system for about two years. The optimization modeling approach takes into account not only the power economics of the hydro system, but also other demands placed on the reservoir system. These demands, which include flood control, navigation, recreation, and water quality, as well as special operations for maintenance and community events, are defined in RiverWare as prioritized constraints. The optimization routine uses goal programming to satisfy all of the constraints in order of priority to the extent possible, and then with any remaining flexibility, optimizes hydropower operations to reduce the total integrated system power supply cost. Hydropower operations are optimized by maximizing the combined value of energy generated during the forecast period and water reserved in storage for future generation. TVA's RiverWare optimization model is typically run using 6 hour timesteps for a forecast period of one week. The optimization model can be run several times per day as forecasts of power demands or operational constraints change. There are several advantages to using RiverWare for optimizing TVA's reservoir system. First, the optimization model ensures that all of the operational objectives of the reservoir system are met to the extent possible. Then, with the physical and policy constraints satisfied, the timing of hydro generation can be improved to maximize the dollar value of the hydro system to TVA. Finally, RiverWare allows the user great flexibility in scheduling the system. The user can interactively define operating policy in the form of constraints, quickly and easily manipulate input data, and use the objective function value to compare the cost difference of various operating scenarios.

The division of total flow into the direct runoff and the baseflow is of paramount importance for these type of studies. A large sample of natural hydrographs of total flow, chosen from different geographical areas of the 48 contiguous States, is considered for the study analysis in this investigation. These hydrograph curves are analyzed to divide the total flow judiciously into the direct runoff and the baseflow volumetric quantities, respectively. A two-parameter Frechet Distribution is fitted to each one of the hydrographs of the direct runoff curves as obtained through the proposed analysis from these sample hydrographs of total flow. The two individual parameters of the Frechet Distribution are related to the dimensionless shape factor and the storage time constant of the homogeneous drainage basin, respectively. Both parameters are determined through the analysis of the total flow data as measured at a stream gaging station. The calibrated form of the two-parameter Frechet Distribution, representing the direct runoff as the natural hydrograph curve, describes it rather well. It not only furnishes accurate estimates of the flood volume from the computed direct runoff but also provides a compatible length value of the hydrograph timebase. And, of course, helps in the determination of the accurate profile of the corresponding baseflow curve for a given drainage basin under consideration, as well as, furnishes a correct value of the volume of baseflow.

Aquifer Storage and Recovery may be a viable method (subject to proper geologic conditions) of increasing water treatment plant efficiency and promoting energy conservation because Aquifer Storage and Recovery projects permit conservation of water during critical times, while utilizing excess resources in plentiful periods. It is generally understood that each Aquifer Storage and Recovery well should be designed, constructed, and tested with the unique goals of the project in mind (e.g. injection rate, storage volume, storage period, recovery rate, water quality of recharge, water quality of native, and water quality of intended recovered use). The proper peer review, and multi-jurisdictional input, in an effort to maximize the information gained, will serve to help clarify the magnitude of Aquifer Storage and Recovery's future in a regional water supply picture. However, the reliance on large scale, regional Aquifer Storage and Recovery projects are of concern to many utility systems because there are no successful, large-scale demonstration Aquifer Storage and Recovery projects, and even those project purported to be successful have many questions. Since geology and water quality play such a significant role in the success of Aquifer Storage and Recovery projects, before moving toward the assumption that Aquifer Storage and Recovery should be as significant a component for an area's water supply needs, it is hoped that consideration will be given to how ASR is perceived to be successful and where the data gaps in our understanding really are. For example, successful ASR projects rarely include the variable of time, critical to utilities - at what time will water be available. It is suggested that a ""success"" graph could be derived - it would be an s-shaped curve starting at nearly 90% recovery at the start and dropping to 40% after two years of storage. Likewise, modeling of ASR systems is rarely done because standard groundwater models do not accurately depict the buoyancy change that occurs in the aquifer. However, there has been work to this end completed in Europe a number of years ago that may hold some promise in a better understanding of the ASR concept.

Approximately 10 percent of that electricity is generated from hydroelectric power plants on the six dams in the Highland Lakes system on the lower Colorado River. A real-time scheduling system has been developed and is being implemented into the LCRA Energy Management System (EMS) to optimally schedule the hourly operation of thirteen hydropower generating units in concert with the three steam-electric power stations operated by the LCRA. The hydro scheduling system uses a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of the Highland Lakes to determine the optimal hydro generation based on forecasted power and water demands and hydrologic conditions over the next 72 hours. The MILP model maximizes hydropower generation while satisfying hourly and daily constraints on generation capacity, lake storage and flow releases.

The UC tank is used to satisfy acceleration and regenerative braking requirements accomplishing the system load transients and improving the on-board BU life time.

However, quantum systems can also exist in superposition states, thereby storing both states of the bit simultaneously. This property potentially leads to an exponential increase in memory and processing capacity. It would enable a quantum computer to efficiently solve certain problems, such as factorizing large numbers, which may be intractable on a classical computer. Actually building a useful quantum computer is an extremely daunting task due to the necessity of overcoming decoherence. Nevertheless, in the near term, the principles of quantum information processing may find important applications in metrology.

Memories are responsible for a significant percentage of a system's aggregate energy consumption. Consequently, novel memories as well as novel memory hierarchies are being designed to reduce the energy consumption. Caches and scratchpads are two contrasting variants of memory architectures. The former relies completely on hardware logic while the latter requires software for its utilization. Most high-end embedded microprocessors today include onchip instruction and data caches along with a scratchpad. Previous software approaches for utilizing scratchpad did not consider caches and hence fail for the prevalent high-end system architectures. In this work, we use the scratchpad for storing instructions. We solve the allocation problem using a greedy heuristic and also solve it optimally using an ILP formulation. We report an average reduction of 20.7% in instruction memory energy consumption compared to a previously published technique. Larger reductions are also reported when the problem is solved optimally. The scratchpad in the presented architecture is similar to a preloaded loop cache. Comparing the energy consumption of our approach against that of preloaded loop caches, we report average energy savings of 28.9% using the heuristic. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Energy aware compilation; Integer Linear Programming; Memory allocation; Memory architectures; Memory energy modeling","Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Integer programming; Memory architecture; Optimization; Power management; Storage allocation (computer); Allocation algorithm; Allocation problems; Embedded microprocessors; Energy aware; Energy-constrained; Instruction memory; Integer Linear Programming; Memory energies; Cache memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048816918

Most studies use control algorithms that dynamically transition devices to low power modes after they are idle for a certain threshold period of time. The control algorithms used in the past have two major limitations. First, they require painstaking, application-dependent manual tuning of their thresholds to achieve energy savings without significantly degrading performance. Second, they do not provide performance guarantees. In one case, they slowed down an application by 835%! This paper addresses these two limitations for both memory and disks, making memory/disk energy-saving schemes practical enough to use in real systems. Specifically, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a technique that provides a performance guarantee for control algorithms. We show that our method works well for all tested cases, even with previously proposed algorithms that are not performance-aware. (2) We propose a new control algorithm, Performance-directed Dynamic (PD), that dynamically adjusts its thresholds periodically, based on available slack and recent workload characteristics. For memory, PD consumes the least energy, when compared to previous hand-tuned algorithms combined with a performance guarantee. However, for disks, PD is too complex and its self-tuning is unable to beat previous hand-tuned algorithms. (3) To improve on PD, we propose a simple, optimization-based, threshold-free control algorithm, Performance-directed Static (PS). PS periodically assigns a static configuration by solving an optimization problem that incorporates information about the available slack and recent traffic variability to different chips/disks. We find that PS is the best or close to the best across all performance-guaranteed disk algorithms, including hand-tuned versions.

The page miss ratio curve(MRC), i.e. page miss rate vs. memory size curve, is a good performance-directed metric to serve this purpose. However, dynamically tracking MRC at run time is challenging in systems with virtual memory because not every memory reference passes through the operating system (OS). This paper proposes two methods to dynamically track MRC of applications at run time. The first method is using a hardware MRC monitor that can track MRC at fine time granularity. Our simulation results show that this monitor has negligible performance and energy overheads. The second method is an OS-only implementation that can track MRC at coarse time granularity. Our implementation results on Linux show that it adds only 7-10% overhead. We have also used the dynamic MRC to guide both memory allocation for multiprogramming systems and memory energy management. Our real system experiments on Linux with applications including Apache Web Server show that the MRC-directed memory allocation can speed up the applications' execution/response time by up to a factor of 5.86 and reduce the number of page faults by up to 63.1%. Our execution-driven simulation results with SPEC2000 bench-marks show that the MRC-directed memory energy management can improve the Energy * Delay metric by 27-58% over previously proposed static and dynamic schemes.

Therefore, the mixture of fuels provided and their individual flux must be tightly orchestrated to cope with changing physiological needs. In exercising mammals, metabolic rate-expressed relatively to the aerobic maximum: %VO2 max-determines what mixture of oxidative fuels is being used. This simple model of fuel selection accurately predicts the relative contributions of lipids and carbohydrates to total metabolism, and it applies widely across body sizes, aerobic capacities, and even to exercise in hypoxic environments. However, it is also becoming obvious that significant exceptions to this pattern exist in other vertebrates that rely more heavily on lipids (e.g., migrating birds) or proteins (e.g., migrating salmonids), or for stresses other than exercise (e.g., cold exposure in mammals). Instantaneous fuel use is determined by multiple interacting mechanisms involving fuel availability, storage location, muscle recruitment, fiber recruitment within each muscle, and metabolic pathway selection within each fiber. These various mechanisms are being characterized in more detail to try designing a general model of fuel selection applicable to a wider range of animals and physiological stresses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We then calculate the similarity distances of every two photos, and perform photo album sorting and adaptive clustering algorithms to group the most similar photos together. We further compress those clustered photos by a MPEG-like algorithm with variable IBP frames and adaptive search windows.

In 1978, a committee established by the American Chemical Society Division of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology (DNCT) surveyed both the status and future needs and supplies of manpower in nuclear and radiochemistry in the United States. The survey concluded that 1) the numbers of nuclear and radiochemistry faculty members were decreasing, 2) there were few practicing radiochemists, 3) negative public perception had Led to a student's reluctance to enter the field, and 4) the supply of students trained in these and related areas fell far short of meeting the projected national needs. In 1988, participants from academic institutions, national laboratories, the nuclear power industry, the nuclear medicine community, the pharmaceutical industry, and government met to examine the status of education in nuclear and radiochemistry. In their report, each panel came to a similar conclusion: there was a serious shortage of chemists with a background in nuclear and radiochemistry and bona fide nuclear and radiochemists. Each of the panels addressing national needs listed education as a top priority action item. In 1998 members of the Senior Scientists and Engineers of the American Association for the Advancement of Science presented their report on ""The Education and Training of Isotope Experts"" to the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of representatives. The object of the study was to ""determine whether the U.S. educational base for preparing isotope experts had recovered from the serious decline of the past two decades."" They ""found no recovery from the very serious diminution of the U.S. educational capability in isotope science and technology."" From the 30 institutions in nuclear and radiochemistry responding to their survey, the data for numbers of graduates and numbers of full-time faculty showed no improvement from the previous 1987 survey. Of particular concern is the impact that thefading of the central, basic area of nuclear and radiochemistry has on nuclear medicine, radiobiology, radiopharmaceuticals, and radiopharmacy. According to the 1998 AAAS , report,3 there is an unsustainable ratio between the large numbers of patients who benefit from nuclear medicine and the currently tiny number of ""teachers of teachers"" in an indispensable part of the base from which these benefits flow. Similarly, a 2002 report observed that, while the spectacular benefits of nuclear and molecular imaging and targeted radiotherapy have long been recognized and are becoming more commonplace, there is a major inadequacy of supply of radiochemists and radiopharmacists to meet the ever increasing demands in the U.S. and around the world. In sharp contrast to the national trend in radiochemistry education, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri at Columbia has expanded from one (Dr. Jurisson) to four radiochemistry faculty members over the last four years. Drs. Lever and Robertson joined the Chemistry faculty in 2000 and Dr. Duval joined the faculty in 20.01. Drs. Lever and Robertson hold joint appointments at the University of Missouri 10 MW Research Reactor (MURR) and Dr. Duval's position was made possible through a grant from the DOE REAP program. The investment by the Department in radiochemistry is already reaping benefits through, for example, increases in the number of students (at both the undergraduate and graduate levels) being trained in radiochemistry, the establishment of the University of Missouri Nuclear Science and Engineering Institute (NSEI), new courses being offered in Chemistry and the NSEI, and the creation of a NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program in Radiochemistry. The presence of four radiochemistry faculty members in the department provides ""critical mass"" for addressing multi-disciplinary projects and gives students an opportunity to be exposed to many facets of nuclear and radiochemistry research. Dr. Duval's research explores the inorganic chemistry of the actinides by probing new coordination environments. Topics of study include the speciation and solubility of actinide ions in various aqueous media and the development of new separation techniques for fuel processing and waste remediation. Dr. Jurisson's research interests involve two very different, yet related, areas of radioinorganic chemistry. One area focuses on the utilization of gamma and beta emitting radiometals in the development of potential diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. The second area addresses methods for the detection and separation of radiometals, in particular technetium-99, for minimization and safe storage of radioactive waste. Dr. Lever's research focuses on the design and synthesis of metal-based radiotracers for biomedical applications and, more recently, on the process of in vivo complexation, where an administered chelating agent is used to rid the body of an unwanted metal (chelation therapy), Dr. Robertson's research is focused on the development of radionuclear methods of analysis and the subsequent application of these techniques to fundamental problems in a variety of areas.

In the low Ni alloy the thermal hysteresis expanded with increasing stress while in the high Ni alloy the thermal hysteresis contracted with increasing stress. The results in both cases meet the limit obtained from Differential Scanning Calorimetry at zero stress. The changes are attributed to the relaxation of elastic stored energy which is primarily due to dislocations emanating at martensite/austenite interfaces. Modifications in thermodynamics formulation are proposed to account for the change in hysteresis via change in the elastic stored energy. Memory effects due to dislocation arrangements imposed under high stress thermal cycles on subsequent thermal hysteresis under low stresses were found to be significant, while variations in thermal hysteresis from cycle to cycle under constant stress are noted to be rather small. © EDP Sciences.",,"Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Nickel alloys; Single crystals; Stress analysis; Titanium alloys; Constant stress; Elastic stored energy; Martensite/austenite; Thermal hysteresis; Hysteresis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32744476562

An attractive idea is to aggregate a number of small size, environmentally compatible, generators close to the loads to supply both thermal and electrical power; this is the underlying concept of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). In this paper an optimisation algorithm is proposed to integrate many DG into a VPP which will be able to generate and sell both thermal and electrical energy. Suitable models are proposed to simulate electric and thermal productions, CHP plants, thermal storages, and the energy exchange with the Grid. The optimisation problem is here formulated as a nonlinear minimisation algorithm with constraints, where the objective function is the variable cost associated with the supply of thermal and electric energy to the loads. A working example of application to a case study of a VPP complete the paper.","Combined Heat Power; Distributed Generation; Virtual Power Plant","Algorithms; Constraint theory; Electric power generation; Energy management; Mathematical models; Optimization; Combined Heat Power; Distributed Generation; Minimisation algorithms; Virtual Power Plants (VPP); Electric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044460402

Hybrid propulsion systems incorporating efficient energy storage not only allow the optimal operation of the engine at constant speed and load but also allow brake energy recovery. Ultra Light Rail is a form of transport that combines the environmental and user advantages of light rail with the cost effectiveness of bus operations. It is characterised by the use of small vehicles which can penetrate pedestrian areas safely and unobtrusively, and which are autonomously powered, so avoiding the cost and visual intrusion of overhead supplies and also the cost of track isolation and the need to relocate services beneath the road. ULR is therefore a viable option on routes where patronage is insufficient to justify conventional light rail schemes.

A major economic challenge for nuclear operation of the existing NPPs fleet in France is to improve nuclear fuel energy efficiency, that is to implement new fuel and core management in order to have longer operating cycles and to optimise the efficiency of nuclear fuel (from average 44 GWd/t up to 56 GWd/t in the next decade), to procure both an economic benefit and a reduction in spent fuel inventory. Regarding impact on fuel cycle, the choice in France has been to develop a closed fuel cycle: reprocessing of spent fuel, vitrification of high level waste and recycling of plutonium into MOX fuel loaded on twenty units and REPU fuel on two 900 MW reactors. Future progress are planned to improve the efficiency of both UO2 and MOX fuel (with higher plutonium content) and energetic equivalence with enriched UO2 fuel to be implemented in 2004. Increasing nuclear fuel performance, in association with the current reprocessing and recycling strategy using proven industrial facilities brings a major contribution to sustainable nuclear energy in France in the following respects : (i) Ensuring a safe confinement of high level waste by vitrification under a reduced volume; (ii) Reducing the quantity of spent fuel in storage; (iii) Maintaining the possibility in the far future to reuse the plutonium concentrated in MOX spent fuel; (iv) Maintaining the flexibility of future choices concerning back end and nuclear waste treatment. This strategy is then robust and flexible in term of flows and quantities of nuclear materials to be dealt with. It gives time and can be extended for the decades to come. It relies on mature and proven existing industrial tool to be amortised in the long run, which contributes to nuclear economics.",,"Electricity; Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; Nuclear energy; Performance; Sustainable development; Fuel cycle management; Fuel performance; Nuclear fuel energy efficiency; Nuclear fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044448135

NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development will bring the fuel cell cost to $400/kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also, the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change aim to reduce CO 2, NOx, and SO 2 emissions. SOFC's have no emissions so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFC's, reforming, energy storage - has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFC's for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO 2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications. This U.S. DOE fuel cell funding shown in Figure 1 is only for SOFC. If other U.S. agencies, Japanese, European, and industry cost share, SOFC funding is around $100 MM/year. The DOE FE SECA budget has shown strong growth since a small amount of funds were allocated for initial work in 2000. The SECA program has grown as earlier programs ended.

It is a clean source of energy. The water after generating electrical power is available for irrigation and other purposes. The first use of moving water to produce electricity was a waterwheel on the Fox River in Wisconsin in 1882. Hydro power continued to play a major role in the expansion of electrical service early in this century around the world. Hydro electric power plants generate from few kW to thousands of MW. They are classified as Micro hydro power plants for the generating capacity less than 100 KW. Hydro electric power plants are much more reliable and efficient as a renewable and clean source than the fossil fuel power plants. This resulted in upgrading of small to medium sized hydro electric generating stations wherever there was an adequate supply of moving water and a need for electricity. As electricity demand soared in the middle of this century and the efficiency of coal and oil fueled power plants increased, small hydro plants fell out of favor. Mega projects of Hydro power plants were developed. The majority of these power plants involved large dams which flooded big areas of land to provide water storage and therefore a constant supply of electricity. In recent years, the environmental impacts of such large hydro projects are being identified as a cause for concern. It is becoming increasingly difficult for developers to build new dams because of opposition from environmentalists and people living on the land to be flooded. Therfore the need has arisen to go for the small scale hydro electric power plants in the range of mini and micro hydro power plants. There are no Micro Hydro power plants in Malaysia and the smallest category of hydro power plants in Malaysia is Mini Hydro with a capacity between 500 kW to 100 k\V. This paper discusses the conceptual design and development of a micro hydro power plant. The overall estimation and calculation of a 50 kW power plant has been carried out. Software is also developed using MATLAB to calculate the total head, discharge rate, type of turbine for the micro hydro power plants, once the capacity is known. © 2004 IEEE.","Fox River; Hydro power; Niagara Falls; Saw Mills; Software","Electric power generation; Electricity; Fox rivers; Hydro power; Niagra falls; Saw mills; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30944444364

G1V 2J3, Canada","Eastern Canada produces yearly about 7 million tonnes of corn stover on a dry matter basis (DM). One half of this biomass could be removed without any negative impact on soil organic matter replenishment and erosion protection against wind and water. However, some potential uses of corn stover (oriented strand board, bioenergy) require a low moisture content (10 to 12%) that is difficult to reach under normal field drying conditions. For this reason, artificial drying of corn stover bales was investigated. After grain combining and partial field drying, corn stover was packaged as mid-size rectangular bales (0.81 m × 0.89 m × 1.52 m). A pilot-scale bi-directional batch dryer was used to dry either 9 bales on one layer (0.89 m high) or 18 bales on two layers (1.78 m high). Corn stover bales had an average initial moisture content of 56% (range of 49 to 66%) and an average dry matter (DM) density of 117 kg/m3 (range of 87 to 144 kg DM/m3). One layer of corn stover bales dried during 40 h with air at 40°C (no re-circulation) and an additional 12 h with air at 67°C (with air re-circulation). Airflow direction was alternated every 8 h up to 40 h. The final average moisture content was 19%, with a range of 7 to 30%. Two layers of corn stover bales dried during 90 h with air at 61°C (89% re-circulation). The final average moisture content was 18% (range of 8 to 38%). After a one-week period for transport, storage and handling, six selected bales sampled at 75 locations indicated some re-hydration (4% units in exp. #1; 1% unit in exp. #2). Drying increased moisture content variation within bales (average SD of 13.2% after drying; 4.3% prior to drying). Estimated energy cost for drying from 55 to 12% moisture content ranged between $56 and $98/t DM depending on the type of dryer and the source of energy. Reducing the energy cost below $10/t DM would require field drying stover below 20% moisture.","Bale; Biomass; Corn stover; Drying; Harvest; Storage","Biomass; Drying; Erosion; Hydration; Moisture; Bale; Corn stover; Storage; Plants (botany)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044446810

G1V 2J3, Canada","A pilot scale batch dryer was built with a capacity of 6 mid-size bales (0.81 m by 0.89 m by 2.44 m per bale) on one layer or 12 bales on two layers. With a floor area of 2.44 m by 4.88 m, the pilot scale dryer included a 102 kW propane burner and a 12 kW blower located at the end of the air duct system, thereby creating a negative air pressure. The side walls were made of plastic film which adhered to the bales because of suction. A re-circulation duct returned a variable fraction of the output air to the input to improve thermal efficiency depending on the level of vapor saturation. Part of the dryer's originality lies in its bi-directionality, i.e. heated air can flow alternately from the top plenum downwards or from the bottom plenum upwards. Bi-directional airflow was automated by two pairs of gate valves installed in two incoming air ducts and two outgoing air ducts. Results from the summer of 2003 showed that one-layer batches reached an average moisture content of 12% in less than 5, 9 and 14 h with initial moisture contents below 21, 24 or 34%, respectively. Two-layer batches reached an average moisture content of 12% in less than 10 and 24 h with initial moisture contents below 21 and 30%, respectively. Total energy efficiency for water evaporation was as high as 49% with air re-circulation. Thermal efficiency excluding electric energy for the blower was as high as 55%. The difference between moisture content in the upper half and the lower half of bales was reduced with increased airflow inversion cycles. Because of lateral variation in final moisture content due in part to non-uniform initial moisture and bale density, some over-drying would be required to ensure that all bales are dried to a safe storage moisture level.","Airflow; Bale; Drying; Hay; Moisture","Drying; Electric properties; Fuel burners; Moisture; Plastic films; Propane; Airflow; Bale; Hay; Propane burner; Dryers (equipment)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044445638

One of the problems associated with the supply of corn stover to conversion plants is the delivery of feedstock at low storage and transportation costs. Corn stover has low bulk density and it is difficult to handle, store and transport. Experiments were conducted, where corn stover was compacted a in a piston cylinder with three pressures (5, 10, 15 MPa) at three moisture content levels (5, 10, 15% (wb)) to produce briquettes. The total energy requirement to compress and extrude briquette was in the range of 12-30 MJ/t. The briquette density was in the range of 650-950 kg/m3 increasing with pressure and biomass moisture. Moisture content and pressure had the significant effect on briquette density, durability and stability. Corn stover produced highly dense, more stable and durable briquettes at low moisture levels (5 and 10%) than at high moisture level (15%).","Briquettes; Compression and extrusion energy; Densification; Density and durability","Biomass; Densification; Density (specific gravity); Durability; Renewable energy resources; Storage (materials); Compression and extrusion energy; Corn stover; Density and durability; Crops; Biomass; Briquets; Corn; Densification; Density; Durability; Renewable Resources; Storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044438453

The objectives of this research were: (i) to propose a methodology for adequate use of electric traction in feeding industry; (ii) to apply the proposed methodology to a commercial animal feed industry; (iii) to compare the sizing using the present motor with the sizing based on the manufacturer's literature. This research was based on all the motor-load combinations of a feed mill located in the Minas Gerais State, Brazil. For each motor-load combination, each of the following was compared energetically and economically: (1) the current motor, (2) an alternative motor that kept the load index as high as possible, (3) a more efficient motor with same power rating, (4) a more efficient and adequate motor, and (5) a motor sized according to the technical literature. The main conclusions were: (i) the potential economic savings in electrical energy used by motors was around 23%. These savings were in demand and energy costs; (ii) the average load index for the motors in the industry audited were 48.6% which was considered to be too low. Only 23.3% of the total number of motors that were analyzed had a load index higher than 81.0%; (iii) as much as possible, it is advisable to study the possibility to optimize the number of functioning hours in order to save with the electrical demand bill; (iv) more restricted security factors are needed for dimensioning electrical motors.","Demand side management; Electric motors; Electrical energy and energy costs; Motor sizing","Electric energy storage; Electric motors; Energy efficiency; Demand side management; Electrical demand bill; Motor sizing; Agriculture; Agriculture; Electric Motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044438081

Contour maps showing hours below -10°C for the months of December, January, and February were developed to help effective planning and management of aeration to control insects that normally survive the winter. Two cumulative lethality index (CLI) models were developed to estimate mortality of laboratory-reared (diapausing without cold-acclimation) and field-collected (cold-acclimated, and diapausing with cold-acclimation) Indian meal moth larvae under changing temperature conditions. The CLI models were found to be useful for evaluating aeration management strategies. Simulation studies were conducted using 30 years of weather data for twelve locations in north- and east-central regions of the U.S. to evaluate different aeration management strategies for controlling Indian meal moth larvae. Temperatures of headspace-air and grain in the top meter of grain were simulated using an existing model for the period of December to February. The tested management strategies included no aeration, continuous aeration, and intermittent aeration by controlling fan operation. During aeration, air was pulled from the headspace downward through the grain (downward airflow). Among the tested management strategies, a fan control strategy that turned the aeration fan on when the temperature of grain at 0.4 m depth was greater than the headspace-air temperature was found to be the best aeration management strategy for managing Indian meal moth larvae in all tested locations. For this strategy, the CLI model indicated that 100% mortality of Indian meal moth larvae could be achieved at a grain depth of 0.4 m from the top grain surface in all locations. For this strategy, the aeration fan operated about 10% of the time from December to February. The average cost of electrical energy required for aeration fan operation with this strategy for all locations was 1.3 ¢/t (0.03 ¢/bu) based on an electrical energy cost of 7 ¢/kWh.","Aeration; Indian meal moth; Insect management; Stored corn","Bins; Food storage; Insect control; Low temperature effects; Strategic planning; Contour maps; Indian meal moth; Insect management; Stored corn; Grain (agricultural product); Aeration; Bins; Food Storage; Grain; Insect Control; Low Temperature; Planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044435400

Enzymatic addition did improve the ensilage process, as indicated by sustained lower pH, inhibition of clostridia spores, and increased lactic acid production. The middle particle size range (<10 mm) demonstrated the most promising results, although size reduction was not necessary for successful stover bioconversion.","Bioconversion; Clostridia; Corn stover; Ensilage; Enzyme; Lactate fermentation; Lactic acid bacteria","Corn stover; Ensilage; Lactate fermentation; Lactic acid bacteria; Bioconversion; Biomass; Fermentation; Organic acids; Particle size analysis; pH effects; Enzymes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044435398

Needed economy-of-scale requires an industrial, rather than a farm-scale operation, meaning 24/7 operation for 50 weeks a year. This study examines the logistics system needed to move round bales of grass hay from the production field to a 20 dry ton/h pre-processing plant. Bales are stored in satellite storage locations and hauled as needed to meet a weekly demand schedule. Two options are considered. Option 1 uses walking floor trailers which self-unload at the pre-processing plant, a system that emulates hay delivery at a large feedlot. Option 2 uses a removable frame that is lifted off the truck and loaded onto railcars. The railcars serve as a mobile accumulator to deiiver bales into the pre-processing plant, a system that emulates the use of a unit train to deliver grain to a large processing plant. One way to reduce satellite storage cost is to use each storage location (fill and empty it) twice during the year. This means that the production/harvest must be managed to allow filling twice per year. Hauling cost is 62% of the total cost for Option 1 and 52% for Option 2. Clearly this is an operation that needs further analysis. A more detailed study is underway to answer questions defined by this baseline study. Plans are to report these results in 2005.","Bio mass; Logistics; Management Systems; Optimization; Transportation","Biomass delivery; Conversion plants; Grass hay; Management systems; Costs; Crops; Logistics; Optimization; Plants (botany); Scheduling; Transportation; Biomass; Biomass; Conveying; Costs; Farm Crops; Grasses; Materials Handling; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30044434423

It is either different from ordinary small power DC MHD generators for power plants, or different from explosive MHD generators where its pulsed current width is in the microseconds order of magnitude. Operating principle of the PMHDG is as follows: fuels or oxidizing agents within two storage vessels are injected into a combustion chamber to combust by a pump and a valve, after waiting for the pressure (or density) of generated conductive electric MHD ascends some threshold value, a self-controlled valve in combustion chamber throat is opened automatically. As a result, conductive electric MHD passes into a generating channel in pulse to generate electric current. Obviously, control the amount of the working substance entering into the combustion chamber with the injector valve, and adapt the spring pressure of the self-controlled valve, then we can control the pulse width and obtain different values of high power to be used directly by electric launcher. Besides, this paper gave a theory-mathematical model in which some characteristics of the generator were expressed. This helps us to understand the relationship between various physical quantities about the generator, and provides a basis to research their mutual influences. In addition, in physical design of the circuit, we adopted a proper high energy density capacitor as auxiliary energy storage. On one hand, the generator can realize the self-excited generation by using the capacitor; on the other hand, the high energy capacitor is charged directly by the generator and energy store within the capacitor is realized, so as to form a generator-capacitor combined high power pulsed power supply, which can be used by high energy electric launchers. ©2004 IEEE.","Combined power supply of the MHDG-capacitor; Controlling valve; PMHDG; Self-excitation","Combined power supply of the MHDG-capacitor; Controlling valve; PMHDG; Self-excitation; Catapults (aircraft launchers); DC machinery; Electric equipment; Electric potential; Electron tubes; Energy storage; Pressure effects; Magnetohydrodynamic converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28444497125

With its 10 MJ distributed energy storage and a 6 m long launcher tube, projectiles with a mass of several hundred grams are accelerated to muzzle velocities greater than 2000 m/s. The fiber brush armatures are supported by a sabot made of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP), an orthotropic insulating material with the best mechanical performance found so far. If the muzzle velocity is intended to be substantially increased, the sabot material may reach its mechanical limits due to the high dynamic loading. Hence a precise understanding of the material behavior will be necessary, especially with regard to the failure mechanisms that occur. The mechanical behavior of the sabot is analyzed by means of numerical simulation combining two 3D-finite-element codes: the electromagnetic code MEGA and the mechanical dynamic code LS-DYNA3D. The Lorentz force computed by MEGA is introduced into LS-DYNA3D as a time-and space-dependent volumetric load inside the brushes. By calculating the stress-strain distribution of the sabot, the regions which are liable to fail can be identified. The simulation results are validated by comparison with the experimental work using the X-ray photographs taken at the muzzle of the launcher. © 2004 IEEE.","Electromagnetic propulsion; GFRP sabot; Mechanical loads; Railgun; Simulation","Computer simulation; Electromagnetism; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Launching; Numerical analysis; Rails; GFRP sabot; Launcher tube; Mechanical loads; Railgun; Projectiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28444479893

An electromagnetic railgun is a candidate that provides enhanced capabilities for indirect fire support with increased ranges and velocities. Additionally, improvements of logistics for ammunition handling and storage make the railgun an attractive solution for the next generation Naval Electric Warship Armament. The notional naval railgun at full scale will fire a 20 kg launch package at a velocity of 2500 m/s providing 63 MJ of muzzle energy. It is estimated that a 200 MJ pulse forming energy storage system (PFN) will be required to achieve the desired muzzle velocity and energy. A land based Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Facility can validate the notional railgun performance and pulsed power requirements. Components for the barrel, launch package, sabot and projectile designs will also be validated. Terminal effects can also be studied at the facility.

Based on conventional metallized film technology a compact 120 kJ capacitor with an energy density of 2 MJ/m3 was designed and tested with the electric requirements of the ETC gun. Both, performance and lifetime tests were performed with discharge currents up to 45 kA. These tests led to the certification of the capacitor design to be applied in the 120kJ ETC pulsed power supply module. In the next step improved material and winding designs were realized and tested in order to increase the current characteristics at similar energy densities. In the second design generation current magnitudes up to 100 kA at energy densities of 1.75 J/m3 could be certified for an active armor application. Ongoing developments and tests have the goal to increase the performance and identify the limits of this capacitor technology. In parallel standard capacitor designs are derived from the high energy density development program to be applied in e.g. multi megajoule capacitor systems for high current applications.

Results of these investigations are very important for improvement of characteristics of pulsed plasma generators (PPG) which are the main part of electrodischarge, electrothermal and electrothermal-chemical launchers. In course of experiments the influence of current rise rate and initial particle density on arc parameters was investigated and bright temperature of arc outer layer was measured. These experiments were performed under the following conditions: charge voltage of capacitive storage - 8.0-12.0 kV, stored energy - 140-400 kJ, discharge current - 200-600 kA, current rise rate - 109-10 10 A/s. The maximum particle density nmax, achieved after the adiabatic compression of gas was about 3.0×1022 cm-3. It was revealed that increasing in current rise rate causes reducing of arc diameter and increasing of its temperature. Experiment results permit to define the electric parameters of arc (arc voltage, arc resistance and strength of field) sizes of arc channel and discharge current density. Obtained experimental data permit to calculate the main parameters of discharge such as: temperature of arc channel, plasma conductivity and density of charged particles in arc channel. It was shown that increasing in initial particle density and discharge current rise rate leads to the significant increasing of arc temperature. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Electric currents; Electric potential; Energy storage; Gas generators; Gases; Hydrogen; Plasma applications; Arc parameters; Capacitive storage; Charge voltage; Particle density; Electric discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28444439949

The heat carrying media here is a Freon-22 refrigerant, rather than traditionally used water or air in the solar collectors. The liquid refrigerant is allowed to expand while passing through the collector coils, and evaporates by absorbing the solar energy. The compressor of the system compresses the refrigerant vapor and the hot refrigerant vapor is cooled in a condenser coil, which is immersed in the water tank, thus the water is heated. The condensed refrigerant is re-circulated through the evaporator and the cycle is repeated. The purpose of the study is to analyze the cycle, the performance of the system, and develop a model for the prediction of performance. Since water has a very high specific heat, the application where water heating is necessary draws a huge portion of the total energy input of a customer. Unlike the applications such as electric lights, which work only by electricity, water heating can be done by solar energy so that electricity can be saved. An analytical approach is adopted for the study of the system. The working cycle is developed, and the performance analysis of the whole system as well as the parts is conducted for various operating conditions. A mathematical modeling is developed and it is converted into a spreadsheet form in MS Excel, so that the performance at various conditions can be predicted. The meteorological data for Sacramento, CA with clear sky conditions is used throughout the study. It is observed that the thermal performance of the system is affected significantly by the variation of solar radiation, collector area, ambient temperature and compressor RPM. Better matching of the capacities of various components and operating control will result in superior results. It is observed that a combination of collector area of 2 m 2, compressor speed of 3000 RPM, storage volume of 150 liters, compressor output pressure of 2000 kPa and compressor rating of 250W gives good results. The predicted results indicate that high values of the COP and collector efficiency, ranging from 3.0 to 6.5 and 50% to 85% can be realized with low cost uncovered collectors. It is observed that the system gives an output of approximately 39 liters per hour with an approximate temperature rise of 30 C, on an average summer day.",,"Energy input; Heating system; Spreadsheet form; Water heating; Compressors; Computer simulation; Electricity; Heating; Mathematical models; Refrigeration; Solar collectors; Water heaters; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844519841

This paper explores these potential pitfalls from the perspective of the lengthy licensing proceeding for the Private Fuel Storage (PFS) facility, which has been ongoing since 1997. Under the new rules, the PFS licensing proceeding would have been conducted under the informal hearing provisions in Subpart L rather than the formal adjudication procedures of Subpart G. This could have had a significant beneficial effect in streamlining the licensing process. However, rule changes alone will not assure expeditious NRC licensing. The experience gleaned from complex licensing proceedings like the PFS case illustrates that applicants must take care to assure that the potential benefits from the rules are not undercut by the potential pitfalls that remain.",,"Licensing; Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); Private fuel storage; Fuel storage; Laws and legislation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear materials safeguards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27644534122

Designing and implementing such a file system for a sensor node faces various challenges. Sensor nodes are highly resource constrained in terms of limited runtime memory, limited persistent storage, and finite energy. Also, the flash storage medium on sensor nodes differs in a variety of ways from the traditional hard disk, e.g. in terms of the limited number of writes for a flash memory unit. We present the design and implementation of ELF, an efficient log-structured flash-based file system tailored for sensor nodes. ELF is adapted to achieve memory efficiency, low power operation, and tailored support for common types of sensor file operations such as appending data to a file. ELF's log-structured approach achieves wear levelling across flash memory pages with limited write lifetimes. ELF also uniquely provides garbage collection capability as well as reliability for micro sensor nodes. A performance evaluation of an implementation of ELF based on TinyOS and MICA2 sensor motes is presented.

Ranking highly among them are the steadily increasing accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the potential climactic changes associated with generating power needed to heat our homes, to drive our automobiles and to fly aircraft. As engineers we can contribute significantly towards making our world more livable by minimizing the damage to our environment. The School of Engineering at Stanford is active in helping to better understand and design the fundamentals of the next generation of power systems. We are addressing techniques to realize the coming of the 'Hydrogen Economy'. Developing means for hydrogen production, hydrogen storage and hydrogen utilization are just a few examples of projects we are exploring. Recent advances in micro and nano technology have allowed our students and faculty to participate in the realization process for future hydrogen fuel cell systems. Energy is just one of our targeted social needs. Another grand challenge we confront responds to the fact that, statistically, we will live longer than previous generations. To afford the cost inherent in living longer, we need to stay healthy and to work longer in our factories and offices. Retaining our mobility, being able to walk at all stages of our life, represents one primary issue we need to address. We have established research to better understand a broad range of questions including what it takes to delay the onset of diseases such as osteoarthritis. We are exploring design and manufacturing environments that are suited to realize next generation medical systems.

Static discharges under certain conditions can generate sparks that may have sufficient energy to ignite explosive materials and gases. Antistatic agents are chemicals that are applied to the surface of fibers, filaments, yarns to control the propensity of the textile materials to accumulate static electricity. The control can be achieved either by decreasing the generation of the electrical charge or by increasing the electrical conductance of the textile fibers. To get the highest efficiency, antistatic finish must be present on the fiber surface so that the fiber-surface conductivity is increased. The diffusion of antistatic finish into the body of the fiber must be prevented, or atleast retarded, otherwise, on storage, the efficiency of the antistatic finish will gradually decrease.

A large portion of this waste was not contaminated. Because this non-contaminated waste originated in the ""active area"" of the MDSN facility, it was routinely disposed of as low-level active waste. In 2002, MDSN undertook an initiative to develop and implement a more sophisticated and more economical waste management program. The Waste Diversion Program (WDP) ensures continued environmental and public protection, and reduces the demand on Canada's limited capacity for storage of radioactive material and the associated operating costs. The goal of the WDP is to reduce the volume of waste currently being shipped to AECL-CRL's Waste Management Operation as low-level active waste. The presentation discusses key elements of both the development and the implementation of WDP. It focuses on the following areas: The regulatory environment surrounding the waste disposal issues in Canada and abroad. Methods used by MDSN for determination of radionuclides. which could be present in the facility. Choice of equipment and calculation of individual alarm levels for each identified radionuclide. Key elements of the practical implementation of the program. CNSC Regulatory approval process. The bottom line - dollars and cents. The primary objective of the WDP is to ensure that only waste, which meets regulatory requirements, is diverted from the solid active waste stream. This has been successfully accomplished in MDSN's Cobalt Operations Facility. The objective of the presentation is to share the knowledge and experience obtained in the development process, and thus provide a guideline for other nuclear facilities interested in establishing similar proactive and cost effective programs.",,"Contamination; Costs; Laws and legislation; Radioisotopes; Regulatory compliance; Waste management; Non-contaminated waste; Nuclear facilities; Waste diversion program; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23944485185

Elements of the service clustering support are often constructed using centralized or hierarchical architectures, in order to meet performance and policy objectives desired by online applications. For instance, a central Executive node can be employed to make efficient resource management decisions based on a complete view of cluster-wide resource availability as well as request demands. Functionally symmetric software architecture can enhance the robustness of cluster-based network services due to its inherent absence of vulnerability points. However, such a design must satisfy performance requirements and policy objectives desired by online services. This paper argues for the improved robustness of functionally symmetric architectures and presents the designs of two specific clustering support elements: energy-conserving server consolidation and service availability management. Our emulation and experimentation on a 117-server cluster show that the proposed designs do not significantly compromise the system performance and policy objectives compared with the centralized approaches. © 2004 IEEE.","Cluster computing; Energy conservation; Network services; Peer-to-peer computing; Resource management","Cluster computing; Network services; Peer-to-peer computing; Resource management; Computer software; Decision theory; Energy conservation; Performance; Servers; Telecommunication networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23944468213

It represents the base material essential for each human activity and it should be hard to imagine the contemporary world without this phenomenon. How the electrical energy demand rises up, new power-producing equipments are built. Expect the nuclear and water power plants, the thermal ones belong to the most widespread in the world. They constitute very complex systems with the steam turbine as a basic unit in which the transformation of the steam thermal energy to the prime mover mechanical power takes place. Controlling this conversion, the considerable savings can be obtained. But the control algorithm should be simulated on the system model at first and only the successful results should enable its applicability in the industry. This paper describes the development of the mathematical model of the backpressure and condensing multipart turbine and the implementation of the other energetic components in MATLAB environment. The next purpose is the testing of the designed models in the SIMULINK tool. The comparison of the data provided by the models with the real data represents the last goal.","Identification; Mathematical model; Simulation; Steam turbine","Computer simulation; Costs; Electric energy storage; Geothermal power plants; Mathematical models; Multivariable control systems; Back pressures; MATLAB environment; Steam thermal energy; Throttling valves; Steam turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844525365

The LVL2 trigger starts from LVL1 information concerning pointers to restricted so-called Regions of Interest (ROI) and performs event selection by means of optimized algorithms. If the LVL2 is passed, the full event is built and sent to the Event Filter (EF) algorithms for further selection and classification. After that, events are finally collected and put into mass storage for subsequent physics analysis. Even if many differences arise in the requirements and in the interfaces between the two HLT stages, they have a coherent approach to event selection. Therefore, the design of a common core software framework has been implemented in order to allow the HLT architecture to be flexible to changes (background conditions, luminosity, description of the detector, etc.). Algorithms working in the Event Filter are designed to work not only in a general purpose or exclusive mode, but they have been implemented in such a way to process given trigger hypotheses produced at a previous stage in the HLT dataflow (seeding concept). This is done by acting in separate steps, so that decisions to go further in the process are taken at every new step. An overview of the HLT processing steps is given and the working principles of the EF offline algorithms for muon reconstruction and identification (MOORE and Muld) are discussed in deeper detail. The reconstruction performances of these algorithms in terms of efficiency, momentum resolution, rejection power and execution times on several samples of simulated single muon events are presented, also taking into account the high background environment that is expected for ATLAS. © 2004 IEEE.","ATLAS; Event Filter; HLT; Muons","Algorithms; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Computer software; High energy physics; Spectrometers; Event filters; High level triggers (HLT); Muons; Regions of interest (ROI); Trigger circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844518072

Polymer/carbon nanotube composites are processed into films, fibers, and bulk composites with significant mechanical and physical property enhancements. Single wall carbon nanotubes have high specific surface area, which can be further increased in activated carbon/single wall carbon nanotube composites. Such composite systems are promising candidates for supercapacitor applications. While single wall carbon nanotubes offer outstanding opportunities in materials development, many of the predicted properties can be achieved only if the nanotubes are well dispersed, exfoliated, and oriented in the polymer systems of interest. Currently, research is in progress addressing these issues in conjunction with the processing and characterization of polymer/carbon nanotube composites.","Advanced Composites; Carbon Nanotubes","Advanced composites; High-performance polymer composites; Single wall carbon nanotubes; Surface area; Carbon nanotubes; Elastic moduli; Electric conductivity; Energy storage; Field emission displays; Nitric acid; Sensors; Strength of materials; Composite materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844509289

This solid state device works on the simple principle of a thermoelectric generator operating in the temperature difference that exists between the ambient or surrounding temperature (nominally 290°K) as the thermal source and deep space at approximately 4°K as the thermal sink. Thus the Nighttime Solar Cell™ produces electric power continuously at night, and during the day utilizing one of several modes, depending on whether photovoltaic cells are used, reducing or eliminating the need for on-site electrical energy storage or power source maintenance. A thermal model has been developed from fundamental laws that predict the device can produce up to an estimated 17 W/m 2 as a remote electric power source, depending on site location. Several simple benchscale prototype cells have functioned well under all weather conditions. Field studies must now be performed with prototypes that have all the design attributes of the thermal model to demonstrate the usefulness of this reliable nighttime/daytime energy source.

Sensor deployments are characterized by non-uniform placement of nodes, intermittent node connectivity, and the aggregation and reliable transfer of a large amount of data as networks scale to larger and larger sizes. Operation challenges include efficiently utilizing battery powered nodes, dynamically selecting sample periods and equipment clusters of interest, integrating with existing sensing and analysis infrastructure and easily correlating faults identified by the sensor network back to key factory operations and equipment. Commercial aspects involve returning value to the organization with hardened network nodes and reliable network operation that easily justifies the sensor network deployment and operating costs. We will demonstrate a sensor network in the ultra-pure water facility of an Intel fabrication plant, including details on the fab vibration application, the hardware nodes, and the heterogeneous wireless network. The fab vibration application uses vibration analysis to predict and correct equipment failures before fab operations are impacted. The ultra-pure water facility has a diversity of pumps and metal infrastructure both in a gymnasium size room and in an outside open air area that require 51 nodes with 201 vibration sensors. Data samples of 6K bytes are taken periodically from each vibration sensor, forwarded to a central server, measured for velocity, spike energy, acceleration, and displacement, analyzed with FFTs and trend analysis, and compared against expected profiles. When the analysis detects vibration variations outside of normal operating parameters, the affected equipment is scheduled for preventive maintenance, and repairs are made during normal down times. The hardware nodes for the fab vibration application include battery-powered motes (Figure 1(a)) and line-powered gateways. The motes are powered by four C Cell batteries, use a 900 MHz transceiver, and support an RPM (Reviolutions per Minute) sensor and up to six vibration sensors. The gateways contain both a 900 MHz transceiver and a 2.4 GHz transceiver running 802.11b to bridge the sensor radios to the 802.11 network. Both motes and access points use heavy metal housings and are hardened for industrial use. Motes and gateways self configure into a heterogeneous wireless network on power up. Motes form an ad hoc network and cluster to gateways. Gateways form an ad hoc 802.11b overlay network and provide high-capacity data transport allowing us to scale the network. One of the gateways is connected to the corporate network through Ethernet. The motes are cycled through planned sleep and wake periods to alternately conserve power and perform vibration data acquisitions. Motes send the data to the gateways where it is aggregated and ultimately forwarded to a server for analysis and storage. Our demonstration includes the display of actual vibration data with real time updates from an Intel fab, together with hands-on samples of gateways, motes, vibration sensors, and RPM sensors used in the deployment. Overview of the network topology and physical deployment is also shown along with the key network technologies developed and used to run the vibration application. We also discuss current learnings from the deployment and future work.","Predictive maintenance; Sensor networks; Vibration analysis","Fabrication; Pumps; Transceivers; Vibration measurement; Metal infrastructure; Sensor networks; Wireless networks; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22744452283

This reserve must be appropriately activated by means of the primary frequency control (PFC). Nowadays, the new energy storage systems (ESS) are a feasible alternative to store exceeding energy for substituting the primary control reserve. In this way, it is feasible to combine this new ESS with power converter-based FACTS controllers. This allows an effective exchange of active power with the electric grid and thus enhancing the PFC. The current article presents the detailed models of power converter-based FACTS controllers with shunt and series connection to the utility system, i.e. Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) and Static Synchronous Series Compensators (SSSCs), both combined with SMES coils. Moreover, a three-level control scheme for these integrated systems is proposed and a comparative evaluation of performance of both controllers in the PFC is carried out. © 2004 IEEE.","Control techniques; Energy storage; FACTS; Modeling; Primary Frequency Control; SMES; SSSC; STATCOM","Algorithms; Bifurcation (mathematics); Electric fault currents; Electric lines; Electric potential; Electromagnets; Electronic equipment; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Control techniques; FACTS; Primary frequency control; SMES; SSSC; STATCOM; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22744444426

They can be used in applications much like batteries, only they weigh less and larger quantities of energy can be stored at relatively low costs through the use of large storage tanks. Whereas conventional fuel cells tend not to be as viable for operation at high pressures due to the costs and irreversibilites of compression of air to high pressures, regenerative fuel cells are capable of generating oxygen and hydrogen at the same pressure as the gas storage. Optimal operating parameters will typically mandate that fuel cell operation, electrolysis operation, and tank operation are all at the same pressure - the pressure will be the tank pressure and will depend upon the reserve of oxygen and hydrogen. Accordingly, the oxygen tank should be about one half the volume of the hydrogen tank so pressures remain the same as hydrogen/oxygen is consumed/generated.

The SPH method is commonly used in pin-by-pin mesh core calculations to reduce cell-homogenization error. The investigation revealed that the normalization condition of the SPH factor in the conventional SPH method is not appropriate for multi-assembly calculations in which different assembly types are adjacent. Since the conventional normalization condition does not incorporate flux discontinuity between assemblies, cell homogenization error in assembly peripheral region becomes larger. In the improved SPH method, the SPH factor is divided by an averaged ""cell-level"" discontinuity factor obtained in each fuel assembly. Though the SPH factor is somewhat changed from the conventional value, no additional homogenization parameters (e.g. discontinuity factor) is necessary in core calculations. Test calculations were carried out in a simplified one-dimensional slab and two-dimensional PWR colorset geometries. The calculation results showed that the improved SPH method effectively reduce the cell-level homogenization error especially in assembly peripheral region. Since we can easily implement the improved SPH method by slight code modifications, it can be a promising candidate of the cell-homogenization method for pin-by-pin core calculations.","Generalized equivalence theory; Multi-assembly calculation; Pin-by-pin core calculation; SCOPE2; SPH factor; SPH method","Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Magnetic flux; Mathematical models; Neutrons; Nuclear fuels; Parameter estimation; Generalized equivalence theory; Multi-assembly calculations; Pin-by-pin core calculation; SCOPE2; SPH factor; SPH methods; Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22344455313

One of the main proposed applications of hydrogen is its use as ecologically clean fuel in transportation. The results obtained from the application of both density functional theory-based and atomistic molecular dynamic simulations were presented to the study of chemi- and physisorption of hydrogen by single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), and of the effect exerted by the presence of CO, a well-known poison for fuel cell. The small number of H2 molecules sucked into the nanotube stays inside, and are organized in concentric rings, as are those outside the carbon tube. At 298 K, the rings are destroyed, the attractive energy of nonbonding interactions being too small to counteract the destruction caused by thermal vibration and diffusion. The potential energy of the SWNT/CO system is much lower than that of the corresponding hydrogenated system, indicating the stronger affinity of CO for the carbon tube.

In order to test and simulate the immunity of electronic circuits to an EMI environment, an Electrical Fast Transient/Burst generator has been developed which generates broadband interference spectrum in the range of 20MHz to 600MHz. The Burst Generator is mainly comprised of coaxial cables, pressurized spark gaps, a HV Power Supply, a terminating resistor and a TEM Horn which acts as load. For pulse sharpening, switching has been done at two stages. Depending upon the delay time of coaxial line, the width of the square wave pulse has been kept at 50ns.

These initial tests led to the modification of the PBFA II machine to provide high currents rather than the high voltage it was initially designed for. The success of z-pinch for high energy density physics experiments insured a new mission for the converted accelerator, known as Z since 1997. Z now provides a unique capability to a number of basic science communities and has expanded its mission to include radiation effects research, inertial confinement fusion and material properties research. To achieve continued success, the physics community has requested higher peak current, better precision and pulse shaping versatility be incorporated into the refurbishment of the Z machine, known as ZR. In addition to the performance specification for ZR of a peak current of 26 MA with an implosion time of 100 ns, the machine also has a reliability specification to achieve 400 shots per year. While changes to the basic architecture of the Z machine are minor, the vast majority of its components have been redesigned. Moreover the increase in peak current from its present 18 MA to ZR's peak current of 26 MA at nominal operating parameters requires significantly higher voltages. These higher voltages, along with the reliability requirement, mandate a system assessment be performed to insure the requirements have been met. This paper will describe the System Assessment Test Program (SATPro) for the ZR project and report on the results. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Energy density; Peak load current; System assessment tests; Z-pinches; Data acquisition; Differentiating circuits; Electric generators; Electric power measurement; Energy storage; Fusion reactions; Particle accelerators; Particle beams; Pulse shaping circuits; Radiation effects; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22244471736

The long term goals of the research at MUTTS are to improve the multichanneling reliability and jitter of the switch when the electrode rings in the cascade section are either increased in number or in diameter. Multichanneling is important for two main reasons: 1) a reduction of electrode wear and 2) reduced inductance. The test facility provides a high voltage/high current test bed for a number of experiments that are easily scalable to large accelerators, such that, we expect the results to be directly applicable to the requirements of the Z and ZR accelerators. The first series of shots at MUTTS included dummy load and open load configurations to determine parasitic circuit elements. Diagnostics include monitoring the load current and Marx total current, voltage at the Marx output, load, and Marx trigger unit. Equivalent series resistance, series inductance, Marx capacitance, and shunt resistance were determined from these diagnostics.

The active converter comprises two SGs (chopper and peaker), an additional Ins PFL and a secondary decoupling inductor for resonant charging of the second PFL. The peaking SG and active converter are set in one body and operate in N2 at pressure up to 6MPa. Weighing less than 10kg, the converter generates bipolar subnanosecond pulses having peak-to-peak amplitude up to 270kV on a 46.6Ω load at operation with Radan. The pulsewidth of each half wave of bipolar pulses on FWHM is 280ps at the rise time of the first half wave of about 160ps. The SGs' gaps can be regulated without system depressurizing (a technique adopted from [3]). Circuit analysis accounting for the distributed character of the components and numerous parasitic parameters is presented. Voltage measurement means, including several capacitive dividers, Rogowski coils, attenuators and connection cables, were time-domain calibrated using ultrafast high voltage solid-state pulsers. Waveforms probed at different locations of the pulser systems, from the SOS-generator and from the Radan to the load, are presented. The bipolar subnanosecond pulses had very stable rise, while the fall jitter was around 50ps. The experimental results are in fair agreement with the simulation. Pulsers were tested with a TEM horn antenna. An effective potential of about 900kV was obtained. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Bipolar integrated circuits; Electric attenuators; Electric coils; Electric converters; Electric inductors; Electric network analysis; Energy storage; Stresses; Switching; Bipolar subnanosecond pulses; Energy density; Power switching; Rogowski coils; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22244438915

The inventory of highly enriched uranium, declared excess to U.S. defense needs, has remained static over the entire time period, but the application of safeguards has continually evolved. All of the original IAEA safeguards equipment and software has been replaced or upgraded. Containment and surveillance equipment installed by the IAEA has been replaced over time. New personnel representing both the IAEA and the facility have rotated through the program. Material handling procedures at the facility have been periodically reviewed and tweaked as necessary. Health, safety, and security requirements have continually been strengthened, especially in light of the events surrounding the World Trade Center disaster of September 2001. The performance of a remote monitoring field trial required a minor configuration change to the storage area itself. Site needs to utilize a portion of the original facility for other purposes resulted in a redefinition of the facility. The inspection notification process has continually been enhanced to improve timeliness. In summary, over the course of over 100 inspections conducted during the last 10 years, nearly every aspect of the inspection process has changed to some degree with one exception - the material itself.",,"Inspection process; Nuclear materials; Safeguard equipment; Security requirements; Computer software; Inspection; Nuclear energy; Nuclear materials safeguards; Security systems; Uranium; Nuclear power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144497773

The inventory needed to be stabilized and repackaged for long-term storage to comply with Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 94-1. In 1998, the United States began negotiations with IAEA to develop methods to maintain safeguards as this material was stabilized and repackaged. The Design Information Questionnaire was revised and submitted to the IAEA in 2002 describing how PFP would be modified to accommodate the stabilization process line. The operation plan for 2003 was submitted describing the proposed schedules for removing materials for stabilization. Stabilization and repackaging activities for the safeguarded plutonium began in January 2003 and were completed in December 2003. The safeguards approach implemented at the Hanford Site was a combination of the original baseline approach augmented by a series of five vault additions of stabilized materials followed by five removals of unstabilized materials. IAEA containment and surveillance measures were maintained until the unstabilized material was removed. Following placement of repackaged material (most from the original safeguarded stock) into the storage vault, the IAEA conducted inventory change verification measurements and then established containment and surveillance. As part of the stabilization campaign, the IAEA developed new measurement methods and calibration standards representative of the materials and packaging. The annual physical inventory verification was conducted on the normal IAEA schedule following the fourth additional/removal phase. Plant activities and the impacts on operations are described.","Hanford; IAEA Safeguards; Plutonium; Stabilization","Fissile materials; Plutonium finishing plan (PFP); Safeguard stocks; Stabilized materials; Calibration; Inspection; Inventory control; Nuclear energy; Nuclear materials safeguards; Plutonium; Scheduling; Nuclear power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144494173

Key point of this concept is to launch water and convert this into hydrogen and oxygen, using solar power. These propellants can be used for attitude and orbit control as well as to generate electrical power through a fuel cell. The easy handling of water will greatly reduce the launch and preparation costs and enhance flexibility in comparison with the toxic monopropellants, while the system also promises mass reductions. These mass reductions are induced by the dual use of one component for various functions, like water for propulsion, energy supply and thermal control or tanks as propellant storage and structural components.

We focus our study on the existence of magnetic structures and topological elements that are associated with eruptive events in the corona. We first observe a twisted flux tube in active region (AR) 8151 which is associated with an eruption. The kink instability is the important mechanism to release the magnetic energy easily stored in a twisted flux tubes. And secondly we follow the time evolution of AR 8210 in which the complex topology and the photospheric transverse motions trigger some C-class flares. In AR 8210, two photospheric motions are considered as pre-flare phenomena: the clockwise rotation of the main sunspot and the fast moving parasitic polarity. Our observations imply that only the sunspot rotation is able to store a sufficient amount of magnetic energy to produce a detectable flare. The combination of photospheric motions and the existence of appropriate topological elements is also important for storage and release of magnetic energy.","Flares; Magnetic energy; Magnetic fields; Sun: corona","Aerodynamic heating; Current density; Electric currents; Magnetic flux; Magnetic storage; Sun; Topology; Vectors; X rays; Corona; Flares; Magnetic energy; Magnetic structures; Magnetic fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144446052

The inability to verify the declaration was due to significant quantities of HEU and LEU waste material contained in waste drums (total of about 20,000 drums). This waste had accumulated from several uranium processes at NECSA (enrichment of HEU and LEU, fuel fabrication, etc), stored at various locations, without traceability, or known content. The material is in various waste matrixes and drum sizes. Measures had to be put in place to ensure all waste remains traceable (particularly when moving on site). The only way to resolve the IAEA declaration anomaly was to quantify the material in each drum by assaying it with a waste assay system. The Department of Energy (USA) made an IQ3 Waste Assay System, including a comprehensive support program, available to South Africa at the end of 2001. This ultimately led to the first two measured batches of HEU containing waste drums (total of about 85% of the total declared HEU) being presented to the IAEA in 2003. This paper gives an overview of this ongoing project. Included is the background, preparations (drum registration on a central database, traceability of drums, gathering of waste information for proper IQ3 measurement and result interpretation), calibrations and validations, technical difficulties/challenges (to ensure that various matrixes and drum sizes could be measured), result capturing and reporting, and IAEA method of verification.",,"Assays; Fuels; Inventory control; Matrix algebra; Radioactive wastes; Storage (materials); Uranium; Fuel fabrications; International atomic energy agency (IAEA); Non-proliferation treaty (NPT); Waste drums; Nuclear materials safeguards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22144438704

For these low pressure changes, the three estimation methods evaluated (VBE, E&P TANK, HYSYS) agreed well for a majority of the facilities sampled. For the purposes of air permitting and emission inventories, an emission factor was determined which could be used to estimate flash gas emissions for all DEFS' low pressure facilities in New Mexico. For facilities with higher pressure changes, more variability was shown between the three methods evaluated.

Our study is related to an acidified pre-heated milk gels formation fairly often used to product soft cheeses and yoghurts. These gel materials formations require a tight control of the kinetic reaction parameters. To achieve the measurement a thickness shear mode quartz resonator technique has been used in the MHz frequency range. This method is singularly effective to ensure a complete and reliable follow up of the viscoelastic parameters (the storage -G′- and the loss -G″- shear moduli) of gel materials. Using a suitable model this technique gives access to a new accurate characteristic time tvs (named viscoelastic time). This time corresponds to the instant from witch the material is no more a Newtonian liquid. Using the Arrhenius and modified Flory-Stockmayer relationships the activation energy is extracted from the study of the gelation process at different temperatures. The experimental results of the G′ and G″ moduli are discussed in this paper on one hand versus temperature, and on the other hand versus glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) added to milk © 2004 IEEE.","Activation energy; Milk; Quartz; Rheology; Yoghurt","Activation energy; Elastic moduli; Newtonian liquids; Quartz; Resonators; Rheology; Gelation time; Milk; Strain response; Yoghurt; Gels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21644480573

Among many, is the energy homeostasis that is regulated through systems driving the animal to start or stop eating depending of its energy expenditure and storage. Animals such as rats are heavily dependent on their sense of smell to find and select appropriate food. The olfactory bulb (OB) is an intermediate level of the olfactory system receiving inputs from the olfactory receptors and transmitting them to higher brain structures. The OB is also a target for many higher brain centres regulating its activity through centrifugal pathways. It is therefore a first-choice structure for the modulation of the organism's ability to detect odours with a nutritional value, thus allowing the animal to find food. Indeed, several studies have shown that the OB activity is modulated by an alimentary odour in a hungry animal whereas it is not in a satiated animal. In this study, we have used a new approach to investigate the OB modulation in relation to the internal state of the organism. Orexin (ORX), a novel molecule, known to play an important role in regulating food intake and whose receptors are present in the OB, was applied directly on the OB while recording its activity. Results have shown that while the OB has a stable activity in control conditions when no odours are applied, a local administration of ORX modulates its activity in a majority of cells tested. This modulation is rapid (within a few seconds to a minute), reversible (the activity returns to a base level within minutes) and can be either an increase in activity or a decrease. While the mechanisms through which ORX could modulate the output of the OB are not yet understood, it remains a promising model to investigate how the internal state modulates the olfactory integration.",,"Alimentary mechanism; Olfactory bulb (OB); Orexin effects; Sensory integration; Brain; Cells; Mathematical models; Molecules; Neurology; Sensors; Microorganisms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21644455473

Global loop transformations play a crucial role in optimizing the memory accesses. By improving regularity and temporal locality of these memory accesses using loop transformations, data can be potentially stored closer to the datapath in smaller less power consuming memories. To steer the selection of which loop transformations to perform, high level memory estimation is used. In state of the art memory estimation techniques the mapping of data to different parts of the memory hierarchy are not considered since these decisions are made in later system design phases. However, estimates of these mapping decisions is crucial, since they greatly influence the consequences of different transformations. In this paper we propose a systematic methodology for hierarchical memory usage estimation which considers also future data mapping decisions for a memory hierarchy. The goal of the estimation is to evaluate global loop transformation decisions for different platforms and keep only the optimal decision (in terms of energy) for each platform. We demonstrate our methodology on a real- life multimedia video coder (QSD-PCM) which shows that for 1k layer one memory, a factor of 2 improvement in total energy can be achieved. ©2004 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Hierarchical systems; Mathematical transformations; Multimedia systems; Parameter estimation; Shape memory effect; Data reuse analysis (DRA); Data transfers; Global loop transformation; Incremental data; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21244501323

One of the challenging problems of the FESS is to stabilize the rotor which is very sensitive to outside disturbances and plant uncertainties. In this paper, a stabilizing synchronization design of the FESS is proposed by incorporating cross-coupling technology into the optimal control architecture, which can be decomposed into two problems: a robust optimal control problem to improve the synchronization performance of the rotor in the radial directions and a stability problem. The control scheme is based on minimization of a new quadratic performance index in which the synchronization errors are embedded. Stability of the control scheme is investigated through Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control technique. It is shown that with adequate control parameters the resulting control system can provide satisfactory synchronization performance, and the closed-loop stability can be guaranteed theoretically. Simulations on a compact and efficient flywheel energy storage system with integrated magnetic bearings demonstrate that the proposed approach is very effective to recover the unstable system when outside disturbances are present. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Closed-loop stability; Flywheel energy storage systems (FEES); Linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG); Optimal control technique; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Gaussian noise (electronic); Magnetic bearings; Power electronics; Problem solving; Synchronization; System stability; Theorem proving; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21244496490

Our focus is to understand the nanoscale dynamic behavior of thin lubricant films, related to the emerging field of nanotechnology, especially for achieving durability and reliability in the nanoscale devices. Our goal is to present a unified and hybrid description of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) experiment, mesoscopic interpretation, microscopic simulation tools, and molecular design tools available up to now. The experimentation and theory for the physicochemical properties of ultra- thin PFPE films are used to examine liquid film in the sub-monolayer to multilayer regime. Methods for extracting spreading properties from the scanning microellipsometry (SME) for various PFPE/solid surface pairs and the surface rheological characterization of PFPEs are examined. The interrelationships among SME spreading profiles, rheology, surface energy, and tribology, are given. Mesoscopic theories, including thermodynamics of evaporation and flow, stability analysis, microscale mass transfer, and capillary waves are introduced to describe thin PFPE film dynamics. Estimation of thin film viscosity enhancement from vapor pressure suppression by dispersion force is reviewed. The method for experimental derivation of lubricant spreading profiles from contact angles is summarized. The implications of capillary waves, or thermal fluctuations, at the surface of polymeric lubricant films are also discussed. The lattice-based, simple reactive sphere Monte Carlo (MC) technique for examining the fundamentals of PFPE dynamics is illustrated. An off-lattice based bead-spring MC model is also introduced to capture the detailed internal structure of the PFPE molecules, and the molecular dynamics method is implemented for a full-scale nanostructural analysis of PFPE ultra-thin films. By systematically tuning the endgroup strengths of PFPE, we examined the physicochemical properties for thin liquid films of the various PFPE/solid surface pairings. These tools accurately describe the static and dynamic behavior of ultra-thin liquid films consistent with experimental findings and thus are suitable for examining the fundamental mechanisms of lubrication in nanoscale devices. Application of the next generation head-disk interface design in information storage device is briefly considered.

This effect need be considered in MEMs, micro-machines, magnetic storage systems and other such situations where the surfaces are inherently smooth and loads are extremely low. Surfaces in these and many other tribological contacts may have sub-micron or even nanometric levels and the stochastic model for rough surfaces that typically applies to engineering surfaces is not suitable. The rough surface model in these circumstances must cover asperities ranging from nanometer to micrometer level and this essentially needs a fractal approach. The paper describes a theoretical study of adhesive wear at the contact between surfaces with nanometric level asperities at low loads using a fractal contact model and taking into account the surface forces. The model predicts wear between solids with wide range of material and surface properties. The results broadly confirm the experimental observation such as dependence of wear volume on normal load and also on adhesion due surface forces. Furthermore the fractal analysis gives a generalized solution and depending on the combinations of material and fractal parameters specific solutions, relevant to realistic situations may be arrived at. are obtained. Under certain parametric combinations high wear even under tensile load is predicted while near zero wear is expected for some another set of parameters. These predictions are certainly advantageous in the selection of surface and material properties in applications where loads are small and surfaces are ultra smooth.

At such low spacing new nanoscale forces act between the slider and disk, such as intermolecular and electrostatic forces, which must be taken into consideration. These forces can create dynamic instabilities in the flying head slider, which are detrimental to its ability to reliably read and write data. This paper reviews the recent trends in data densities and size reductions in hard disk drives, showing that the transition to nanoscale phenomena is about to occur. Simple evolutionary developments appear to no longer work for increasing the areal data density.

Long-distance cruising AUVs generally need an AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) power source characterized by high- energy density and high- energy efficiency. Fuel cells are the preferred AIP power source for small underwater vehicles and PEFC (Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell) have been adopted for ""Urashima"". It is understood that one of the main themes with fuel cell is storing the hydrogen, the metal hydride storage has been adopted for ""Urashima"" as a safer method of storing the hydrogen. In summer of 2002 the AUV ""Urashima"" successfully completed an autonomous 132.5 km long-distance cruise using large capacity lithium-ion rechargeable battery. In the meantime, a Closed Cycle PEFC (Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell) system with a metal hydride hydrogen storage system was developed as an alternative AIP power source in order to extend ""Urashima"" 's cruising range. The lithium-ion rechargeable battery was replaced by the Closed Cycle PEFC system and this system became the main power source of ""Urashima"" in winter of 2002. ""Urashima"", with its new power source (the Closed Cycle PEFC system) achieved the world's first and deepest fuel cell power source dive in summer of 2003 and completed an autonomous cruise of 220 km in spring of 2004.

Using a high time resolution, the program studies system operation and thus coverage of a home's heat and power requirements. The study is based on true 1-min values measured for the heat, water and power requirements in several single-family homes over a period exceeding 1 yr in each case. The program is suitable for simulating all relevant CHP technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines, Stirling engines, CHP plants with steam piston drives) in single-family homes, as a great number of parameters have been used to describe CHP plant components, boilers and hot-water storage facilities. For each minute of the year, the simulation program calculates the heat and power generated by the system and compares the values with the heat and power required. The values are added up for each day, each month and an entire year. With the high time resolution, it is possible to determine with adequate accuracy the share of the CHP power that can be used in the home, thus replacing power from the grid, and the share to be fed into the grid. Accurate determination of the own-consumption share is a major prerequisite for calculating the annual energy cost savings, which may be achieved with a CHP system compared to a reference system with central power generation and decentral heat generation using a condensing boiler.

The extreme rainfall affected mainly the Vltava river, where there is a cascade of dams used for energy generation. The increased level of downstream water flooded almost all the hydro units on the river. Some of the generators (the highest unit outputs are 100 MVA) were flooded with a few meters of water. One of the units, a 53 MVA generator-motor installed in a deep cavern under the river, was flooded under a 25 metre water column for several weeks. Five generators were repaired from three flooded power stations. This paper deals with experience gained during repairs of these hydro-generators and during similar repairs of generators performed some time ago in Africa.

Hydrogen can be produced from a wide range of sources, with potentially low environmental consequences. It can be used in both transport and stationary energy applications. Hydrogen is already in some 200 test vehicles and 50 fuelling stations around the world, stored as gas at pressures of between 21 and 70MPa, or in liquid form, and dispensed rapidly into buses and cars. To ensure safety and performance targets can be met, technology developments in all areas are required, including production techniques, storage tanks, piping, valves, gauges, dispenser nozzles and safety and monitoring equipment. While some developments are incremental, entirely new concepts are also being brought into the market, and opportunities arise frequently in providing solutions to new problems. Hydrogen's properties as a very light gas, with small molecules and the potential to embrittle or otherwise react with certain materials, render this area fertile for both research and practical solutions.

DG provides solutions to two long standing problems of power system operation: non-availability at all times of sufficient power generation to meet peak demands and the lack of capacity of existing transmission lines to carry all the electricity needed by consumers. Installing DG at or near a customer load can eliminate the need to upgrade existing transmission and distribution networks to handle the extra power requirement. The paper presents a model of the photovoltaic fuel generator (PVFC) for localized load management. Results obtained for dynamic and steady-state characteristics are presented and discussed. Photovoltaic systems employ direct current motors; therefore understanding of the system operation and the matching of the system components for a particular PV system, dc motor type, and load type are important factors of this system design. The performance of dc motor powered by PV generator connected the load, were analysed with respect to the transient (starting) and steady state operation.

Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are designed for highly scalable, self-organizing, and efficient distribution and lookup of data, whereby data is stored globally persistent. The range of values of the corresponding hash function is partitioned and each interval is assigned to a node of the DHT. Because the assignment of data to nodes is based on hash functions, one assumes that the respective data load is distributed evenly across all participating nodes. However, most DHTs show difficulties with load balancing as we will demonstrate in this paper. As a solution for this problem, we present a new and very simple approach for balancing stored data between peers in a fashion analogous to the dissipation of heat energy in materials. We compare this algorithm with other approaches for load balancing and present results based on simulations and a prototype implementation.

It consists in a single-phase AC-AC converter in a matrix arrangement, which keeps a continuous regulation in the output voltage. The proposed scheme has the capability to compensate up to 25% voltage sags and 50% voltage swells. Energy storage devices are not required by the AC-AC converter and it is connected between the AC mains and the load by using a series transformer. One of the advantages of this topology is that taps for the coupling transformer are no necessary to change the polarity of the compensation voltage. A four step switching technique is used to drive the AC-AC converter switches, executing snubber-less operation. The reference signal is generated using single-phase d-q theory, obtaining a fast response time and high regulation. Simulation and experimental results of a 5kW capacity, 127V, 60Hz equipment are presented. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electric potential; Electric transformers; Energy efficiency; Voltage control; Converter analysis; Power operations; Voltage sags; Voltage swells; Analog to digital conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544453284

The Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) is one of the major custom power solutions that are capable of mitigating the effect of supply voltage sags at the load or Point of Common Coupling (PCC). A UPQC-Q employs a control method in which the series compensator injects a voltage that leads the supply current by 90° so that the series compensator at steady state consumes no active power. However, the UPQC-Q has the disadvantage that its series compensator needs to be overrated. Thus it cannot offers effective compensation. This paper proposes a new control scheme for the UPQC-Q that offers minimum power injection. The proposed minimum power injection method takes into consideration the limits on the rated voltage capacity of the series compensator and its control scheme. The validity of the proposed control scheme is investigated through simulation and experimental results. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Electric impedance; Electric potential; Energy storage; Passive filters; Problem solving; Reactive power; Signal interference; Minimum power injection; Point of common coupling (PCC); Unified power quality compensators; Wide spread automation; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544449210

Radio communication is the overriding consumer of energy in such networks. Therefore, data reduction before transmission, either by compression or feature extraction, will directly and significantly increase network lifetime. In many cases, it is premature to begin implementing feature extraction techniques. Users do not yet understand in what forms interesting data will appear and consequently can't risk automatically discarding what they presume to be uninteresting. Moreover, computer scientists are only beginning to develop algorithms to collect spatially distributed features in situ. Even for the many application where all of the data must be transported out of the network, data may be compressed before transport, so long as the chosen compression technique can operate under the stringent resource constraints of low-power nodes and induces only tolerable errors. This paper evaluates a simple temporal compression scheme designed specifically to be used by mica motes for the compaction of microclimate data. The algorithm makes use of the observation that over a small enough window of time, samples of microclimate data are linear. It finds such windows and generates a series of line segments that accurately represent the data. It compresses data up to 20-to-1 while introducing error on the order of the sensor hardware's specified margin of error. Further-more it is simple, consumes little CPU and requires very little storage when compared to other compression techniques. This paper describes the technique and results using a dataset from a one-year microclimate deployment. © 2004 IEEE.",,"In network processing; Lossless compression techniques; Microclimate deployment; Sensor networks; Algorithms; Data processing; Data reduction; Feature extraction; Program processors; Radio communication; Sensor data fusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20544445373

Controlling the power inflow may enable also the reduction of the de-link energy storage, which will then lead to the replacement of the electrolytic capacitors with film capacitors, which have lower energy density meaning that the volume is similar, but will increase the ASD lifetime. In these circumstances, operation under unbalanced and distorted supply voltage as well as high dynamic operation of the ASD makes the control task more challenging.

Main purpose of KCPP is to test and to evaluate several different kinds of high power CPD (Custom Power Device) under the several power disturbance conditions before installing it in real site. We can generate typical power disturbances such as sag, swell, over voltage, under voltage and voltage flicker by using the proposed SSG composed of series inverter, energy storage DC capacitor, rectifier and voltage clamp circuit. Also we can generate the distorted voltage waveforms and the phase jumping waveforms by controlling the series inverter. In this paper, three kinds of control methods for the proposed 2MVA SSG are given. Typical voltage sag and swell waveforms are implemented by adopting simple control method. Also the voltage flicker is generated by changing the amplitude of the injected voltage in random. Owing to the limited bandwidth of the proposed SSG, high frequency transient waveforms can be obtained by using the open loop control. The simulation and experimental results are given to verify the operation of the proposed SSG.

In optimal control, the control strategy is sought that gives the best control performance. High stability and robustness against parameter changes are two important advantages of optimal control. By using the method of translating three phase bilogic PWM signals to three phase trilogic PWM signal, EMTP-RV simulations show that trilogic PWM signals produced by this method can optimally handle stabilizing feedback signals. The AC side inverter has been modeled within the separated d-q-frame. This proposed method enables the independent control of the active and reactive components of the supply current vector, and thereby the ability to adjust the grid real power and reactive power through control of the SMES. Comparisons with a voltage source inverter SMES show that the current source inverter exhibits faster recovery of the wind farm voltage following a disturbance in the wind farm transmission line than voltage source inverter SMES. © 2004 IEEE.","Current Source Inverter; Feed-forward; Optimal Feedback; SMES; State-space; Wind farm","Control equipment; Energy storage; Problem solving; Robustness (control systems); Superconducting devices; Transmission line theory; Current Source Inverter; Feed-Forward; Optimal Feedback; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage system (SMES); Optimal control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444449331

The tree-based multicasting scheme can be used. However, due to the short communication range of each sensor node and the frequent movement of sources and sinks, a sink may fail to receive data due to broken paths, and the tree should be frequently reconfigured to reconnect sources and sinks. To address the problem, we propose a dynamic proxy tree-based framework in this paper. A big challenge in implementing the framework is how to efficiently reconfigure the proxy tree as sources and sinks change. We model the problem as on-line constructing a minimum Steiner tree in an Euclidean plane, and propose centralized schemes to solve it. Considering the strict energy constraints in wireless sensor networks, we further propose two distributed on-line schemes, a shortest path-based (SP) scheme and a spanning range-based (SR) scheme.

These two robotic missions were aimed at examining the presence of water and, thus, any evidence of life, and at understanding the geological conditions on Mars. These rovers have been successfully assisted by primary lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries during the critical entry, descent, and landing (EDL) maneuvers. These batteries were located on the petals of the lander, which, unlike the Mars Pathfinder mission, was designed only to carry the rover. The selection of the lithium-sulfur dioxide battery system for this application was based on its high specific energy and high rate discharge capability, combined with low heat evolution, as dictated by this application. Lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries exhibit voltage delay, which tends to increase at low discharge temperatures, especially after extended storage at warm temperatures. In the absence of a depassivation circuit, as provided on earlier missions, e.g., Galileo, we were required to depassivate the lander primary batteries in a unique manner. The batteries were brought onto a shunt-regulated bus set at pre-selected discharge voltages, thus affecting depassivation during constant discharge voltage. Several ground tests were performed, on cells, cell strings and battery assembly with five parallel strings, to identify optimum shunt voltages and durations of depassivation.

The structural changes are observed as a dark region by a microscope with transmitted illumination. When the energy is close to the threshold for producing the structural change, it had a linear shape, and at higher energy, it had conical shape. We observed a phenomenon of increase of fluorescence intensity at the structural changes. The fluorescence intensity is higher than its surrounding auto-fluorescence of a fingernail. The spectrum of the increased fluorescence coincided with the auto-fluorescence spectra of a fingernail and a pure keratin. The increase of fluorescence intensity was also observed with the fingernail heated by a drying oven. It is suggested that the fluorescence increase of the structural change is most likely caused by locally heating caused by femtosecond laser pulse irradiation. We demonstrate the fluorescence increase of the structure is useful to read out three-dimensionally recorded data inside human fingernail. Furthermore, we demonstrate the fluorescence can be observed over a half year.","Biological tissue; Femtosecond laser processing; Three dimensional optical memory","Continuous wave lasers; Infrared radiation; Laser beam effects; Laser pulses; Lighting; Optical data storage; Optical pumping; Solid state lasers; Three dimensional; Tissue; Biological tissue; Femtosecond laser processing; Pulse duration; Three dimensional optical memory; Fluorescence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344400138

L9-24, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1191, United States","In this paper, we propose a new flywheel energy storage approach using micro-rotors that is safe and free of gyroscopic effects. Moreover, due to the micro size of the rotor, it will have higher specific energy/power and energy/power density than previously proposed flywheel systems and offers many advantages such as flexibility in size, shape and energy output characteristics. Thus, its application could range from small consumer electronics to automobile and aerospace applications. We call this Massively Micro Modularity (MMM) approach. In MMM approach, the storage device consists of many independently controlled tiny cells insulated from one another and thus is safer and more robust than one big flywheel. In each cell, energy is stored kinetically in tiny spherical or cylindrical rotor rotating at high speed and suspended by electrostatic instead of magnetic bearings. Energy is drawn from the rotating magnetic field emanating from the magnetized rotor side. The key to the advantages described above is the small size of the rotor. We show by analyses that as the size of the rotor decrease; the momentum that causes gyroscopic effect and stresses on the surrounding container reduces dramatically. Thus, the specific energy/power is closer to the flywheel theoretical limit due to a reduction in the weight of the structure needed to contain the rotor. Another consequence of the small rotor size is that it is more robust to environmental disturbances thanks to the use of electrostatic bearings. Unlike magnetic force that is proportional to volume, electrostatic force is proportional to surface area. As the rotor volume reduces, the control authority, defined as the ratio between the suspension force and the weight of the rotor, increases dramatically in the electrostatic bearing. To demonstrate the feasibility of such suspension concept, we successfully suspended a small rotating cylindrical rotor in one axis using electrostatic force while generating enough power from its permanent magnet to light up an LED for about 1 second. Finally, we discuss the various challenges as well as promises of this new technology and suggest future research directions.

The study considered a cylindrical tank with elliptical top and bottom. The tank wall is made of aluminum and a multi-layered blanket of cryogenic insulation (MLI) has been attached on the top of the aluminum. The tank is connected to a cryocooler to dissipate the heat leak through the insulation and tank wall into the fluid within the tank. The cryocooler has not been modeled; only the flow in and out of the tank to the cryocooler system has been included. The primary emphasis of this research has been the fluid circulation within the tank in both liquid and vapor regions for different fill conditions and for different distribution patterns of incoming cryogen from the cryocooler. Equations governing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved in the liquid and vapor regions. In the solid region, heat conduction was solved. The simulations were carried out using the finite element method. The steady-state velocity, temperature, and pressure distributions were calculated. The mass and energy balance at the evaporating interface was taken into account by incorporating the change in specific volume and latent heat of evaporation. A good flow circulation in the liquid region was observed when the cold entering fluid was made to flow at an angle to the axis of the tank or aligned to the bottom surface of the tank. The fluid velocity in the vapor region was found to be higher compared to the liquid region. Copyright © 2004 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We then present, analyze, and evaluate novel and lightweight solutions to both the storage and the querying sub-problems for time indexing. First, the time-indexed storage problem is formally defined, and two formulations are presented, seeking to optimize generic utility functions that are derived from concerns about energy, bandwidth usage, and storage balancing. We present and analyze decentralized protocols to solve these formulations, and prove the optimality of some of our solutions. Secondly, maintenance and use of simple overlays among rendezvous point nodes, in order to enable fault-tolerant and efficient time-indexed queries, are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented to quantify performance characteristics of the protocols, and we find that our proposed scheme has low query overhead that scales with system size and density while exhibiting very good load balancing and fault tolerance properties. ©2004 IEEE.",,"Data-centric storage (DCS); Rendezvous points (RP); Sensor networks; Time indexing; Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Fault tolerant computer systems; Network protocols; Problem solving; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344396353

Using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and power switching modules a scalable power system can be constructed for use on multiple deep space missions including future missions to Mars, comets, Jupiter and its moons. The key developments of the DSA power system effort are five power ASICs and a module for power switching. These components enable a modular and scalable design approach, which can result in a wide variety of power system architectures to meet diverse mission requirements and environments. Each component is radiation hardened to one megarad total dose. The power switching module can be used for power distribution to regular spacecraft loads, to propulsion valves and actuation of pyrotechnic devices. The number of switching elements per load, pyrotechnic firings and valve drivers can be scaled depending on mission needs. Telemetry data is available from the switch module via an I 2C data bus. The DSA power system components enable power management and distribution for a variety of power buses and power system architectures employing different types of energy storage and power sources. This paper will describe each power ASIC's key performance characteristics as well as recent prototype test results. The power switching module test results will be discussed and will demonstrate its versatility as a multipurpose switch.

Besides, available storage is scarce due to their small physical size. Therefore choosing the most storage- and energy-efficient block cipher for WSNs is important.

In this paper, we have identified the candidates of block ciphers suitable for WSNs based on existing literature and authoritative recommendations. We have benchmarked these candidates and based on this benchmark, we have selected the suitable ciphers for WSNs, namely Rijndael for high security and energy efficiency requirements; but MISTY1 for good storage and energy efficiency.

The processed structure in the fingernail surface is strongly dependent on focus position and irradiation energy of a laser pulse. A variety of structures depending on the focus position were observed. A sudden change in the size of the processed structure according to the irradiation pulse energy is also observed. From a linear theoretical estimation based on the diffraction of a laser beam, we found that the sudden change is mainly due to the diffraction pattern generated by the circular aperture of an objective lens. The processing feature is investigated by comparing the structures processed in a fingernail with those processed in glass.","Ablation; Biological tissue; Femtosecond laser processing; Nano-processing; Optical memory","Diffraction; Laser ablation; Laser beam effects; Laser pulses; Nanotechnology; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Optimization; Reflection; Surfaces; Tissue; Transparency; Biological tissue; Femtosecond laser processing; Fingernails; Nano-processing; Optical memory; Solid state lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344377400

Increased use of modularity and on-board intelligent technologies will enable these lofty goals. To support this new paradigm, an advanced technology program to develop modular, intelligent power management and distribution (PMAD) system technologies is presented. The many benefits to developing and including modular functionality in electrical power components and systems are shown to include lower costs and lower mass for highly reliable systems. The details of several modular technologies being developed by NASA are presented, broken down into hierarchical levels. Modularity at the device level, including the use of power electronic building blocks, is shown to provide benefits in lowering the development time and costs of new power electronic components. At the functional component level, modularity decreases costs and mass while increasing fault tolerance and reliability. The concept of ""true modularity"" is introduced describing the need for distributed, master-less solutions in developing modular power components. Ultimately, the development of system-level modular technologies can result in highly reconfigurable and interoperable systems that are able to seamlessly share resources and burdens. To achieve the modular visions presented, digital control and peer-to-peer communications are required. These modern capabilities applied to power electronics will finally enable the on-board autonomy and health management required for reliable electrical power systems operating far from Earth for long periods of time. Summary results from recent development efforts are presented along with expected future technology development needs required to support NASA's new Human and Robotic Space Exploration Initiative.",,"Interoperable systems; Modular vision; Power management and distribution (PMAD); Subsystems; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Power electronics; Aerospace engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344364662

This paper describes how additional energy storage can be provided within the existing wind turbine system by allowing the turbine speed to vary over a wider range. It also addresses the stability issue due to the modified control requirements. A control algorithm is proposed for a typical, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) arrangement and a simulation model is used to assess the ability of the method to smooth the output power. The disadvantage of the method is that there is a reduction in energy capture relative to a maximum power tracking algorithm.

Moreover, modern technologies provide various types of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), constituted by small size generators and storage systems, that generate in direct current, such as photovoltaic arrays, fuel cells, storage, or that need dc section before the interfacing with the ac network (microturbines, variable speed wind generators, flywheels). It can be thought to integrate the various generators, storage systems and dc loads in a local dc distribution network, that is interfaced with public grid by means of one or more inverters. This solution makes easy the islanding operation of the generators. The aim of this work is to analyze a local dc distribution system both with diode and IGBT bridge interface converter in the presence of small scale generation and storage systems. After a suitable modeling of the entire system, some simulation results will be given. ©2004 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resources; Islanding Operation; Local dc Distribution Systems","Arrays; Computer simulation; Electric converters; Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Insulated gate bipolar transistors; Photovoltaic effects; Distributed Energy Resources (DRE); Islanding operation; Local dc distribution systems; Photovolataic arrays; Electric network analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19644397002

A single application may have many different phases during its lifetime, and workload mixes show interleaved phases. This work examines and uses the differences between memory- and CPU-intensive phasex to reduce power. Today's processors provide resources that are underutilized during memory-intensive phases, consuming power while producing little incremental gain in performance. This work examines a deployed system consisting of identical cores with a goal of running each one at a different effective frequency. The initial goal is to find the appropriate frequency at which to run each phase. This paper demonstrates that memory intensity directly affects the throughput of applications. The results indicate that simple metrics such as IPC (instructions per cycle) cannot be used to determine what frequency to run a phase. Instead, it uses performance counters which directly monitor memory behavior to identify. Memory-intensive phases can then be run on a slower core without incurring significant performance penalties. The key result of the paper is the introduction of a very simple, online model that uses the performance counter data to predict the performance of a program phase at any particular frequency setting. The information from this model allows a scheduler to decide which core to use to execute the program phase. Using a sophisticated power model for the processor family shows that this approach significantly reduces power consumption. The model was evaluated using a subset of SPECCPU and the SPECjbb and TPC-W benchmarks. It predicts performance with an average error of less than 10%. The power modeling shows that memory-intensive benchmarks achieve up to a 58% power reduction at a performance loss of less than 20% when run at 80% of nominal frequency. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Frequency setting; Heterogeneous processors; Memory-intensity levels; Schedulers; Data reduction; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Error analysis; Frequencies; Online systems; Product design; Integrated circuit layout",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19644379080

As the liquid pressure is decreased, gases dissolved in the liquid may be released from solution (""flashed"") and can be emitted directly to the atmosphere through storage tank vents. At present, there is no universally accepted method for estimating flash emissions for gas gathering and processing facilities. Flash emissions from storage tanks are in addition to working and breathing losses. Duke Energy Field Services, LP (DEFS) recently conducted an evaluation seeking to determine a practical method for estimating flash emissions at its natural gas gathering and processing facilities in New Mexico for air permitting and emission inventory purposes. The study evaluates and compares several currently recognized methods of estimating flash emissions from atmospheric condensate storage tanks. This evaluation found that for DEFS' facilities in New Mexico with low pressure separators (<30 psig) and atmospheric storage tanks, flash gas emissions were estimated to typically be less than 15 tons per year. For these low pressure changes, the three estimation methods evaluated (VBE, E&P TANK, HYSYS) agreed well for a majority of the facilities sampled. For the purposes of air permitting and emission inventories, an emission factor was determined which could be used to estimate flash gas emissions for all DEFS' low pressure facilities in New Mexico. For facilities with higher pressure changes, more variability was shown between the three methods evaluated. This variability seems to be strongly related to the composition of the pressurized liquid.",,"Duke Energy Field Services (CO); Natural gas liquids (NGL); Pressurized organic liquids; Vasquez-Beggs Equation (VBE); Compressors; Environmental protection; Gas fuel storage; Gas industry; Geographical regions; Natural resources exploration; Pressure drop; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944382510

It is confirmed that the higher thermal stress, the higher the Qbd failure rate. Even though the mechanism of Si epitaxy growth is not fully understood, the process induced stress at the corner of STI should be a major factor. The driving force of this Stress Induced Si Epitaxy (SISE) is a localized thermodynamical instability. This SISE can be suppressed with lower thermal budget using Rapid Temperature Anneal (RTA) for the densification of HDP oxides, instead of the furnace anneal in our 0.15um embedded Flash memory process.

We propose that the SISE induced high compressive stress causes the Co suicide to decompose into Co and Si to reduce the free energy of the poly gate/Co suicide region. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Flash memory devices; High voltage oxides; Silicide; Stress induced Si epitaxy (SISE); Data storage equipment; Densification; Epitaxial growth; Logic gates; Plasmas; Reliability; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; Voltage measurement; Silicon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18844377140

These kinds of pyrotechnic shock devices produce transient loads with high levels of acceleration at different location of satellite. The prediction of acceleration level is significant for the definition of payload shock environment in the earlier design phase and selection of proper accelerometers in the test. This paper summarizes the shock response spectrum (SRS) from the pyrotechnical testing data of several typical satellites from the view points of distance from the source, complex equipment mount structure, etc. The empirical curve for the prediction possibility of pyrotechnic shock level is discussed. At first, the SRS distribution maps at the measure points were compared to understand the shock response environment which may differ from the distance attenuation from the shock source, effects of material and size of structural components, effects of joints and inserts of structural components, etc. Then, the paper discusses the prediction methodologies related to the empirical and extrapolation model presented by NASA-HDBK-7005 is compared to the testing data distribution of several satellites.","Distance Attenuation of Shock Response; Environment Test; Shock Response Spectrum; Shock Test","Distance attenuation of shock response; Shock devices; Shock response spectrum (SRS); Shock sources; Accelerometers; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Energy storage; Environmental testing; Extrapolation; Mathematical models; Shock testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18744378641

Hence, with low node mobility, traffic may concentrate on just a few nodes, which results in long end-to-end delay due to congestion at the nodes. Furthermore, since some specific nodes are used for a long time, their battery power may be rapidly exhausted. To resolve this traffic concentration problem, we propose a load balancing scheme called Simple Load-balancing Approach (SLA) that allows each node to drop RREQ or to give up packet forwarding depending on its own traffic load. Meanwhile, mobile nodes may deliberately give up packet forwarding to save their own energy.

This technique uses a new selective boost equalizer that detects batteries either at a very low state of charge (SOC) or at an extremely high SOC. In this system a set of electromechanical relays is connected in a matrix to route boost current to the weaker batteries. A 32-bit microcontroller is used to control the relay switching, and the boost current is supplied by a separate boost charger. Once a weak battery is detected, it is scheduled for a specific boost tune by a special ""round robin"" algorithm. The equalizer was tested on a pack of twelve series connected 12V 93 ampere hour NiMH batteries. Test results show that the equalizer was able to re-balance an artificially unbalanced pack, and the capacity was increased by 27% within six charge-discharge cycles. The number of cycles required to re-balance the pack was significantly reduced by using the ""round robin"" algorithm. ©2004 IEEE.","Batteries; Equalizer; Hybrid electric vehicle; Nickel metal hydride","Battery management systems (BMS); Equalization techniques; Hybrid electric vehicles; Nickel metal hydride; Electric potential; Electric vehicles; Electrochemistry; Energy storage; Equalizers; Lithium batteries; Nickel compounds; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17744396101

In this paper, we explore a more general design space for dynamic associativity (for a 4-way associative cache, consider 1-way, 2-way, and 4-way associative accesses). The other major departure is in the associativity control mechanism. We use the actual instruction level parallelism exhibited by the instructions surrounding a given load to classify it as an IPC k load (for 1 ≤ k ≤ IW with an issue width of IW) in a superscalar architecture.

The energy savings over SPEC2000 CPU benchmarks average 28.6% for a 32KB, 4-way, L-1 data cache. The resulting performance (IPC) degradation from the dynamic way schedule is restricted to less than 2.25%, mainly because IPC based placement ends up being an excellent classifier. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Cache architecture; Cycle times; Energy performance; Total processor energy; Approximation theory; Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Decoding; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Scheduling; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644425359

For this goal, way selection logic and specialized replacement policy are designed to enable only one way of set-associative cache as in the direct-mapped cache. Overall cache access time becomes almost the same as that of conventional set associative cache with accessing additional way selection logic. Because data array can be accessed without waiting for tag comparison, multiplexer delay can be removed totally. The simulation result shows that the proposed architecture can reduce a per access power consumption by 59% over conventional set-associative caches with average 0.06% of negligible performance loss. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Formal logic; Microprocessor chips; Natural frequencies; Block allocation; Cache structure; Data arrays; Performance degradation; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644416840

A specific challenge lies in the design of portable surveillance systems that can be rapidly deployed, installed and easily operated. Conventional surveillance systems typically employ standalone sensors that transmit their data to a central control station for data-processing. One of the disadvantages of these kinds of systems is that they generate a lot of data that may induce processing or storage problems. Moreover, data from the sensors must be constantly observed and assessed by human operators. In this paper, a surveillance concept based on distributed intelligence in wireless sensor networks is proposed. In this concept, surveillance is automatically performed by means of many small sensing devices including cameras. The requirements for such surveillance systems are investigated. Experiments with a demonstration system were conducted to verify some of the claims made throughout this paper.","Security; Sensor networks; Surveillance; Unattended sensors","Alarm systems; Data processing; Energy utilization; Feature extraction; Infrared devices; Military operations; Mobile computing; Optimization; Personnel; Security systems; Infrared cameras; Mobile surveillance systems; Sensor networks; Unattended sensors; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644413199

To exploit this slack, processors may implement more power-efficient, longer latency pipelines or provide dynamically scaled pipelines using multiple clock domains. Issuing instructions with slack to slower pipelines can result in substantial power savings, with minimal performance loss. Considering both dynamic and static power dissipation, we found that by using longer latency pipelines the power of functional unit pipelines decreases by 20% to 55% with a performance impact of 0% to 3% for SPEC2000 and MediaBench workloads.

A drawback of these schemes is that the unspecified bits are filled with random values resulting in a large number of transitions during scan-in thereby causing high power dissipation. This paper presents a new encoding scheme that can be used in conjunction with any LFSR reseeding scheme to significantly reduce test power and even further reduce test storage. The proposed encoding scheme acts as a second stage of compression after LFSR reseeding. It accomplishes two goals. First, it reduces the number of transitions in the scan chains (by filling the unspecified bits in a different manner), and second it reduces the number of specified bits that need to be generated via LFSR reseeding. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces test power and in most cases provides greater test data compression than LFSR reseeding alone. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Encoding algorithm; Power dissipation; Static compaction; Systems-on-chip (SoC); Algorithms; Computer graphics; Data compression; Electric power utilization; Encoding (symbols); Energy dissipation; Polynomials; Integrated circuit layout",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644397592

The device uses a single poly 0.15 μm CMOS process. The SER FIT rates have been measured from silicon with and without the triple well. In contrast to the historical literature, the measured FIT rate of the triple well silicon shows a significant degradation of the SER FIT rate. Detailed analysis of the bitmap for the flipped cells was employed to identify the degradation mechanism. It is found that the increase of the p-well resistivity and the effective contact tapping distance to the p-well is the main reason of the degradation. However, in the region of solid taps to both n-well and p-well, the FIT rate is close but still slightly higher than the FIT rate of the control wafers. In addition, a trade-off between the NMOS and PMOS region is identified using 2D numerical analysis. The results prove that an optimization of the well connections are needed for the triple well scheme and the SER improvement relies on the optimization of the tradeoff effect. For high energy particles, which can penetrate much deeper into the silicon substrate, the triple well is expected to be helpful to limit the charge collection. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Accelerated soft error rates; Charge collection; Flipped cells; Triple well architecture; Capacitance; Computer architecture; Error analysis; MOS devices; Silicon; Transistors; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644391443

Power characterization is provided based on HSpice circuit-level simulation of state-of-the-art low-power cache designs implemented in deep-submicron process technology. This is combined with architecture-level simulation of switching activities in the memory system. The results show that while aggressive prefetching techniques often help to improve performance, they increase energy consumption in most of the cases. In designs implemented in deepsubmicron 100-nm BPTM process technology, cache leakage becomes one of the dominant factors of the energy consumption. We have, however, found that if leakage is optimized with recently-proposed circuit-level techniques, most of the energy degradation is due to prefetch-hardware related costs and unnecessary LI data cache lookups related to prefetches that hit in the LI cache.

Four aspects are considered: performance, power, reliability, and scalability. To increase performance, the architecture is based on the radix-4 Carry-Save Adder (CSA). To lower power consumption, we devised several effective techniques for reducing the spurious transitions and the Expected Switching Activity (ESA) of high fan-out signals. To achieve scalability, we implement a 4-fold nested loop for the whole data processing flow. It is compatible with the multiple-precision digit-serial arithmetic as well as the data transfer to/from an external memory.

From the original sorting strategies, mainly addressed to separate non-transparent elements (ceramics, stones, metal particles, etc.) from transparent ones (glass fragments), the attention was addressed to define procedures and actions able to separate the cullets according to their color characteristics and, more recently, to recognize transparent ceramic glass from glass. Cullets sorting is currently realized adopting, as detecting architecture, laser beam technology based devices. The sorting logic is mainly analogical. An ""on-off"" logic is applied. Detection is, in fact, based on the evaluation of the ""characteristics"" of the energy (transparent or non-transparent fragment) and the spectra (fragment color attributes) received by a detector after that cullets were crossed by a suitable laser beam light. Such an approach presents some limits related with the technology utilized and the material characteristics. The technological limits are linked to the physical dimension and the mechanical arrangement of the optics carrying out and in the signals, and with the pneumatic architectures enabling the modification of cullets trajectory to realize sorting, according to their characteristics (color and transmittance). Furthermore such devices are practically ""blind"" in the recognition of ceramic glasses, whose presence in the final selected material to melt, damage the full recycled glass fusion compromising the quality of the final product. In the following it will be described the work developed, and the results achieved, in order to design a full integrated classical digital imaging and spectrophotometric based approach addressed to develop suitable sorting strategies able to perform, at industrial recycling scale, the distinction of cullets both in terms of color and material typologies, that is ""real glass"" from ""ceramic glass"" fragments.","Cullets sorting; Digital imaging based spectrophotometry; Glass recycling; Image analysis; Quality control","Ceramic materials; Digital image storage; Energy utilization; Image analysis; Image quality; Quality control; Recycling; Waste utilization; Cullets sorting; Digital image based spectrophotometry; Glass fragments; Glass recycling; Spectrophotometry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644370998

Four beacons move towards the node to be localized and form a square, being sensor node at the center. Sensor node calculates its position as centroid of the square after getting co-ordinate information from four beacons sitting at the edge of the square.

As the trend on the energy market is towards deregulation, new converter topologies are needed to allow independent producers/consumers to connect to multiple distribution grids in order to optimise the electricity price, as this will vary during the day from one power distribution company to another one. It will be needed to have a load that can smoothly adjust the power consumed from each power grid in order to minimize the overall energy cost or in case of special applications, to improve the system redundancy. Also, having a generator that can simultaneously feed fractions of its power into multiple grids which are not coupled (different voltage, frequency, displacement angle) and continuously adjust these fraction power will be a necessary feature on a deregulated energy market. This paper presents a new topology of a power converter based on the Direct Power Conversion concept, which is able to connect to multiple grids and provide complete decoupling between without circulating power between the grids, adjust continuously the power sharing and provide sine-wave in and sine-wave out operation. Additionally, it minimizes the size of passive components and does not need electrolytic capacitors for energy storage, which has impact on increasing the converter lifetime. © 2004 The Institution of Electrical Engineers.","Adjustable loading factor; Direct power conversion; Multiple power grid supply","Capacitors; Electric loads; Electric network topology; Frequencies; Matrix algebra; Military applications; Pulse width modulation; Semiconductor devices; Vectors; Adjustable loading factor; Direct power conversion; Multiple power grid supply; Space vector modulation (SVM); Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17044437337

Coupled with multiplexing schemes such multi-stage subsystems achieve the necessary quality and flexibility to support a variety of different services. In 3GPP, a 2-stage multiplexing channel interleaver network is adopted. Its state-of-the-art implementation is both memory- and control-intensive, since the deinterleaving is done explicitly implying dedicated storage and processing units at each stage. In this paper, we show that the C-fold decimation property which characterizes typical block interleavers is preserved in 2-stage interleaving networks. Thus, the underlying architecture not only results in significant memory size and access rate reductions but also greatly simplifies control processing.

This paper describes the development of a fuel cell/battery hybrid power source for a stationary domestic power application, details the control systems underpinning this system and describes some preliminary experimental results. The authors believe that the fuel cell/battery hybrid power system is the most cost-effective solution for domestic power applications. This recognizes that a typical domestic power profile can have a peak to average power ratio of between around 9-15, and hence a fuel cell only system would significantly over-rate the fuel cell to satisfy peak power and consequently suffer from poor utilisation. The hybrid system avoids this by using battery power to meet instantaneous peak power and the fuel cell as a base load / battery charging element. The objective of this paper is to consider the power electronic interface from a fuel cell as a low voltage dc source, to a higher voltage storage battery and possible dc load, i.e dc/dc booster, and ultimately a dc/ac inverter for utility connection.

As a result, these systems must provide run-time memory management support to allow real-time memory de/allocation, retrieving and processing of data while very limited power supply is available. Thus, its implementation must be designed to combine high speed access, low power and large data storage capacity. This is only possible by an efficient use of the memory hierarchy available in the embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach to design convenient dynamic memory management subsystems making profit of the multiple memory levels. It analyzes the logical phases involved in modern dynamic applications to effectively distribute the dynamically allocated data among the multi-level memory hierarchies present in embedded devices. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach for three representative real-life case studies of the new dynamic application domains (i.e., network and 3D rendering applications) ported to embedded systems. The results accomplished with our approach show a very significant reduction in energy consumption (up to 40%) over state-of-the-art solutions for dynamic memory management on embedded systems with typical cache-main memory architectures while respecting the real-time requirements of these applications. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Architectural design; Cache memory; Data processing; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Multimedia systems; Storage allocation (computer); Wireless telecommunication systems; Memory management; Memory subsystems; Power supply; Storage capacity; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17044401007

Given the energy (and hence range) and performance limitations of electro-chemical battery storage systems, hybrid systems combining energy and power dense storage technologies have been proposed for vehicle applications. Further, in recent years, fuel cell systems have also been proposed as a potential energy carrier, and the most suitable alternative likely to displace petroleum based fuels during the first half of this century. Whilst there are many technical and resource management issues associated with the displacement of petroleum fuels for transportation, and the commensurate supply infrastructure requirements, this paper will discuss some of the application issues associated with the implementation of hybrid energy/power sources for electric vehicle traction systems. Results from two case studies based on the combination of an electro-chemical storage battery and fuel cell energy sources with a supercapacitor peak power buffer will be presented to illustrate the benefits of on-board source hybridisation for urban road vehicles.

Films of Ge19Sb1Te80 with a thickness of ∼1 μm were deposited onto glass substrates by vacuum thermal evaporation of parent glasses. The as-deposited films were exposed to light by using a 500 W HBO mercury lamp. The optical constants of the films, before and after their illumination, were evaluated from the ellipsometric measurements in the spectral range of 300-820 nm. It has been established that illumination of the films leads to a decrease of the refractive index in the studied spectral region, while a slight increase of the extinction coefficient in the 600-800 nm range is observed. For the given film composition the optical bandgap energy of 0.76 eV reduces to 0.62 eV. The film structure shows a very slow recovery expressed in the increase of bandgap energy toward its initial value. The observed decrease of the bandgap energy after illumination is indicative that the film structure undergoes rearrangements upon exposure to light leading to the effect of photodarkening.","Amorphous chalcogenide Ge19Sb1Te80 films; Illumination; Optical bandgap energy; Optical constants; Photo-induced changes; Spectral ellipsometry; Vacuum thermal evaporation","Ellipsometry; Evaporation; Glass; Light absorption; Lighting; Optical data storage; Photochromism; Refractive index; Stoichiometry; Thin films; Amorphous chalcogenide Ge19Sb1Te80 films; Optical bandgap energy; Optical constants; Photo-induced changes; Spectral ellipsometry; Vacuum thermal evaporation; Germanium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16844377916

We have proposed a mechanical switch of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) as a mechanical PCS. In the previous paper, the sample surfaces were carefully polished and deposited with metals. As a result, the transfer current exceeded 30A, and the contact resistance reduced to 6μΩ at constant load 500N. In this paper, the experiment result when depositing metal thickly, and the relation between contact resistance and load were reported. Reduction of contact resistance and load was tried by depositing metals. Consequently, contact resistance was able to be reduced.

The MRF model minimizes the noise of the disparity compensation because it takes into account the residual energy, smoothness constraints and the occlusion field. The disparity compensation is formulated as a MAP-MRF problem in the spatial domain and the MRF field consists of the disparity vector and occlusion field, which is partitioned into three regions by an initial double-threshold setting. The MAP search is conducted in a block-based sense on one or two of the three regions, providing faster execution. The reference and the residual images are decomposed by a discrete wavelet transform and the transform coefficients are encoded by employing the morphological representation of wavelet coefficients algorithm. As a result of the morphological encoding, the reference and residual images together with the disparity vector field are transmitted in punitions lowering the total entropy. The experimental evaluation on synthetic and real images shows beneficial performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Markov Random Field (MRF); Morphological encoding; Vector fields; Wavelet coefficient algorithms; Algorithms; Bandwidth; Computer vision; Digital image storage; Image analysis; Image communication systems; Markov processes; Wavelet transforms; Image coding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244423711

The target system comprises of an instruction scratchpad memory instead of an instruction cache. Highly utilized code segments are copied into the scratchpad memory, and are executed from the scratchpad. The copying of code segments from main memory to the scratchpad is performed during runtime. A custom hardware controller is used to manage the copying process. The hardware controller is activated by strategically placed custom instructions within the executing program. These custom instructions inform the hardware controller when to copy during program execution. Novel heuristic algorithms are implemented to determine locations within the program to insert these custom instructions, as well as to choose the best sets of code segments to be copied to the scratchpad memory. For a set of realistic benchmarks, experimental results indicate the method uses 50.7% lower energy (on average) and improves performance by 53.2% (on average) when compared to a traditional cache system which is identical in size.

In this paper, we propose an architectural template for the HLS output that consists of a controller-datapath circuit associated with a memory subsystem into which computation units have been integrated. The enhanced memory subsystem is called computation-unit integrated memory (CIM). A CIM offers higher memory bandwidth (relative to what is offered through the system bus) to computation units present locally within it and reduces the overall communication between the memory subsystem and the controller-datapath, thus providing a template highly suitable for deriving efficient implementations of memory-intensive applications. This work addresses the challenge of providing an automatic synthesis framework for a CIM-based architecture. Our framework can analyze the various trade-offs involved in selecting suitable operations in a behavior for execution using a CIM and generate a high-performance, low-overhead implementation. Experiments with several behaviors indicate that an average performance improvement of 1.88 X (a maximum of 2.63 X) is possible with very low area overheads. The energy-delay product improves by an average of 2.1 X (maximum of 3.4 X). $2004 IEEE.",,"Datapaths; High-level synthesis (HLS); Memory banks; Memory systems; Algorithms; Application specific integrated circuits; Bandwidth; Computational methods; Functions; Interfaces (computer); Logic design; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244406821

This paper presents the location cache structure which significantly reduces the power consumption for large set-associative caches. We propose to use a small cache, called location cache to store the location of future cache references. If there is a hit in the location cache, the supported cache is accessed as a direct-mapped cache. Otherwise, the supported cache is referenced as a conventional set-associative cache. The worst case access latency of the location cache system is the same as that of a conventional cache. The location cache is virtually indexed so that operations on it can be performed in parallel with the TLB address translation. These advantages make it ideal for L2 cache systems where traditional way-predication strategies perform poorly. We used the CACTI cache model to evaluate the power consumption and access latency of proposed cache architecture. Simplescalar CPU simulator was used to produce final results. It is shown that the proposed location cache architecture is power-efficient. In the simulated cache configurations, up-to 47% of cache accessing energy and 25% of average cache access latency can be reduced.","Data location; L1/L2 caches; Set-associative caches; TLB","Data location; L1/L2 caches; Set-associative caches; TLB address translation; Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Program processors; Random access storage; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244390216

In this paper, we propose a dynamic software management (DSM) framework to improve battery utilization, and avoid competition for limited energy resources from multiple applications. We have designed and implemented a DSM module in user space, independent of the operating system (OS), which explores quality-of-service (QoS) adaptation to reduce system energy and employs a priority-based preemption policy for multiple applications. It also employs energy macro-models for mobile applications to aid in this endeavor. By monitoring the energy supply and predicting energy demand at each QoS level, the DSM module is able to select the best possible trade-off between energy conservation and application QoS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first energy-aware coordinated framework utilizing adaptation of mobile applications. It honors the priority desired by the user and is portable to POSIX-compliant OSs. Our experimental results for some mobile applications (video player, speech recognizer, voice-over-IP) show that this approach can meet user-specified task-oriented goals and improve battery utilization significantly.

Most of these structures are required to operate in a dynamic environment. Therefore, investigating the modal characteristics of these structures is very critical for developing optimum designs. Unlike that of simpler structures such as beams and plates, the modal spectrum exhibits very unique modal characteristics. The interrelationship between modes usually results in mode crossing, uniqueness of modal spectrum, stationary mode, and the redundancy of modal constraints. During the design optimization of a uniform cylindrical shell, one is faced with some unique challenges. When a uniform segmented shell is segmented longitudinally along its axis, the thickness optimization of the segment thicknesses will yield in a segmented shell with varying thickness segments. In order to study their modal characteristics, an analytical expression for segmented circular cylindrical shell needs to be developed. In this paper, an analytical and numerical investigation of the modal characteristics of thin-segmented circular cylindrical shell under shear diaphragm boundary condition is presented. Analytical expressions for the equations of motion are derived using Donnell-Mushtari shell theory and Sanders shell theory for uniform circular cylindrical shells. The eigenvalue problem of the analytical solution is then solved using a MATLAB program script to predict the natural frequencies and strain energy distribution for the various mode shapes in the modal spectrum. The analytical results were found to be in good agreement with the numerical results obtained from finite element analysis using MSC.NASTRAN. The fundamental influence of the strain energy distribution and other related issues such as the mode crossing, repeated natural frequencies are also discussed.

Space-filling designs can be used to specify the points so that as much of the design space is sampled as possible with the minimum number of response evaluations. One popular technique is the optimal Latin hypercube design of experiments. However, its generation is non-trivial, time consuming and is - but for the simplest problems - infeasible to carry out by enumeration. Therefore, solving this problem requires an optimization technique to search the design space. As the problem is discrete, it is ideally suited to the use of discrete optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms. This paper describes a method for generating optimal latin hypercubes using a permutation genetic algorithm and compares it with a standard binary genetic algorithm. The objective of the optimization is based on minimizing a function that is analogous the potential energy of the system of material points. The developed method offers considerable improvements over previous solutions; it generates better solutions and the computational effort in reaching those solutions is significantly reduced.

Hence any attempt for energy cost saving at the pumping stations network of the country will be very much appreciated. An experimental model of multi-pump pumping station installed to apply and verify the modern concepts of power saving in the irrigation pumping stations of Egypt. This model is built-up to acquire also the intelligent management and control strategies. The fundamental concepts are to design the pumping station taking into consideration the mechanical problems elimination. The first part of energy saving is accomplished by the electronic soft starter; it is used to eliminate the cavitationsphenomena. Also, It is used for soft stopping, which eliminates the water hammering problems. The second part, which is the main part of the energy saving, is the management of the output water delivery. To meet the variable needs, the experimental pumping station consists of five identical water pumps. A variable speed derive is used when the water demand is covered by a fractional of the rated flow of a water pump. The management and control of the pumps operation is carried out by a programmable logic controller (PLC). The linguistic experience and intelligent operation of this pumping station that is collected from the related human being is stored and operated also by the PLC. Experience operations have been carried out by the concepts of the Fuzzy logic control to determine the number of pumps to be operated.

We address the problem of minimizing the energy consumed by a two-device data flow chain by choosing the speed profiles of the two devices and the ""cycle time"" of the intermediate buffer. Determining the speed profiles (functions of time) to minimize the energy functional, in general, requires variational techniques.

Validation of Earth observation (EO) data sets requires knowledge of greater positional precision as EO data resolution increases to metre and submetre scales. Software from a variety of commercial and public domain sources bridges the functionality gap that integrates stored digital images and real-time GPS data (with WAAS or subsequently corrected GPS-C technology). The software is currently user-friendly enough to allow for a seamless storage of positional field stop information linked with other instrument measurements or associated with georeferenced EO data in GIS databases. Examples presented here from several field campaigns indicate that in some cases, the increase in productivity was as high as 40-50%. This is especially true under cold weather conditions where freedom of movement, note taking and manual data recording are hampered. GPS positional information also allows several points or tracks to be collected in rapid succession, thus enabling two dimensional information stops or area plots to be collected in addition to the traditional ""point location"". The locations of terrain features are often readily recognizable on digital imagery. This allows for immediate verification and confirmation of the site. GPS data collection is not limited to two-dimensions, and real-time 3-D (altitude) information can guide the user along constant hypsometric levels in the field. In other cases, processed and georeferenced EO data may contain thematic information that does not correspond to visual image-like characteristics. Navigation from these kinds of imagery to their corresponding field locations may be difficult in these circumstances. Real-time positional displays, however, may help guide the field worker to the correct location on the imagery to be visited. In conclusion, field use of integrating GPS technology with EO data in real-time can greatly increase the efficiency of data collection campaigns as well as reduce errors and questionable data since it allows for an immediate visual feedback and validation by the user.",,"Earth observation; Field computer; Hypsometric levels; Real time positional displays; Communication satellites; Cost effectiveness; Image processing; Productivity; Real time systems; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Tracking (position); Global positioning system",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15944413180

Auroral events are monitored on the global scale at the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum by satellite-based sensors. However, the existence of dayglow emission significantly limits scientists is the ability to determine the location and the size of auroral ovals. A dynamic methodology to remove day airglow emission from the LBHL band UVI images on the Polar satellite is presented in this paper. First, the methodology identifies the geomagnetic latitude bound of the night side auroral oval Then, the maximum range of geomagnetic latitude bound of the auroral is inferred based on the domain knowledge. Using the non-auroral dayglow pixels, a multi-variable regression fit of the intensity as function of the cosine of the solar zenith angle and cosine of the sateltite viewing zenith angle is obtained. The methodology then uses this fitting function to estimate the dayglow intensity and to remove its effect in the LBHL band FUV images. This methodology does not require an external source of input solar flux and the dayglow removal is solely based on individual images. Experiment results show that dayglow effect is removed significantly from the original LBHL FUV images. Using this methodology, the performance of auroral oval detection algorithms is significantly improved.",,"Auroral images; Dayglow removal; Far ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum; Solar flux; Algorithms; Band structure; Data reduction; Energy storage; Fluxes; Geomagnetism; Geometry; Satellites; Sensors; Spectrum analysis; Ultraviolet radiation; Image analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15944391331

The ODF can naturally adapt to curvature variations in the original mesh and can preserve sharp features. We describe an energy minimization approach to convert geometric models to ODFs.

Even though this approach has the potential for a finer control of a hard real-time system, using fewer resources and easily adapting to further quality aspects (memory/energy consumption, jitter minimisation, etc.), synthesised schedulers are usually extremely large and difficult to understand. Their big size is a consequence of their inherent precision, since they attempt to describe exactly the frontier among the safe and unsafe system states. It nevertheless hinders their application in practise, since it is extremely difficult to validate them or to use them for better understanding the behaviour of the system. In this paper we show how one can adapt data-mining techniques to decrease the size of a synthesised scheduler and force its inherent structure to appear, thus giving the system designer a wealth of additional information for understanding and optimising the scheduler and the underlying system. We present, in particular, how it can be used for obtaining hints for a good task distribution to different processing units, for optimising the scheduler itself (sometimes even removing it altogether in a safe manner) and obtaining both per-task and per-system views of the schedulability of the system. © 2004 IEEE.","Data-mining; Decision-tree induction; Hard real-time systems; Schedulability analysis; Scheduler synthesis; Software engineering","Decision-tree induction; Hard real-time systems; Schedulability analysis; Schedular synthesis; Computer applications; Computer simulation; Computer system recovery; Optimization; Real time systems; Software engineering; Storage allocation (computer); Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15844428780

To transmit their data to the base, all the sensors are required to be connected to a high-energy communication node, which serves as a relay from the ground to a satellite or to a high-altitude aircraft. The sensors are assumed to have a fixed communication and a fixed sensing range, which can significantly vary depending on the type of sensing performed. This simple framework serves to benchmark a Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for the sensor placement, where the two competing objectives considered are the total sensor coverage and the lifetime of the network.

It makes efficient use of valuable radio frequency resources. More flexibility and resource sharing leads to more control. A separate shared control channel (HS-SCCH) is defined to carry convolutionally encoded control data over the air interface to allow for fast adaptation to system dynamics. Thus, low-latency HS-SCCH subsystems are a key building block impacting major design choices of the underlying HSDPA architecture. In this paper, we systematically analyze different algorithm and architecture candidates at various levels of abstractions. At the functional level, formalizing the complexity, i.e. operations, memory size and access rate, we show how algorithm and architecture transformations of the classical Max-Log-MAP and Viterbi algorithm are traded-off with communication performance. At the architecture level, DSP implementation strategies are discussed. Cycle estimates are presented for two STMicroelectronics DSP platforms - the ST122 and a small, application-specific DSP. Finally, we propose a low-latency, energy-efficient SW implementation of HS-SCCH decoding referred to as short-sequence Viterbi-like approach. ©2004 IEEE.","3GPP; Design Space Exploration; DSP; High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA); Max-Log-MAP; MLSE; Viterbi","Communication channels (information theory); Computational complexity; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Digital signal processing; Microelectronics; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet networks; Systems analysis; Telecommunication services; 3GPP; Design space exploration; High-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA); High-speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH); Max-log-MAP; MLSE; Viterbi; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15344344930

Theoretically, thermal convection has long been a challenging subject in physics because of the complexity embedded in such unstably stratified flows. Practically, Rayleigh-Benard convection is central to many technologies and situations. In particular, core melt progression in a hypothetical severe accident in a nuclear reactor is governed by heat transfer (and therefore energy splitting) in molten metal/oxide layers. In previous studies, we conducted large-scale experiments and numerical simulations to quantify melt pool heat transfer models. In the present study, we developed a novel experimental approach and used an advanced diagnostic method to obtain flrst-of-a-kind thermometry data on transient natural convection heat transfer. The data are used to assess whether and to what extent Navier-Stokes and energy equations and their numerical methods are capable of preserving and correctly predicting complexity in thermal convection, i.e. onset and pattern formation.

To make the new construction project acceptable by government and society, a maximum effort to obtain sustainability (i.e. minimization of resource use and waste production) will have to be shown. Therefore the usual open cycle for HTR has been abandoned, and the spent fuel will be reprocessed once. The long-lived transuranic (TRU) elements Pu, Np, Am and Cm are all refabricated into so-called transmutation fuel elements, and loaded back into the same reactor, in our case a 110 MWe PBMR with low-enriched uranium cycle. In this study, the reactor physical prospects have been investigated: to what extent the amount of TRU could be reduced. In this way, 75% of the initial amount of TRU waste is being destructed, while the time span in which the waste is more radiotoxic than uranium ore is being reduced to one-third. Also, the amount of fresh driver fuel needed is decreases by 25%. A preliminary cost analysis has been performed as well. It shows that there is also a cost advantage of operating the reactor in Deep Burn mode in industrialized countries, where the waste storage fees charged per volume are relatively high.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Nuclear fuels; Project management; Radioactive wastes; Resource allocation; Sustainable development; Uranium; Open cycle; Resource use; Time span; Transuranic elements; Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844331127

The encoder exploits application-specific knowledge regarding program hot-spots to generate codewords that deliver savings in power and to furthermore provide concurrent detection of errors. Power savings can be obtained through the use of codewords that reduce the switching activity on the bus. The analysis shows that generating codewords that prohibit the occurrence of three consecutive transitions in three adjacent lines is fundamental to capturing the worst-case crosstalk faults in the bus lines at run time, thus improving the overall reliability of the bus. The desired codewords can be generated through a set of simple prespecified transformations. The detailed analysis we outline shows that the presented transformations are optimal. The proposed encoding scheme is dynamically reprogrammable, thus targeting code particularities effectively.

Japan Nuclear Energy Organization (JNES) has conducted the experiments necessary to introduce creep equation for integrity assessment of spent fuel during interim storage. In these tests, creep properties of irradiated and unirradiated Zircaloy-2 and -4 claddings have been investigated in the two different deformation kinetic regions, namely grain boundary sliding and dislocation creep. Irradiated materials have shown some creep suppressing effects compared to unirradiated material, but the degree of suppression depends on temperature and stress conditions. The differences in observed effects of irradiation on the creep properties of fuel cladding may likely be from differences in basic creep deformation kinetics under given conditions. Although partial recovery of irradiation-hardening both in Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4 appears to have occurred in the temperature range of 330-420degrees C, the effect appears to be less on creep properties. As a result of metallographic observation of cross section of post-creep samples, it implies that the threshold hoop stress for hydride reorientation from the circumferential to radial direction of irradiated Zircaloy-2 cladding might be lower than that of irradiated Zircaloy-4 cladding. The detailed examinations revealed that the cracks which were initiated on the outer surface of the cladding and penetrated inwards had been observed on Zircaloy-2 cladding creep specimens of higher hoop stress test conditions (200-300MPa). The occurrence of cracking appears to be related to the precipitation of radial hydrides during cool-down of the test furnace.",,"Cladding (coating); Fuel storage; Irradiation; Societies and institutions; Stresses; Cracking performance; Creep equations; Nuclear energy organizations; Spent fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14744281678

When the share of wind power increases it is necessary to consider the produced power in the daily operation planning of the power system. The first step is then to use forecasts of wind power. But the forecasts of wind power are in reality rather uncertain, so reserves have to be kept for unforecasted wind speed changes. But still an economical good solution is of large interest, and the consequence of this is to use stochastic optimization. To be able to do this it is necessary to have a view, so called scenarios, of possible outcomes of wind power. The aim of this paper is to provide a method that can simulate possible outcomes of wind speeds based on available forecasts. The method is based on the assumption that wind speed forecasts are available in several regions and the forecast errors in different regions are correlated. The developed method is based on multidimensional ARMA series.","Autoregressive series; Correlated forecast errors; Forecasts; Operation planning; Wind power","Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Cost effectiveness; Data acquisition; Electric load forecasting; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Error analysis; Matrix algebra; Vectors; Autoregressive series; Correlated forecast errors; Multi area power systems; Operation planning; Stochastic optimization; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14544296200

Our framework uses multiobjective criteria during exploration, such as application execution time, energy, bandwidth, and data size. In order to tackle the complexity of the exploration, it is divided into three phases; Pareto diagram composition, data assignment, and access scheduling. The first phase produces multidimensional Pareto points for our application. After this phase, our framework produces distinct data assignments which are represented as Pareto points in a two dimensional space defined by bandwidth requirements and size requirements. Finally, the scheduling phase finds possibly optimal order of the tasks and performs precise scheduling of the tasks. Three feedbacks paths are present which can be used to iteratively improve exploration results. It is possible to trade off the quality of the results and the algorithm runtime.

In such applications, exhaustive data analysis is often highly complex and time consuming whereas the actual bottlenecks are essentially due to the few largest data objects (arrays). Therefore, to ensure a good trade-off between analysis time and efficiency, we focus the optimization on these objects also called 'structures'. Our approach relies on a new graph formalism called Data Control Flow Graph' which analyzes an algorithm (written in C), and brings out data structure dependencies while retaining execution order constraints.

The energy savings, here, comes from repeated execution of tiny loops from energy efficient FC. The absence of cacheable loops leads to performance degradation in such FC structures. Therefore, we propose a simple dynamic FC scheme, which detects the opportunity for use of the FC and enables (or disables) it dynamically. Thus providing (slightly reduced) energy savings at minimal performance degradation. A combination of the predictive filter cache with the above schemes reduces the performance and energy penalty. For the benchmarks simulated with 256 Byte FC, the average performance degradation is 1.13% with the proposed scheme compared to 2.47% with just the predictive filter cache. With the same configuration, the resulting energy reduction is 42.77%.

This paper presents analytical results expressing the relation between storage volume, number of heat exchanger transfer units and temperature limited performance. For a system composed of a single storage element, the limiting behavior of a perfectly stratified storage element is shown to be superior to a fully-mixed storage element, consistent with more general analysis of thermal storage. Since, however, only the fully-mixed limit is readily obtainable in a physical system, the present paper also examines a division of the storage volume into separate compartments. This multi-element storage system shows significantly improved discharge characteristics as a result of improved elemental area utilization and temperature variation between elements, comparable in many cases to a single perfectly-stratified storage element. In addition, the multi-element system shows increased robustness with respect to variations in heat exchanger effectiveness and initial storage temperature.",,"Cost savings; Energy discharges; Flow systems; Solar thermal systems; Thermal storage; Algebra; Costs; Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Flow of fluids; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Integration; Solar energy; Thermal effects; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644270623

Net imports of foreign oil as a percentage of total U.S. oil demand have increased from 37% in 1980 to 55% in 2001 and are predicted to increase to 65% by the year 2016. Since heating and air conditioning account for 44% of the energy usage in a typical U.S. home, residential energy conservation techniques hold great promise for significant savings. Insulated concrete form (ICF) construction is a promising construction technique for both residential and commercial construction. Some advantages of ICF construction include: reduced construction time, compatibility with any inside or outside surface finish, insect resistance, strength, noise reduction, reduced infiltration, significant and continuing energy savings, lower HVAC capital costs for the building, and 12'' (30 cm) wide window sills. Disadvantages of ICF construction include: resistance from builders and subcontractors unfamiliar with the construction technique, higher material costs, the necessary custom window and door openings, and the difficulty and expense of making changes once the walls are in place. Even though the material costs are higher than typical (stick-frame) construction, labor savings might result in overall savings. In this paper actual energy usage for an ICF house constructed in 1998 is compared to the energy usage for a 1988 conventional stick-frame building. Comparison of these two buildings indicates a 75% reduction in energy usage per square foot per degree-day for the ICF building when compared to the stick-frame building. During this same time period, energy (gas) usage for heating and hot water decreased 85%. Computer simulations were made for both an ICF wall and for a conventional frame wall. These computer simulations indicate significant saving potential for the ICF wall when compared to a conventional frame wall section. In addition these simulations illustrate dramatically the effect of separating the thermal resistance and thermal capacitance inherent in this ""sandwich"" construction.",,"Insulated concrete form (ICF); Residential construction; Storage capacity; Thermal capacitance; Building materials; Computer simulation; Energy dissipation; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Forms (concrete); Insulating materials; Specific heat; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644269644

Coll. of Technology, Japan","Recently, the photovoltaic (PV) power generation system has attracted attention as one of clean energies. Especially, residential roofing PV system connected with power grids has been popularized as a result of increasing concerns over global warming and continuing decline in PV manufacturing costs. The power generated by the PV module increases with irradiance, but it decreases as PV module temperature becomes high. The PV temperature depends on ambient temperature, and becomes more than 60°C in summer. Therefore, the power generated does not necessarily increase even if the irradiance increases in summer. However, if the PV modules were cooled under such a high PV temperature condition, more electrical power would be obtained from PV modules. In this study, a PV power generating system equipped with a cooling device has been developed. The major components of the system are an array of PV modules and cooling panels attached to the backside of the PV modules. The respective PV module is cooled with cooling water flowing through a narrow gap in each cooling panel. Hot water discharged from the cooling panel is delivered to a storage tank and can be reused in anywhere. In order to save energy for introducing cooling water into the panel, a siphonage from an upper level of a building to the ground level is utilized. A siphon tube is connected to a discharge port of the cooling panel, thus the pressure at the discharge port becomes negative. Cooling water enters into the bottom end of the cooling panel at atmospheric pressure and goes up to the top, discharge side. By adopting this cooling water system, we could spread the cooling water evenly over the entire backside of the PV module and thus realized an effective cooling device. In addition, we could make the cooling device light and smaller because no auxiliary pumping system is needed for introducing cooling water. To provide field performance data for the present PV power generation system equipped with the special cooling device mentioned above, long-term monitoring tests in a natural environment were conducted in summer for a test facility constructed at the Yatsushiro National College of Technology (YNCT), Japan. As a result, it was confirmed that the cooling of the PV modules increases the electric power and that the reuse of hot water from the cooling panel contributes very much for saving energy consumed for heating water.",,"Conversion efficiency; Cooling panel; Module temperature; Performance evaluation; Cooling water; Photovoltaic effects; Siphons; Solar cells; Structural panels; Test facilities; Wind power; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644265891

Most PV systems are sold on the basis of first cost, but in addition to these first costs, system owners must consider operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and down time, as well as energy savings [1]. The challenge in developing realistic life cycle costs is that most databases have only new data available, and only one database - that maintained by the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) - contains performance information along with cost and maintenance data. The goals of this effort are to: 1. Characterize the actual life cycle costs (LCC) of PV systems installed in Florida and tracked since 1998. 2. Develop a benchmark of PV LCC that will aid in prioritizing cost improvement steps and feed into the U.S. Department of Energy and its subcontractors' efforts to develop a baseline for grid-connected small residential and larger commercial PV system costs. 3. Develop an easy to use and modify LCC model that allows sensitivity analysis and input of new data as it becomes available. The PV system LCC model developed and used here is based on statistical methods, which provide us with a range of expected outcomes. The Monte Carlo technique allows the use of repeated simulation iterations to mimic a population sample. For inputs, the model relies largely on data from FSEC's performance and maintenance databases, and where appropriate simplifying assumptions are explained. Beyond establishing an LCC baseline, this project considers the sensitivity of the total LCC to various inputs and thereby provides guidance on the question of where to put valuable resources to substantially reduce PV system costs. Further discussion is offered concerning the additional value of this model in determining the impact of various methods of PV system performance tracking.",,"Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC); Life cycle cost (LCC) analysis; Rebate program; Sandia National Laboratories (SNL); Benchmarking; Computer simulation; Costs; Energy storage; Monte Carlo methods; Sampling; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Photovoltaic effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644262732

A mathematical model based on energy equilibrium and a one-dimensional mathematical model for the unsaturated porous medium have been founded and developed to predict the temperature and moisture content in soil and the enclosed air temperature in the greenhouse. On the condition that plant and massive wall is neglected, the air is mainly heated by the soil surface in the greenhouse, which absorbs the incident solar radiation. With increase in depth, the variation of the temperature and moisture content in soil decreases on account of ambient, and the appearance of the peak temperature in soil postpones. Solar irradiation absorber, heat storage and insulation are the main effects of the north massive wall on greenhouse, which is influenced by the structure and the material. The specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of wall material have a remarkable effect on the north wall temperature. The build-up north wall with thermal insulation material may be chosen for greenhouse. The temperature distribution and gas flow in greenhouse is influenced by the cover material of the inside surface of the north wall.

At present hydrogen is produced mostly from fossil sources. Solar photoelectrochemical processes are being developed for hydrogen production. Storing hydrogen can be done in three main ways: in compressed form, liquid form and by chemical bonding. Near term spaceport operations are one of the prominent applications for usage of large quantities of liquid hydrogen as a cryogenic propellant. Efficient storage and transfer of liquid hydrogen is essential for reducing the launch costs. A Two Stage Reverse Turbo Brayton Cycle (RTBC) CryoCooler is being developed at University of Central Florida. The cryocooler will be used for storage and transport of hydrogen in spaceport and space vehicle application. The efficiency of the compressor and motor of the cryocooler depends mainly on the friction and wear between the mating parts. Tribological coatings having extremely high hardness, ultra-low coefficient of friction, and high durability at temperatures lower than 60 K are being developed with an aim to reduce the friction and wear, thereby resulting in improved efficiency of the cryocooler. Extremely hard and extremely low friction coatings of DLC, TiN coatings and DLC/MoS2 and TiN/MoS2 bilayer coatings have been chosen as part of this ongoing research aimed for this application.

It is timely in view of the aging electrical transmission system in the U.S. and rising energy demands in the U.S. and worldwide. The High Temperature Superconductor/Liquid Hydrogen (HTS/LH2) SuperGrid, formally proposed by EPRI in 2001, has the potential to deliver large amounts of electricity and hydrogen, the two most environmentally friendly secondary energy sources. The SuperGrid for the new millennium will use HTS cables, the most efficient pathway to transmit electricity; hydrogen, the cleanest energy to power vehicles in addition to cooling the HTS cables; and information technology to make the grid system intelligent. The HTS/LH 2 SuperGrid will serve as the energy super highway, supplying large amounts of energy to fuel economic development, as envisioned by Jimmy Glotfelty of the U.S. Department of Energy. In this paper, we attempt to briefly summarize the rationale, promises, and challenges for the successful deployment of the HTS/LH 2 SuperGrid in the U.S. The points we touch upon are equally valid for application in other parts of the world.",,"Energy demands; Energy-storage systems; Secondary energy sources; Supergrid; Cooling; Energy storage; Fusion reactions; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Reliability; Superconductivity; Yttrium barium copper oxides; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644261571

Imidazolium salts are a subset of the general class of molten salts. They are termed ionic liquids because many have freezing points at or below room temperature. This class of salts was selected for initial study because there were many examples that were reported to be stable at high temperatures. These reports were usually based on the results of standard thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. Work by our subcontractor at the University of Alabama and at NREL showed that slow heating rates or when the temperature is held constant for long times resulted in decomposition temperatures that are much lower than found with the usual TGA methods. We have used a TGA technique that allows calculation of the rates of thermal decomposition as a function of temperature. The results lead us to the conclusion that the imidazolium salts known to be the most thermally stable would not have useful lifetimes above about 200°C. At present this determination is based on the rough approximation that the fluid in a solar trough system experiences a constant, high temperature. Better estimates of the useful lifetime will require a system model that takes into account the time at temperature distribution of a fluid moving through the different components in a solar plant.","Heat transfer fluid; Imidazolium salt; Solar thermal electricity; Thermal storage","Heat transfer fluids; Imidazolium salt; Solar thermal electricity; Thermal storage; Activation energy; Approximation theory; Electric power systems; Freezing; Heat transfer; Molten materials; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Salts",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644261537

The heating of the indoor air is by thermal storage with paraffin wax situated inside the incubator. Previously the wax is exposed to solar radiation in order to melt it and then it is inserted into the incubator. The solidification of the wax delivers heat to the air inside the incubator at an average temperature that is approximately constant.The biological and thermal processes of incubation in bird raising require relatively little energy of low temperature. The process needs to maintain the eggs at temperatures around 38°C, during almost 21 days. To achieve a chicken born only requires between 250 to 300 W.h. In an incubator insulated adequately, the thermal energy demand increase during the nights, clouded and cold days, and must not be interrupt during at least the first 19 days. Then it is necessary to have some form of energy storage if we do not want or cannot aid the system with a conventional heat source.Paraffinic wax with a melted point of 57°C at normal atmospheric pressure has been cycled in fusion and solidification to store heat in 6 cm diameter cylinders. The surfaces were blackened in order to absorb solar energy, within a solar insulate cabinet and a glass cover. The disadvantage of wax is poor thermal conductivity. Fins embedded into the wax was used in order to eliminate this inconvenience. The fins are aluminum shaving within the cylinders. The quantitative results shown these characteristics: complete change of phase, delivery of latent heat, repeatable behavior over the melting-solidification cycles, good rates of internal heat transfer, and uniform solidification. The analysis of the stored energy, discharged energy, melting time and solidifying time are included.","Air heating for aviculture; Solar breaker chicken; Thermal storage","Air heating for aviculture; Solar breaker chicken; Thermal energy; Thermal storage; Environmental impact; Glass; Heat storage; Heating; Paraffin waxes; Solar radiation; Solidification; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal effects; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644251052

Industry and laboratory research efforts are now focusing on integration of thermal energy storage as a viable means to enhance dispatchability of concentrated solar energy. One option to significantly reduce costs is to use thermocline storage systems, low-cost filler materials as the primary thermal storage medium, and molten nitrate salts as the direct heat transfer fluid. Prior thermocline evaluations and thermal cycling tests at the Sandia National Laboratories' National Solar Thermal Test Facility identified quartzite rock and silica sand as potential filler materials. An expanded series of isothermal and thermal cycling experiments were planned and implemented to extend those studies in order to demonstrate the durability of these filler materials in molten nitrate salts over a range of operating temperatures for extended timeframes. Upon test completion, careful analyses of filler material samples, as well as the molten salt, were conducted to assess long-term durability and degradation mechanisms in these test conditions. Analysis results demonstrate that the quartzite rock and silica sand appear able to withstand the molten salt environment quite well. No significant deterioration that would impact the performance or operability of a thermocline thermal energy storage system was evident. Therefore, additional studies of the thermocline concept can continue armed with confidence that appropriate filler materials have been identified for the intended application.",,"Concentrating solar power (CSP); Filler materials; Operating temperatures; Thermal energy storage; Cost effectiveness; Fluids; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Molten materials; Power plants; Solar energy; Temperature distribution; Thermal cycling; Fillers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644250891

Buildings can respond to these pricing signals by shifting cooling-related thermal loads either by pre-cooling the building's massive structure (passive storage) or by using active thermal energy storage systems such as ice storage.

This article investigates an approach to ensure that a commercial building utilizing both thermal batteries does not incur excessive energy consumption. The model-based predictive building controller is modified to trade off energy cost against energy consumption. This work shows that buildings can be operated in a demand-responsive fashion to substantially reduce utility costs, however, at the expense of increased energy consumption. Placing a greater emphasis on energy consumption led to a reduction in the savings potential. In the limiting case of energy-optimal control, the reference control was replicated, i.e., if only energy consumption is of concern, neither active nor passive building thermal storage should be utilized.

It increases resolution and depths of focus for certain layout patterns and design styles. First annular, then quadrupole, and lately dipole source shapes are getting deployed. The source shape can be formed by hard stop apertures or by diffractive optical elements (DOE). The former is advantageous because it preserves light energy on the way from a laser source to the mask (object). In addition, DOEs can form very complex source shapes, with smooth distribution of light across the aperture. This enables source tuning to print certain layout features with a high resolution. Though printing hardware is ready for complex shapes to be used, optimization methods are not well developed. In this study we first review existing source optimization methods. Lack of rigorous formulations motivates discussion of the optimization objectives and constraints. We stress importance of using weighted and so-called Sobolev norms. Second, we state the main optimization problem as a set of the optimization objectives in a form of functional norm integrals to maximize image fidelity, system throughput, and source smoothness. We show how to reduce this to a non-negative least square (NNLS) problem, which is solved by standard numerical methods. Third, we analyze solutions for important practical cases: alternating phase-shifting regular and SRAM cell.

This increases DRAM idle time (inter-access time) and provides opportunity for reducing memory energy usage by performing memory state transition to a low-power mode. However, additional delay due to resynchronization may greatly increase the system response time. This work focuses on exploiting state transition techniques to reduce DRAM energy usage and also mitigating the penalty of resynchronization time. We propose a state transition technique based on address prediction that predicts the inter-access time between memory accesses. According to predicted inter-access time, the DRAM is directly put into a low-energy mode and transits back to the operation mode as the idle timer expires to avoid resynchronization overhead. Experiments using multimedia application show that the proposed scheme has achieved the best energy-delay performance than other previous policies. ©2004 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Delay control systems; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Focusing; Multimedia systems; Random access storage; Synchronization; Energy usage; Energy-delay performance; Inter-access time; Low-power mode; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444270703

The directly measured ensquared energy of the hybrid optical system is obtained through an experimental test. Then, the actual line spread function (LSF) of the system under test is measured, and the point spread function (PSF) is calculated from LSF based on the symmetric property of the system. The PSF is used to calculate the so-called derived ensquared energy. The ratio of the directly measured and the derived ensquared energy, defined as the diffraction efficiency of the DOE, represents the fraction of the energy focused onto the image point over the total input energy on the image plane, because the energy loss is caused by the scattering from the DOE corrector.

A Bode plot was drawn to tune the PSS's time constants to compensate for phase lag. In addition, eigenvalue analysis was used to determine a reliable PSS gain, Ks, and a time-domain transient program was used to verify safe operation of the PSS in the presence of predictable disturbances, such as the AVR step test and generator unloading. In the on-site test, the AVR step tests at 300 MW loading at Muju P/P #2 were implemented with a dual-input prototype PSS to check to what extent the PSS damped the power oscillation of the disturbances.

The choice made by the Company FAAM focuses on the production of small and medium size appliances based on fuel cell technology. In these appliances, easy system management is combined with their safety, in terms of energy quality and the absence of risks for operators and user equipment. The choice was focused on fuel cells with 400 Watt power, fed with high purity hydrogen and air taken from the surrounding environment and introduced through a ventilator. For hydrogen storage, metal hydride reservoirs have been used, containing up to 400 liters of hydrogen in N.C., with a very wide allowance in relation to safety in handling and operation. The choice to manufacture small size power systems simplifies the issues related to the management of thermal flows and humidification of membranes and their use at a demonstration scale becomes immediately applicable. The use of fuel cells with these characteristics is not limited to the field of stationary applications, but it has a good market in the transport sector with the application of engine-driven bicycles (Camaleo bikes) and small size electric vehicles, therefore ensuring further reduction of production costs and a better success in alternative sectors. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed description of the technical specifications adopted as a base for system design and show the flexibility in using this system.

Today more than 25,000 48-volt battery strings have been installed worldwide and valuable experience has been gained. This paper will share this experience and make some recommendations to operators that are looking for alternatives to VRLA. While the telecom Ni-Cd batteries were engineered as direct replacements for VRLA, there are some important differences that operators need to be aware of. The paper will briefly describe the conception of the Ni-Cd telecom battery and discuss the main design criteria and explain how these were met In particular, it will deal with the growing need for reduced maintenance and show that it is now possible to match battery life and reliability to telecommunications equipment in general. Experienced equipment manufacturers know it is not possible to introduce a new product concept into a new market without some difficulties and problems. However, by utilizing certain strategies and preparations such difficulties and problems can be minimized. Included in such strategies is the collection and analysis of observations from the field including reports from users. This paper will examine such information including statistics from customer complaint logs and observations and data from some key installations.

In brief, the proposal calls for the creation of an Energy SuperGrid, delivering both electricity and hydrogen. The electric portion of the grid would use superconducting, low voltage, high current dc cables for power transmission, with liquid hydrogen used as the cryogen agent. The electric power and hydrogen would be supplied from nuclear and other source power plants spaced along the grid. Electricity would exit the system at various taps, connecting into the existing ac power grid. The hydrogen would also exit the grid, providing a readily available, alternative fuel, for perhaps fuel-cell based automobiles, or be retained as storage of electric power.",,"Electricity delivery; Fuel-cell based automobiles; Power grids; Automobiles; Electric cables; Electric currents; Electric potential; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Energy management; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Nuclear energy; Superconductivity; Voltage control; Electric utilities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13344269611

The system operator generates a signal, Area Control Error (ACE) signal at PJM, based on the difference between these two parameters. The expected goal is to keep the system near nominal 60 or 50 Hz. Traditionally, frequency regulation is managed by varying the output of fossil fuel or hydro generators connected to the electric grid. The authors present a new method in which electric energy is recycled. First, absorbing energy when it is in abundance, then discharging the same for the desired frequency regulation effect. The proposed system is based on kinetic energy storage technology in high-speed flywheels. Performance modeling results, based on actual ACE signals, indicate that a modular flywheel system matrix is effective in providing frequency regulation. The cost of this system is attractive compared with today's generator-based approach. The controlled injection or absorption of reactive power, inherent to the system, extents its capability to provide voltage support. Further, fast acting control electronics allow for the damping of grid oscillations. All the above functions, once deployed in moderate numbers, could help prevent frequency and voltage shifts that have been linked to significant blackouts in recent history.","Distributed Resources; Energy Storage; Flexible AC Transmission System; Flywheels; Frequency Control; Reactive Power; Renewable Resources; Transmission system; Uninterruptible Power Systems; Voltage Control","Flywheels; Frequencies; Kinetic energy; Reactive power; Recycling; Renewable energy resources; Signal processing; Uninterruptible power systems; Voltage control; Distributed resources; Flexible AC transmission system; Frequency control; Renewable resources; Transmission systems; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13344261339

This approach is critically dependent upon the pulse power switches employed to reduce the mass, volume and weight of pulsed power system. The three general functions a power conditioning system must perform are storage, switching, and scaling. This paper discusses the importance of switches in compact pulse power systems due to the fact that the available energy storage technologies operate near dielectric breakdown and scaling methods are limited to switch dependent vector inversion generators and transformers. Two design examples of compact, stacked Blumlein line pulse power systems are presented and the switch requirements developed. This paper also evaluates the benefits of high dielectric strength materials when employed in very thin sections in energy storage and scaling systems. These system design examples are compared with conventional approaches for pulse power systems and compact power conditioning systems goals. Experimental data from a gas switched stacked Blumlein line system is presented to demonstrate the switching requirements of such a power conditioning system. Finally, candidate switch technologies that have the potential to meet the compact pulse power system requirements are presented with future research and development requirements.",,"Compact pulse power systems; Dielectric breakdown; Dielectric strength; Power conditioning systems; Dielectric materials; Electric conductivity; Electric generators; Electric transformers; Energy storage; Inductance measurement; Product design; Standby power systems; Strength of materials; Volume measurement; Electric switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244278157

On first stage of working of combined opening switch (COS) a magnetic field distribution has great importance, more exactly, on the stage of energy storing. Ampere force acting on electrodes of vacuum breaking may be significant, what may cause electrodes breaking. Under electrodes moving apart a magnetic field will push out an arc from burning area and results in disorder of COS working.

Modifications to the system have also been in evaluated in the past for radiation experiments where the required current rise time is one order of magnitude shorter than that of hydrodynamic experiments. To achieve this very short rise time, inductive-energy storage with a plasma opening switch configuration appears to be the best option. The paper furthers the work reported in [1] by analyzing a circuit model of the Atlas machine as a source of x-rays. The circuit consists of physics-based electrical models for the Marx capacitor banks and series damping resistors, output cables, transmission lines, plasma opening switch, vacuum feed, and Z-pinch load. PSpice circuit simulation is used to predict system performance for various parameter values, and conditions for achieving maximum radiation produced by the kinetic energy of the Z-pinch load. Inductance changes of the load during implosion, and of the plasma opening switch during the conduction phase are simulated according to published models. The main assumption that is made in the study is that the conduction and opening physics of the plasma opening switch scales to the plasma density required for the much larger Atlas current magnitude.",,"Atlas machine; Marx capacitors; Plasma opening switches; Weapons-physics experiments; Damping; Electric lines; Hydrodynamics; Kinetic energy; Plasma density; Plasmas; Power generation; Resistors; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244259676

They are readily made with a low-cost polymerization technique based on two-photon absorption. Microsensors are free-floating in the liquid to be characterized. A linearly-polarized optical tweezers is used to trap one sensor at the laser focal point and to generate the optical torque needed for local hydrodynamic measurements. Viscosity and velocity microsensors have slab shapes that align in the polarization direction. The local viscosity is deduced from the maximum rotation frequency generated by the rotating linear polarization, while the fluid velocity is obtained by measuring the maximum angle that equilibrates the optical torque and drag torque. Experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations. The micropump is based on a micron-size Archimedes screw that rotates around its long axis when it is trapped at the focal point. The laser-induced rotation is due to the optical torque that is transferred by the laser scattering on the screw.","Archimedes screw; Drag torque; Micro-velocimetry; Micro-viscosimetry; Micropump; Microsensor; Optical torque; Optical tweezers; Polymerization; Two-photon absorption","Cells; Crystal structure; Energy gap; Hydrodynamics; Microstructure; Optical data storage; Photopolymerization; Silica; Torque; Velocity measurement; Archimedes screw; Drag torque; Micro-viscosimetry; Micropumps; Optical torque; Optical tweezers; Two-photon absorption; Microsensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244258276

The EPL method consists of two steps, in the first step we get rapidly some initial unit commitment schedules by Priority List (PL) method. In this step, operational constraints are disregarded. In the second step, unit schedules are modified using the problem specific heuristics to fulfill operational constraints and to reduce the total cost. To calculate efficiently, some heuristics are only applied to solutions which can expect improvement. The ramp constraint for thermal unit is considered at last of EPL method.

The use of water filled spark gaps to transfer energy from one energy storage stage to another has led to a high degree of integration not possible with gas switches. This, coupled with the relatively high breakdown strength of water manifests as short gap lengths and correspondingly low switch inductance. Though water switches have been used extensively in pulsed power drivers for many years, a predictive capability of their performance, and its scaling with voltage, is lacking. To improve our understanding of both the basic physics and the operational capability of water switches, an extensively diagnosed experiment on water switches, nominally operated at 4 MV and 350 kA, was conducted. This experiment has led to a deep understanding of the operation of water switches.

This paper presents DC bus signaling as a means of generator scheduling and power sharing in a nanogrid under steady-state conditions. DC bus signaling is a novel control strategy that is a hybrid of the voltage level signaling and voltage droop schemes. Discrete voltage levels on the nanogrid bus indicate the state of the system and determine the behaviour of each source.

Various coding and storage schemes and also other applications have been developed to exploit these correlations; therefore it is crucial to efficiently track the correlations. In this paper, a linear prediction algorithm is developed to initially establish the correlations, and the order of linear prediction has been derived from the prediction error power distribution. A tracking algorithm uses discrete Kalman filter to track the correlation once it is initially obtained. This Kalman filter based algorithm uses the gradient computed at each step as the input control vector. This approach is suitable for quantifying geographical spatial correlation and multi-modality correlation. Experimental results using various data sets have shown that the proposed scheme can accurately obtain the correlation and consumes much less energy as compared to known schemes.",,"Line-of-bearings (LOB); Microsensor networks; Sensor fields; Sensor networks; Algorithms; Arrays; Correlation methods; Data communication systems; Data reduction; Microsensors; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13244249685

Box 522, 11001 Belgrade, Yugoslavia","One of the greatest challenges in the use of nuclear energy is the high radioactive long-lived waste which is generated during production. It must be dealt with safely and effectively. While technical solutions exist, including deep geological repositories, progress in the disposal of radioactive waste has been influenced, and in many cases delayed, by public perceptions about the safety of the technology. One of the primary reasons for this is the long life of many of radionuclides, actinides and fission products, with half-lives on the order of a hundred thousand to a millions years. Problems of perceptions could be reduced significantly, according to our and many others author's opinion, if there were a way to burn or destroy the most toxic long-lived radioactive wastes. As there are no industrial methods for waste destroying today, in this paper it was suggested a new hybrid, deterministic approach: instead of final waste disposal, long-termed but yet temporal storage only, striving towards final destruction once the appropriate conditions are maintained. This new or modified old approach could affect current HLLLW management and related activities in: changes of processing technology; prolonging the time period of waste storage at temporal depositories; increasing the investment into research regarding the methods and technologies for destructions of these materials, and slowing down the investments into the very expensive final disposal repositories. It is authors' opinion that such deterministic, conceptual approach would contribute the reviving interest in nuclear energy, all over the world and especially in small and developing countries.",,"Actinides; Electric power generation; Fission products; Geological repositories; Investments; Nuclear energy; Nuclear reactors; Numerical analysis; Radiation protection; Radioactive waste disposal; Waste management; Geological formations; Radioactive decay; Radioactive sources; Waste storage; Radioactive wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844260139

Most studies use control algorithms that dynamically transition devices to low power modes after they are idle for a certain threshold period of time. The control algorithms used in the past have two major limitations. First, they require painstaking, application-dependent manual tuning of their thresholds to achieve energy savings without significantly degrading performance. Second, they do not provide performance guarantees. In one case, they slowed down an application by 835%! This paper addresses these two limitations for both memory and disks, making memory/disk energy-saving schemes practical enough to use in real systems. Specifically, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a technique that provides a performance guarantee for control algorithms. We show that our method works well for all tested cases, even with previously proposed algorithms that are not performance-aware. (2) We propose a new control algorithm, Performance-directed Dynamic (PD), that dynamically adjusts its thresholds periodically, based on available slack and recent workload characteristics. For memory, PD consumes the least energy, when compared to previous hand-tuned algorithms combined with a performance guarantee. However, for disks, PD is too complex and its self-tuning is unable to beat previous hand-tuned algorithms. (3) To improve on PD, we propose a simple, optimization-based, threshold-free control algorithm, Performance-directed Static (PS). PS periodically assigns a static configuration by solving an optimization problem that incorporates information about the available slack and recent traffic variability to different chips/disks. We find that PS is the best or close to the best across all performance-guaranteed disk algorithms, including hand-tuned versions.","Adaptation algorithms; Control algorithms; Low power design; Memory and disk energy management; Multiple power mode device","Adaptation algorithms; Low power design; Memory and disk energy management; Multiple power mode device; Adaptive algorithms; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Dynamic random access storage; Energy conservation; Energy management; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Problem solving; UNIX; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844250569

In particular, storage memory and energy saving as well as resilience to physical compromising of a sensor are the more stringent requirements. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) we describe a new threat model to communications confidentiality in WSNs (the smart attacker model); under this new, more realistic threat model, the security features of the previous schemes proposed in the literature drastically decrease; (2) we provide a new pseudo-random key pre-deployment strategy that assures: (a) a key discovery phase that requires no communications; (b) high resilience against the smart attacker model.

With its platform independence and secure execution environment, Java is fast becoming the language of choice for programming embedded systems. In order to extend its use to array based applications from embedded image and video processing, Java programmers need to employ several optimizations. Unfortunately, due to its precise exception mechanism and bytecode distribution form, it is not generally possible to use classical loop based optimization techniques for array based embedded Java applications. Observing this, this paper proposes a dynamic memory layout optimization strategy for Java applications. The strategy is based on observing the cache behavior dynamically and transforming memory layouts of arrays, when necessary, during the course of execution. This is in contrast to many previously proposed memory layout optimization strategies, which are static in nature (i.e., they are applied at compile time).

The PAT method recently presented by us is based on a concept of an average statistical trajectory for transfer of light energy, the photon average trajectory (PAT). The inverse problem of diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is reduced to solution of integral equation with integration along a conditional PAT. As a result the conventional algorithms of projection computed tomography can be used for fast reconstruction of diffuse optical images. In our recent works we have shown that the application of the backprojection algorithms with special filtration of shadows allows a 20%-gain in spatial resolution to be obtained. But the shortcoming of the backprojection algorithms is that they can not reconstruct accurately the object regions located close to the boundary. In the present paper we consider alternative approach to improve the spatial resolution, which may be applied to images reconstructed with the use of algebraic techniques. It is based on post-reconstruction restoration of images blurred due to averaging over spatial distributions of photons, which form the signal measured by the receiver. We suggest a spatially invariant blurring model to restore local regions of a diffuse image with the use of standard deconvolution algorithms. Two iterative non-linear algorithms: the maximum-likelihood algorithm and the Lucy-Richardson algorithm are considered. It is shown that both of them allow the spatial resolution to be improved. The effect of the improvement is identical to that obtained with the use of the backprojection algorithms.","Deconvolution algorithms; Diffuse optical tomography; Image deblurring; Photon average trajectory; Spatial resolution; Spatially invariant blurring model","Deconvolution algorithms; Diffuse optical tomography; Image deblurring; Photon average trajectory (PAT); Spatial resolution; Spatially invariant blurring model; Algebra; Algorithms; Light scattering; Optical image storage; Photons; Tomography; Image reconstruction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12144264186

Given the low computation and battery power capacities of these sensor nodes, the key design factors of network protocols are self-configuring, energy-efficient, adaptive, and scalable. We presented the multi-hop infrastructure network architecture (MINA) for a wireless sensor network consisting of a few hundred sensors that communicate data to a base station (BS). 1 We designed a Unified Network Protocol Framework for MINA that encompasses network organization, medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols. In this paper, we improve it by adaptively varying transmission range to maintain network connectivity. It is a derivative-free optimization algorithm. The BS periodically evaluates the objective function, chooses the appropriate transmission range and broadcasts it to the sensor nodes that then update the transmission range. The advantages are: (i) Avoids the disconnectivity; (ii) Maximizes the number of nodes that can be connected to the BS, (iii) Minimizes the energy × delay metric and (iv) Avoids the ""hot-spot"" nodes in the network. The performance in terms of delay, throughput, energy consumption and network lifetimes, is studied in detail using discrete-event simulation compared with other protocol. The results show that the it is energy efficient in a large scale network.","Energy Efficiency; MAC Protocol; Routing Protocol; Sensor Networks","Embedded processors; MAC protocol; Routing protocol; Sensor networks; Carrier communication; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Network protocols; Radio; Sensors; Computer networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844303550

The PV generation system is characterized by two controllers, namely, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller which makes it possible to take the maximum power which solar arrays can generate at any time irrespective of the weather, and a controller which quickly charges the maximum power obtained by the MPPT control to series connected ultra-electric double layer capacitors (ultra-EDLCs) while maintaining the electric capacity which solar arrays can generate at that time. The MPPT controller controls the output current of the solar arrays so that the output power converges on the maximum power in the prediction line previously determined based on the linearity between the maximum output power and the optimization current. The MPPT controller is characterized by having the ability to enlarge the controllable range of the output power to lower solar radiation in comparison with the conventional hill-climbing method. The charging controller controls the current and voltage so as to be charged at around the power generated at that time while supervising the maximum voltage and allowable temperature of each series connected EDLC. The combined control method makes it possible to charge with the maximum power generation from solar arrays into ultra-EDLCs.

Its potentially increased energy density (30-50 Wh/kg) will also make it suitable for use in a much wider range of electric vehicle applications including on-road buses and trucks as well as in delivery vans and vehicles for urban areas.

The initial feed solution for the V/Br cell is a 50:50 mixture of V(III) and V(IV) bromides. Having the same electrolyte in both half-cells, the V/Br system has no problems of cross-contamination and combines the best features of the original VRB system with a high energy density and wider temperature capability.

A hybrid power system has a power-balanced controller to equilibrate generation power with a given load demand which is composed of common DC power system. To execute a power-balanced control, a hybrid power system is assumed that all of the power generators have the characteristics of an equivalent current-source and load sharing control technique must be needed at the same time.

For some molecules such as H 3+, however, the low energy dissociative recombination (DR) rate is observed to be high despite the absence of such a crossing. We show how the Jahn-Teller coupling mechanism can produce a surprisingly high DR rate in H3+ by first exciting a Rydberg state attached to an ionic vibrationally excited level, which subsequently dissociates. The resulting DR rate coefficients are in good agreement with storage ring experiments that have utilized a rotationally cold ionic target. © Physica Scripta 2004.",,"Electric excitation; Excited states; Ground state; Ion sources; Dissociative recombination; Ionic ground state surface; Molecular ions; Polyatomic molecules; Molecular electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344277817

The design of the local memory organization must take several factors into account, including the memory bandwidth and size requirements of the program and the distribution of program data among the memories. In addition, when register structures and function units in the accelerator are clustered, the effects of intercluster communication should be taken into account. This work proposes a technique to synthesize the local memory architecture of a clustered accelerator using a phase-ordered approach. First, the dataflow graph is pre-partitioned to define a performance-centric grouping of the operations. Second, memory synthesis is performed by combining multiple data structures into a set of physical memories that minimizes cost while maintaining a performance threshold. Finally, post-partitioning is performed to determine the final assignment of operations to clusters given the memory organization. Results show that customization reduces memory cost from 2% to 59% over a naïve scheme that utilizes one physical memory per program data structure. Further, pre-partitioning is shown to reduce the intercluster communication required to achieve a fixed performance.",,"Automatic synthesis; Intercluster communication; Memory architecture; Multicluster application accelerators; Application specific integrated circuits; Bandwidth; Constraint theory; Data reduction; Data structures; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244327032

The primary issues are power efficiency, mass and size, and long-term stability. Flywheels as one-to-one replacements for spacecraft batteries are competitive for only a few special missions. When flywheels replace components in two major bus subsystems, the potential weight and volume benefits are attractive. The objective of this paper is to describe the progression of flywheel technology state-of-the-art for integrated power and attitude control (IPAC) systems in space applications, and describe current AFRL efforts. The main technology areas that are addressed are flywheel designs, bearings containment and safety, and combined power distribution and attitude control.",,"Attitude control; Energy transmission systems; Power efficiency; Spacecraft batteries; Accident prevention; Electric batteries; Electric power distribution; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Microprocessor chips; Satellites; Space applications; Spacecraft; Flywheels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244261308

In these systems, technology scaling has resulted in an increase of subthreshold and gate leakage currents, which contribute significantly to the total cache power consumption. This underlines a need to analyze leakage power consumption and control techniques at every level of system design in embedded applications. In this paper, we have studied three individual leakage control techniques using Hotleakage [2], applied at architectural level over a range of smaller technology sizes including 70nm. Specifically, evaluation of the effects of varying L1 cache sizes (with the size of the other cache constant) demonstrated that the leakage power is directly proportional to the size of the L1 cache. With increasing L2 cache sizes the leakage power increased almost to ∼50% of the total L2-cache power consumption for 70nm technology.",,"Embedded processors; Exponential effects; Leakage power; Power consumption; Benchmarking; Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Gates (transistor); Leakage currents; Simulators; Voltage control; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144347875

Innovative engineering technologies are needed to address a large range of problems in energy balance, intake, and expenditure that are associated with the obesity epidemic. Excess adipose tissue, representing fat storage, ultimately derives from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure.

They can be efficiently used for space heating (and cooling), extracting heat from seawater, rivers, lakes, groundwater, rocks, sewage, or mine water. Electrical energy powers the heat pump's compressor. The ratio of total heat output to electrical energy input, called the coefficient of performance, typically ranges from 3.0 to 6.0. The use of mine water for space heating or cooling purposes has been demonstrated to be feasible and economic in applications in Scotland, Canada, Norway, and the USA. Mine water is an attractive energy resource due to: (1) the high water storage and water flux in mine workings, representing a huge renewable enthalpy reservoir; (2) the possibility of re-branding a potentially polluting environmental liability as a 'green' energy resource; and (3) the development of many mine sites as commercial/industrial parks with large space heating/cooling requirements. The exothermic nature of the pyrite oxidation reaction (> 1000 kJ/mol) implies added benefits if closed-loop systems can harness the chemical energy released in mine-waste tips. An appreciation of geochemistry also assists in identifying and solving possible problems with precipitation reactions occurring in heat pump systems. © The Geological Society of London 2004.",,"energy resource; heat transfer; mine waste; waste management; Harness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044227513

Immediately after injection, the CO 2 will be stored as a free phase within the host rock. Over time it will dissolve into the local formation water and initiate a variety of geochemical reactions. Some of the these reactions could be beneficial, helping to chemically contain or 'trap' the CO 2 as dissolved species and by the formation of new carbonate minerals; others may be deleterious, and actually aid the migration of CO 2. It will be important to understand the overall impact of these competing processes. However, these processes will also be dependent upon the structure, mineralogy and hydrogeology of the specific lithologies concerned and the chemical stability of the engineered features (principally, the cement and steel components in the well completions). Therefore, individual storage operations will have to take account of local geological, fluid chemical and hydrogeological conditions.

A stand-alone RE system based on energy storage in the form of hydrogen has been developed at the Hydrogen Research Institute and successfully tested for automatic operation with an in-house designed control system and power conditioning devices. In this system the excess energy with respect to load demand is sent to the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen which, when properly stored, is available to the fuel cell to produce electricity when there is insufficient wind and solar energy with respect to load requirement. The RE system components have substantially different voltage-current characteristics, and they are integrated through the designed and developed power conditioning devices on a DC bus, which allows power to be managed between input power, energy storage and load. The DC-DC buck and boost converters are connected for power conditioning between the DC bus and the electrolyzer, and between the fuel cell and the DC bus, respectively. With respect to the energy level at the DC bus and the control strategy, the controller sends the conditioned signal (duty ratio) to the digitally controlled DC-DC converters for on/off operation, thus controlling the power flow to the electrolyzer and from the fuel cell. The converters' control is based on a chopper multiphase switching technique, which reduces the harmonics levels and ripples with a simple additional filter. The simulated and experimental results of the boost and buck converter operations are compared. Also the effect of duty ratio with respect to the number of cells in the converters has been studied for harmonic reduction. It has been found that the designed and developed DC-DC converters and the control system give effective power flow control with automatic operation of the system under different load conditions and with intermittent inputs from wind turbine generator and photovoltaic array.","DC-DC converters; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Multiphase switching; Power system; Renewable energy","Dc-dc converters; Electrolytic hydrogen; Multiphase switching; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); DC machinery; Electric converters; Electric power systems; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Switching; Hydrogen",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10944242028

A particularly cost-sensitive issue with energy storage is the high replacement cost of depleted battery banks. One possibility to ease the power burden on batteries and fuel cells is to use ultra-capacitors as load-leveling devices. The high power density of ultra-capacitors allows a significant reduction in the power fluctuations imposed on the remaining electrical system; however, the same ultra-capacitors have a very low energy density and therefore must be used sparingly and with coordination. A control strategy for coordinated power distribution is a central issue for ultracapacitor-supported systems. Toward this end, several control methods are implemented on an electric vehicle equipped with a battery/ultracapacitor system with the goal of improving battery life and overall vehicle efficiency. A particular goal is to obtain both a peaking load control and a frequency-weighted coordination between capacitor and battery in order to mitigate transients in the battery current demand. A key control design issue is that the control objectives vary with respect to vehicle velocity, driver's power demand, and state-of-charge of both the batteries and ultracapacitors.

The paper presents examples for torsional resonances measured in the IPP experimental power supply, an isolated power system based on flywheel generators. After a routine check of these synchronous machines, damage to a coupling of one rotor shaft system was revealed which can only be explained by an electromechanical resonance, itself excited by active power transients from thyristor converter loads. Once the coupling was repaired, a novel power electronic device for damping the torsional vibrations was developed. The power circuitry of the device consists of a six-pulse thyristor bridge which is connected to a magnet coil acting as a buffer storage of magnetic energy. The thyristor converter is feedback controlled with the measured first natural frequency of the shaft assembly. Thus, only little damping power is needed which results in a compact converter design. Up to now, two thyristor controlled devices were applied on different synchronous machines in more than 2000 dynamic load cases. Since they work demonstrably reliable and do not require modifications to the existing control or drive system, applications to special-purpose industrial drives are presently investigated.",,"Control systems; Damping; Dynamic loads; Electric drives; Rotors; Shafts (machine components); Synchronous machinery; Thyristors; Vibration measurement; Magnetic energy; Rotor shaft system; Torsional vibration; Torsional stress",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744255309

However, lifetime of those capacitors are shortened by the power pulsation with twice utility frequency. The authors have been studied two kinds of DC ripple compensation circuits, such the authors call an inductive storage method and a capacitive storage method, those enable to transfer the ripple energy appeared on the output DC capacitors into the energy in an additional inductor and additional small capacitors.

This active power may overcharge the ESC. Two possibilities to overcome this situation are explored in this paper: 1) if the dc-voltage of the ESC is lower than a predetermined voltage level, the active power is employed to charge the ESC to this voltage level; 2) otherwise, the overvoltage protection of the SSC must operate. This paper also applies an overvoltage protection scheme based on a combination of a dc resistor with a chopper and the valves of the SSC. The design of the dc resistor is discussed.

This paper describes a modeling and control effort that was undertaken for improving run-to-run repeatability. A multiscale input-output model was developed for the primary physical phenomena in the deposition process - gas flow, plasma discharge, sputtering, and atom transport. The model predicts the deposition rate, the energy distribution of sputtered atoms, and their sensitivity to deposition conditions such as power, working gas type, pressure, gas temperature, and electrode spacing. Simulations with this model were used to determine the process parameters to which the wafer properties have the maximum sensitivity. Experiments were performed to determine the relative importance of these parameters. Based on the results, a controller was designed to regulate the time-integrated target bias voltage. Implementation of the controller reduced wafer-to-wafer variation of GMR properties by over 50%.

Although plasma displays show high performances their use is still restricted to high-end professional applications because of high cost. A large part of the cost is caused by the electronic which covers the whole backside of the panel. Almost three quarter of the electronic is related to sustain drivers. These drivers provide the panel with high frequency AC voltages of about +/- 175V. Because of the energy stored in the electrode capacitance and the high repetition frequency, sustain drivers in PDP consist of transistor H-bridges and energy recovery circuits. These energy recovery circuits are based on resonant topologies, which are formed by the parasitic capacitances of the panel and discrete chokes. Ideally all energy, repetitively stored in the capacitance of the panel, can be recovered. However, the required MOSFETs, the chokes and the PCB connections cause voltage drops, which damp the oscillation, leading to hard-switching operation in the sustain driver units applied today. The paper thus describes the topology and the fundamental operation of standard sustain drivers and it proposes two alternative solutions. Both solutions allow real zero voltage switching. The first alternative sustain driver concept only uses another control scheme, which can be easily installed in the present hardware. The second new concept uses split auxiliary DC voltages for the resonant commutation. The two DC voltages are adapted to perform a complete resonant commutation of the panel voltage with the lowest current. This solution needs a small buck and a small boost converter to be designed for continuous power flow. Since up to 8 sustain driver units are operating in parallel at the same DC link voltage, the required buck and boost converter can be used for all sustain driver units. Prototypes of the standard and the alternative sustain drivers have been built and successfully tested.",,"Boost converter; Plasma display panels (PDP); Professional applications; Sustain drivers; Electric commutation; Electric converters; Electric potential; Electrodes; Energy storage; Resonance; Television; Transistors; Plasma display devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744286719

Currently the main cause of customer complaints due to light flicker is the voltage fluctuation generated by arc furnaces, which often represent the largest single load of an electric power utility. Because of cost efficiency the energy storage capability of static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) for the mitigation of voltage flicker can still only be small compared to the energy taken by an arc furnace during one period of the line voltage. This leads to high demands on compensation strategies.

Savings are achieved by operating the power converters in efficient operating points, meeting the desired power output with an energy storage device. Predictions of the future desired output and conditions are used, with the largest gain for an infinite prediction horizon. This is not realistic: predictions for the far future are unreliable. So, it is of interest to know the performance degradation due to a finite horizon.

A prototype generator for low frequency (human body) motion has been developed using a micro-machined (MEMS) implementation of an inertial generator based on a moving-plate capacitor. The prototype generates pulses of 300 V on a 10 pF capacitor. This paper examines the design of a circuit and mosfet device to convert this energy to a low voltage. Because of the very small charge involved, the effect of leakage and parasitic stored charge are important. A silicon-on-insulator design is proposed and is examined through physics based finite-element simulation. The overall effectiveness of the generation process is shown to be composed of several terms which are functions of system parameters such as generator flight time, device area and circuit inductance.

Power densities and speeds of pulsed-power circuits have increased dramatically due to the commercial introduction of fast, multi-kilovolt IGBT silicon and SiC diodes featured in PCB-style packages. A solid-state modulator concept that stands to benefit considerably from recent IGBT and SiC breakthroughs is the Marx configuration - where an array of stacked modules generates high-voltage output pulses directly from a low voltage DC supply. The Marx scheme avoids the large, inefficient and costly magnetic cores inherent in standard modulator designs, resulting in a considerably simpler, cheaper and more compact mechanical solution. The main disadvantage to this approach is that the individual cells in a Marx bank must float at high voltages during the pulse, complicating the distribution of power and timing signals. This paper examines in closer detail the practical advantages and pitfalls of a solid-state Marx configuration, and explores a design approach with emphasis on performance, wall-plug efficiency, cost of manufacture, availability and ease of service.

Another expectation is that electrolytic capacitors will be replaced by film capacitors in order to increase the ASD lifetime, but as this has lower energy density, the dc-link capacitance is expected to decrease. In these circumstances, operation under unbalanced and distorted supply voltage as well as high dynamic operation of the ASD makes the control task more challenging. This paper discusses problems related to the ASD dc-link both in respect to its stability (under regeneration as well as in the case of constant power absorbed by the inverter stage) both also in respect to the dc voltage ripple generated by the grid unbalance and made more severe due to the small dc-link storage. To mitigate the latter problem it is proposed to pre-compensate the dc-link voltage reference signal considering the real grid voltage. Experiments show that the system handles successfully unbalance situation even with a small dc-link capacitor.",,"Adjustable speed drives (ASD); Electrolytic converters; Grid voltage; Voltage supply; Electric inverters; Electric potential; Electric rectifiers; Electrolytic analysis; Pulse width modulation; Robustness (control systems); Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744227050

A protected electrical power supply is possible by using a static Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), because its electrical energy is stored in a dc-link intermediate circuit, connected with a battery. An important cost factor and power loss producer is the usually inserted line frequency output transformer. The elimination of the transformer causes a changing of the circuit topology and a riising of the dc-link voltage. It is possible to omit the transformer by connecting the ground wire of the load to the centre point of the dc-link capacitor. The dc-link voltage has to be higher than the sum of the peak value of the sinusoidal output voltage and the voltage drop of the output filter inductance at maximum load (e.g. Ud=800 V) [2]. A second cost factor is the dc-link capacitor. Its reactive power capacity becomes bigger compared to conventional UPS because the low-frequency load current flows through the centre point of the dc-link capacitors. This is an essential and an expenditure property [3]. The centre of the paper is the analysis of the dc-link capacitor current in different topologies.

"" Open Electric Energy Network (OEEN)"" which has been proposed by the authors is one of the future power networks [1]. The major function of OEEN is to maintain energy balance with respect to bilateral transactions so as not to cause line overloading. In order to achieve the function, many storage devices are distributed in the network, and which are controlled by a management system named as Power Router. The Power Router acquires information about bilateral transactions and power flows through a communication system to make a charge-discharge schedule of storage devices. The mobile agent discussed in the paper supports the information acquisition and the charge-discharge scheduling of storage devices, and which is called Power Router Support Agent (PRSA). We also discussed about another mobile agent to manage many storage devices in OEEN, and which is called Storage Device Management Agent (SDMA). The mobile agent is a kind of computer program which can deal with some works ordered by its user and also move within computer networks such as Internet[6].","Mobile agent; Power flow control and energy storage","Electric loads; Energy storage; Functions; Power control; Scheduling; Software agents; Energy balance; Mobile agents; Open electric energy network (OEEN); Power flow; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644270649

In each case, overall system performance can be improved significantly if we can first identify and then exploit interesting structure within a community's access patterns. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on file sharing that considers the relationships that form among users based on the files in which they are interested. We propose a new structure that captures common user interests in data - the data-sharing graph - and justify its utility with studies on three data-distribution systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, and the Kazaa peer-to-peer network. We find small-world patterns in the data-sharing graphs of all three communities. We analyze these graphs and propose some probable causes for these emergent small-world patterns.

The following guidelines have been derived: for an internal heat gain-dominated commercial building, the deviation of building geometry and zoning from the reference building only marginally affects the optimal control strategy; reasonable simplifications are acceptable without loss of cost savings potential. Building construction characteristics determine the building passive thermal storage capacity. Zone temperature setpoints are affected more than TES operation by this construction mismatch, and a loss of cost savings potential is found in some cases. It is advisable to make sure the construction material is well modeled. Zone temperature setpoint profiles and TES performance are strongly affected by mismatches in internal heat gains, especially when they are underestimated. Since they are a key factor determining the building cooling load, efforts should be invested to keep the internal gain mismatch as small as possible. Efficiencies of the building energy systems have no direct impact on building cooling load, but they affect both zone temperature setpoints and active TES operation because of the coupling of the base chiller and the TES chiller. Relative efficiencies of the base and TES chillers will determine the balance of operation of the two chillers. Mismatch in this category may be significant. To avoid critical modeling mismatch, system identification techniques may be useful in improving the modeling process.",,"Chillers; Modeling process; Thermal energy storage (TES); Zone temperature; Buildings; Closed loop control systems; Computer simulation; Cooling; Costs; Inventory control; Mathematical models; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8344284324

Side-entry mixers are frequently used to homogenize the contents of storage tanks. Normally, empirical correlations are used to determine the mixing time of these mixers. The objective of the work, discussed in this paper is to establish the potential of CFD in determining these mixing times. A buoyancy extended standard k-ε model has been used to model the mixing behaviour in a tank containing two miscible liquids of different density, which are stratified before the mixer is switched on. The agreement with the experiments was not good: the model in some cases underestimated the mixing time by an order of magnitude. In another attempt, LES technique was used to model this problem. The agreement with the experiments became better but still the mixing time in the low Froude number range was seriously underestimated.

However, the on-line algorithm proposed in that study requires cumbersome parameter tuning for each workload and is therefore difficult to apply to real systems. This paper presents a new power-aware on-line algorithm called PB-LRU (Partition-Based LRU) that requires little parameter tuning.

This has resulted in the manufacture of propane and LPG tanks with thinner walls. For example, some 500 gallon ASME code propane tanks have had the wall thickness reduced from 7.7 mm in 2001 to 7.1 mm in 2002 and now to 6.5 mm in 2004. This change significantly affects the fire survivability of these tanks. This paper presents both experimental and computational results that show the effect of this design change on tank fire survivability to fire impingement. The results show that for the same pressure relief valve setting, the thinner wall tanks are more likely to fail in a given fire situation. In severe fires, the thinner walled tanks will fail earlier. An earlier failure usually means the tank will fail with a higher fill level, because the pressure relief system has had less time to vent material from the tank. A higher liquid fill level at failure also means more energy is in the tank and this means the failure will be more violent. The worst failure scenario is known as a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) and this mode of failure is also more likely with the thinner walled tanks. The results of this work suggest that certain applications of pressure vessels such as propane transport and storage may require higher design margins than required by the ASME.","BLEVE; Design margin; Fire exposure; Pressure vessel","Design margins; Fire exposure; Fire survivability; Overpressure protection; Boiling liquids; Codes (standards); Failure analysis; Fire protection; Pressure vessels; Propane; Structural design; Valves (mechanical); Tanks (containers)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7744238059

The ability to probe the surface for chemical functionality and acid-base interactions is valuable for matching fillers with the appropriate matrix. In this study, the surface energy of exfoliated graphite nanoparticles was determined via wicking measurements using water at varied pH followed by analysis using the Washburn equation. The surface energy provided the basis for determining the work of adhesion and the dispersive and acid-base interactions. This wicking process was also applied in order to evaluate chemistry changes induced on the surface of exfoliated graphite by an oxygen-plasma treatment. The work of adhesion has its highest value at larger values of pH as a result of the acidic functional groups added to the exfoliated graphite by oxygen-plasma treatment. Analysis of XPS data indicates that the primary functionality added to the surface comes from hydroxyl groups. However, carbonyl and carboxyl groups are also present. The effect of the time between oxygen plasma treatment and surface chemical condition was also studied in this research. It was determined that the work of adhesion decreases with time when the oxygen plasma treated graphite is stored in air. After 24 hours the work of adhesion stabilized over the period in which it was evaluated. The decrease in work of adhesion reflects chemical changes that occurred with storage in air. XPS analysis shows that there is an increase of 140% carbonyl functionality and a 22.4% decrease in hydroxyl functionality associated with these temporal changes. Since carbonyl groups are less reactive with basic solutions than hydroxyl groups, the work of adhesion was lowered. Surface chemical changes were correlated to mechanical properties of composites made with oxygen plasma treated graphite reinforcement.","Composite filler; Graphite nanocomposites; Polymer matrix; Surface energy","Composite fillers; Oxygen plasma treatment; Polymer matrices; Adhesion; Interfacial energy; Nanostructured materials; Oxygen; pH effects; Plasma applications; Plastics fillers; Reinforcement; Surface treatment; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Graphite",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044220843

We have mathematically modeled this conversion technique in order to determine a design methodology as well as provide a means to evaluate the performance of specific designs. The main principle of operation of the conversion technique is in utilizing microscopic waveguides in combination with specialized rectifying structures, called ballistic diodes. These structures, when properly combined, enable DC power generation using switching supply techniques. This is achieved by treating the infrared radiation as a high frequency AC source. This conversion methodology is now possible due to the fact that ballistic rectifiers are much smaller (∼200nm) than a wavelength of thermal energy radiation (∼18μm). We have shown that it is possible to obtain voltages on the order of 0.02 volts from one wave-guide, while using rectifiers that are only 14% efficient. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to extract 90% of the available energy within 10μm of depth of the wave-guide structure (assuming a wave-guide opening of 3μm x 9.4μm). We have observed that power densities on the order of tens of watts per cubic centimeter are theoretically possible using this technique.

Methods which increase the hit ratio of the cache hierarchy will typically enhance the performance and reduce the embedded system's total energy consumption. This is mainly due to reduced cache-to-memory bus transactions, fewer main memory accesses and fewer processor waiting cycles. A heuristic approach is presented to reduce the total number of cache misses by carefully relocating selected sections of the application's software code within the main memory, thus reducing conflict misses resulting from the cache hierarchy. The method requires no hardware modifications i.e. it is a software-only approach. For the first rime such a method is applied to large program traces, and the miss rates and corresponding energy savings are observed while varying cache size, line size and associativity. Relocating the code consistently produces superior performance on direct-mapped cache. Since direct-mapped caches, being smaller in silicon area than caches with higher associativity (for the same size), cost less in terms of energy/access, and access faster, using direct-mapped instruction cache with code relocation for performance-oriented embedded systems is recommended. A maximum cache miss rate reduction from 71% down to less than 1% is achieved, with energy reductions of up to 63% with only a small increase in main memory size. © IEE, 2004.",,"Algorithms; Cache memory; Codes (symbols); Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Semantics; Storage allocation (computer); Cache allocation; Code relocation; Heuristic code placement; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244289384

At the ultrastructural level, crystal structure and protein secondary structure distort as the tissue is loaded. These structural changes are followed as perturbations to tissue spectra. We load tissue in a custom-made dynamic mechanical tester that fits on the stage of a Raman microprobe and can accept hydrated tissue specimens. As the specimen is loaded in tension and/or compression, the shifts in mineral P-O4 ν 1 and relative band heights in the Amide III band envelope are followed with the microprobe. Average load is measured using a load cell while the tissue is loaded under displacement control. Changes occur in both the mineral and matrix components of bone as a response to elastic deformation. We propose that the mineral apatitic crystal lattice is deformed by movement of calcium and other ions. The matrix is proposed to respond by deformation of the collagen backbone. Raman microspectroscopy shows that bone mineral is not a passive contributor to tissue strength. The mineral active response to loading may function as a local energy storage and dissipation mechanism, thus helping to protect tissue from catastrophic damage.","Biomechanics; Bone; Raman","Biomechanics; Crystal lattices; Crystal structure; Crystallization; Deformation; Perturbation techniques; Proteins; Raman spectroscopy; Tissue; Collagen backbone; Cortical bone; Raman microprobe; Ultrastructural elastic deformation; Bone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5644259781

These protein reversibly bind odorants with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. For this reason, they are good candidates as biological elements in the development of biosensors. Vertebrate OBPs belong to the lipocalin superfamily. Even if the members of this superfamily display low sequence similarity, all of them show a conserved folding pattern, that is an 8-stranded β-barrel flanked by an α-helix at the C-terminal end of the protein chain. The β-barrel defines a central apolar cavity, called calyx, whose role is to bind and transport hydrophobic odorant molecules. The detection of hazard exposure is becoming a priority in the third millennium, and OBPs are good candidates for detecting traces of explosive molecules in different environments such as luggage's storage rooms and public places. In this context, the measurement of refractive index of odor-binding protein in absence and in presence of odorant molecules have been performed in order to assess its usefulness as a probe for detection of hazardous agents. The work is instrumental to explore the possibility to realize a biosensor where the concentration of searched for substances is analyzed as a variation of the protein refractive index by means of suitable optoelectronic devices.","Biohazard; Biosensors; Odor-binding proteins; Refractive index measurements","Binding energy; Biosensors; Dissociation; Hydrophobicity; Odor control; Optoelectronic devices; Refractive index; Biohazard; Folding pattern; Odor-binding proteins (OBP); Refractive index measurements; Proteins",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5644246321

Projecting growth in US gas demand to 29.7 tcf in 2020 from 21.5 tcf in 2003, the study predicts electric power generation will account for 67% of the increase, followed by residential uses 14%, commercial and industrial 8% each, and other uses. To supplement North American production, the INGAA study says LNG imports will have to leap from 475 bcf in 2003 to > 6.6 tcf in 2020. That growth will require construction of 10 terminal and expansion of the four existing facilities. The study assumes construction of two terminals on the East Coast, seven on the Gulf Coast, and one on the West Coast. EEA notes that new pipeline capacity will be needed from frontier basins and to accommodate growing imports of LNG. Additional pipeline infrastructure will be needed to accommodate expected increases in LNG receiving capacity, which will exceed 11 bcf/day.

Combustion heat is converted to electrical energy by thermoelectric generation, and hydrogen gas is used in fuel cells to provide electrical energy.

The home made solar panel consisted of six, 10 ft long parallel, 1/2 in. diameter PVC pipes with two headers and with no insulation. Both panels were placed on the east side roof of the author's house, therefore they received solar radiation during part of the day. The instrumentation consisted of seven thermocouples and a computer data acquisition system. Two identical, 20-gallon plastic tanks, one tank on each panel, were used for water storage. Two sets of comparative measurements were carried out. For the first set, the PVC solar panel pipes were white; for the second set, the PVC solar panel pipes were painted in black. For the white PVC system the maximum water temperature in the tank was slightly lower than the commercial solar panel tank water temperature. For the painted PVC system, the maximum water temperature in the tank was slightly higher than the commercial solar panel tank water temperature. In conclusion it can be stated that a simple homemade six-pipe, black PVC solar panel is superior to an expensive commercial solar panel. Although water tanks were not insulated, water temperatures in them have reached to about 100 deg-F in September. Such a system may be incorporated into one of the MET courses as a laboratory exercise to demonstrate basic principles of passive solar heating, calculation of heat losses, optimization, manufacturing techniques, creativity, etc.",,"Instrumentation; Solar panels; Water heating; Data acquisition; Heat losses; Heat pipes; Heating; Optimization; Polyvinyl chlorides; Thermal effects; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5444253457

Hydrogen storage reports in carbon-based materials vary widely; however, recent reports suggest that defects introduced during synthesis or heat treatment lead to an expanded graphite lattice and enhanced hydrogen storage in graphitic materials. The efficacy of certain a priori pretreatment methods to induce defects in graphitic materials and to expand the graphite lattice was studied. The extent of hydrogen uptake for carbon materials with induced defects was presented, and the results were used to test the hypothesis that defects lead to increased hydrogen storage.

Wind power has become the most important source of renewable energy in many countries, and has been shown to effectively complement central generation. However, good power quality of distributed generators is of vital importance, and for this reason independent control of the real and reactive power is desirable. In addition, there has been an increasing demand for alternative energy sources to behave like conventional generators, whereby their output power is deterministic. Wind energy is an inherently stochastic system and therefore, external measures must be used to overcome the fluctuations in the generator's energy production as a result of the wind's dynamics. This presentation deals with the modeling and simulation of a doubly-fed induction machine as a wind power generator. The ability of the system to provide independent control of the real and reactive power is demonstrated. The incorporation of a battery or other energy storage device in the dc link enables temporary storage of energy and therefore, the ability to provide smooth output power, which is both deterministic and resistant to wind speed fluctuations. The power electronic converters directly control the machine and act as the interface between the storage system and the grid. This allows full control over voltage characteristics as well as real power generation. Simulations of the system in EMTP-RVshow that the design is feasible.","Doubly-fed induction generator; Energy storage; Power electronics; Wind energy","Doubly-fed induction generators; Voltage characteristics; Wind energy conversion systems; Electric converters; Electric potential; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic control systems; Wind power; Wind turbines; Asynchronous machinery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5044229848

Microprocessors, typically, come with one or more levels of cache. Caches are geared toward extremely high throughput and fast switching, thereby require great attention in power management to avoid malfunction or performance degradation. Historically, architectural alternatives had aimed at improving cache performance by: reducing the miss rates, reducing the miss penalties, and the time to hit the cache. These alternatives include techniques such as increasing the data block size, use of victim caches, higher associativity and of course compiler optimization. In this work, we examine the impact of these techniques on the energy requirements of the memory system. Each performance optimization technique will be analyzed in relation to how it impacts the overall energy dissipation of the memory system. We will use two measures: average-memory- access-time (AMAT) which is the average latency per memory reference and average-memory-access-energy (AMAE) which is the average energy dissipated per memory reference to investigate performance and power tradeoffs for each optimization technique.","Average-Memory-Access-Energy; Average-Memory-Access-Time; Cache Performance Optimization","Average-memory-access-energy; Average-memory-access-time; Cache performance optimization; Energy-aware compilers; Bandwidth; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Optimization; Power electronics; Random access storage; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944230456

While the introduction of recycle streams helps to increase efficiency and minimize waste, it also leads to increased coupling between process variables, and thus more difficult control problems. One such example is coupling between storage (surge) vessels contained in recycle loops. Coupled surge tanks can be found in pulp screening operations. The main purpose of these tanks is to buffer changes in material (or energy) flow between the various unit operations within a process by allowing the tank levels to vary within limits. This is usually referred to as averaging level control. The averaging level control problem for a single tank has been extensively dealt with in the literature. However, for a coupled system of multiple tanks, a single-input single-output control strategy is no longer sufficient to provide good control performance. Hence, a multivariable control strategy is required. In this paper we will present various controller designs for the multivariable averaging level control problem. For obvious safety and economic reasons, the tank levels must never be allowed to overflow or become empty. Thus the main emphasis of this paper will be on the design of control laws that explicitly account for process constraints, such as constrained Model Based Predictive Control (MPC). Simulation results comparing the various controller design techniques will be presented.",,"Model based predictive control (MPC); Multi-input multi-output (MIMO); Multivariable control; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Energy conservation; Optimization; Problem solving; Pulp; Screening; Control systems; Control Systems; Energy Conservation; Pulps; Screening",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944229158

It sets a new industry marker for the rapid development of a complete gas chain, and through its innovative LNG supply requisition has revolutionized LNG pricing in the Asia-Pacific trade. To meet the growing demand in Guangdong province, and to provide a timely alternative to the predominantly coal-fired power industry, the project was required to develop rapid and cost effective delivery of LNG. With power generation comprising approximately 60% of the initial gas demand, careful coordination with the developing IPPs was necessary. Effective engineering and commercial structures were needed to ensure a reliable facility capable of delivering competitively priced gas to both power and LDC customers. With this objective, the Guangdong LNG Joint Executive Office was established in 2001, and separate competitive processes were undertaken to solicit a foreign partner to provide technical expertise and investment in the terminal, as well as for the supply of LNG.

Since BOG are low temperature, stainless steel materials are used for the suction and discharge valve plates in the reciprocating compressors, but since there is wear due to the contact between the valve plate and valve seat, valve plates must be replaced periodically, and inspection for the valve and adjustments are necessary. Since durability has been improved in recent years, resins have come into use for suction and discharge valve plates in reciprocating compressors in normal temperature ranges, but they have not been used at all in low temperature ranges because of the brittleness of resins. In this instance resin materials with cryogenic properties have been selected, the valve structure improved to alleviate impact forces, and suction and discharge valves made of resin valve plates at low temperatures developed for the first time. Therefore, valve plates with durability approximately twice that of conventional stainless steel valve plates have been realized. The resin valve plates have the following effects compared with conventional stainless steel valve; inspection and maintenance cost reduction: approximately 30% with improvement in durability power required by compressors reduction: approximately 2.4% with improvement in sealing ability lowering operating noise: approximately 4% by avoiding metal contact (contact metal and resin).

The 300mm processing will increase emphasis on maximizing yields and minimizing scrap costs. Polyimide Film has many outstanding properties, such as low dielectric constant, a high thermal resistance, and high chemical resistance, so it was used as dielectric or passivation layer in IC device. Recently lithographic technique with the advantage of patternability leads the traditionally non-photo PI promoting into photo-sensative polyimide (PSPI). This paper describes using Photo-Sensitive Polyimide on 300mm wafer printing bump process and shows the results that spin-coating process, definition of curing degree and optical property of polyimide. The solder bump surface and bump shear are good due to properties of Photo-Sensitive polyimide, the polyimide surface is free from any damage because of good thermal ability and chemical resistance. Flip Chip used in laminate package like PBGA and CSP BGA to replace wire bonding as interconnection has become major trend in the assembly industry. But unlike well-known failure mode of wire bonding package, flip chip package with external solder ball as electrical interconnection present a extremely different failure mode with wire-bonding package from a point of view in process and material. In this study, one 16mmx16mm 3000 I/O SnPb wafer bumping using screen-printing process was explored including the effects of reflow times, high temperature storage life (HTSL) and temperature cycle test (TCT) on bump shear strength. Furthermore, the qualified wafer bumping is assembled by flip chip assembly with specific organic build-up substrate, then is subject to precondition and temperature cycle test to observe the effect on SnPb bump protection and solder joint life. Various failure modes in the flip chip package like solder and UBM and so on, will be scrutinized with SEM. And finally, best material combination will be addressed to make the flip chip package success.",,"Chemical resistance; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Heat resistance; Passivation; Permittivity; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Flip chip packages; High temperature storage life (HTSL); Photo-sensitive polyimide (PSPI); Temperature cycle test (TCT); Flip chip devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644220323

In the case of using fossil fuel, we compared 5 key factors among the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle (gasoline or diesel), battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Comparison factors are cruising range, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, waste heat rejection, air pollutants and noise. According to this comparison, hybrid, battery-powered and fuel cell electric vehicle have better potentials than ICE vehicles. In the case of utilizing renewable energy, EV will become the mainstream among various vehicles. In addition, FCEV will play an important role until that age. Moreover, we designed a high efficiency FCEV from the viewpoint of fuel effective utilization. This vehicle not only has fuel cell, but also various energy utilization and storage systems, for example, battery, flywheel and PV cell. This vehicle has excellent fuel economy more than 100km/liter. The proposed FCEV will be very promising to mitigate urban and global warming, and to conserve fossil fuel consumption.

Shortlisted competition entrants included Obermayer from Germany, Kurokawa from Japan and the Beijing Planning Bureau. The winning scheme blends traditional Chinese practices in sustainable farming, aquaculture and soil and water management evolved over four millennia; with 21st Century technologies; to create a city which is sustainable to a degree greater than most contemporary cities. At the same time, the new city design embodies urban design qualities rarely found in contemporary Chinese cities, and compliments a fine city building tradition which spans 4000 years. ESD components are woven throughout the fabric of the new city. The largest parks and waterbodies accommodate storm and wastewater treatment and storage for recycling, and sustainable energy generation from wind and wastes; the smaller urban canals and waterways provide drainage and water distribution into wetlands for cleaning. The ESD agenda for the new Ningbo will reduce externally supplied water and energy requirements by half that of a conventional city, while providing a physical environment equivalent to the most advanced contemporary cities.

The PARROT microarchitectural framework integrates trace caching, dynamic optimizations and pipeline decoupling. We employ a selective approach for applying complex mechanisms only upon the most frequently used traces to maximize the performance gain at any given power constraint, thus attaining finer control of tradeoffs between performance and power awareness. We show that the PARROT based microarchitecture can improve the performance of aggressively designed processors by providing the means to improve the utilization of their more elaborate resources. At the same time, rigorous selection of traces prior to storage and optimization provides the key to attenuating increases in the power budget. For resource-constrained designs, PARROT based architectures deliver better performance (up to an average 16% increase in IPC) at a comparable energy level, whereas the conventional path to a similar performance improvement consumes an average 70% more energy. Meanwhile, for those designs which can tolerate a higher power budget, PARROT gracefully scales up to use additional execution resources in a uniformly efficient manner. In particular, a PARROT-style doubly-wide machine delivers an average 45% IPC improvement while actually improving the cubic-MIPS-per-WATT power awareness metric by over 50%.",,"Bandwidth; Computational complexity; Energy utilization; Optimization; Reusability; Scheduling; Decoders; Microarchitectural techniques; Power density; Transistor density; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644222833

To meet the strict time-to-market requirements of systems containing these chips, compilers require retargetable alogrithms for effectively assigning values to the memory partitions. The EMBARC algorithm described in this paper is the first algorithm to attempt to realize a comprehensive, retargetable algorithm for effective partition assignment of variables in an arbitrary memory hierarchy. It supports a wide variety of memory models including on-chip SRAMs, multiple layers of caches, and even uncached DRAM partitions. Even though it is designed to handle such a range of memory hierarchies, EMBARC is capable of generating partition assignments of similar quality to algorithms designed for specific memory hierarchies. We use a large range of benchmarks and memory models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the EMBARC algorithm. We found that EMBARC can achieve 99% of the improvement of a dedicated algorithm for cacheless systems without SRAM. Also, for cacheless systems with SRAM, EMBARC generated the optimal partition assignment for benchmarks that were simple enough to hand-generate an optimal partition assignment. As further proof of EMBARC's generality, we also show how EMBARC can be used to generate partition assignments for a memory hierarchies with two on-chip caches that can be accessed in parallel.","Embedded Systems; Partition Assignment; Retargetable Compilers","Memory partition; on-chip caches; Partition Assignment; Retargetable Compilers; Algorithms; C (programming language); Embedded systems; Java programming language; Mathematical models; Static random access storage; Storage allocation (computer); Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544376705

Large scale scientific applications like climate modeling and high energy physics generate huge amounts of data that needs to be replicated across long distances for collaboration purposes. In addition, businesses need to copy critical data to remote sites for disaster recovery. The performance of these kinds of applications depends on the latency of the link due to the physical distance between the sites. The model presented in this paper uses the most prominent characteristics of remote data transfer applications and simplifies the performance prediction. This study shows that the overall throughput is mostly determined by the latency of the link, bandwidth of the link, number of round trips required for each I/O operation, and the number of simultaneously active I/O operations (asynchronous window size). Through laboratory and field experiments, we show that the model is capable of approximating the performance of remote data transfers within a very small error range.",,"Data backup; Data migration; Disaster recovery; Distributed caching; Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Data acquisition; Data storage equipment; Metropolitan area networks; Network protocols; Wide area networks; Data transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544376257

Polymer/carbon nanotube composites are processed into films, fibers, and bulk composites with significant mechanical and physical property enhancements. Single wall carbon nanotubes have high specific surface area, which can be further increased in activated carbon/single wall carbon nanotube composites. Such composite systems are promising candidates for supercapacitor applications. While single wall carbon nanotubes offer outstanding opportunities in materials development, many of the predicted properties can be achieved only if the nanotubes are well dispersed, exfoliated, and oriented in the polymer systems of interest.

To take advantage of these trends and opportunities, research communities are creating new architectures, such as the Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA), which are being implemented in new prototype advanced infrastructures. The DWDM-RAM project, funded by DARPA, is actively addressing the challenges of next generation applications. DWDM-RAM is an architecture for data-intensive services enabled by next generation dynamic optical networks. It develops and demonstrates a novel architecture for new data communication services, within the OGSA context, that allows for managing extremely large sets of distributed data. Novel features move network services beyond notions of the network as a managed resource, for example, by including capabilities for dynamic on-demand provisioning and advance scheduling. DWDM-RAM encapsulates optical network resources (Lambdas, lightpaths) into a Grid Service and integrates their management within the Open Grid Service Architecture. Migration to emerging standards such as WS-Resource Framework (WS-RF) should be staright forward. In initial applications, DWDM-RAM targets specific data-intensive services such as rapid, massive data transfers used by large scale eScience applications, including: high-energy physics, geophysics, life science, bioinformatics, genomics, medical morphometry, tomography, microscopy imaging, astronomical and astrophysical imaging, complex modeling, and visualization.","10Gbs Lambda-switched networks; Data-intensive applications; DWDM; Dynamic wavelength provisioning; eScience; ODIN; OGSA; OGSI; Optical network resources; Scheduled Grid services","10 Gbs Lambda-switched networks; Data-intensive applications; Dynamic wavelength provisioning; eScience; ODIN; OGSA; OGSI; Optical network resources; Scheduled grid services; Distributed computer systems; Fiber optic networks; Random access storage; Scheduling; Software engineering; Software prototyping; Standards; Switching networks; Dense wavelength division multiplexing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544259867

We propose two new interfaces that pierce the abstraction barrier that inhibits device power management. First, an OS power manager allows applications to query the current power mode of I/O devices to evaluate the performance and energy cost of alternative strategies for reading and writing data. Second, we allow applications to disclose ghost hints that enable better power management in the presence of multiple devices. Adaptive applications issue ghost hints to device power managers when they are forced to use a poor I/O path because a device is not in an ideal power mode; such hints allow devices to implement proactive power management strategies that do not depend upon passive load observation. Using these new interfaces, we implement a middleware layer that supports adaptive disk cache management. On an iPAQ handheld running Linux, our cache manager reduces interactive response time for a Web browser by 27% and decreases total energy usage by 9%.

Access efficiency and energy conservation are two critical performance concerns in a wireless data broadcast environment. To improve the efficiency of energy consumption on mobile devices, traditional disk-based indexing techniques such as B +-tree have been extended to index broadcast data on a wireless channel. However, existing designs are mostly based on centralized tree structures. Most of these indexing techniques are not flexible in the sense that the trade-off between access efficiency and energy conservation is not adjustable based on application specific requirements. We propose in this paper a novel parameterized index, called the exponential index, which can be tuned to optimize the access latency with the tuning time bounded by a given limit, and vice versa. The proposed index is very efficient because it facilitates replication naturally by sharing links in multiple search trees and thus minimizes storage overhead. Experimental results show that the exponential index not only achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art indexes but also enables great flexibility in trade-offs between access latency and tuning time.","Data broadcast; Energy conservation; Index structure; Mobile computing","Data broadcast; Index structure; Multiple search trees; Parameterized distributed indexing; Broadcasting; Data acquisition; Energy conservation; Indexing (of information); Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Tuning; Mobile computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544301484

In addition, we allow sensors to control the amount of buffered packets since storage space is limited. To achieve this, a two-radio architecture is used which allows a sensor to ""wakeup"" a neighbor with a busy tone and send its packets for that destination. However, this process is expensive because all neighbors must awake and listen to the primary channel to determine who is the intended destination. Therefore, triggered wakeups on the primary channel are proposed to avoid using the more costly wakeup procedure. We present a protocol for efficiently determining how large the period for these wakeups should be such that energy consumption is minimized.",,"Energy costs; Hardware complexity; Sensor networks; Wakeup signals; Code division multiple access; Communication channels (information theory); Computer science; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Estimation; Packet networks; Radio; Signal interference; Synchronization; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544271118

The execution units of the coprocessor are clustered and embedded in a rich set of communication resources. Fine grain control of these resources is imposed by a wide-word horizontal micro-code program. The advantages of this approach are quantified on a suite of six algorithms that are taken from both traditional DSP applications and from the new 3G cellular telephony domain.

As in many sensor or wireless systems, nodes have critical resource constraints such as processing speed, memory size, and energy supply; they also face special hardware issues such as sensing device sample time, data storage/access restrictions, and wireless transceiver capabilities. This paper discusses and evaluates ZebraNet's system design decisions in the face of a range of real-world constraints. Impala - ZebraNet's middleware layer - serves as a light-weight operating system, but also has been designed to encourage application modularity, simplicity, adaptivity, and repairability. Impala is now implemented on ZebraNet hardware nodes, which include a 16-bit microcontroller, a low-power GPS unit, a 900MHz radio, and 4Mbits of non-volatile FLASH memory. This paper discusses Impala's operation scheduling and event handling model, and explains how system constraints and goals led to the interface designs we chose between the application, middleware, and firmware layers. We also describe Impala's network interface which unifies media access control and transport control into an efficient network protocol. With the minimum overhead in communication, buffering, and processing, it supports a range of message models, all inspired by and tailored to ZebraNet's application needs.

Portable battery-powered applications, fuelled by pervasive and embedded computing, have seen tremendous growth and have reached a point where battery energy and power density can't be increased further. This raises the computational throughput per watt target for the future technology nodes.

Also new transitional turbulence models will be proposed with emphasis on hybrid techniques that use the k - ε model at an appropriate distance away from the wall and suitable models, with wall functions, near wall regions. A major proportion of heat emitted from electronic packages can be extracted by air cooling. This flow of air throughout an electronic system and the heat extracted is highly dependent on the nature of turbulence present in the flow. The use of CFD for such investigations is fast becoming a powerful and almost essential tool for the design, development and optimization of engineering applications. However turbulence models remain a key issue when tackling such flow phenomena. The reliability of CFD analysis depends heavily on the turbulence model employed together with the wall functions implemented. In order to resolve the abrupt fluctuations experienced by the turbulent energy and other parameters located at near wall regions and shear layers a particularly fine computational mesh is necessary which inevitably increases the computer storage and run-time requirements. The PHYSICA Finite Volume code was used for this investigation. With the exception of the k - ε and k-ω models which are available as standard within PHYSICA, all other turbulence models mentioned were implemented via the source code by the authors.

A typical goal of a manual designer is to combine a large number of atomic instructions into an ISE satisfying microarchitectural constraints. However, memory operations pose a challenge for previous ISE approaches by limiting the size of the resulting instruction. In this paper, we introduce memory elements into custom units which result in ISEs closer to those sought after by the designers. We consider two kinds of memory elements for mapping to the specialized hardware: small hardware tables and architecturally-visible state registers. We devised a genetic algorithm to specifically exploit opportunities of introducing memory elements during ISE generation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by a detailed study of the variation in performance, area and energy in the presence of the generated ISEs, on a number of MediaBench, EEMBC and cryptographic applications. With the introduction of memory, the average speedup varied from 2.7X to 5X depending on the architectural configuration with a nominal area overhead. Moreover, we obtained an average energy reduction of 26% with respect to a 32-KB cache.","Ad-hoc Functional Units; ASIPs; Coprocessors; Customizable processors; Genetic Algorithm; Instruction Set Extensions","Ad-hoc functional units; ASIP; Coprocessors; Customizable processors; Instruction set extensions; Benchmarking; Buffer storage; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Decoding; Genetic algorithms; Reduced instruction set computing; Standards; Program processors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444275354

To date, the most detailed theoretical treatments of reversal as a field-induced but noise-activated process have focused on the case of a very long ferromagnetic nanowire, i.e., a highly elongated cylindrical particle, and have yielded a reversal rate per unit length, due to an underlying assumption that the nucleus may form anywhere along the wire. But in a bounded-length (though long) cylindrical particle with flat ends, it is energetically favored for nucleation to begin at either end. We indicate how to compute analytically the energy of the critical nucleus associated with either end, i.e., the activation barrier to magnetization reversal, which governs the reversal rate in the low-temperature (Kramers) limit. Our treatment employs elliptic functions, and is partly analytic rather than numerical. We also comment on the Kramers prefactor, which for this reversal pathway does not scale linearly as the particle length increases, and tends to a constant in the low-temperature limit.","Activation barrier; Ferromagnetic cylinder; Ferromagnetic nanowire; Kramers prefactor; Kramers theory; Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation; Magnetization reversal; Néel-Brown theory; Weak spatiotemporal noise","Activation barriers; Ferromagnetic cylinders; Kramers prefactor; Kramers theory; Landau-lifshitz-Gilbert equation; Magnetization reversal; Weak spatiotemporal noise; Anisotropy; Crystal lattices; Data storage equipment; Ferromagnetic materials; Magnetization; Mathematical models; Nucleation; Partial differential equations; Spurious signal noise; Statistical mechanics; Nanotechnology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444288622

To increase error correction capability of RS-PC, we need to repeat Reed-Solomon (RS) decoding several times for rows and columns. As the number of RS decodings increases, the execution time and the energy consumption also increase as well. In order to reduce unnecessary operations and memory accesses, we added two small memories to store data on whether the row or column is updated or not. In the next iteration, only the updated rows and columns are recalculated instead of the whole rows and columns. Based on the proposed scheme, we implemented a RS-PC decoder using UMC 0.25μm standard and memory cells. The working frequency is 133MHz at 2.5V.

We first demonstrate software prefetching provides an average 36% performance boost with 8% more energy consumption and 69% higher power on six memory-intensive benchmarks. However, when we combine prefetching with a (unrealistic) static voltage scaling technique, the performance gain afforded by prefetching can be traded off for savings in power/energy consumption. In particular, we observe a 48% energy saving when we slow down the system with prefetching so as to match the performance of the system without prefetching. This suggests a promising approach to build low power systems by transforming traditional performance-enhancement techniques into low power methods. We thus propose a real time dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) algorithm that monitors a system's performance and adapts the voltage level accordingly while maintaining the observed system performance.

However, it is shown here that in contrast to sequential logic the clock gating scheme has significant impact on the power dissipation of register files due to signal changes of the data input port.

These NESHAPs regulate air pollutant emissions from nearly all equipment at the facility including valves, flanges, storage tanks, storage bins, conveying systems, mills, kilns, etc. The facility is required to demonstrate continual compliance with these requirements through extensive recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting that is often unique to each individual piece of equipment and that cannot efficiently be achieved through historically used methods of notebook and pencil. Consequently, the facility was forced to develop an overall program for ensuring that all information would be generated, collected, processed, stored, and, if necessary, be made available for reporting. An overriding goal of the program development was to utilize existing systems whenever possible and practical. Consequently, all existing data collection and management systems in place at the facility were reviewed, including plant maintenance systems, plant operating systems, control systems, accounting systems, etc. to determine if the systems already possessed required information, or if they could be utilized to collect the information. Where gaps in information collection were identified, systems were modified or developed such that all information necessary could be collected and processed in an efficient manner.

The study, authored by Energy and Environmental Analysis, predicts hefty energy bills for residential and industrial gas customers if construction delays spurred by local opposition or bureaucratic red tape continue plaguing industry efforts. The INGAA report finds that a 2-yr delay in natural gas infrastructure construction will cost US gas consumers > $200 billion (in constant $2003) by 2020. INGAA anticipates that annual US natural gas consumption will rise to 30 tcf by the end of the next decade from the current 23 tcf level if gas supplies are developed.

Recently proposed concept of low energy electron-beam proximity-projection lithography (LEEPL)1,2 technology has already released its first production machine in 2003, which is being expected to cover the design rule down to 65nm-node and even smaller 3. Although production of semiconductor device has been pursuing optical lithography, without any optical technology that is proved as a convincing solution for 65nm node and below, we need to take account of all the candidates. So we made an investigation on LEEPL technology and evaluated beta and first production tool to see the feasibility of printing sub-70nm resolution and of optic-first mix-and-match overlay from a chip maker' s point of view. Two different kinds of stencil masks were fabricated for the evaluation, which are fabricated in SiC and Si membrane. The former mask is for sparse contact holes(C/H) and the latter for dense C/Hs. Beta-tool showed a good resolving power of sub-70nm sparse C/Hs of SRAM with negligibly small proximity effect. It implies that LEEPL does not require much effort for proximity correction comparing to that required in optical lithography, which is one of the biggest issues in low-k1. LEEPL also showed a good capability of optic-first mix-and-match overlay correction and this is the most stringent and important functionality for optic-first mix-and-match application. However random intra-membrane image placement(IP) error that is a little bit larger than the requirement for sub-70nm node was observed, which is interpreted to come from the larger stress of 100MPa in 3×3mm2 dry-etched SiC unit membrane. For dense C/Hs, we failed, to the contrary, to obtain any good quality of stencil masks for DRAM cell patterns because of e-beam proximity effect which is unavoidable in the reversed order of front-side forward direct writing and back-side later membrane formation. Pros and cons of LEEPL technology are discussed based on the evaluation results and estimation from the memory device standpoint. We also propose a novel concept of stencil mask that can be helpful in memory device application.","Electron-beam; IP error; LEEPL; Low-k1; Mix-and-match; Overlay; Proximity-projection; Resolution","Data storage equipment; Electron beams; Error analysis; Image processing; Masks; Membranes; Optical resolving power; Photolithography; Risk assessment; Scanning; Silicon; Silicon carbide; IP error; LEEPL; Low-k1; Mix-and-match; Overlay; Proximity-projection; Electron beam lithography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843072122

A stable VUV cleaning procedure for contaminated binary, alternating, and attenuated phase shift reticles has been developed. This cleaning procedure was verified by lithographic imaging on the 157nm ASML MS-VII exposure scanner. A point-to-point steady state dose transmission uniformity range across a batch of 25 wafers (the exposure conditions of which were equivalent to that of a 300 mm wafer, 26mm×33mm fields, 50mJ/cm 2) that were exposed with a modified fused silica substrate, was found to be &lt;0.24% for a reticle that was cleaned prior to exposure using this VUV cleaning process. In-situ laser cleaning of contaminated mask substrates during exposure in the MS-VII resulted in 1% change in transmission at doses of up to 20 J/cm 2, above which transmission remains stable (&lt;0.24% variation). The cleaning procedure involves exposing the contaminated reticle in the UVO Reticle Cleaning Station for 30 minutes, using a cleaning gas mixture of N2/O2=99%/1%. Transmission loss due to contamination within the clean room is limited to 1 -2 % and is reversible upon VUV cleaning. Flare levels of 3% were measured on contaminated reticle relative to a clean state of the same reticle. VUV cleaning is not only good for improving and maintaining stable mask transmission, but it is also good for preventing reticle contamination-induced flare. Contamination rate and contaminant type appear to be dependent on the storage environment of mask substrates and reticles. Typical contaminants included molecular acids (halogens, sulfur, sulfates), molecular bases (ammonia, amines), molecular condensables (hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, fatty acids, siloxanes, phthalate), molecular dopant (boron) and molecular metals (Ca, Mg, Al, Cu). Contamination of mask substrates appears to be through a competitive adsorption phenomenon, whereby low molecular weight species with high vapor pressure and low adsorption energies are over time replaced by large molecular weight ones with low vapor pressure and high adsorption energies.",,"Attenuation; Chemical cleaning; Contamination; Fused silica; Imaging techniques; Light absorption; Light transmission; Lithography; Molecular weight; Phase shift; Ultraviolet radiation; Lithographic imaging; Mask substrates; Reticle cleaning sattions (RCS); Transmission losses; Optical materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843069722

We show that by illuminating Br-tetra-ethyl-porphyrin (Br-TEP) with 150-fs pulses in the near-IR wavelength range the molecule can be switched between two tautomer forms with distinct spectral absorption- and fluorescence signatures in a fully reversible manner. The 2PA cross section in the illumination wavelength range 775-810 nm is measured and the figure of merit, F= φ×σ2 ∼ 5×10-53 cm4 photon-1 s-1 is estimated for one of the tautomer forms of Br-TEP. Enhanced selectivity of 2PA-induced switching in the near-IR, with respect to one-photon excitation at the same transition energy is observed. We propose to overcome the limitation imposed by the small value of the 2PA cross section by introducing a new class of tetrapyrrolic molecules with greatly enhanced two-photon absorption efficiency. In this paper we present for the first time the structure and absorption properties of asymmetrical chlorin molecules with an attached 2PA-enhancing side group.

The range of light intensities must match the dynamic range of the holographic storage medium and of the full HDS system. Descriptions, mathematical models, and tests of a variety of phase mask types have been reported in the literature: pixelated phase masks, non-pixelated phase masks, and axicons. Lacking, however, has been a systematic way of comparing the relative merits of phase mask types in order to make sound choices. To address this problem, performance criteria are proposed for both the Fourier plane and for the output image plane (e.g. the margin by which 1's can be distinguished from 0's). The criteria are useful both for comparisons and for design optimization. A new numerical model has been developed enabling quantitative comparisons to be made between the predicted performance of the various phase mask types. The model reported here enables more extensive investigations than could be carried out with previously reported models, including investigation of systems in which multiple bits of data are encoded by each pixel using light intensity modulation. The viability of using non-pixelated phase masks integrated with spatial light modulators is also examined. The use of non-pixelated (continuous random) phase masks instead of the more common pixelated phase masks would eliminate the need for costly precision lateral alignment, and integration eliminates the need for precise positioning in an image plane. These advantages would enable smaller, cheaper, high performance HDS optical systems.","Holographic data storage; Phase mask; Spatial light modulator","Axicons; Holographic data storage; Optical energy; Phase mask; Data storage equipment; Design; Fast Fourier transforms; Holography; Image analysis; Light amplifiers; Mathematical models; Optimization; Sorting; Light modulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543124098

In the case of 800 or 980 nm irradiation by Ti:sapphire laser or laser diodes, on the other hand, the formation of such glass-ceramic occurs near the surface and/or inside of glass. The glass-ceramic parts can be easily read by upconversion luminescence under laser excitation. Therefore, the presently developed rare earth-doped oxyfluoride glass can be utilized as optical devices of the writing and reading memory, which can be utilized as specific devices for security information.","CO2 laser; Laser diode; Nanocrystal; Optical memory; Oxyfluoride glass; Rare-earth element; Upconversion luminescence","Carbon dioxide; Doping (additives); Glass ceramics; Luminescence; Nanostructured materials; Optical data storage; Rare earth elements; Semiconductor lasers; CO2 lasers; Nanocrystals; Optical memory; Oxyfluoride glass; Upconversion luminescence; Laser beam effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543077546

In this case a memory cell consists of only one device where the stored information is written as a gate insulator polarization by a gate voltage pulse and read by the channel conductance control with channel voltage pulse without destruction of the stored information. Therefore such transistor could be the base of non-volatile non-destructively readable computer memory of extremely high density. Also devices with polarizable gate dielectrics can function more effectively in certain circuits. The effective threshold voltage Vt can be brought very close to zero, for applications where the available gate voltage is limited. Resonant and adaptive circuits can be tuned insitu by polarizing the gates. Poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF and its copolymer with trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) are among the best known and most widely used ferroelectric polymers. In this manuscript, we report new results of an organic FET, fabricated with pentacene as the active material and P(VDF-TrFE) as the gate insulator. Application of a writing voltage of -50 V for short duration results in significant change in the threshold voltage and remarkable increase in the drain current. The memory effect is retained over a period of 20 hours.","Field effect transistor; Non-volatile memory; Organic semiconductor","Dielectric materials; Electric insulators; Energy gap; Nonvolatile storage; Resonant circuits; Semiconducting organic compounds; Substrates; Thin film transistors; Thin films; Threshold voltage; Ferroelectric memory; Gate insulator polarization; Nonvolatile transistor memory; Organic electronics; Field effect transistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543061146

More stringent future exhaust emission standards require a better fuel quality and more effective emission control means in motor vehicles. The importance of measures to reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in the optimization of vehicle and powertrain concepts is also steadily growing. Securing a long-term supply of energy sources for the auto industry requires not only that existing fuel resources be utilized as economically as possible, but also that the energy sources used in fuel production be diversified in the medium and long term, including alternative and renewable resources in particular. Synthetic fuels can play a major role in this context in allowing a wide range of usable primary energy. High-quality, environmentally friendly synthetic diesel fuel produced from natural gases via GTL process is, e.g., sulfur and aromatics-free. In the second phase even biomass in many different forms can be used as primary energy for fuel production via a Bio-GTL process. Producing synthetic gas out of biomass and combining it with the Fischer-Tropsch process will create a CO 2 neutral energy source that reduces CO 2 emissions on a well-to-wheel base. If the problem on mobile hydrogen storage and infrastructure will be solved, fuel cell will not only supplement the modern-day internal combustion engine, but will supersede it as a means of vehicular propulsion.

The size of wind turbines is also increasing - from less than 1 MW a few years ago to the 2- to 3-MW machines being installed today and the 5-MW machines under development. The interaction of the wind farm, energy storage, reactive power compensation, and the power system network is being investigated. Because the loads and the wind farms' output fluctuate during the day, the use of energy storage and reactive power compensation is ideal for the power system network. Energy storage and reactive power compensation can minimize real/reactive power unbalances that can affect the surrounding power system. In this paper, we will show how the contribution of wind farms affects the power distribution network and how the power distribution network, energy storage, and reactive power compensation interact when the wind changes.

The current production status, the selection criteria of individual slabs for specific beam line locations, and some recent technical advances are reviewed. The glass blanks are manufactured by a novel continuous glass melting process, and the finished slabs are then prepared by epoxy bonding a Cu-doped phosphate glass edge cladding and by advanced finishing techniques. To date, nearly 3400 slab equivalents have been melted, 2600 have been rough-cut to blanks, 1200 have been finished, and 144 have been installed in NIF. A set of selection rules, which are designed to optimize laser performance (e.g., maintain gain balance between beam lines and minimize beam walkoff) and to maximize glass lifetime with respect to Pt damage site growth, have been established for assigning individual slabs to specific beam line locations. Recent technical advances for amplifier slab production, which include: 1) minimizing surface pitting (hazing) after final finishing; 2) minimizing humidity-induced surface degradation (weathering) upon storage and use; and 3) preventing mounting-induced surface fractures upon installation, have contributed in improving the laser glass quality.","High peak-power laser; Indentation fracture; National Ignition Facility; Phosphate laser glass; Surface pitting; Weathering","High peak-power lasers; Indentation fracture; Laser glass; Amplifiers (electronic); Indentation; Installation; Laser beams; Optimization; Research laboratories; Semiconductor doping; Lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142671983

Cass County Electric Cooperative (CCEC) is a distribution cooperative member of MPC. In the mid 80's, MPC created a program whereby its member cooperatives could market electric heating energy without a demand charge in order to utilize excess energy production. As energy supplies have tightened up, this program was discontinued. The distribution cooperatives had to find a means to offset the electrical demand created by the heating loads which were added under this program and not included in the MPC load management program. In a joint effort, MPC and CCEC have worked to install ten diesel powered generation modules at the distribution level totaling 18.25 MW of peak electrical capacity. These units will be operated synchronously with the grid system during periods of peak electrical demand to offset the non-managed load created by the demand waiver heating program.

Each tank has the capacity to store 50,000 gallons of liquid and sludge waste.

However, a major concern for the implementation of multivalued systems is the computational burden associated with the fuzzy inference and defuzzification process.

The proposed implementation with singleton consequences greatly reduces the space required for data storage and speeds up the control computation while providing a simple way of fusing the behavioral commands. This paper also presents a genetic algorithm approach to improve the performance of the proposed fuzzy system with singleton consequences. The developed genetic fuzzy system obtains the optimal values of the singleton consequences for the heading control activity and speed control activity by minimizing the path length, the bending energy and navigation steps.

In addition to the automation requirement, robotics equipments in the nuclear industry must be substituted to human operators in order to respect the ALARA principle. More over, remote technologies aim to improve the working conditions, as well as the quality of the work achieved by the operators. A few years ago, COGEMA started an ambitious Research and Development program in robotics and remote technologies applied to its spent fuel management facilities in France, with the aim to cover the requirements of the different plant life cycle steps. This program has been carried out in collaboration with the French Atomic Energy Agency (C.E.A) in charge of R&D. The paper summarizes the important remote technology developments that have been carried out by C.E.A. and now being transferred to COGEMA industrial group. The range includes the next generation of servo-manipulators, long range inspection tools and carriers, nuclear versions of industrial robots, radiation hardened robotics systems, as well as force-feedback master-slave generic control software for teleoperation. Some applications of these new remote technologies are presented in the paper : - rad-hard electronic modules for robotic equipments which are used by COGEMA in high radiating environment, - electrical manipulators for remote teleoperation with force-feedback for maintenance applications, - a 6 axes master arm for teleoperation of master-slave systems with force-feedback - generic control and supervision software for remote teleoperated systems. The results of the robotics development program carried out by COGEMA and C.E.A have been very valuable for the introduction of these new technologies in the nuclear industry.

Plasma torch cutting is efficient, but there are many cases and situations where it is not appropriate. Sometimes the fire hazard cannot be tolerated; sometimes it is more of a contaminant dispersal issue. Circular saws, band saws, and reciprocating saws are often the necessary tool of choice. Sawing is a complex action that is difficult to execute with remote manipulation without extensive task-specific fixturing of the tool to minimize blade chatter and binding. Extensive fixturing leads to the requirement for multiple tools for each minor variation of the task. This drives up the cost of remote tooling for a given D&D large-scale task, generates clutter and tool storage issues, impacts tool reliability due to complexity, and increases the required spare parts.

The first sample grown in CH4H2 reaction gas was curly shaped nanotubes with blocked nanoholes and closed caps and the next sample grown in CR 4t/H2/O2 reaction gas had less defective structure with connected holes and open caps. The hydrogen storage properties of the carbon nanotubes with these closed and open structures were compared by thermal desorption technique. Though the MWNTs with blocked and closed structure had two different desorption ranges such as 290-330 and about 420 K and evolved about 0.64 and 0.03 wt% of hydrogen respectively, the MWNTs with open structure evolved about 1.94 wt% of hydrogen at ambient temperature. The hydrogen desorption activation energy was also calculated. The obtained hydrogen desorption activation energy of MWNTs with closed and open structure at ambient temperature was -18.5 kJ/mol H2 and -16.5 kJ/mol H2, respectively. The activation energy of high temperature hydrogen desorption in MWNTs with closed structure was -124.4 kJ/mol H2. The hydrogen desorbed between 290 and 330 K was the hydrogen physi-sorbed in nano-hole and the hydrogen desorbed at about 420 K was that chemi-sorbed in defects of nanotubes.","Adsorption; Hydrogen; Nanotube","Activation energy; Desorption; Gas chromatography; Heating; Hydrogen; Magnetron sputtering; Methane; Oxygen; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Synthesis (chemical); Thermal conductivity; Hydrogen storage; Interaction energy; Thermal desorption; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042821036

A range of 500 kilometers is projected for economic viability and this requires the storage of at least 4 kg of H 2. Hydrogen storage concepts being considered and evaluated include: 1) compressed H 2, 2) liquid H 2, 3) bulk storage in hydrides, 4) surface adsorption on carbon and boron nitride nanotubes and 5) generation by chemical reaction of a hydride with water. Compressed H 2 tanks with a capacity of about 2 kg of H 2 stored at 350 bar of pressure have been certified while tanks with higher capacity stored at 700 bar are being developed. Liquidified H 2 tanks can store more H 2 in a vehicle than compressed H 2 but liquifying H 2 requires considerable energy and boil-off of the liquid H 2 is a concern, especially in enclosed spaces. Storage of H 2 in bulk hydrides or on the surface of carbon or boron nitride nanotubes are attractive because of the low pressures involved. Recent studies have shown that NaAlH 4 can be reversibly charged and discharged with H 2 hundreds of times but the capacity of this hydride material is only about one-half of that needed. Storage of H 2 on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes has shown great promise but verification of the storage capacities has not occurred. However, carbon nanotubes have the potential to store about 80% of the desired quantity of H 2 so it remains a viable storage material. Generation of H 2 by chemical reaction of a hydride such as LiH with water to produce H 2 is also attractive because of the significant amounts of H 2 that can be generated by this process. The key issues for this process of generating H 2 is the need to reprocess the reaction products and the cost associated with transportation and reprocessing this product. There are several options for storing hydrogen on-board a vehicle but considerable development work is needed before the hydrogen economy can be realized.","Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuel; Hydrogen storage","Boron nitride nanotubes; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fueled vehicles; Hydrogen storage; Adsorption; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical reactions; Compaction; Cost benefit analysis; Hydrides; Transportation; Hydrogen fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042785504

However, high capacity storage is still to be developed. Many metals, alloys and intermetallic compounds are able to store hydrogen gas. Such possibility is of interest in terms of safety, global yield and long time storage. However, to be suitable for applications, such compounds must present high capacity, good reversibility, fast reactivity and sustainability. In this paper, we will review on the thermodynamic properties of metal hydrides. Their solid-gas hydrogenation behaviour and the related absorption-desorption isotherm curves are examined as a useful criterion for the selection of suitable materials for applications. The paper emphasizes the possibility to reach given properties by convenient chemical substitutions of the compounds.","Hydrogen storage; Intermetallic compounds; Metal hydrides","Absorption; Alloys; Desorption; Greenhouse effect; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Isotherms; Nanostructured materials; Storage (materials); Thermodynamic properties; Borohydrides; Energy carriers; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Intermetallics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042785500

The promise of superconductors is the generation, transmission, conversion and storage of energy with little or no loss. Significant progress has been made in the development of high temperature superconductors suitable for use at liquid nitrogen temperature. However, flux pinning and grain boundary ""weak link"" problems remain and better understanding and development of techniques to minimize the adverse effects are needed. The recently discovered superconductor, MgB2, while not a high temperature superconductor, has many attractive properties such as the absence of the ""weak link"" effect, low cost synthesis and operation at liquid hydrogen temperature. However, the synthesis of MgB2 is not trivial and several routes to its fabrication into wire form are being pursued. Many technical challenges in the development of these two classes of superconductors remain. Some of the challenges and opportunities in the development of these materials are discussed in this paper.","Flux pinning; High temperature superconductor; Hot deformation; MgB 2; Superconductivity","Cooling; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Magnesium compounds; Nitrogen; Superconductivity; Synthesis (chemical); Cooling technology; Energy-saving technology; Logic-electronics; Rotational energy; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042774420

To illustrating the latter point, we present an investigation of the properties of the hydrogen storage Ni-substituted LaNi5 intermetallic compounds. The effects of mono substitutions of Ni by 3d elements (Mn, Fe, Co), an s - p element of the 3d series, Cu, as well as by s-p elements of the IIIA (Al) and IVA series (Si, Ge, Sn) for several substitution rates are presented. We discuss the trends observed in the electronic structure and the factors that control : the stability of the intermetallic and their corresponding hydrides and the maximum hydrogen absorption capacity. We found that besides the elastic effects associated to volume changes on Ni substitutions, chemical bonding effects and band filling effects play a crucial role in controlling the storage properties of the materials. We also analyze the effect of polysubstitutions at the Ni site in LaNi3.5Al0.25Mn0.5Co0.75, a composition close to that of an industrial compound of good electrochemical performances, and we discuss the results in light of thermodynamic and spectroscopic data.","Electronic structure; Hydrides of intermetallic compounds; Hydrogen storage","Chemical bonds; Cobalt; Electronic structure; Energy storage; Iron; Manganese; Metal insulator transition; Nickel; Substitution reactions; Band filling; Electronic effects; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen content; Hydrogen",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042773260

The kinetic measurement showed that: (i) Dehydrogenation of Na 3AlH6 proceeds much slower than that of NaAlH4, when the former is observed as a second step of the two step consecutive dehydrogenation of Ti doped NaAlH4. (ii) But if Na 3AlH6 is doped directly with Ti, the dehydrogenation rate matches that of NaAlH4. (iii) The activation enthalpies of both Ti doped NaAlH4 and Na3AlH6 are 100 kJ·mol-1, and those of both Zr doped NaAlH4 and Na3AlH6 are 135 kJ·mol-1. These findings imply that the rate determinig step is not related to the cleavage of Al-H bonding, which must be sensitive to whether the species involved is [A1H 4]- or [AlH6]3-, but to a long range phenomenon, such as the diffusion of the atom in the particle. The TEM-EELS observation showed that the Ti element was distributed on the surface of the particle of doped material.","Alanates; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; TEM-EELS; TG-DTA; Ti catalyst; Zr catalyst","Dehydrogenation; Diffusion; Doping (additives); Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Titanium; Transmission electron microscopy; Zirconium; Alanates; Complex hydrides; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Kinetic measurement; Sodium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042773258

Experimental results will be presented which demonstrate that microsystem components produced by conventional electrodeposition approaches show relatively low overall hardness and considerable variations of Young's modulus and hardness throughout their cross section. These undesirable properties are traced back to i) the microstructure of the deposits which is characterized by grain size gradients resulting from the fine grained to columnar structure transition and ii) the relatively large grain size in comparison to the overall component size. In past efforts both post deposition recrystallization annealing and texture control during the electroplating process have been used in attempts to alleviate these concerns, however only with limited success. In this paper, we present a new approach which essentially involves the modification of the electrodeposition process to produce fully dense nanostructured deposits throughout the entire cross section of the component without transition from fine to large grained columnar structure. Results will be presented for such components which show i) uniform hardness and Young's modulus in cross section and ii) significant enhancements in hardness and other important performance indicators such as specific strength and elastic energy storage capacity.","Hardness; LIGA; MEMS; Nanostructured Ni; Young's modulus","Density (specific gravity); Elastic moduli; Electrodeposition; Energy storage; Hardness; Metallographic microstructure; Reliability; Elastic energy storage; Multifunctional capabilities; Specific strength; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042738255

In particular, memory energy consumption of array-intensive applications can be overwhelming due to poor cache locality. One option for reducing memory energy is to adopt a banked memory architecture, where memory space is divided into banks and each bank can be powered down if it is not in active use. An important issue here is the bank access pattern, which determines opportunities for saving energy. In this paper, we present a compiler-based data layout transformation strategy for increasing the effectiveness of a banked memory architecture. The idea is to transform the array layouts in memory in such a way that two loop iterations executed one after another access the data.in the same bank as much as possible; the remaining banks can be placed into a low-power mode.

The input to our algorithm is an application given as an annotated task graph and a specification of a multi-layer memory architecture. The algorithm produces Pareto trade-off points representing different multi-objective execution options for the whole application. Different metrics are used to estimate parameters for application-level Pareto points obtained by merging all Pareto diagrams of the tasks composing the application. We estimate application execution time although the final scheduling is not yet known. The algorithm makes it possible to trade off the quality of the results and its runtime depending on the used metrics and the number of levels in the hierarchical composition of the tasks' Pareto points. We have evaluated our algorithm on a medical image processing application and randomly generated task graphs. We have shown that our algorithm can explore huge design space and obtain (near) optimal results in terms of Pareto diagram quality.",,"Data access methods; Multilayer memory architecture; Random task graphs; Application execution; Design space exploration; Exploration algorithms; Hierarchical composition; Image processing applications; Multi objective; Multi-layer memory architectures; Optimal results; Algorithms; Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Graph theory; Hierarchical systems; Image processing; Logic design; Medical imaging; Program processors; Design; Economic and social effects; Exhibitions; Pareto principle; Data storage equipment; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042656853

We propose to reduce the static energy dissipation of an on-chip data cache by taking advantage of the frequent values (FV) that widely exist in a data cache memory. The original FV-based low-power cache design aimed at only reducing dynamic power, at the cost of a 5% slowdown. We propose a better design that reduces both static and dynamic cache power, and that uses a circuit design that eliminates performance overhead. A designer can utilize our architecture by simulating an application and then synthesizing the FVs into an application-specific FV cache design when values will not change, or by simulating and then writing to an FV-cache with configuration registers when values could change. Furthermore, we describe hardware that can dynamically determine FVs and write to the configuration registers completely transparently.

In this paper we present an automated approach for analyzing these opportunities in a program that allows modification of the program to use custom scratch pad memory configurations comprising a hierarchical set of buffers for local storage of frequently reused data.

Such locality occurs when a code segment, although executed repeatedly in the program, takes only a small number of different values as input and, naturally, generates a small number of different outputs. It is potentially beneficial to replace such a code segment by a table which records the computation results for the previous inputs. When the program execution re-enters the code segment with a repeated input, its computation can be simplified to a table look-up. In this paper, we discuss a compiler scheme to identify code segments which are good candidates for computation reuse. We discuss the conditions under which the table look-up costs less than repeating the execution, and we perform profiling to identify candidates which have many repeated inputs at run time. Compared to previous work, this scheme requires no special hardware support and is therefore particularly useful for resource constrained systems such as handheld computing devices. We implement our scheme and its supporting analyses in GCC. We experiment with several multimedia benchmarks and the GNU Go game by executing them on a handheld computing device. The results show the scheme to improve the performance and to reduce the energy consumption quite substantially for these programs.",,"Code segments; Compiler schemes; Memory location; Run time; Computational methods; Energy utilization; Game theory; Information analysis; Storage allocation (computer); Table lookup; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042606562

We investigated the possible causes of this discrepancy, including the accuracy of the neutron flux, the high flux effect, the incident neutron angle dependence, the temperature dependence, and the time variation of the cosmic rays, etc. As a result, we concluded that the discrepancy originates from the value assumed for the neutron flux at sea level. We normalized our ASER results to the SSER of 0.18 μm SRAMs so as not to use the neutron flux at sea level.

Adding a victim buffer to the memory hierarchy is known to reduce energy and improve performance on average, yet victim buffers are not typically found in commercial embedded processors. One problem with such buffers is, while they work well on average, they tend to hurt performance for many applications. We show that a victim buffer can be very effective if it is considered as a parameter in designing a memory hierarchy, like the traditional cache parameters of total size, associativity, and line size. We describe experiments on PowerStone and MediaBench benchmarks, showing that having the option of adding a victim buffer to a direct-mapped cache can reduce memory-access energy by a factor of 3 in some cases. Furthermore, even when other cache parameters are configurable, we show that a victim buffer can still reduce energy by 43%. By treating the victim buffer as a parameter, meaning the buffer can be included or excluded, we can avoid performance overhead of up to 4% on some examples.

Nevertheless, power hungry wireless network interface cards (WNIC) may limit the battery lifetime and application performance if not efficiently exploited. In this work we explore performance and energy of network swapping in comparison with swapping on local micro-drives and flash memories. Our study points out that remote swapping over power-manageable WNICs can be more efficient than local swapping and that both energy and performance can be optimized through power-aware reshaping of data requests.

The key idea is to make use of runtime information about the external memory access statistics in order to perform CPU voltage and frequency scaling with the goal of minimizing the energy consumption while translucently controlling the performance penalty. The proposed DVFS technique relies on dynamically-constructed regression models that allow the CPU to calculate the expected workload and slack time for the next time slot, and thus, adjust its voltage and frequency in order to save energy while meeting soft timing constraints. This is in turn achieved by estimating and exploiting the ratio of the total off-chip access time to the total on-chip computation time. The proposed technique has been implemented on an XScale-based embedded system platform and actual energy savings have been calculated by current measurements in hardware. For memory-bound programs, a CPU energy saving of more than 70% with a performance degradation of 12% was achieved.

In this paper, this 'power of two' assumption has been used to drastically simplify the tile-based address mapping functions. Once optimized, the implementation of the non-linear tile-based mapping consumes 60% less power than the implementation of the linear row-major mapping. This result is very interesting because one would normally expect a power penalty in the address generation stage of the more sophisticated tile-based mapping.

We present an automated method for tuning two-level caches to embedded applications for reduced energy consumption. The method is applicable to both a simulation-based exploration environment and a hardware-based system prototyping environment. We introduce the two-level cache tuner, or TCaT - a heuristic for searching the huge solution space of possible configurations. The heuristic interlaces the exploration of the two cache levels and searches the various cache parameters in a specific order based on their impact on energy. We show the integrity of our heuristic across multiple memory configurations and even in the presence of hardware/software partitioning - a common optimization capable of achieving significant speedups and/or reduced energy consumption. We apply our exploration heuristic to a large set of embedded applications. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our heuristic: on average the heuristic examines only 7% of the possible cache configurations, but results in cache sub-system energy savings of 53%, only 1% more than the optimal cache configuration. In addition, the configured cache achieves an average speedup of 30% over the base cache configuration due to tuning of cache line size to the application's needs.","Architecture tuning; Cache exploration; Cache hierarchy; Cache optimization; Configurable cache; Embedded systems; Low energy; Low power","Cache exploration; Cache hierarchy; Configurable cache; Architecture tuning; Cache hierarchies; Cache optimization; low energy; Low Power; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Computer software; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Microprocessor chips; Optimization; Tuning; Automation; Cache memory; Energy utilization; Exhibitions; Hardware; Buffer storage; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042558290

Customizing a microprocessor cache's total size, line size and associativity to a particular program is well known to have tremendous benefits for performance and power. Customizing caches has until recently been restricted to core-based flows, in which a new chip will be fabricated. However, several configurable cache architectures have been proposed recently for use in pre-fabricated microprocessor platforms. Tuning those caches to a program is still however a cumbersome task left for designers, assisted in part by recent computer-aided design (CAD) tuning aids. We propose to move that CAD on-chip, which can greatly increase the acceptance of configurable caches. We introduce on-chip hardware implementing an efficient cache tuning heuristic that can automatically, transparently, and dynamically tune the cache to an executing program. We carefully designed the heuristic to avoid any cache flushing, since flushing is power and performance costly. By simulating numerous Powerstone and MediaBench benchmarks, we show that such a dynamic self-tuning cache can reduce memory-access energy by 45% to 55% on average, and as much as 97%, compared with a four-way set-associative base cache, completely transparently to the programmer.","Architecture tuning; Cache; Configurable; Dynamic optimization; Embedded systems; Low energy; Low power; On-chip CAD","Architecture tuning; Dynamic optimization; On chip computer aided design (CAD); Cache; Configurable; low energy; Low Power; On chips; Application specific integrated circuits; Benchmarking; Bit error rate; Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Data transfer; Embedded systems; Fabrication; Microprocessor chips; Exhibitions; Heuristic programming; Buffer storage; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042522990

In a way of root cause analysis to elucidate the degradation mechanism, atomic force microscope (AFM), SEM-EDX (energy disperse X-ray) and Auger electron spectrometry (AES) are used. It is found that the bonding strength of the wire pull and ball shear decreases with increasing depth profile of preexisting contamination layer and surface roughness. The plasma cleaning on the Al pad prior to an epoxy molding, however, enhances initial wire pull and ball shear strength. We firstly report the appearance of Sb on Auger spectrum from the fractured surface of Au-Al bonding. In the case of alloy-Al bonding, Pd retards the growth of intermetallics. The life time of Au-Al ball encapsulated with BP resin is much longer than that of OCN under the HST conditioned at 150 and 170°C. It is also found that lessening in the wire pull and ball shear strength is correlated to the interfacial degradation coupled with the material of wire and EMC.",,"Adhesion; Aluminum alloys; Atomic force microscopy; Bonding; Electric industry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Epoxy resins; Gold alloys; Integrated circuits; Oxidation; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Silicon wafers; Epoxy molding compounds (EMC); High temperature storage (HTS); Interfacial degradation; Electronics packaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20244372812

Nodes in a sensor network are severely constrained by energy, storage capacity and computing power. To prolong the lifetime of the sensor nodes, designing efficient routing protocols is critical. Even though sensor networks are primarily designed for monitoring and reporting events, since they are application dependent, a single routing protocol cannot be efficient for sensor networks across all applications. In this paper, we first analyze the requirements and similarities of MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) and sensor networks. Then, we describe the existing routing protocols for sensor networks and present a critical analysis of these protocols. Finally, we compare and contrast these protocols.

But all energy-based arguments for more than 200GW of hydro after 2020 look increasingly flimsy. Additional capacity after this date would therefore be driven by storage needs to support urban and rural water supply. But as these demands will by then be largely met by current projects there would appear to be little need for additional large-scale water storage after 2020.

Although several sizes and types of tanks exist, a typical vehicular storage tank has a volume of ∼400 liters (∼100 gallons). The pressure in the ullage space of a tank freshly filled is usually ∼0.25 MPa but may vary during use from ∼0.25 MPa (∼20 psig) to ∼0.92 MPa (∼120 psig). Cryogenic vehicular tanks are typically dual-walled, stainless steel vessels with vacuum and superinsulation isolation between the inner and outer vessel walls. The heat leaks into such tanks are measured as a percentage boil-off per day. For a storage tank of vehicular size range, the boil-off may be ∼ 1 % day, depending upon the cryogen and the quality of the tank. The corresponding heat leak into the cryogenic liquid vaporizes a certain amount of liquid that in turn increases the pressure in the tank which in turn significantly influences the properties of the cryogens. We have used a novel approach to calculate the increase in pressure of LNG and LH2 in a closed cryogenic vessel with a fixed heat leak as a function of time using real equations of state for the properties of the cryogens.

The ZBO concept involves the use of a cryocooler/radiator system to balance storage system incoming and extracted energy such that zero boiloff (no venting) occurs. A large-scale demonstration of the ZBO concept was conducted using the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) along with a commercial cryocooler unit. The liquid hydrogen (LH2) was withdrawn from the tank, passed through the cryocooler heat exchanger, and then the chilled liquid was sprayed back into the tank through a spray bar. The spray bar recirculation system was designed to provide destratification independent of ullage and liquid positions in a zero-gravity environment. The insulated MHTB tank, combined with the vacuum chamber conditions, enabled orbital storage simulation. ZBO was demonstrated for fill levels of 95%, 50%, and 25%. At each fill level, a steady-state boiloff test was performed prior to operating the cryocooler to establish the baseline heat leak.

Data aggregation is affected by several factors such as the placement of aggregation points, the aggregation function, and the density of the sensors in the network. The determination of an optimal selection of aggregation point is thus extremely important. We present an exact as well as approximate algorithms to find the minimum number of aggregation points in order to maximize the network lifetime.

The steam-based thermal processes are energy intensive and hence, high carbon dioxide (CO 2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), emissions. There are potentials for the reduction of CO 2 emissions by capturing and disposal of CO 2 for pressure maintenance during the later stage of these thermal operations. This paper describes the numerical investigation on the feasibility of using CO 2 for pressure maintenance during a steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) wind-down process in an Athabasca bitumen reservoir in Northern Alberta, Canada. It is found that SAGD wind-down process with CO 2 injection is feasible although oil recovery performance is slightly sacrificed. The oil recovery performance during the wind-down period with pure CO 2 injection is slightly better than those with other gas injections such as flue gas (i.e., a mixture of nitrogen (N 2) and CO 2) and pure N 2 mainly because CO 2 acts as a solvent in reduction of the bitumen viscosity. From a GHG storage point of view, CO 2 storage capacity of approximately 2 × 10 7 sm 3 (or 37,244 tonne) in a single Athabasca-type SAGD pattern with dimensions of 100 m wide, 500 m long and 25 m thick can be achieved. CO 2 balance indicates that CO 2 stored during SAGD wind-down processes is less than the CO 2 emitted from steam generation during the initial SAGD period. However, ""CO 2 credit"" in the order of 10,000 tonne can still be claimed in a single SAGD pattern because using CO 2 as steam substitute during the wind-down process results in less CO 2 emission compared to continuously operating the SAGD process. Recently, numerical prediction in this study has been validated qualitatively by the experimental observations of SAGD pressure maintenance from a low-pressure/low-temperature CT experiment and a high-pressure/high-temperature 2-D experiment conducted at the Alberta Research Council (ARC).",,"Greenhouse gases (GHG); Steam assisted drainage gravity (SAGD); Thermal processes; Additives; Carbon dioxide; Industrial emissions; Numerical methods; Particulate emissions; Pressure effects; Steam; Viscosity; Oil fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942576041

In a recently released report, such contracts would stifle competition in the EU's free gas market, scheduled for full opening to non-household gas consumers by July 2004 and for complete market opening by July 2007. However, gas supply security has become a growing concern because of Europe's increasing reliance on imported gas. Fifty percent of Europe's consumption will be imported by 2020 and long term contracts are now being viewed as ""an essential part of European gas market"". Gas demand in Europe has grown about 4%/yr since 1990, driven by increased use of gas-fired power generation, especially in combined-cycle gas turbine plants, and by industrial energy consumers switching from more-expensive and environmentally less-friendly fuels, e.g., oil and coal. In 2002, Europe's gas demand represented 24% of world gas consumption and the region produced enough gas to meet 67% of its requirements. However, all European gas production, except that of Norway, has passed its peak and is in decline. More than 50% of the gas Europe now uses crosses at least one national border via interconnections with the 187,000 km of gas transmission pipelines that traverse the region, most operated on a national basis within each country. The system links to production in the North Sea and to delivery pipelines from Algeria and Russia, which provide most of the EU's gas imports. Underground storage facilities, used to meet seasonal demand fluctuations, have capacity to hold 14% of Europe's total annual consumption.

In this paper we present an energy efficient code generation technique for rISA architectures, and furthermore explore energy savings for both cached and non-cached architectures.

By aggressively reducing code size on frequently executed parts, fewer fetches to instruction memory are incurred, thus reducing the power consumption of the instruction memory.

The outline design of two beamlines, suitable for the fabrication of MEMS devices using the LIGA process, is presented, along with an estimate of the exposure doses throughout the resist. The most commonly used resist is PMMA, which requires a minimum dose of about 4500 J/cm3 for accurate microstructure definition. Exposure with such a dose, in resist thicknesses of several hundred microns, can take hours. Fortunately, SU-8 resist is becoming more widely used as the minimum dose required is about 35 J/cm3, leading to exposure times of only a few minutes. Although Boomerang will shorten exposure times due to its higher irradiance at the substrate, the full benefits may not be realizable due to excessive resist heating. Heating effects have been simulated and suggest that helium cooling will be essential if the glass transition temperature of the resist (100°C for PMMA, 50°C for SU-8) and thermal distortion of the mask are to be avoided. The parameters chosen in this study of the future performance of Boomerang have been inserted into a cost model. The model shows that Boomerang exposure can become competitive with other exposure methods, particularly where large quantities of devices with deep structures are required.",,"Computer aided manufacturing; Computer simulation; Glass transition; Helium; Image quality; Lithography; Microelectromechanical devices; Microstructure; Photoresists; X rays; Beamlines; Boomerang; Storage ring energy; Thermal distortion; Synchrotron radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442534818

The following guidelines have been derived: for an internal heat gain-dominated commercial building, the deviation of building geometry and zoning from the reference building only marginally affects the optimal control strategy; reasonable simplifications are acceptable without loss of cost savings potential. Building construction characteristics determine the building passive thermal storage capacity. Zone temperature setpoints are affected more than TES operation by this construction mismatch, and a loss of cost savings potential is. found in some cases. It is advisable to make sure the construo tion material is well modeled. Zone temperature setpoint profiles and TES performance are strongly affected by mismatches in internal heat gains, especially when they are underestimated. Since they are a key factor determining the building cooling load, efforts should be invested to keep the internalgain mismatch as small as possible. Efficiencies of the building energy systems have no direct impact on building cooling load, but they affect both zone temperature setpoints and active TES operation because of the coupling of the base chiller and the TES chiller. Relative efficiencies of the base and TES chillers will determine the balance of operation of the two chillers. Mismatch in this category may be significant. To avoid critical modeling mismatch, system identification- techniques may be useful in improving the modeling process.",,"Ice storage; Plant energy efficiency; Thermal energy storage (TES); Utility rate structures; Buildings; Computer simulation; Cooling; Cost effectiveness; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Optimization; Temperature measurement; Predictive control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442529922

For this goal, the proposed cache, called SSA (selective-way-access skewed associative) cache, equips with a way-selecting mechanism controlled by skewing function and small table lookup, which also has the reconfigurable ability to be converted to one direct mapped cache on a specific application. The skewing mechanism including differentiated mapping function for each cache set, and specialized replacement policy enables the perfect speculation in way-selection and decreases conflict misses. Consequently, the proposed cache effectively achieves the energy reduction without any performance degradation. Additional delay of a small table look-up for the way selection can be hidden partly and multiplexer delay in critical path can be removed totally, such that overall cache access time becomes almost same as that of conventional set associative cache. The simulation result shows that the proposed cache structure reduces energy consumption up to 30∼55% over conventional set associative cache and up to 25∼30% over previous way-prediction caches. Furthermore, the software controlled reconfigurable architecture brings flexibility with the proposed cache to operate as direct mapped cache or way selecting cache based on given application adaptively.","Embedded system; Low power cache; Memory hierarchy; Selective way access; Skewed associativity","Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Hierarchical systems; Mapping; Multiplexing; Problem solving; Program processors; Low power cache; Memory hierarchy; Selective way access; Skewed associativity; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442526651

The proposed converter and its control is designed to be compatible to a fuel cell power source, which exhibits 2:1 voltage variation as well as a slow transient response. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a conventional boost converter stage cascaded with a current-fed two-inductor boost converter topology, which has a higher voltage gain and isolation from the input source. The function of the first boost converter stage is to maintain a constant voltage at the input of the cascaded DC-DC converter to ensure optimal performance characteristics with high efficiency. At the output of the first boost converter a battery or ultracapacitor energy storage is connected to take care of the fuel cell slow transient response (200 watts/min). The robust features of the proposed control system ensure a constant output DC voltage for a variety of load fluctuations, thus limiting the power being delivered by the fuel cell during a load transient. Moreover, the proposed configuration simplifies the power control management and can interact with the fuel cell controller.

Photo Voltaic and Wind Energy Sources are being increasingly recognized as cost effective generation sources in small isolated power systems. A realistic cost benefit analysis requires evaluation models that can recognize the highly erratic nature of these energy sources while maintaining the chronology and inter dependence of the random variables inherent in them. This paper reports the probabilistic performance assessment of a wind, Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV) Hybrid Energy System. A 400 watt wind Electric Generator (WEG), 840 WP (peak watt power) Solar Photo Voltaic Power Generator, 6×75 Amp- Hour (Ah) backup storage batteries, charge controller (CC), 1KVA inverter(INV), etc were designed, integrated and optimized to predict the behavior of generating system based on available local wind / solar and load data at Vasavi College of Engineering, Hyderabad, India. Storage batteries can be designed for various hours of uninterrupted power supply in the event of Wind & SPV energy failures. This model is useful for evaluating the probabilistic reliability evaluation of generating systems and gaining a better insight in the component sizes needed before they are built.

The MB_distr scheme is based on classifying instructions and dispatching them into a set of queues depending on their data dependences. These instructions are selected for issuing based on an estimation of when their operands will be available, so the conventional wakeup activity is not required. Additionally, the functional units are distributed across the different queues. The energy required by the proposed scheme is substantially lower than that required by a conventional issue design, even if the latter has the ability of waking-up only unready operands.

Among the various components of a data center, storage is one of the biggest consumers of energy. Previous studies have shown that the average idle period for a server disk in a data center is very small compared to the time taken to spin down and spin up. This significantly limits the effectiveness of disk power management schemes. This paper proposes several power-aware storage cache management algorithms that provide more opportunities for the underlying disk power management schemes to save energy. More specifically, we present an off-line power-aware greedy algorithm that is more energy-efficient than Belady's off-line algorithm (which minimizes cache misses only). We also propose an online power-aware cache replacement algorithm. Our trace-driven simulations show that, compared to LRU, our algorithm saves 16% more disk energy and provides 50% better average response time for OLTP I/O workloads. We have also investigated the effects of four storage cache write policies on disk energy consumption.",,"Cache management; Data centers; Power management; Algorithms; Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Internet; Servers; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342595096

However the mathematical modelling of the erratic turbulent motion remains the key issue when tackling such flow phenomena. The reliability of CFD analysis depends heavily on the turbulence model employed together with the wall functions implemented. In order to resolve the abrupt changes in the turbulent energy and other parameters situated at near wall regions a particularly fine mesh is necessary which inevitably increases the computer storage and run-time requirements. Turbulence modelling can be considered to be one of the three key elements in CFD. Precise mathematical theories have evolved for the other two key elements, grid generation and algorithm development. The principal objective of turbulence modelling is to enhance computational procedures of efficient accuracy to reproduce the main structures of three dimensional fluid flows. The flow within an electronic system can be characterized as being in a transitional state due to the low velocities and relatively small dimensions encountered. This paper presents simulated CFD results for an investigation into the predictive capability of turbulence models when considering both fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena. Also a new two-layer hybrid kε / kl turbulence model for electronic application areas will be presented which holds the advantages of being cheap in terms of the computational mesh required and is also economical with regards to run-time.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Heat Transfer; Recirculation Vortex; Reynolds Number; Thermal Management; Transitional Flow; Turbulence Models","Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Heat losses; Mathematical models; Optimization; Reynolds number; Turbulence; Vortex flow; Recirculation vortex; Thermal management; Transitional flow; Turbulence models; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342593166

Its structure mainly integrates a previously developed maximum point tracking method and output current shaping function into a buck-boost-derived converter and then inverts the shaped current through a grid frequency bridge to the grid. Instead of having a storage capacitor connecting in parallel with the converter output, series connection is used, so that the required capacitor voltage rating is lower than that in classical inverters. Most importantly, the inverter output current harmonics are less sensitive to the capacitor value. A 30W laboratory prototype has been built. The tracking capability, inversion efficiency, and large-signal responses at different insolations have been investigated. Detailed analysis on the inverter performance has been performed.

However, field reliability experienced by customers often does not match those expectations. Actual disk drive reliability may differ greatly from the manufacturer's specification and from customer to customer because of dependence on a variety of factors, some of which are completely independent of the drive design or manufacturing process. Thermal environment and duty cycle, inherent characteristics of the drive itself, architecture and logic of the system in which it is used, and the data collection and analysis process itself are all sources of significant variability. Together, these can create a range on mean time between failures (MTBF), if MTBF is indeed the correct metric, of 350,000 to 1,200,000 hours over the lifetime of a population of server class disk drives. This paper further elaborates on these four causes of variability and explains how each is responsible for a possible gap between expected and measured drive reliability.","Disk drive; Field data; System architecture; Vintage; Weibull","Disk drive; Field data; System architecture; Vintage; Weibull; Disk drive; Field data; System architectures; Vintage; Weibull; Acceleration; Activation energy; Approximation theory; Data reduction; Database systems; Drives; Integrated circuits; Printed circuit boards; Computer architecture; Hard disk storage; Maintainability; Manufacture; Quality control; Reliability; Sales; Specifications; Supply chains; Servers; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342502396

In this study, we further propose long pulses stacked with narrow pulses to prevent undesired air breakdown and reduce power consumption.

The fundamental x-ray beam properties from storage ring sources, such as the source size, brilliance, and pulse duration are limited by the dynamic equilibrium characteristic of the magnetic lattice that is the storage ring. Importantly, the characteristic equilibration time is long, involving thousands of orbits around the ring. Advances in laser-driven photoelectron sources allow the generation of electron bunches with superior properties for synchrotron radiation. ERLs preserve these properties by acceleration with a superconducting linac, followed by transport through a return loop hosting insertion devices, similar to that of a 3rd generation storage ring. The loop returns bunches to the linac 180° out of accelerating phase for deceleration through the linac and disposal. Thus, the electron beam energy is recycled back into the linac RF field for acceleration of new bunches and the equilibrium degradation of bunches never occurs. The superior projected properties of ERLs beams include extraordinary brilliance and small source size, with concomitant high transverse coherence, x-ray pulse durations down to ∼100 femtoseconds, and flexibility of operation. ERL projects are summarized. ERLs will be capable of hosting practically all experiments now being carried out at storage rings while also enabling new types of experiments. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012299208

The interferometer uses the same beamline in the visible range. The minimum measurable beamsize is with about 8 μm one order of magnitude smaller. This resolution is sufficient for the expected small vertical beamsizes at DELTA.

For this purpose one eights of PETRA will be converted into a section of DBA cells. Two modes of operation are foreseen. One with a very high number of bunches and a second one with a considerably lower number of bunches allowing time resolved measurements. In the later mode the Touschek effect severely limits the beam lifetime to the order of an hour. To compensate for the rapid losses a frequent refilling of the machine is necessary. This procedure is usually called topping up mode. The low emittance in combination with the optics at the insertion devices leads to very small beam dimensions especially in the vertical plane.

A distributed photon diagnostics has been involved to monitor the real beam quality provided by the storage ring at each high brightness beamline. Mainly conventional Photon Beam Position Monitors (Ph-BPM), based on photoelectric effect, are currently installed in the majority of the beamlines fed by Insertion Devices. These devices give a reliable amount of data both on beam position and intensity. A data acquisition system based on a real-time environment, assures a deterministic analysis on beam oscillations, shifts and long-term drifts. An automated archiving process stores the data and performs statistical calculations. Both time and frequency domain analysis are also routinely performed. Besides, an innovative detector, suitable for undulator sources only, has been successfully commissioned last year at Elettra. It is designed for undulator beamlines and it overcomes most of the limitations that affect the traditional devices. In fact radiation fringes, coming from the upstream and downstream dipoles, contaminate the position data of the conventional Ph-BPM commonly used. The novel detector, working as photon energy discriminator, can be tuned on the desired undulator harmonic rejecting the dipole contributions down the noise level. A sub-micron sensitivity has been obtained and the dipole radiation contamination level has been cut down to less than 0.1%. Its layout is fully presented in the paper with particular emphasis on its performances and operational considerations. Starting from the present status, we propose further developments in order to completely fulfil the user requirements in stability, reliability and reproducibility of the photon beam at the high brilliance light ports. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012285105

For the soft x-ray beam lines covering 100 - 1000 eV photon energy range, the best way of these is to use a gas cell and an XPS setup with a well-defined work function and a cooling system. Typically, the N 1s → π∗ absorption spectrum has been used as a reference for energy calibration and the visibility of the spectrum has been a good measure of the monochromator energy resolution. However, the gas cell is rather inconvenient in case of frequent uses, because it needs a dedicated experimental setup. In this manuscript, we introduce a solid sample that can be used for the energy calibration and for the measurement of spectral resolving power (RP) of the monochromator. The sample is a plasma nitrided SiON. The N 1s absorption spectrum of the sample at room temperature shows a spectral feature of nitrogen in free molecular state. The spectral resolving power that can be measured with this sample is as high as 3,000. The accuracy of energy calibration obtained with this sample is 130 meV at the photon energy of 400 eV. This sample is stable in air when stored at room temperature, except some contaminations on the surface; the absorption spectrum shows almost the same spectral feature after 6 months of air storage. We believe this sample can be usefully used in calibrating the photon energy and measuring the energy resolution of the monochromator for the soft x-ray beam lines which may not require higher spectral resolving power than 3,000. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012273374

The spatial photon intensity distribution at the first undulator harmonic (21.23 keV) was used to determine the horizontal emittance of the storage ring. The set-up installed at 107.7 m from the source point consists of a vacuum chamber with a cryogenically cooled silicon crystal in Laue geometry. The monochromatized radiation is converted to visible light by a fluorescent screen on the back of an aluminum plate and observed by a digital camera. Gaussian fits to horizontal lines through the centre of mass of the images provide the standard deviations of the measured intensity distributions in the horizontal plane. The corresponding emittance values were derived by modeling the whole setup with the SPECTRA code using the emittance as a free parameter and by using machine physics formulas neglecting photon source size effects. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012253414

The 150 MeV injector linac may contain a thermionic RF gun to have simple configuration of accelerating structure. The RF gun allows us to operate infrared free electron laser (FEL). A 1.5 GeV storage ring is designed to realize relatively low emittance and capability of inserting a couple of superconducting wigglers for x-ray. Furthermore a storage ring FEL is also taken account to provide coherent higher harmonic photons and high energy gamma-rays via Compton backscattering and Bremsstrahlung. At the present, the lattice of the storage ring is considered to have eight-hold Chasman-Green cells and two 8 m-long straight sections.

An improved undulator compensation algorithm and new optical beam position monitors have been implemented improving beam stability and maintaining vertical beam size variations to < 2% peak-to-peak during undulator scanning. Instrumentation initiatives include construction of a modified Wadsworth beamline (7.8 - 50 eV) and a variable-line-spacing plane-grating monochromator (VLS-PGM, 75 - 2000 eV) to utilize radiation from a permanent magnet undulator. The Wadsworth beamline is being commissioned for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) experiments using high-resolution Scienta analyzers. The VLS-PGM is being constructed for experiments that require higher photon energies and high flux density such as x-ray photoemission electron microscopy (X-PEEM) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). It is scheduled to be available in early 2004. Recent research at the SRC has produced exciting results in a variety of fields, culminating in eight articles published in Physical Review Letters and three in Nature since October 2002, in addition to articles in many other publications. An outreach program offers research experiences for undergraduates and provides the general public with an awareness of synchrotron radiation. Hands-on workshops and activities on FTIR microscopy and X-PEEM are offered for graduate students and scientists. SRC sponsors a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and offers opportunities to non-research universities and high schools. Tours and educational events are coordinated with local civic groups and schools. Open houses are offered that include tours, demonstrations, and family activities. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247649

NewSUBARU is a 1.5 GeV storage ring with injection energy of 1.0 GeV. Besides the 1.5 GeV user mode, the ring is often operated at 1.0 GeV for EUV users with the so-called top-up injection mode. In this experiment, we use a new synchronization method developed at SPring-8, wherein an instantaneous synchronization between NewSUBARU RF (500 MHz) and Linac RF (2856 MHz) enables a buckets-to-bucket beam transfer. This is one of the key technologies of top-up operations in a storage ring that uses a linac as an injector. The RF clock and timing trigger signal are sent to the Linac from NewSUBARU, and this clock is used to delay units in order to maintain good synchronicity. This works as a standard because it has a system to compensate for transfer-time drift. The arbitrary waveform generator is another key module.

It is believed in the energy community that a technology similar to photovoltaic (PV), but offered at about $1/W would lead to widespread deployment at residential and commercial sites. This paper addresses the investigation and feasibility study of a low-cost solar thermal electricity generation technology, suitable for distributed deployment. Specifically, we discuss a system based on nonimaging solar concentrators, integrated with free-piston Stirling engine devices incorporating integrated electric generation. We target concentrator-collector operation at moderate temperatures, in the range of 125°C to 150°C. This temperature is consistent with use of optical concentrators with concentration ratios on the order of 1-2. These low ratio concentrators admit wide angles of radiation acceptance and are thus compatible with no diurnal tracking, and no or only a few seasonal adjustments. Thus, costs and reliability hazards associated with tracking hardware systems are avoided. Further, we note that in the intended application, there is no shortage of incident solar energy, but rather it is the capital cost of the solar-electric system that is most precious. Thus, we outline a strategy for exploiting solar resources in a cost constrained manner. The paper outlines design issues, and a specific design for an appropriately dimensioned free-piston Stirling engine. Only standard low-cost materials and manufacturing methods are required to realize such a machine.","Solar Thermal Collectors; Solar Thermal Electricity; Stirling Engine","Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Stirling engines; Solar thermal collectors; Solar thermal electricity; Solar collectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942518387

Dow Corning's team has now found that phase transfer catalysis can reduce the cost of making silanes. The new process is faster and more efficient than the existing processes. It is more environmentally friendly, as it requires no salt filtration or hazardous solvents, solvent storage, recovery or treatment. The energy saving from using these ""green"" tires is striking, according to Martin Harvey of Dow Corning's Materials Manufacturing Industries division. When comparing the amount of CO2 released in the manufacturing process with the amount saved during the life of the tires, the benefit is that for every ton of CO2 produced in making the sulphidosilane, 250 ton of CO2 are saved in reduced fuel consumption.

This chapter presents a different approach based on the use of persistent spectral hole burning (PSHB) materials, which can be programmed to combine the roles usually played by the dispersive components and the modulator arrays. A PSHB material is nonpixelated and potentially offers a larger number of addressable points. The shaping process includes two steps: first, engraving a coherent spectral filter with an accumulated storage interferometric procedure, followed with the use of this filter to shape a probe pulse. Modifying the phase of an ultra short laser pulse or correcting a phase change implies that one is able to measure this phase. The spectral interferometry (SI) technique that perfectly suits ultra-short pulses is expected to be the ideal tool: A reference pulse is sent through the device, and the output pulse and a portion of the incident reference pulse are made to frequency beat on the entrance slit of a spectrometer. The resulting spectrogram provides the required information.

Box 43, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","High energy consumption is still an obstacle for sustainable greenhouse production. Therefore reduction of absolute energy consumption has high priority. In the Solar Greenhouse project, the ultimate goal is to develop a greenhouse system with a fully sustainable energy supply. The first step in the project is to decrease greenhouse energy demand substantially. Therefore, new covering materials have to be developed enabling the combination of high insulation with high light transmittance. New flexible or rigid plastic materials with geometry designed for high light transmittance are promising. Also coating of glass is promising. In connection to improved insulation, the greenhouse itself and its climate conditioning has to be redesigned. Active, energy friendly dehumidification has to be developed. Progress on this field is reported. On a year round base, sustainable solar energy is sufficient to cover the low heat demand of well-insulated greenhouses, even in North Western Europe. Long term energy storage in aquifers can link available surplus of sustainable energy in summer with energy demand in winter. Then energy is available at low temperature levels, so a heat pump has to be applied. From crop science, insight is given in potentials of a crop to integrate temperature. In this way the overall heat demand of a greenhouse can be decreased too. Crop tolerance has to be quantified to exploit it in control strategies. In these strategies, costs and benefits can be optimised applying optimal control theory. The implementation of models is essential in greenhouse climate control enabling the prediction of systems behaviour. The accuracy of the models can be improved by updating and tuning them through actual greenhouse climate and crop measurements. Therefore crop (soft) sensors have to be developed enabling phytomonitoring. © ISHS.","Dehumidification; Energy saving; Energy storage; Optimal control; Solar greenhouse; Sustainable greenhouse systems",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749341000

With its 70 billion cu m/yr of gas consumption, Italy is the largest market on the continent that is as advanced in its structures, its path to opening to competition (after the UK that started in the 1990s). Italy has a regulatory authority since 1997 but France formally only for a year. Italy, in its gas law of 5/23/2000 opens all its markets from 1/1/2003. At the same time, France opened 20% of its market and expects to open all its markets in 2007. Since 2001 Italy applies access of third parties to the regulated transport system with, for the high pressure national system, a rate structure of entrance/exit to a single zone. Since 2000, the transport was separated juridically from the commerce of Eni and Eni now has possession of ≤ 60% of its subsidiary Snam Rete Gas. In France, the juridical separation between transport and commerce is expected this year. The access of third parties to storage is in place in Italy since 2002, the access of third parties to LNG terminals since 2001. In retail and in practice, the situation of the opening of the Italian market is more contrasted. The infrastructure and imports are saturated and controlled by a dominant player. The priorities to access of the transport system favor the holders of long term contracts. The access to storage is reserved in terms of priority to the supplier of the residential sector. About 15% of the volumes of the industrial sector in Italy changed suppliers between 2000 and 2002 and 18% in France at mid 2003.

Scenarios established by the International Panel on Climate Change show that the CO 2 level in the atmosphere of 360 ppm as of now could, in the absence of countermeasures, exceed 1000 ppm between now and the end of the century, with significant risks of changing the climate. The generation of electricity (39%), industry (22%), and transport (23%) provide the main anthropogenic emissions of CO 2. To limit them, three actions are envisaged, i.e., reducing the consumption of energy; starting to use fuels emitting less CO 2 per unit of energy produced; and capturing and storing CO 2 (sequestration). The capture of CO 2 from combustion smoke can be made using known principles. Solvent scrubbing is applied using especially amines such as monoethanolamine used also in treating natural gas. These installations present the inconvenience of cumbersome and costly installation that consume significant amounts of energy that can lead in some instances to doubling the amount of necessary energy. Also, these facilities work under slightly favorable conditions of large volumes of smoke at low pressure and with low concentrations of CO 2 in the smoke. That is why other options are considered. In one option for a new facility the fuel can be converted into synthesis gas by steam reforming of natural gas or by partial oxidation in oxygen. The CO in the mixture reacts with water in the water gas shift conversion to produce CO 2 and hydrogen. The CO 2 is then separated neatly by capture before combustion and the hydrogen can be used to produce energy (electricity and heat) without CO 2 emissions. The other option is to combust the fuel in pure oxygen yielding products of combustion with CO 2 in high concentration, making it easy to separate the CO 2 from water vapor with which it is mixed. The three main options to separate out CO 2 are absorption by chemical solvents or physically or chemically/physically; adsorption on solid adsorbents; separation membranes; and cryogenically.

LePrince is provided of the lecture of A. Ferrari on the liberalization of the Italian gas market. The resumé is provided in terms of introduction; the natural gas situation in Italy; the distribution system; the legislative framework; the results; and conclusion. The natural gas market in Italy is characterized by the dominant role of the Eni company at all levels of the gas chain; by the fragmented distribution involving over 700 local players that divide up the retail market; and by the prices higher than the European average despite surveillance of wholesale prices at the level of large consumers and despite the rates regulated at the level of the residential and commercial consumers. Total natural gas consumption in Italy in 2002 was 70 billion cu m. The growth rate is 4%/yr, due largely to a strong demand for electrical energy. Parallel to this demand, the domestic production of gas, which peaked in 1994-1996 (20 billion cu m) decreases steadily (14.1 billion cu m in 2002-2003). Resorting to imports is an increasing necessity. Imports are assured from countries outside of the EU. The distribution system in Italy resides in 30,400 km of gas pipelines and storage capacity of 12.2 billion cu m in depleted fields. There are four transport companies on Italian soil of which SNAM Rete Gas controls over 96% of the system. There is now a regulatory authority that encourages commercial competition; protects the end consumer; watches over a just return on invested capital; promotes new investments; and studies improving the efficiency and quality of service to the consumer. The ""regulator"" takes all the necessary steps to assure a gradual transition to the free market. Its concerns include rules and economic criteria and applicable rates to the diverse links in the gas chain (transport, access to storage, capillary distribution, and access to LNG terminals, for example). These actions have provided for less fragmentation in distribution and retail sales; appearance of new operators in the gas chain; 15% of consumers changing their main supplier in the industrial sector; low rates for transport and storage; increase in transport and storage capacity; and over 5% of short term import contracts. Despite the results of this policy of progressive liberalization, there remain obstacles such as congestion of international pipelines, the lack of new investments from new operators, and lack of visibility on the future of electricity. In terms of a unified European market, progress in the regulatory system remains to be made such as reinforced coordination among the regulatory bodies of the EU and development of hubs.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043083518

Appert (IFP), CO2 emissions could increase by 70% to attain 70 billion ton/yr if no action is taken to reduce them. A first solution is the use of fuels with low carbon content. A second solution is to capture CO2 produced by energy producers and to inject the CO2 into appropriate geological formations. According to A. Pilavachi (European Commission), the European policy to reduce greenhouse gas warming of the planet involves the use of renewable energy, capture and sequestration of CO2, and improvement of energy yields. Projects now underway include AZEP - new chemical capturing process - Alstom; Grace - CO2 capture in the refinery BP; GETSCO - study of the potential of sequestration - GEUS of Denmark; CO2 STORE study of underground CO2 storage reservoirs - Statoil; NASCENT - study of the mechanisms of CO2 retention in reservoirs - British Geological Survey; RECOPOL - storage of CO2 in coal mines TNO (The Netherlands); WEYBURN behavior of CO2 in assisted recovery in the Weyburn field British Geological Survey; SACS 2 - behavior of CO2 injected in the Sleipner field - Statoil; and CO2 NET - thematic network on CO2 SHE Technology Initiative.

The GCEP brings together the world of scientific research and engineering of universities and industry. Its goal is to develop new technologies that can be commercialized allowing the generation of energy with a low emission of greenhouse gases. Diversity of energy sources is an essential element of this project because it is improbable that only one source of energy will respond to all future demands. Since its creation, the GCEP has concentrated on the geological sequestration of CO2, the integrated evaluation of technological options, the production and use of hydrogen, and advanced combustion. The integrated evaluation of technological options relates to a system of analysis with mathematical models that can be used continuously to evaluate technological options of energy sources with low greenhouse gas emissions. The hydrogen project relates to the production of hydrogen by genetic photosynthesis using the sun as the main source of energy.

For the hydrocarbons, the goals include the reduction of energy consumption, notably by engines, by the progressive use of fossil fuels with lower carbon content and by non-fossil fuels low in carbon, and by the capture and sequestration of CO2. Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) is involved nationally and internationally all along the petroleum chain in these three areas. In transport, the manufacturers have taken on CO2 emissions reduction from 140 g/km in 2008 to 120 g/km in 2012. IFP works on the optimal design of gasoline and diesel engines, on new modes of combustion such as homogeneous combustion to reconcile higher performance with very low emission levels. With respect to alternative fuels, the most interesting avenues appear to be NGV (natural gas vehicles), biofuels, and, in the long term, hydrogen, despite the obstacles to its development. In making a CO2 balance for the different types of fuels, it is important to make a complete analysis of the life cycle from the well to the wheel, taking into account the ensemble of the steps of production and use of the fuel. It is thus for example that the use of hydrogen, seemingly satisfactory, can be penalizing if its production is accompanied by elevated emissions of CO2. The capture and sequestration of CO2 underground is a promising solution in terms of the impact of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the problems to overcome are significant. It is a question of being able to store significant amounts of CO2, to reduce the costs, still high, and to be able to guarantee the security and integrity of the storage in the long term. CO2 can be stored in exhausted oil and gas fields, in deep saline aquifers, and in non exploited coal veins. The storage potential for depleted oil and gas fields is 920 billion ton. In the case of saline aquifers, it seems to be 400-10,000 billion ton. In coal veins, the potential is 5-150 billion ton. These estimates are to be compared with annual CO2 emissions that are now 23 billion ton.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043049499

In recent years, the traditional, flooded design of the battery has begun to be replaced by an alternative design. This version - the valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery - requires no replenishment of the water content of the electrolyte solution, does not spill liquids, and can be used in any desired orientation. Since the VRLA battery operates in a somewhat different manner from its flooded counterpart, considerable technological development has been necessary to meet the exacting performance requirements of the full range of applications in which rechargeable batteries are used. The valve-regulated design is now well established in the industrial battery sector, and also appears set to be adopted widely for automotive duty. This book provides a comprehensive account of VRLA technology and its uses. In the future, all industrial processes - including the manufacture of batteries - will be required to conform to the conventions of sustainability. Accordingly, the crucial areas of the environmental impact associated with the production and use of VRLA batteries and the recycling of spent units are also treated thoroughly. Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid Batteries gives an essential insight into the science that underlies the development and operation of VRLA batteries and is a comprehensive reference source for those involved in the practical use of the technology in key energy-storage applications. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The great majority of systems deployed have been BESS designs based on lead-acid technology. Computer-based, power-electronic control systems are creating a growing demand for reliable, high-quality electrical power that can be available via energy storage systems. This trend favours a growing number of BESS applications. Most BESS applications require the four-quadrant operation that is the ability of the ac side to both absorb and deliver both volt-ampere reactive (VAR) and watt. This capacity is provided by the back diodes that parallel the power switches and controls on the firing angles of the power switches. Many electric utility companies world over are successfully using BSESs for power supply. Crescent Electric Membership Corporation, Statesville, NC, the United States is using a 500 kW, 500 kWh BESS as a peak-shaving facility since July 1987 to reduce demand charges paid to their supplying utility. The battery consists of a single string of 324 cells configured six cells per module. These are flooded, deep-cycle cells with lead-antimony grids. The BESS at the GNB lead smelting and recycling center in Vernon is foremost an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) system that serves an essential purpose at an environmentally sensitive facility. The recycling centre is located about 16km south-east of downtown Los Angeles, and it recycles about ten million lead-acid batteries annually. The PQ2000 is another BESS that is designed to meet the growing market demand for high quality, reliable power for industrial and utility applications. It is primarily a rapid reserve resource that temporarily substitutes for the utility supply in the event of a power-line anomaly and, subsequently, returns the load to utility service excitation when the service returns to normal. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Its root, very rich in carbohydrate reserves, is edible as a vegetable. To bring this species closer to commercialisation with the aim of enhancing the diversification of vegetable crops, a research program was initiated. One of the objectives was to characterise the root reserves. The present paper gives the results of starch and sucrose evaluation. The root starch content at harvest time was very high (37 % dry matter, containing 76 % starch). Because this rate is exceptional for a species cultivated under a temperate climate, C. bulbosum could be a good option for diversification of starch sources under this climate. Results of a physical and chemical characterisation of the starch are discussed in this way. A two-month period of cold storage (4 °C), necessary to reach the consumable stage, resulted in a dramatic change of the carbohydrate composition. After this period sucrose content reached 25 % of root dry matter (DM). Sucrose and starch (35 % of root DM) were the two major components. The combination of these two high rates in a single organ, uncommon for a vegetable, reveals the great interest of tuberous-rooted chervil for the human diet. It is, indeed, a very tasty edible root combining a very rapidly digested sugar with a more slowly digestable one, resulting in long-term availability of energy. In conclusion, as it can be used for both industrial starch production and food production, C. bulbosum offers a good opportunity to diversify horticultural crops.","Cold-sweetening; Diversification; Starch properties; Tuberous-rooted chervil",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879632059

Geowissens./Rohstoffe, Hannover, Germany","The CO2-enhanced gas recovery (CO2-EGR) potential of German Rotliegend gas fields within the EC-supported R&amp;D CO2STORE was assessed. The CO2 migration within a layered reservoir resembling conditions of the Altmark fields was simulated generically. The Altmark was chosen because the fields are depleted and the CO2 storage capacity, estimated to be equivalent to the cumulated volume of natural gas produced from the reservoirs, would be enough to take up the amount of CO2 produced during the service lifetime of a modern lignite fired power plant such as the one at Schwarze Pumpe in the Lausitz. The discussion covers introduction; Altmark CO2-EGR simulation (geological model, injection concept, numerical simulator and fluid properties, and results); and perspective. The generic simulations provide preliminary results that may be useful for further simulations of fractured Rotliegend reservoirs. The numerical models indicate that the reservoir pressure can be maintained with CO2 during natural gas production. The produced natural gas quality will remain unaffected by CO2 injection for several years. Permeable sandstone layers facilitate the lateral breakthrough of CO2 from injection to production wells. The retardation of this CO2 breakthrough to optimize EGR is a reservoir engineering challenge. Despite efforts to change the energy supply to renewable sources, fossil fuels will be necessary for a sustained period to meet the German energy demand. Because of the forthcoming trading in emissions there is growing interest in underground storage options for CO2 in Europe now. The storage capacity for CO2 in gas fields is an estimated 2.5 billion ton. This would suffice to take up 10% of the present industrial emissions in the next 50 yr. Thus, gas fields could contribute significantly to reduce CO2 emissions in Germany. To optimize the benefits of EGR and CO2 storage, two injection strategies may be applied consecutively. For example, CO2 pattern flooding can be used to increase gas production until CO2 breakthrough deteriorates the produced natural gas quality, and CO2 can be injected through few horizontal wells that are highly injectable after sealing surplus production and injection wells.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9344252783

The to day available AUVs, generally, make use of several propellers, distributed around the body, to achieve the desired mobility with full attitude control. The solution requires the closure of multiple loops between sensors and actuators, highly cross-coupled and dependent on dynamics non-linearity and marine surroundings disturbances. The prospected solution considers a properly shaped vehicle, to grant minimal drag for lowering power consumption. A single rear propeller has in charge propulsion and manoeuvring. The propeller can be oriented around two axes, say, pitch (for heaving) and yaw (for veering); the screw (hydrodynamic) torque is balanced by variable tilt fins, either, by counter-rotating vanes. A three degrees of freedom parallel kinematics robotic wrist provides joint path-and-attitude selection and twist compensation, by driving the propeller assembly through three independent actuations. The build-up makes use of a duct-restricted propeller, with externally driven pitch-and-yaw bending and twist to counter-act the screw torque by reactive fins, either, continuous rotation. The balancing wile assures best performance, in the reactive mode, during steady surveying missions, while the local hover or docking is better accomplished by active counter-rotation.

Due to the more stringent limits imposed by governments, various manufacturers started working in the incorporation of alternative powertrain configurations, such as pure electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and fuel cell vehicles (FCV), in the automotive consumer market. In order to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of these new vehicles over conventional vehicles a comparison must be performed in terms of efficiency and pollutant emissions. However, hybrid vehicles comprise many components with at least two different energy conversion devices (i.e. internal combustion engine and electric machine) drawing energy from at least two different energy storage devices (i.e. fuel tank and battery). In recent times, many hybrid propulsion system configurations have emerged and many others can be imagined comprising multiple reversible and irreversible energy paths. Therefore, considering that in a hybrid vehicle at least two different forms of energy (i.e. fuel chemical energy and electricity) are consumed, fuel consumption alone is no more sufficient to give a measure of the effectiveness of a hybrid propulsion system. This paper presents a first attempt to give a general mathematical form of the traction energy, the global efficiency and the specific fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle that recovers as particular cases the thermal vehicle and the series hybrid electric vehicle. To evaluate the efficiency of the generic propulsion system the complete process from fuel energy and electricity to power available at the wheels is considered. The introduced concept of equivalent fuel consumption can be the basis for the comparison between road vehicles whatever the powertrain is pure thermal or hybrid. In order to get a better understanding of the mathematical analysis and its potential effectiveness some numerical simulations of hybrid vehicles virtual prototypes are performed through a suitable simulation model. The aim of the present analysis is to provide an instrument that allows a quick evaluation of the performances of hybrid electric vehicles.",,"Combustion; Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Electric traction; Gasoline; Torque; Gasoline thermal engines; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV); Hybrid propulsion systems; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844237757

The patterns disappear when the conditions change and information stored in these non-equilibrium structures is lost since precise reconstructions are impossible. Replication of molecules, in particular of polynucleotides RNA or DNA, is an autocatalytic process too. The storage of information in polynucleotide sequences, however, allows for reconstruction of the molecules under suitable conditions. Conservation of information in polymer sequences constitutes the basic difference between chemical and biological self-organization. Evolution of RNA molecules is considered as pattern formation in sequence space, which manifests itself as another pattern in the space of minimum-free-energy structures. In addition, optimization of RNA structures and properties is visualized as an evolutionary trial-and-error process. This process can be interpreted as a simple form of learning at the level of ensembles or populations of molecules. Evolutionary optimization of RNA molecules occurs in steps: Short adaptive periods are interrupted by long epochs of quasi-stationarity during which the mean replication rate of the populations is essentially constant. Understanding of evolution is largely facilitated through consideration of sequence-structure relation as a many-to-one or non-invertible mapping from sequence space into structure space. Neutrality of sequences with respect to structure formation is highly relevant for evolutionary optimization on rugged fitness landscapes.","Evolution; Information; Learning; Neutral networks; Optimization; Quasispecies; RNA","Chemical reactions; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Free energy; Kinetic theory; Mathematical models; Molecular biology; Mutagenesis; Neural networks; Optimization; Evolution; Flow reactors; Quasispecies; Self-organization systems; RNA",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744244322

Only exploitation of coal in the regions of Velenje and Zasavje is economically justifiable. Unfortunately, coal in these two regions is environmentally problematic, and reserves are sufficient only for about 40 years of exploitation. Reserves of uranium are bigger, but their exploitation is environmentally questionable and economically not viable. Slovenia has, because of its pre-Alpine geographical location, rather high amount of annual precipitation, which gives possibilities for exploitation of hydropower potential, solar energy and biomass. EU countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, in which they took over obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 8 % in the commitment period 2008-2012. In order to fulfil the Kyoto targets it will be necessary to restructure the sectors of energy supply, industry and transport. The costs of emission reduction should not exceed the purpose of investment into cleaner environment and exploitation of additional energy. The most important options for fulfilment of these commitments are exploitation of renewables and simultaneous production of heat and electricity (CHP). Nevertheless, before construction of power plants for electricity production from renewables or CHP plants, it is necessary to investigate their economic justifiability and impact on the environment. In this process it is necessary not to forget the process of electricity market opening, which reached the Western Europe at the end of last millennium, and is now irrepressibly spreading towards the east and is increasingly becoming (cruel!) reality in our country.",,"Coal; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Electric power plants; Embedded systems; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Investments; Energy supply; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Kyoto targets; Electrical engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744226706

For safeguards inspection, those bundles are item counted, identified by serial numbers, and verified by nondestructive assay. In doing these activities, underwater camera and gamma radiation detectors are being used. However, due to narrow space between bundles and high radiation area, some of bundles are inaccessible.

There is a body of evidence to show that OPEC is true to its word in releasing new volumes to the market in light of the May 2004 price spike and the cartel's subsequent decision to sanction a 2 million bpd quota increase.

Micropulsing was a premise behind a power processing unit (PPU) and an energy storage unit (ESU) design that for certain mission profiles, it was advantageous to operate a PPT at lower energy but higher frequency rather than at a higher energy but lower frequency. This premise allows for reductions in the ESU volume and mass without paying a penalty in thrust. To complete the evaluation, an independent spark plug initiation unit, a high voltage power supply and a variety of mica foil capacitors at 2.6, 5, 10 and 20 μF were used to conduct a series of tests on a single PPT to map performance levels of thrust, impulse bit, efficiency and specific impulse over a comparable power range. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center was conducted with breadboard PPT hardware. The test results showed that operating in the lower energy ESU micropulsing mode produced similar thrust levels to a higher energy ESU operating at high power level. Further testing however showed a reduction in specific impulse and efficiency when the smaller capacitances were used at the highest power levels. This would require more fuel mass for a mission that was predominately high power, potentially negating the ESU mass savings. Therefore, micropulsing is advantageous where most of a mission profile occurs at low power, but retains the ability to conduct high thrust maneuvers when necessary. © 2004 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Capacitance; Impulse testing; Mica; NASA; Plasma devices; Propulsion; Energy storage unit; High power level; High voltage power supply; Higher frequencies; Lower frequencies; Performance level; Power processing units; Specific impulse; Pulsed plasma thrusters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099490548

In deepwater remote areas there is generally no existing infrastructure to allow the gas to be sent to the market and many host countries are requiring companies not to flare gas. Some countries have built large facilities to turn the gas into LNG; for example, Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia and Qatar, and these facilities have been based on large base loads. Typical LNG train sizes have been in the range of 3.0 million tonnes a year with a minimum entry-level production rate being 0.5 BCF/Day or higher. This threshold is too high for offshore oil fields with a more typical peak production of 100,000 to 300,000 BPD of oil and up to 250 MMSCFD of produced gas. A concept has been developed for the exploitation of associated and stranded gas resources using a Floating LNG facility that can be moored in deepwater next to an oil production facility. The system is based on a patented turbo expander process that was developed by ABB Randall Gas Technology to liquefy natural gas streams and is called NicheLNGSM. The system uses no intermediate liquids for cooling and has a very low equipment count. This Floating LNG system is based on the storage of product in a vessel similar to a typical LNG tanker with the NicheLNG process located on the deck. Gas streams can be either preconditioned, i.e., NGLs removed, dehydrated, and contaminants removed or these operations can be done on the Floating LNG. This Floating LNG system is viable for development of stranded gas in the 0.5 to 3.0 TCF range with production rates from 75 to 300 MMSCFD. This paper will detail the work done by ABB in the development of the Floating NicheLNG vessel. The principle focus of the paper will be on the marine aspects of this development including selection of containment system, mooring and offloading concepts.

The shortfall of this process is that, once sectioned, a parabolic transverse profile is seen. This is due to the Gaussian irradiance distribution of the beam and no conventional optics can remedy the problem. Diffractive optical elements, however, can be designed for each process. Models of thermal conduction in the powder and the substrate can be utilised to produce a diffractive optical element specific to this operation. This enables a rectangular spot with a semi-idealised intensity cross section to be delivered to the work piece, reorganising 90% of the 1.2kW CO2 laser beam. When the diffractive optical element is applied to the laser cladding process, the resultant transverse clad profile is uniformly rectangular with a lack of 'shoulder rounding'. The laser cladding operation produced complex microstructures, which could not be satisfactorily categorised with optical microscopy. This lead to the simplification of the process by removing the powder.

The FCHV's system is designed to improve the efficiency and aims for high responsiveness when the vehicle is in a transitional state. In much the same way as most electric vehicles and the gasoline powered hybrid ""Prius"", the energy the traction motor creates during braking can be used to regenerate the secondary battery. The fuel cell and traction motor inverter are connected directly, with the secondary battery connected through the DC/DC converter to the fuel cell in parallel. The efficiency of the FCHV has the ability to be approximately 3 times greater than the conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicle. In 2003, Toyota developed the highly efficient next-generation FCHV. The system uses a lithium battery, the optimum power storage device for the characteristics of the fuel cell system, and a highly efficient half bridge converter circuit. The change to a lighter secondary battery and the reduction of converter losses make it possible to improve the fuel economy by 4% over the current Toyota FCHV.

Recognizing the challenge imposed by the potential for climate change, recent initiatives by various governments and by energy producers target a significant reduction in the intensity of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. A major mitigation strategy for reducing the intensity and amount of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere is CO2 capture and sequestration, of which geological sequestration is a major component. Although enhanced oil recovery operations have the lowest capacity of all options for geological CO2 sequestration, they are most likely to be implemented first because of the additional economic benefit that will help offset the cost of CO2 sequestration. Assuming that the pore space previously occupied by the produced oil can be backfilled with CO2, a methodology has been developed for the identification and screening of oil reservoirs that are suitable for CO2 flooding and for estimating their CO2 sequestration capacity at depletion, as well as under enhanced oil recovery. The methodology has been applied to close to 11,000 oil pools in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that are recorded in provincial reserves databases. Of these, 4, 767 oil pools are technically suitable for CO2 flooding, with an estimated incremental oil production and total CO2 sequestration capacity of 350×106 m3 (2, 200 MMbbl) and 988 Mt CO2, respectively. However, only 110 oil pools have individual CO2 sequestration capacity greater than 1 Mt CO2 each, but together they account for ∼61% of the total. The incremental oil production from these 110 oil pools is estimated to be 150×106 m3 (930 MMbbl) oil, and these oil pools should be considered first in detailed studies of CO2 EOR and sequestration. To account for the effect of underlying aquifer influx that reduces CO2 storage capacity, analysis of the production history of these 110 oil pools shows that the water-oil and gasoil ratios are indicative of the strength of the underlying aquifers, but the recovery factor is not. The underlying aquifer is considered strong if cumulative net WOR&gt;0.25, and weak if WOR&lt;0.15. For WOR between 0.15 and 0.25, strong aquifer support is indicated by cumulative GOR&lt;1,000 m3/m3 (5, 600 scf/bbl), otherwise the aquifer support is weak. Material balance analysis on 19 of these oil pools with active aquifers indicated that, if the reservoir pressure is only allowed to increase back to the initial pressure, the CO2 sequestration capacity is reduced on average only by ∼3%, if the underlying aquifer is weak, and by ∼50% if the underlying aquifer is strong. © 2004, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.",,"Air pollution; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Floods; Fossil fuels; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Proven reserves; Reservoirs (water); Atmospheric concentration; Enhanced oil recovery; Fossil fuel combustion; Geological sequestration; Industrial activities; Industrial revolutions; Mitigation strategy; Western canada sedimentary basins; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055860011

The reasons are summarized as follows: (1) cool energy of snow is renewable and clean energy, (2) use of snow has possibility to reduce the peak demand of the electricity and may cause to reduce the emission of CO2, (3) air-conditioning utilizing stored snow may bring clean and comfortable air by dust absorption on the snow surface, and (4) stored snow may bring high-quality condition, high humidity and cold air temperature slightly over the ice melting point, for farm products warehouse. To spread the amount of use of snow, there must be low-cost method to store snow by summer with simple insulation. New insulation technology, which is developed by Kobiyama and his group, utilizing agricultural waste, such as rice husk, was tested 2002. Snow pile of 960m3 (490 t) covered by an insulation of rice husk layer having 15 or 30 cm thickness was constructed. It was shown that the snow melting rate is approximately 1.5 cm/d even in mid-summer, then it was concluded the rice husk insulation is effective enough to store large amount of snow. The thermo-physical properties were measured in laboratory, and then the model of heat transfer in the layer of rice husk was developed considering the heat conductivity, property of water absorption, and water-shedding quality. © 2004 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055817339

For buildings with façades worthy to be preserved, only an inside insulation layer may be possible, but with inside insulation layers, moisture problems often arise. Using a capillary active material, as has been done in this research, the amount of condensation water on the cold side of the inside insulation can be reduced. Also, a vapor retarder is not necessary and, therefore, the drying potential is not limited. Based on the physical models for coupled heat, air, water vapor, capillary water, pollutant, and salt transport (CHAMPS) in porous building and insulating materials and the computer code DELPHIN developed at the Institut für Bauklimatik (Dresden, Germany), in continuation of the topic “capillary active inside insulation,” further substances and substance combinations were investigated in order to develop safe wall constructions in connection with appropriate thermal insulation. That was done via a computational prognosis and, secondly, with practical application in six test houses in Germany. The latter were connected to measurements of all climatic boundary conditions, such as temperature, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, precipitation, wind velocity and direction, as well as hygrothermic properties, such as temperature and humidity, in the materials. For numerical simulation, a set of storage and transport functions for the porous building materials is necessary. This paper describes the modeling and measurement of the moisture storage and moisture transport functions for the capillary active insulation material “calciumsilicate” used in the study. A comparison of measured and calculated hygrothermic performance within the envelope in a renovated frame house near Hannover, Germany, shows good correspondence. Heat losses have been reduced to one-third, and condensation water does not exceed 0.5 kg/m2 during winter. Moreover, a simplified computer code, COND, has been developed. It delivers about the same results and a sufficient assessment of the moisture distribution in the structure. © 2004 ASHRAE.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971378208

Though very small, this memory often contains highly valuable information (identification data, cryptographic key, etc). This is why it is subject to many attacks, as the other parts of the smart card, and thus requires appropriately chosen protections. The use of memories in smart cards induces security problems, but also other more particular ones. The main constraint is naturally the limited physical expansion and integration, but fault level, aging and power consumption are not to be discarded. Indeed, deducing the context of a ROM using a microscope has been proven to work. Interactions with light or eddy current on silicon can produce faults that might reveal important information, as well. This article details the role of memory in smart card industries, in current context and future perspectives of smart cards and their applications. It then gives a survey of published physical attacks targeting memory and all the existing techniques to counter them. Great efforts are undertaken by industries and academics to tackle specific memory problems introducing hardware and software countermeasures in the designs. This struggle between security and hackers permits in the one hand tremendous breakthroughs in research but in the other hand makes rather difficult for manufacturers to maintain cost effectiveness, that is one important factor for smart card. © 2003 IEEE.","Aging; Cryptography; Data security; Eddy currents; Energy consumption; Information security; Microscopy; Protection; Read only memory; Smart cards","Aging of materials; Cost effectiveness; Cryptography; Digital storage; Eddy current testing; Eddy currents; Energy utilization; Hardware security; Microscopic examination; Personal computing; ROM; Security of data; Surveys; Transportation; Cryptographic key; Future perspectives; Hardware and software; Identification data; Protection; Security problems; Smart card industry; Tamper resistance; Smart cards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948152556

Functionality symmetric software architecture can enhance the robustness of cluster-based network services due to its inherent absence of vulnerability points. However, such a design must satisfy performance requirements and policy objectives desired by online services.

However, most DVS schemes scale the clock frequency of the supply-voltage-clock-scalable (SVCS) CPU only and do not address the energy consumption of the memory. The memory is generally non-supply-voltage-scalable (NSVS), but its energy consumption is variable to its clock frequency and the total execution time. Thus, DVS for an SVCS CPU cannot achieve an optimal system-wide energy saving without consideration of the memory, as far as it is controlled by an SVCS CPU. We introduce an energy-optimal frequency assignment, for both an SVCS CPU and a synchronous NSVS memory, which optimizes the system-wide energy consumption. We derive the energy-optimal clock frequencies for an SVCS CPU and a synchronous NSVS memory, as a function of the number of processor clock cycles, the number of memory accesses and the hardware energy model. Our technique modifies the frequency assignment of the CPU and the memory used in previous DVS schemes, which ignore the memory energy. It enables the system-wide energy-optimal settings and achieves additional 50% energy reduction over previous DVS schemes. This technique can also be applicable to synchronous NSVS peripheral devices. © 2004 ACM.","Low power; memory system; SDRAM","Clocks; Dynamic random access storage; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Power electronics; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Dynamic supply voltage scaling; Frequency assignments; Linear relationships; Low Power; Memory systems; SDRAM; Supply-voltage-clock-scalable; System-wide energy consumption; Voltage scaling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932188643

For each bit-line pair, the proposed SRAM includes a dummy bit-line of sufficient capacitance to ensure that the memory array presents a constant capacitive load to the power-clock, regardless of data or operation. Using a single-phase power-clock waveform, read and write operations are performed with single-cycle latency. The efficiency of the proposed SRAM has been assessed through simulations of 128 × 256 arrays with 0.25μm process parameters and a 42/58 write/non-write access pattern. Assuming lossless power-clock generation, the proposed SRAM dissipates 37% less power than its conventional counterpart at 400MHz/2.5V.

In a way of root cause analysis to elucidate the degradation mechanism, atomic force microscope (AFM), SEM-EDX (energy disperse X-ray) and Auger electron spectrometry (AES) are used. It is found that the bonding strength of the wire pull and ball shear decreases with increasing depth profile of preexisting contamination layer and surface roughness. The plasma cleaning on the Al pad prior to an epoxy molding, however, enhances initial wire pull and ball shear strength. We firstly report the appearance of Sb on Auger spectrum from the fractured surface of Au-Al bonding. In the case of alloy-Al bonding, Pd retards the growth of intermetallics. The life time of Au-Al ball encapsulated with BP resin is much longer than that of OCN under the HST conditioned at 150 and 170°C. It is also found that lessening in the wire pull and ball shear strength is correlated to the interfacial degradation coupled with the material of wire and EMC. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Atomic force microscopy; Auger electron spectroscopy; Augers; Degradation; Intermetallics; Palladium; Photodegradation; Soldered joints; Surface roughness; Wire; Auger electron spectrometry; Ball shear strength; Contamination layers; Degradation mechanism; Growth of intermetallics; High temperature storage; Interfacial degradation; Root cause analysis; Aluminum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932165367

This paper presents the location cache structure which significantly reduces the power consumption for large set-associative caches. We propose to use a small cache, called location cache to store the location of future cache references. If there is a hit in the location cache, the supported cache is accessed as a direct-mapped cache. Otherwise, the supported cache is referenced as a conventional set-associative cache. The worst case access latency of the location cache system is the same as that of a conventional cache. The location cache is virtually indexed so that operations on it can be performed in parallel with the TLB address translation. These advantages make it ideal for L2 cache systems where traditional way-predication strategies perform poorly. We used the CACTI cache model to evaluate the power consumption and access latency of proposed cache architecture. Simplescalar CPU simulator was used to produce final results. It is shown that the proposed location cache architecture is power-efficient. In the simulated cache configurations, up-to 47% of cache accessing energy and 25% of average cache access latency can be reduced. © 2004 ACM.","data location; L1/L2 caches; set-associative caches; TLB","Buffer storage; Cache memory; Low power electronics; Power electronics; Virtual addresses; Cache architecture; Cache configurations; Data location; Direct mapped cache; L1/L2 caches; Set associative cache; TLB; TLB address translation; Location",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932139624

In JESD89 it is assumed that the sensitivity of the concerned device to neutrons with energies less than 10 MeV is low enough to be ignored. The scaling of semiconductor devices can cause their higher susceptibility even to neutrons of several MeV, where the flux of terrestrial neutron is relatively high enough to affect SER (soft error rate) -estimation from data acquired by accelerated test. Although the information on the threshold energy of neutron-induced SEU becomes more important, the definition of the threshold energy of neutron-induced SEU is not still an obscure issue.

In particular, the use of energy consuming memory, SDRAM, has become burdensome in battery-powered embedded systems. Intuitively, though demand paging can be used to mitigate the increasing requirement of main memory size, its applicability should be deliberately elaborated since NAND flash memory has asymmetric operation characteristics in terms of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present energy-aware demand paging technique to lower the energy consumption of embedded systems considering the characteristics of interactive embedded applications with large memory footprints. We also propose a flash memory-aware page replacement policy that can reduce the number of write and erase operations in NAND flash memory.

We have developed a new cache architecture, called a way-halting cache, that reduces energy while imposing no performance overhead. Our way-halting cache is a four-way set-associative cache that stores the four lowest-order bits of all ways' tags into a fully associative memory, which we call the halt tag array. The lookup in the halt tag array is done in parallel with, and is no slower than, the set-index decoding. The halt tag array pre-determines which tags cannot match due to their low-order four bits mismatching. Further accesses to ways with known mismatching tags are then halted, thus saving power. Our halt tag array has an additional feature of using static logic only, rather than dynamic logic used in highly associative caches. We provide data from experiments on 17 benchmarks drawn from MediaBench and Spec 2000, based on our layouts in 0.18 micron CMOS technology. On average, 55% savings of memory-access related energy were obtained over a conventional four-way set-associative cache. We show that energy savings are greater than previous methods, and nearly twice that of highly-associative caches, while imposing no performance overhead and only 2% cache area overhead. © 2004 ACM.","cache design; Low power techniques","Associative processing; Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Power electronics; Associative memory; Cache architecture; Cache design; High performance systems; Low power techniques; Microprocessor systems; Power and energy consumption; Set associative cache; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932085957

In the case of using fossil fuel, we compared 5 key factors among the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle (gasoline or diesel), battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Comparison factors are cruising range, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, waste heat rejection, air pollutants and noise. According to this comparison, hybrid, battery-powered and fuel cell electric vehicle have better potentials than ICE vehicles. In the case of utilizing renewable energy, EV will become the mainstream among various vehicles. In addition, FCEV will play an important role until that age. Moreover, we designed a high efficiency FCEV from the viewpoint of fuel effective utilization. This vehicle not only has fuel cell, but also various energy utilization and storage systems, for example, battery, flywheel and PV cell. This vehicle has excellent fuel economy more than 100km/liter. The proposed FCEV will be very promising to mitigate urban and global warming, and to conserve fossil fuel consumption. Further, the effect of the introduction of the above environment compatible vehicles into urban area will be discussed by 3-D heat island simulations. © 2004 WIT Press.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Photovoltaic cells; Waste heat; Air pollutants; Comparison factors; Cruising range; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Future energies; Renewable energies; Storage systems; Waste heat rejection; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903467169

In many ways, this vision is close to being realized. Wireless networks such as 802.11 offer connectivity to small, mobile devices. Portable storage, such as mobile disks and USB keychains, let users carry several gigabytes of data in their pockets. Yet, at least three substantial barriers to pervasive data access remain. First, power-hungry network and storage devices tax the limited battery capacity of mobile computers. Second, the danger of viewing stale data or making inconsistent updates grows as objects are replicated across more computers and portable storage devices. Third, mobile data access performance can suffer due to variable storage access times caused by dynamic power management, mobility, and use of heterogeneous storage devices. To overcome these barriers, we have built a new distributed file system called BlueFS. Compared to the Coda file system, BlueFS reduces file system energy usage by up to 55% and provides up to 3 times faster access to data replicated on portable storage.",,"Energy efficiency; File organization; IEEE Standards; Systems analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Virtual storage; Battery capacity; Distributed file systems; Dynamic power management; File systems; Mobile computers; Mobile data access; Portable storage devices; Shared data; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874790838

First, we introduce a new conservation technique, called Popular Data Concentration (PDC), that migrates frequently accessed data to a subset of the disks. The goal is to skew the load towards a few of the disks, so that others can be transitioned to low-power modes. Next, we introduce a user-level file server that takes advantage of PDC. In the context of this server, we compare PDC to the Massive Array of Idle Disks (MAID). Using a validated simulator, we evaluate these techniques for conventional and two-speed disks and a wide range of parameters. Our results for conventional disks show that PDC and MAID can only conserve energy when the load on the server is extremely low. When two-speed disks are used, both PDC and MAID can conserve significant energy with only a small fraction of delayed requests. Overall, we find that PDC achieves more consistent and robust energy savings than MAID.","Disk power; Energy conservation; Network servers","Cache memory; Computer networks; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Decision making; Energy conservation; Disk power; Input-output devices; Network servers; Storage management; Servers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8344236685

The prediction of temperature distribution around cavern was made in earlier design stage for the first ten years of operation. However, the measured temperature during the past five years revealed higher temperature than predicted value. The difference in temperature distribution between the predicted and measured values seems to be caused by the effect of groundwater flow around the cavern, which was not taken into account when the prediction was made. In this study, the thermal properties of the rock mass were modified to take the effect of groundwater and latent heat of freezing into account. The result of the analysis with these modified thermal properties shows good agreement with the measured temperature distribution. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This water exchange at the soil surface is conditioned by soil physical properties, vegetation characteristics, and the climate pattern shown by the dry and wet period distribution. Their respective influence on the processes involved is not independent, due to the close relationship between the physical characteristics of the soil surface and the vegetation cover distribution and conditions, which, in turn, are related to climatic and meteorological parameters. Since vapor fluxes return water to the atmosphere, water and energy balances are closely linked at the soil surface. In a similar fashion, the incoming energy at the soil surface, net radiation, is distributed into soil and air heat storage, and evaporation into the atmosphere. The resulting balance equations can be written in terms of a physical description of all these water and energy fluxes, which add up to zero because the surfaces have no storage capacity. The balance equations at the soil surface are: P1/4 Iρ Rρ E ϑ4:1ρ, Rng 1/4 Gρ lEρH ϑ4:2ρ, where P, I, R, and E are precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and evaporation fluxes, respectively, in the water balance equation, Rng, G, E, and H are net radiation, soil heat flux, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux, respectively, in the energy balance equation and l is the latent heat of vaporization for water. © 2005 by CRC Press.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350027376

Limitations of the fuel cell include usable temperature ranges, hydrogen storage, fuel efficiency, and cost. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are limited by the liquid water temperature range. The hydrogen ions are transported across the membranes in an aqueous environment and thus above the boiling point of water, the mechanism becomes severely limited. Temperatures above 100°C would decrease platinum poisoning by CO and would increase reaction kinetics. A novel approach could involve the use of heteropolyacids (HPA) as an additive for compatible sulfonated hydrocarbon polymers.

We implement our approaches in the Linux kernel running on a Sony Transmeta laptop and in a trace-driven simulator. Our experiments show that, compared to the traditional system-wide CPU voltage scaling approaches, our technique can achieve up to a 38.6% energy saving while delivering good performance to applications.

One way to reduce energy consumed by a WNIC is to transition it to a lower-power sleep mode when data is not being received or transmitted. This paper investigates client-centered techniques for saving energy during web browsing. The basic idea is that the client predicts when packets will arrive, keeping the WNIC in high-power mode only when necessary. This is challenging because web browsing generally results in concurrent HTTP connections. To handle this, we maintain the state of each open connection on the client and then transition the WNIC to sleep mode when no connection is receiving data. Our technique is compatible with standard TCP and does not rely on any assistance from the server, a proxy, or IEEE 802.11b power-saving mode (PSM). Our technique combines the performance of regular TCP with nearly all the energy-saving of PSM during web downloads, and we save more energy than PSM during client think times. Results show that over an entire web browsing session (downloads and think times), our scheme saves up to 21% energy compared to PSM and incurs less than a 1% increase in transmission time compared to regular TCP.","Energy; HTTP; TCP","Buffer storage; Client server computer systems; HTTP; Interfaces (computer); Routers; World Wide Web; Computer communication networks; Mobile devices; TCP; Wireless telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544261752

Many types of memories used in embedded systems allow multiple operating modes (e.g., active, standby, nap, power-down) to facilitate energy saving. Further-more, it has been known that the potential energy saving increases when the embedded systems use multiple memory banks in which their operating modes are controlled independently. In this paper, we propose (a compiler-directed) integrated approach to the problem of maximally utilizing the operating modes of multiple memory banks by solving the three important tasks simultaneously: (1) assignment of variables to memory banks, (2) scheduling of memory access operations, and (3) determination of operating modes of banks. Specifically, for an instance of tasks 1 and 2, we formulate task 3 as a shortest path(SP) problem in a network and solved it optimally. We then develop an SP-based heuristic that solves tasks 2 and 3 efficiently in an integrated fashion. We then extend the proposed approach to address the limited register constraint in processor. From experiments with a set of benchmark programs, we confirm that the proposed approach is able to reduce the energy consumption by 15.76% over that by the conventional greedy approach.","Binding; Low energy design; Scheduling","Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Heuristic programming; Kalman filtering; Potential energy; Problem solving; Program processors; Scheduling; Static random access storage; Binding; Energy minimization; Low energy design; Memory systems; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444379668

While Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) is known to reduce dynamic power consumption, it also causes increased leakage energy drain by lengthening the interval over which a computation is carried out. Therefore, for minimization of the total energy, one needs to determine an operating point, called the critical speed. We compute processor slowdown factors based on the critical speed for energy minimization. Procrastination scheduling attempts to maximize the duration of idle intervals by keeping the processor in a sleep/shutdown state even if there are pending tasks, within the constraints imposed by performance requirements. Our simulation experiments show that the critical speed slowdown results in up to 5% energy gains over a leakage oblivious dynamic voltage scaling. Procrastination scheduling scheme extends the sleep intervals to up to 5 times, resulting in up to an additional 18% energy gains, while meeting all timing requirements.","Critical speed; EDF scheduling; Leakage power; Low power scheduling; Procrastication; Real-time systems","Buffer storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer simulation; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Process control; Scheduling; Threshold voltage; Critical speed; EDF scheduling; Leakage power; Low power scheduling; Procrastication; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444368993

The paper also includes a comparison of the performance of these search techniques and overlays by extensive simulations.","Cache Proxy; Distributed Lookup; MANET","Computer simulation; Electric network topology; Energy utilization; Internet; Mathematical models; Probability; Problem solving; Set theory; Telecommunication services; Trees (mathematics); Dominating set (DS); Hit-ratio; Internal communication; Web caching; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444324425

A macro-model for such energy consumption is derived using linear regression analysis. The results describing filesystem energy consumption have been obtained from Linux Kernel running Journaling Flash Filesystem 2 (JFFS2) and Extended 3 (Ext3) filesystems on StrongARM processor with flash as secondary storage device.

The basic assumptions are that the on/off schedules are completely uncoordinated and that the sensors are distributed according to a Poisson process and their connectivity ranges are larger or equal to their sensing ranges. Moreover, the durations of active and sleeping periods are such that the number of active nodes at any particular time is so low that the network is always disconnected. Is it possible to use such a network for time-critical monitoring of an area? Such a scenario requires indeed to have bounds on the latency, which is the delay elapsed between the time at which an incoming event is sensed by some node of the network and the time at which this information is retrieved by the data collecting sink. A positive answer is provided to this question under some simplifying assumptions discussed in the paper. More precisely, we prove that the messages sent by a sensing node reach the sink with a fixed asymptotic speed, which does not depend on the random location of the nodes, but only on the network parameters (node density, connectivity range, duration of active and sleeping periods). The results are obtained rigorously by using an extension of first passage percolation theory.","Continuum percolation; First passage percolation; Sensor networks","Boolean algebra; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Optical switches; Parameter estimation; Percolation (computer storage); Probability; Random processes; Sensor data fusion; Continuum percolation; First passage percolation; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444247342

Biofuel cells have traditionally suffered from low power densities and short lifetimes due to the fragility of the enzyme catalyst. Utilizing a novel quaternary ammonium salt treated Nafion membrane for enzyme immobilization in a biofuel cell results in increases in power densities and enzyme lifetimes to commercially viable levels. Additionally, this method provides sufficient protection to develop a membrane electrode assembly style (MEA) biofuel cell, an important step for commercialization.

Quaternary ammonium salt treated Nafion membranes provide sufficient protection for the enzyme to retain activity after exposure to temperatures of 140°C.

The very low pollutant emission levels in fuel cells makes them an attractive alternative in ultra clean energy conversion systems. Actually, to truly understand the environmental impact related to fuel cells, it is necessary to study their ""cradle-to-grave"" life, from the construction phase, during the conversion of primary fuel into hydrogen, to its disposal. The tool used in this analysis is the Life Cycle Assessment approach; in particular the environmental impact of a fuel cell system has been simulated through the software SimaPro 5.0. Thanks to this approach, once the critical process regarding the production of energy by fuel cell system, (i.e. the production of hydrogen by natural gas steam reforming), has been determined, an analysis of the use of landfill gas as a renewable source to produce hydrogen was done. Finally, the production of electric energy by fuel cell systems was compared to that by some conventional energy conversion systems.

The study deals with the abundance of saccharides and ways to extract them from solid organic urban, forest and agricultural wastes, and from food industry effluents. The use of saccharides as fuel is treated from the thermodynamic point of view and compared with other common fuels currently used in fuel cells. Other properties of saccharides, relevant to their use as fuels, such as: safety, transportability, storage, inflammability, poisonous character and volatility, are also considered. The different possible catalytic electrodes needed to create a Saccharide Fuel Cell are discussed. Three options are considered: Microbiological, Enzymatic and Inorganic. None of the available catalytic electrodes has satisfactory performance. We conclude that since saccharides are human friendly, abundant, have high-energy content and are relatively easy to extract, efforts should be given to develop a Saccharide Fuel Cell. These fuel cells have the potential to become the basis of a decentralized power economy and open economical ways to deal with the environmental problems caused by organic wastes.

Using traced-based simulation, we determine the effects on battery run-time of adding the storage architecture to a modern palmtop device - effectively adding mass storage capability to the device. We experiment in the palmtop environment because palmtops are frequently and easily docked, and epitomize the battery and power constraints that face compact, portable devices. Our trace-based simulation shows that up to 86% of power used by the storage subsystem can be recovered using simple hoarding algorithms that cache data during the docked state.

In order to reduce the amount of off-chip memory traffic, one or more levels of cache can be employed, located on the same die as the processor core. For performance, energy, and cost reasons, it is expedient that the on-chip cache is small and directmapped. Small, direct-mapped caches, however, generally produce much more traffic than needed. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, to measure how much traffic is generated by small, direct-mapped caches and what the minimal amount of traffic is. This yields an upper bound on the amount of traffic that can be saved by utilizing the on-chip memory more effectively. Second, we survey some techniques that can be deployed to reduce the amount of traffic produced by direct-mapped caches and present results for some of these techniques.","Caches; Embedded processors; Memory traffic; Power consumption","Cache memory; CMOS integrated circuits; Data storage equipment; Electric power utilization; Program processors; Real time systems; Signal processing; Telecommunication traffic; Caches; Embedded processors; Memory traffic; Power consumption; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143128947

Generally, for a given loss rate, using a higher coding redundancy achieves a higher average throughput, but also incurs higher transmission costs (e.g. in terms of energy of a wireless device) and creates a higher load on the network. We define an optimal coding strategy as one that minimizes the expected cost/throughput ratio, for a connection that has a cost per unit time and a cost per transmitted packet. We present an algorithm for computing the optimal strategy and study its properties. We demonstrate that the cost/throughput ratio can be significantly better than with simple retransmission schemes, showing, in particular, that it strongly depends on the decoding buffer size, and obtain several asymptotic bounds on the optimal strategy performance for both unlimited and fixed-size decoding buffers.",,"Algorithms; Bandwidth; Buffer storage; Carrier communication; Cost accounting; Decoding; Performance; Redundancy; Signal encoding; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Forward error correction (FEC); Large delay-bandwidth products; Optimal packet coding; Retransmission; Packet networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143069227

Until now, all of the country's oil needs have been imported, a heavy economic burden given that oil accounts for some 99% of national energy consumption. Oil flows from Chinguetti, initially expected to amount to ∼ 75,000 bpd, could start by March 2006. Proved and probable oil reserves are estimated to be 120 million bbl. Other discoveries may also be declared commercial in due course and the offshore Banda field may hold enough gas to enable the country to join the ranks of the world's LNG exporters. The decision to proceed with Chinguetti is also an important milestone for Australia's Woodside Energy, which has embarked on an ambitious phase of international expansion to offset declining production at home. Development will be divided into two phases. Capital investment for the first is $0.6 billion and will probably be ∼ $150 million in the second. Phase-one drilling, which could commence in 2004, will involve 11 wells (six producers, four water injectors, and one gas injector). Phase two, which is likely to be undertaken in the second or third years of production, depending on field performance, will probably involve an additional four producing wells.

In the last decade, the eddy covariance technique (EC) has become a standard for estimating carbon and water vapor exchanges in all international flux networks. EC is a direct measurement of the upward and downward fluxes that uses high frequency measurements of vertical component of the wind speed and scalars. This study assessed the energy budget components and carbon and water vapor fluxes in two vineyards in Italy. An EC system was used to monitor 15-min values of carbon dioxide (Fc), water vapor (LE), and sensible heat (H) fluxes above the vegetation. Flux data were taken in August of 2002 in Tuscany, Italy, and in July of 2003 in Sardinia, Italy. In addition, net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) data were collected. The results of the energy balance closure indicated good accuracy of the data set. Rn was partitioned more toward H and less toward λE most of the time, depending on weather conditions and irrigation applications. The daytime Fc values ranged between -8 and -15 μmol CO2 m-2s -1. The daily net C budget was in about 2.14 g m-2 d -1 in Tuscany and 4.32 g m-2 d-1 in Sardinia showing that the vineyards were sinks for C. © ISHS.","Carbon flux; Carbon sink; Energy budget; Evapotranspiration; Vineyard",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549035895

The interleaver breaks the temporal correlation of successive samples by reshuffling them prior to transmission. In state-of-the-art solutions, this memory intensive operation is both power consuming due to frequent accesses to large memories and area inefficient due to poor memory-reuse. In this paper, we present a cluster-based deinterleaving method which makes a two-level custom memory hierarchy design possible. The access rate to large memories is reduced by performing sub-array deinterleaving inside much smaller memories thereby lowering the energy dissipation significantly.

The overarching design goals of such an infrastructure include client performance, global resource utilization, system scalability (providing a single logical view of larger resource and user pools) and application scalability (enabling single applications with large resource requirements). Such a storage infrastructure forms the basis for second generation data-grid efforts underlying massive data handling in high-energy physics, nanosciences, and bioinformatics, among others. This paper describes some of the foundational technologies underlying such a repository, Plethora, for semi-static peer-to-peer (P2P) networks implemented on a wide-area Internet testbed. In contrast to many current efforts that focus entirely on unstructured dynamic P2P environments, Plethora focuses on semi-static peers with strong network connectivity and a partially persistent network state. In a semi-static P2P network, peers are likely to remain participants in the network over long periods of time (e.g., compute servers), and are capable of providing reasonably high availability and response-time guarantees. The repository integrates novel concepts in locality enhancing overlay networks, transactional semantics for read-write data coupled with hierarchical versioning, and novel erasure codes for robustness. While mentioning approaches taken by Plethora to other problems, this paper focuses on the problem of routing data request to blocks, while integrating caching and locality enhancing overlays into a single framework. We show significant performance improvements resulting from our routing techniques. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Data handling; Digital storage; Grid computing; High energy physics; Scalability; Semantics; Wide area networks; Application scalability; Distributed storage resources; Network connectivity; Peer to Peer (P2P) network; Persistent networks; Resource requirements; Response-time guarantees; Storage infrastructure; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048870154

The approach used, dreamy memory, is to put DRAM in a low-power mode, unless it is referenced. Simulation results show that RAMpage provides a better overall speed-energy compromise than the conventional architecture used for comparison. The most energy-efficient RAMpage configuration in dreamy mode ran 3% faster and used 71% of the energy for DRAM of the best dreamy run of the conventional model. As compared with the best non-dreamy run time, the best dreamy time was 9% slower, but used under 17% of the energy for DRAM. The lowest-energy dreamy simulation used less than 16% of the DRAM energy of the fastest non-dreamy version, a very useful gain, given that DRAM uses significantly more power than the processor in a low-energy design. The most energy-efficient variant ran 12% slower than the fastest, allowing several trade-offs between speed and energy. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Computer architecture; Dynamic random access storage; Economic and social effects; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Conventional modeling; Energy efficient; First look; Low power modes; Low-energy design; Memory hierarchy; Runtimes; Trade off; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048851562

In this paper, we focus on the memory energy dissipation. This is motivated by the fact that, for data intensive applications, a significant amount of energy is dissipated in the memory. Advanced memory architectures like the Mobile SDRAM and the RDRAM support multiple power states of memory banks, which can be exploited to reduce energy dissipation in the system. Therefore, it is important to design efficient controller policies that transition among power states. Since the addressed memory chip must be in the active state in order to perform a read/write operation, the key point is the tradeoff between the energy reduction due to the use of low power modes and the energy overheads of the resulting activations. The lack of rigorous models for energy analysis is the main motivation of this work. Assuming regular transitions, we derive a formal model that captures the relation between the energy complexity and the memory activities. Given a predetermined number of activations, we approximate the optimal repartition among available power modes. We evaluate our model on the RDRAM and analyze the behavior of each parameter together with the energy that can be saved or lost. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Algorithms; Chemical activation; Dynamic random access storage; Energy dissipation; Critical constraints; Data-intensive application; Energy analysis; Energy minimization; Energy overheads; Energy reduction; Read/write operations; Regular transition; Memory architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048848070

Prior work on optimizing applications in a banked memory environment has exclusively focused on uncompressed data. While this may be preferable from a performance viewpoint, it is not necessarily the best strategy as far as memory space utilization is considered. This is because compressing data in memory may reduce the number of memory banks it occupies and this, in turn, may enable a better use of low-power operating modes.

For many critical canopy functions, all plants contribute. Similarly, the forest environment changes continuously from top to bottom, so the gradients cannot be subdivided objectively. In mixed-species, multi-aged stands, the upper layers alone do not represent canopy structure and all its microhabitats, microclimates, and exchange processes. Thus, researchers now recognize that the forest canopy is part of the forest ecosystem as a whole. Non-forest vegetation also supports canopies, such as kelp ""forests,"" algal mats on a river bed, beds of sea grasses, orchards, lawns, wheat fields, and stromatolite aggregates. The chapter restricts the discussion to canopies associated with tall, woody plants; that is, terrestrial forests. In this context, the term canopy denotes forest community architecture as well as species composition, nutrient cycling, energy transfer, and plant-animal interactions from the ground to the forest-atmosphere interface. It also discusses the development of canopy studies and summarizes the general features of canopy composition, structure, and distribution. It identifies ways that humans and forest canopies have been linked through history and in the present, and then discusses the dependence of our species on forest canopies for fiber, fuel, food, medicines, and spirituality.

Unlike previous approaches to storage power savings, the proposed scheme does not rely on the special types or combinations of disk drives. The proposed scheme can be used for various storage configurations including internal disks, NAS, and SAN. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Energy management; Power management; Virtual storage; Active storage; Active storage devices; Cluster server; Cluster server system; Disk drive; Disk I/O; Remote storage; Storage power; Storage management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744933627

Therefore, the paper sets up HESC laminate model and adopts integral approximate Kantorovich solution for the first time to solve HESC cantilever laminate.

Cortisol (in humans) or corticosterone (in rodents) are important mediators of the stress system. Their action - in concert - is crucial for individual differences in coping with other individuals, which in turn depend on genetic- and experience-related factors. The actions exerted by cortisol and corticosterone have an enormous diversity. They include the regulation of rapid molecular aggregations, membrane processes, and gene transcription. In the latter transcriptional regulation, the corticosteroid hormones have two modes of operation. One mode is mediated by high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), which control gene networks underlying stabilization of neuronal activity as determinant for the sensitivity to trigger immediate responses to stress organized by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-1 receptor. Whereas disturbance of homeostasis is prevented by MR-mediated processes, its recovery is facilitated via the low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that require stress levels of cortisol. GRs promote in coordination with CRH-2 receptors and the parasympathetic system behavioral adaptation and enhances storage of energy and information in preparation for future events. The balance in the two stress system modes is thought to be essential for cell homeostasis, mental performance, and health. Imbalance induced by genetic modification or stressors changes specific neural signaling pathways underlying cognition and emotion. This yin-yang concept in stress regulation is fundamental for genomic strategies to understand the mechanistic underpinning of corticosteroid-induced stress-related disorders such as severe forms of depression.","Behavior; Brain; Corticosteroids; Genes; Receptors; Stress","corticosteroid; corticosterone; corticotropin receptor; corticotropin releasing factor; glucocorticoid receptor; hydrocortisone; mineralocorticoid receptor; binding affinity; brain; Chinese medicine; cognition; conference paper; correlation analysis; depression; emotion; energy conservation; environment; experience; genetic transcription; heredity; homeostasis; hormonal regulation; hormone action; human; molecular mechanics; nerve cell; neuroendocrinology; nonhuman; regulatory mechanism; stress; transcription initiation; Rodentia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242723066

Films of copolymers of poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) containing 8 wt-% Azo-benzene were photo isomerized with a UV lamp and then measured as a function of time in a low-energy positron beam.

They are applied to areas where fluid lubricants are undesirable or ineffective, when it is unnecessary to avoid contaminating a product or a system to provide prolonged storage or stationary service, or to work in a high vacuum and under extreme temperatures. One factor which limits the application of solid lubricated roller bearings is the absence of a lifetime estimation. A frictional energy model was utilized to analyze the lifetime under continuous wear conditions. A modified dynamic ball tester and a four bearing test rig were introduced. In contrast to the experiment of real roller bearing, which takes mostly several weeks for a test, on four all tester, the experimental lifetime of a solid lubrication coating was within one day under similar conditions as bearings. Abandonment of bearing test was considerable speeding up development of solid lubricant coatings in ball bearings. Both the four bearing test rig and modified ball tester could be carried out under extreme conditions, i.e., high temperature and high vacuum.

The concept of using a computerized procedure capable of recognizing the status of the equipment from monitoring systems and using that data to automatically optimize the plant operation could lead to significant economic and energy consumption improvements.

A poor on-chip memory design can have serious power and performance implications when running data-intensive embedded applications. While it is possible to design an application-specific memory architecture, this may not be the best option, in particular when storage demands of individual processors and/or their data sharing patterns can change from one point in execution to another for the same application. In this paper, we consider dynamic configuration of software-managed on-chip memory space to adapt runtime variations in data storage demand and interprocessor sharing patterns. The proposed framework is fully implemented using an optimizing compiler, a polyhedral tool, and a memory partitioner (based on integer linear programming), and tested using a suite of eight data-intensive embedded applications. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed technique is very effective in practice and leads to much less energy consumption than all the alternate memory management schemes tested, including one that comes up with an application-specific memory.

Besides caches, branch predictors are among the largest on-chip array structures and consume non-trivial leakage energy. This paper proposes two loop-based strategies to reduce the branch predictor leakage without impacting prediction accuracy, which is crucial for achieving high performance. The loop-based approaches exploit the fact that loops usually only contain a small number of instructions and hence fewer branch instructions. Consequently, all the non-active entries of branch predictors can be placed into the low leakage mode during the loop execution for leakage energy savings. Compilers can annotate this information and pass it to the processor for reducing leakage at runtime. Compared to the recently-proposed decay-based approach, our experimental results show that the loop-based approach can extract 16.2% more branch predictor idleness on average, leading to more leakage energy savings without impacting the branch prediction accuracy and performance.

We exploit the structured organization of memories, which enables a selective mode of operation in which banks are accessed selectively. Unused banks are placed in a lower power mode based on access pattern information. We propose hardware techniques that dynamically control the memory by making the system adapt to the access patterns that arise from queries.

However, consulting the prediction buffer at every cache access consumes non-trivial dynamical energy, which can compromise the overall energy savings substantially. This paper proposes a static approach to capture the sub-bank transition behavior at link time and to pre-activate the instruction cache sub-bank at runtime according to the compiler-directed hints. We also propose a hybrid approach to exploit both the static and dynamic information for reducing the performance penalty further with little dynamic energy overhead. Our experiments reveal that the static approach is very successful in capturing the sub-bank transition behavior for reducing the performance penalty and it also reduces 38.2% more leakage energy than the hardware-based approach, taking the dynamic energy overhead into account. Moreover, our results show that the hybrid approach is the best strategy for the drowsy instruction cache to balance leakage energy reduction and performance.

These systems are not equipped with virtual memory. A small memory space called an execution buffer is allocated to page an application. An application-specific page manager manages the buffer. The manager is generated by a compiler post-pass and combined with the application image. Our compiler post-pass analyzes the ELF executable image of an application and transforms function call/return instructions into calls to the page manager. As a result, each function of the code can be loaded into memory on demand at run time. To minimize the overhead of demand paging, code clustering algorithms are also presented. We evaluate our techniques with five embedded applications.

Caches are critical to the overall performance and thus, modern processors (both high and low-end) tend to deploy a cache with large size and high degree of associativity. Due a large size cache power takes up a significant percentage of total system power. One important way to reduce cache power consumption is to reduce the dynamic activities in the cache by reducing the dynamic load-store counts. In this work, we focus on programs that are only available as binaries which need to be improved for energy efficiency. For adapting these programs for energy-constrained devices, we propose a feed-back directed post-pass solution that tries to do register re-allocation to reduce dynamic load/store counts and to improve energy-efficiency. Our approach is based on zero knowledge of original code generator or compiler and performs a post-pass register allocation to get a more power-efficient binary. We attempt to find out the dead as well as unused registers in the binary and then reallocate them on hot paths to reduce dynamic load/store counts. It is shown that the static code size increase due to our framework is very minimal. Our experiments on SPEC2000 and MediaBench show that our technique is effective. We have seen dynamic spill loads/stores reduction in the data-cache ranging from 0% to 26.4%. Overall, our approach improves the energy-delay product of the program.

These distributed indexes offer a rich design space of a) logical decompositions of sensor relation schema into indexes, as well as b) physical mappings of these indexes onto sensors. In this poster, we explore this space for energy-efficient data organizations (logical and physical mappings of tuples and attributes to sensor nodes) and devise purely local query optimization techniques for processing queries that span such decomposed relations. We propose four design techniques: (a) fully decomposing the base sensor relation into distinct sub-relations, (b) spatially partitioning these sub-relations across the sensomet, (c) localized query planning and optimization to find fully decentralized optimal join orders, and (d) locally caching join results. Together, these optimizations reduce the overall network energy consumption by 4 times or more when compared against the standard single multi-dimensional distributed index on a variety of synthetic query work-loads simulated over both synthetic and real-world datasets. We validate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a functional prototype of our data organizer and query processor on Mica2 motes and observing comparable message cost savings.","Caching; Data Organization; Data-Centric Storage; DCS; Query Optimization; Sensor Networks","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Sensors; Ad hoc networks; Distributed parameter networks; Embedded systems; Industrial research; Optimization; Query processing; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks; Caching; Data organization; Data-centric storage; DCS; Query optimization; Sensor networks; Aggregate queries; Base sensors; Cost saving; Data centric storage; Data organization; Data storage; Design spaces; Design technique; Distributed index; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Functional Prototypes; Logical decomposition; Physical mapping; Query optimization; Query processing techniques; Query processor; Real-world datasets; Sensornet; Computer networks; Data processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27644474973

Its name is derived from the Greek word kreas (flesh): Creatine is found in abundance in skeletal muscle (red meat) and fish. It is essential in energy transmission and storage via creatine kinase (CK). The daily Cr dosage is obtained by both endogenous synthesis and via nutritional intake, followed by absorption in the intestine.[1] Creatine supplementation is widespread among sportspersons because of its documented and=or presumed ergogenic effects.[2-4] In addition, supplementation with Cr has proven to be instrumental for the treatment of rare inborn errors of metabolism due to defects in Cr biosynthesis enzymes.[5-8] Creatine is stored in high concentrations in skeletal and heart muscles and to a lesser extent in the brain. It exists in both free and phosphorylated form [phosphocreatine (PCr)], and is important for maintaining high adenosine triphosphate (ATP): adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratios. Upon increases in workload, ATP hydrolysis is initially buffered by PCr via the CK reaction. During high-intensity exercise, PCr in muscle is depleted within several seconds. Whether de novo Cr biosynthesis occurs in the brain, or whether Cr is taken up into the brain through the blood-brain barrier is currently a matter of debate. © 2005 by Marcel Dekker.

The new FADC-based DAQ system will improve the quality of the data taken by the Grande array by digitizing the scintillator signals with a 250 MHz sampling rate. The signals of each of the 37 detector stations are continuously recorded using cascaded 12-bit Flash Analog-to-Digital- Converters (FADCs) located on custom made digitizer boards at each station. The digitizer boards feature a self-triggering mechanism, initiating the data transmission to the Grande DAQ station using programmable thresholds, a time stamp mechanism and optical data transmission. The control logic is implemented using Field Progammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Five optical receiver and temporary storage modules receive the data from up to eight stations each (at an approximate rate of 2.5 MB/s per station) and transfer them into the memory of one of five PCs via a customized PCI interface card. Running on a master PC, the data acquisition software searches for coincidences in the time stamps, incorporates triggers generated by the other KASCADE-Grande components and builds air shower events from the data of the individual stations. Completed Grande events will be sent to the central DAQ of KASCADE-Grande at an approximate rate of a few air shower events per second. Two Grande stations have been equipped with the FADC-based data acquisition system this summer (2004) and first data are shown. By the beginning of 2005 completion of the full system is anticipated. © 2004 IEEE.","Astroparticle physics instrumentation; FADC-based readout systems; KASCADE-Grande; Programmable logic","Astrophysics; Data reduction; Data transfer; Field programmable gate arrays; High energy physics; Interfaces (computer); Scintillation counters; Threshold elements; Astroparticle physics instrumentation; FADC-based readout systems; KASCADE-Grande; Programmable logic; Scintillator signals; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844496788

The composite fuel is a mixture resulted from natural gas resolving in liquid propane, which has a relatively lower storage pressure compared with that of compressed natural gas. Here in this paper, a numerical investigation of conjugate heat transfer among convection, wall conduction and flow boiling in a double-pipe heat exchanger is presented. The heat exchanger has hot fluid flowing in the annular section and propane boiling in the inside tube. A computer program is developed to calculate the conjugate heat transfer of convection, conduction and boiling. In computing the convection and conduction, control volume method and SIMPLE algorithm are used to solve momentum equations and the energy equation of conjugate heat transfer. The contribution of this work is to combine the third kind (Neuman) of boundary condition with the boiling correlations for flow boiling in horizontal tubes in order to calculate the conjugate heat transfer of the whole problem. Two boiling correlations have been selected to give inside tube boiling heat transfer coefficient. Because the boiling coefficient depends on the wall temperature and local propane quality, so we have to solve the boiling correlation, the conduction and the convection governing equations simultaneously. The iteration method and TDMA are used to solve these coupled equations. The two boiling correlations are Chen's (1966) correlation [2] and Kandlikar's (1990) correlation [3]. Finally the results are compared with the experiment data. It has been found in low quality range, Kandlikar's result is close to the experiment data. Because very few data of propane flow boiling can be found in literature, we use propane pool boiling data by Shen, Spindler and Hahne (1997) [4] to estimate parameter Ffl in Kandlikar's correlation. The influence of simultaneously developing velocity and temperature field at entrance length in annular passage is considered and discussed in detail. The wall conduction resistance is also compared with convection and boiling resistance in the whole length of the heat exchanger. The completed computer program can be used to the design of shell and tube heat exchangers.

Accordingly, grain storage and drying as well as flows over layers of vegetation can be characterized by some sort of porous structure through which a fluid permeates. For such hybrid media, involving both a porous structure and a clear flow region, difficulties arise due to the proper mathematical treatment given at the macroscopic interface. The literature proposes a jump condition in which shear stresses on both sides of the interface are not of the same value. This paper presents numerical solutions for such hybrid medium, considering here a channel partially filled with a porous layer through which fluid flows in turbulent regime. Here, diffusion fluxes of both momentum and turbulent kinetic energy across the interface present a discontinuity in their values, which is based on a certain jump coefficient. Effects of such jump parameter on mean and turbulence fields around the interface regions are numerically investigated. Results indicate that depending on the value of the stress jump parameter, a substantially different structure for the turbulent field is obtained.

It is due to the low density of the solar radiation and its unfavorable distribution. The majority of solar energy falls to the low latitude countries, where space-heating requirements are marginal. In these countries the solar heat is used for preparing water for washing or cleaning purposes, and this process works in one, or -maximum - a few daily cycles. In countries located at higher latitudes, where space heating is necessary in cold months, the current solar energy is insufficient to meet the space heating demand. The heat storage in deep layer of the ground is the one of possible way for solution of this problem. During the heating season, energy storage is discharged supplying the heat pomp cooperating with domestic heating system and during the summer months the storage can be charged by fluid heated in solar collectors. The main aim of presented research was analysis of using the ground layer as a heat storage system in the countries located in higher latitudes. The first variable taken into consideration was the output temperature of water leaving the solar collectors. The temperature distribution in the ground depends on the inlet water temperature, primary heated in the solar collectors, and forced into vertical boreholes. The temperature field in the ground was calculated using the duFort-Frankel finite-difference numerical method. A numerical code for 3D time dependent storage simulation has been created. The next step of analysis was calculation of waters' temperature at the borehole output during cold months when the ground storage is discharged. This water works as a low-temperature reservoir of the heat pomp supplying the dwelling heating system. The solution of the problem is focused on an optimization of all parameters for the most efficient utilization of energy stored in the ground. The numerical genetic algorithms are scheduled to use to achieve this target.

Typically vitrification is achieved when biological systems are cooled at rates ranging from ∼8,000°C/min to -10,000°C/min. Using traditional cooling methods (immersion in liquid nitrogen), such high cooling rates are currently not achievable, in large tissue sections (∼cm's). In the present study we investigate a novel method to achieve high cooling rates in large tissue sections by pulsed laser heating in conjunction with cryogenic temperatures, i.e. high cooling rates are achieved by the localized difference in temperature between the laser heated tissue (∼1000's of °C) and the surrounding liquid nitrogen (∼ -160°C). Additionally, the use of pulsed lasers allows localized heating of the tissue coupled with small time scales of energy deposition (0.1 to 1 pico seconds) such that the heating/thermal damage in tissues is minimized. To amplify this idea further, we developed a numerical model to predict the temperature transients in tissues exposed to laser heating and cryogenic temperatures. Analysis of our numerical simulations suggest that a perturbation of ∼3500°C in a 5mm thick tissue leads to cooling rates in excess of ∼8000°C/min throughout the tissue slice. These results indicate the possibility of vitrifying large tissue sections of cryobiological relevance using a combination of laser heating and liquid nitrogen cooling.

It consists of analyzing the heat transfer and removal of energy, applicable to storage systems, which are chiller-based. In this sense the secondary coolant circulates through a heat exchanger that is submerged in a tank of water and it is used to freeze (charge) the phase-change material (water), which never leaves the storage tank. The thermal exchange process is investigated in critical regions formed between the heat exchanger wall and the tank wall. The present study simulates such regions through a channel formed by parallel flat plates, one of which is the heat exchanger, and investigates the heat transfer effects considering it in two different positions. In the first one the channel is in the vertical position, while for the second, it is horizontally positioned. Our task is to provide helpful qualitative results for the heat transfer performance of ice storage tanks. The results are analyzed through streamlines and isotherms, for specific instants of time.

Natural convection in the melt is considered. Volume-averaged mass and momentum equations are employed, with the Brinkman-Forchheimer extension to the Darcy law to model the porous resistance. Owing to the difference in the thermal diffusivities between the metal foam and the PCM, local thermal equilibrium between the two is not assured. Assuming equilibrium melting at the pore scale, separate volume-averaged energy equations are written for the solid metal foam and the PCM, and are closed using an interstitial heat transfer coefficient. The enthalpy method is employed to account for phase change. The governing equations are solved implicitly using a finite volume method on a fixed grid.

These rovers are being enabled by an advanced rechargeable battery system, lithium-ion, for the first time on a space mission of this scale, for keeping the rover electronics warm, and for supporting nighttimc experimentation and communications. These rover Li-ion batteries are characterized by their unique low temperature capability, in addition to the usual advantages associated with Li-ion chemistry in terms of mass, volume and energy efficiency. To enable a rapid insertion of this advanced Li-ion chemistry into flight missions, we have performed several performance assessment studies on several prototype cells over the last few years. These tests mainly focused primarily on the long-term performance characteristics, such as cycling and storage, as described in our companion paper. In addition, various tests have been performed on MER cells and engineering and proto-flight batteries, under conditions relevant to these missions. For example, we have examined the performance of the cells in: a) an inverted orientation, as during integration and launch, and b) conditions of low rate discharge, between 3.0-2.5 V to support the mission clock. Likewise, we have determined the impedance of the proto-flight Rover battery assembly unit in detail, with a view to assess whether a current-limiting resistor would be unduly stressed, in the event of a shorting induced by a failed pyro. In this paper, we will describe these studies in detail, as well as the performance of Li-ion batteries in Spirit and Opportunity rovers, during cruise and on Mars.

Rechargeable batteries are often used, and recently most of the industries choose lithium - polymer systems. Many materials were tested for each part of the battery, anode, cathode and electrolyte. Our goal is to develop an organic polymeric material to be used as cathode. Two very important characteristics of a portable power supply are the energy storage / weight and energy storage / volume ratio, since the constant electronics evolution is leading to light circuits with very small dimensions. Conjugated conducting polymers has been widely studied for electronic uses, then we chose a low cost polyaniline derivative, poly(ortho-anisidine), because of its better chemical properties of solubility with respect to normal polyaniline. During the synthesis, titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles were added, since in our previous works was demonstrated that this procedure improved the storage characteristics of the material with respect to the pure polymer. To inspect the electrochemical properties of the material, cyclic voltammetry was performed by using directly the electrolytic cell with traditional lithium - polymer elements: lithium foil as anode, liquid electroyte (LP30, 1 M solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate: dimethyl carbonate 1:1) pregnating a soft and porous inert material. Intercalation of Li+ ion was studied basing on these voltammograms. Repetitive charge / discharge test were conducted in order to verify the long term cyclability of the realized dispositives, and after a 50 cycle analysis it was noticed that the 60% of the initial capacity was preserved. The investigated material showed good performance in low current experiments, both for the charge and the discharge process. Capacity values of the realized electrolytic cells tend to decrease as the flowing current increases.

However number of technical and scientific problems such as inadequate heat and mass transfers associated with thermochemical energy reactors remain to be overcome. In the past various studies such as integrated metal foam reaction bed system, impregnation of reactants in consolidated blocks of natural graphite and different configurations of reaction beds have been carried out but dynamic limitations of heat and mass transfers have been observed. Though the intrinsic chemical reaction of working materials must be good, the effectiveness of a thermochemical reactor largely depends on excellent rates of heat and mass transfers from the reactor to the external heat transfer fluid since most exothermic reactions are rapid and instantaneous. Fluidised beds are considered to be favourable for rapid exothermal reactions due to the large specific surface area available for reaction and short residences times for gas or solids. To this end, an agitated fluidised bed thermochemical reactor system has been proposed and investigated with the model results showing enhanced adsorption capacities and heat transfer rates during adsorption process. There is however the need to optimise the thermophysical parameters that affect the minimum fluidising velocity (mfv) in the adsorption column.

The capsules filled with PCM were placed in a rectangular tank. Water was used as the working fluid in the circulation system to discharge the storage tank. A one-dimensional model was used for solving the water temperature distribution along the flow direction in the tank and a conductive one-dimensional phase change model was used for simulating the solidification process of the PCM inside the capsules.

The baseline system comprises an array of 28 10-cell thermionic converters that convert heat directly into electricity. Heat is provided to the converters by a large inflatable concentrating reflector which is deployed after reaching orbit. The solar flux is concentrated further by a secondary concentrator and enters into a thermal receiver that houses the thermionic converters. Integral to each converter is a phase change material that stores energy during insolation to sustain converter operation during the eclipse. For cooling, each converter contains a heat pipe that moves the waste heat to small, high-temperature radiators for rejection. The thermionic system being designed is compact and has a high power density resulting in a low mass and stowed volume. In addition, the system lends itself to operation in the radiation environment encountered in the Van Allen radiation belts. Thermionic converters have been operated for years under substantial fast-neutron flux within nuclear reactors so there is an expectation that the thermionics and energy storage of this system will be able to operate without degradation in the high energy proton and electron environment present in medium earth orbits (MEO). This paper provides an overview of the current design effort and presents test results for some of the major system components.

An integral part of the flywheel unit is the three phase motor/generator that is used to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel. The motor/generator voltage is supplied from a pulse width modulated (PWM) inverter operating from a fixed DC voltage supply. The motor current is regulated through a closed loop current control that commands the necessary voltage from the inverter to achieve the desired current. The current regulation loop is the innermost control loop of the overall flywheel system and, as a result, must be fast and accurate over the entire operating speed range (20,000 RPM to 60,000 RPM) of the flywheel. The voltage applied to the motor is a high frequency PWM version of the DC bus voltage that results in the commanded fundamental value plus higher order harmonics. Most of the harmonic content is at the switching frequency and above. The higher order harmonics cause a rapid change in voltage to be applied to the motor that can result in large voltage stresses across the motor windings. In addition, the high frequency content in the motor causes sensor noise in the magnetic bearings that leads to disturbances for the bearing control. To alleviate these problems, a filter is used to present a more sinusoidal voltage to the motor/generator. However, the filter adds additional dynamics and phase lag to the motor system that can interfere with the performance of the current regulator. This paper will discuss the tuning methodology and results for the motor/generator current regulator and the impact of the filter on the control. Results at speeds up to 50,000 rpm are presented.",,"Computer simulation; Current density; Electric generators; Magnetic bearings; Mathematical models; Notch filters; Solid wastes; Spacecraft; Current regulations; Laplace operators; Phase lag; Rotor reference; Motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344395155

One research and development area has been the minimization of the switching noise produced by the pulsed width modulated (PWM) inverter that drives the flywheel permanent magnet motor/generator (PM M/G). This noise can interfere with the flywheel M/G hardware and the system avionics hampering the full speed performance of the flywheel system. One way to attenuate the inverter switching noise is by placing an AC filter at the three phase output terminals of the inverter with the filter neutral point connected to the DC link (DC bus) mid-point capacitors. The main benefit of using an AC filter in this fashion is the significant reduction of the inverter's high dv/dt switching and its harmonics components. Additionally, common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) voltages caused by the inverter's high dv/dt switching are also reduced. Several topologies of AC filters have been implemented and compared. One AC filter topology consists of a two-stage R-L-C low pass filter. The other topology consists of the same two-stage R-L-C low pass filter with a series connected trap filter (an inductor and capacitor connected in parallel). This paper presents the analysis, design and experimental results of these AC filter topologies and the comparison between the no filter case and conventional AC filter.",,"Current density; Electric generators; Flywheels; Mathematical models; Notch filters; Satellites; Solid wastes; Topology; AC filters; Current regulations; Switching modes; Switching noise; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344380966

The water in the tank is stored at atmospheric pressure and is heated with an electric resistance heater to about 75°C. The cold water at low pressure flows through a heat exchanger, which is immersed inside the water tank. Australian test standard AS1361 (1995) is used to compare the performance of six different designs that use different heat exchangers for improving the energy efficiency of the water heater. It explores the heat transfer characteristics of one of the heat exchanger designs (HX2) and presents the relative performance of the others. It presents actual designs tested under standard conditions. The test conditions were set to draw off hot water at a constant flow rate of 9 liters per minute until the outlet water temperature (from the heat exchanger) was at least 30°C warmer than the entering cold water or continuous ""draw off"" of warm water up to 7 minutes, whichever is less. The duration for this temperature drop illustrates the delivery capacity of a heat exchanger: the longer the time taken for the temperature drop, the more usable the hot water is delivered. The results could help the manufacturer develop a base for design of a cost-effective water heater with higher efficiency. ©2004 ASHRAE.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Heat exchangers; Performance; Water supply systems; Domestic storage water heaters; Flow rate; Heat exchanger coils; Water temperature; Water heaters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344374440

Flywheels offer high efficiency, durability, and near-complete discharge capabilities not produced by typical chemical batteries. These characteristics show flywheels to be an attractive alternative to the more typical energy storage solutions. Flywheels also offer the possibility of combining what are now two separate systems in space applications into one: energy storage, which is currently provided by batteries, and attitude control, which is currently provided by control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) or reaction wheels. To date, the NASA GRC research effort has produced the control algorithms necessary to demonstrate flywheel operation up to a rated speed of 60,000 RPM and the combined operation of two flywheel machines to simultaneously provide energy storage and single axis attitude control. Two position-sensorless algorithms are used to control the motor/generator, one for low (0 to 1200 RPM) speeds and one for high speeds. The algorithm allows the transition from the low speed method to the high speed method, but the transition from the high to low speed method was not originally included. This leads to a limitation in the existing motor/generator control code that does not allow the flywheels to be commanded to zero speed (and back in the ""negative"" speed direction) after the initial startup. In a multi-flywheel system providing both energy storage and attitude control to a spacecraft, speed reversal may be necessary.",,"Algorithms; Automation; Durability; Feedback; Flywheels; Gyroscopes; Spacecraft; Attitude control; Control momentum gyroscopes (CMG); Flywheel controllers; Flywheel enery storage systems; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20344368848

The G2 flywheel is a 60,000 RPM, 525 W-hr, 1kW system designed for a laboratory environment; it will be used for component testing and system demonstrations, with the goal of applying flywheels to aerospace energy storage and integrated power and attitude control (IPACS) applications. G2 has a modular design, which allows for new motors, magnetic bearings, touchdown bearings, and rotors to be installed without a complete redesign of the system. This design process involves several engineering disciplines, and requirements are developed for the speed, energy storage, power level, and operating environment. The G2 rotor system consists of a multilayer carbon fiber rim with a titanium hub on which the other components mount, and rotordynamics analysis is conducted to ensure rigid and flexible rotor modes are controllable or outside of the operating speed range. Magnetic bearings are sized using 1-D magnetic circuit analysis and refined using 3-D finite element analysis. The G2 magnetic bearing system was designed by Texas A&M and has redundancy which allows derated operation after the loss of some components, and an existing liquid cooled two pole permanent magnet motor/generator is used. The touchdown bearing system is designed with a squeeze film damper system allowing spin down from full operating speed in case of a magnetic bearing failure. The G2 module will enable module level demonstrations of component technology, and will be used be a key building block in system level attitude control and IPACS demonstrations.

A generalized wall function is applied in the nozzle exit wall region. The dispersion-relation- preserving scheme is applied for space discretization.

Coupled with positioning technologies like GPS, this opens up an exciting domain of location based services, allowing a mobile user to query for objects based on its current position. Main bottlenecks in such infrastructures are the draining of power of the mobile devices and the limited network bandwidth available. To alleviate these problems, broadcasting spatial information about relevant objects has been widely accepted as an efficient mechanism. An important class of queries for such an infrastructure is the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, in which users are interested in closest objects to their position. In this paper, we describe mechanisms to perform exact kNN search on conventional sequential-access R-trees, and optimize established kNN search algorithms. We also propose a novel use of histograms for guiding the search and derive analytical results on maximum queue size and node access count. In addition, we discuss the effects of different broadcast organizations on search performance and challenge the traditional use of Depth-First (df s) organization. We also extend our mechanisms to support kNN search with non-spatial constraints. While we demonstrate our ideas using a broadcast index, they are equally applicable to any kind of sequential access medium like tertiary tape storage. We validate our mechanisms through an extensive experimental analysis and present our findings.

Newer memories provide a structured way of storing data in multiple chips, with each chip having a bank of memory modules. Current memory-resident databases are yet to take full advantage of the banked storage system, which offers a lot of room for performance and energy optimizations. In this paper, we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory-resident databases, and propose hardware (memory-directed) and software (query-directed) schemes to reduce the energy consumption of queries executed on these databases. Our results show that high-level query-directed schemes (hosted in the query optimizer) better utilize the low-power modes in reducing the energy consumption than the respective hardware schemes (hosted in the memory controller), due to their complete knowledge of query access patterns. We extend this further and propose a query restructuring scheme and a multi-query optimization. Queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are clustered. This helps increase the inter-access idle times of memory modules, which in turn enables a more effective control of their energy behavior. This heuristic is eventually integrated with our hardware optimizations to achieve maximum savings. Our experimental results show that the memory energy reduces by 90% if query restructuring method is applied along with basic energy optimizations over the unoptimized version. The system-wide performance impact of each scheme is also studied simultaneously.

The mechanism is posttranscriptional and involves two cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. Under conditions of iron starvation, IRPs stabilize the transferrin receptor and inhibit the translation of ferritin mRNAs by binding to ""iron responsive elements"" (IREs) within their untranslated regions. The IRE/IRP system also controls the expression of additional IRE-containlng mRNAs, encoding proteins of iron and energy metabolism. The activities of IRP1 and IRP2 are regulated by distinct posttranslational mechanisms in response to cellular iron levels. Thus, in iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane iron-sulfur cluster, which prevents IRE binding, while IRP2 undergoes proteasomal degradation. IRP1 and IRP2 also respond, albeit differentially, to iron-independent signals, such as hydrogen peroxide, hypoxia, or nitric oxide. Basic principles of the IRE/IRP system and recent advances in understanding the regulation and the function of IRP1 and IRP2 are discussed.","Aconitase; DMT1; Ferritin; Ferroportin; Iron metabolism; Iron responsive elements; IRP1; IRP2; Oxidative stress; Transferrin receptor","aconitate hydratase; cytoplasm protein; ferritin; ferroportin 1; hydrogen peroxide; iron; iron regulatory protein 1; iron regulatory protein 2; iron sulfur protein; messenger RNA; natural resistance associated macrophage protein 2; nitric oxide; proteasome; protein IRE1; transferrin receptor; cell level; energy metabolism; genetic transcription; human; hypoxia; iron metabolism; iron responsive element; iron storage; iron transport; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein processing; regulatory mechanism; review; RNA translation; starvation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842608845

It was designed as a hot oil pipeline. In the mid 1990's, with decreasing of the crude throughput, the fuel consumption for pipelining per ton of crude increased dramatically. For reducing fuel consumption, the technology of pour-point-depressant (PPD) beneficiation was adopted. Great success was achieved. With a PPD dosage of 50 ppm and a beneficiating temperature of 60°C at the initial pumping station, the gel point of the crude was reduced by 16°C, and the viscosity at 25°C was reduced by 87%. As a result, the crude temperature at the inlet of the intermediate heating stations was lowered from 34°C to 27∓1°C. This resulted in annual 17200 tons of fuel oil saving. Thanks to improvement of the crude flow properties, running heating stations were reduced from twelve before using the PPD to only one(the initial station) in summer, seven in winter, and two to five in spring and autumn depending on ground temperature. This was the pipeline with the longest distance, the largest diameter, the largest throughput and the most running pumping stations in China that ever used the PPD-beneficiation technology. We believe that experiences gained from this pipeline and other pipelines operated by the SINOPEC Pipeline Transport and Storage Company will be helpful to safe and economical operation of hot waxy crude pipelines.

To meet the target of the long-term DOE volumetric (0.09 kg H2/kg) and energy density (3 kwh/kg) targets, further development and understanding of hydrogen storage materials will require substantial new research effort and the discovery of new hydrogen storage materials. Computational approaches were used to examine the thermodynamics of two potential hydrogen storage systems, NHxBHx and NHxAlHx (x = 1-4). Both materials could potentially meet the long-term DOE requirements for volumetric and energy density requirements with a potential of 0.24 kg H2/kg and 0.19 kg H2/kg, respectively. Theoretical calculations predicted that hydrogen loss is the thermodynamically favored pathway over B-N or Al-N bond scission. However, the loss of hydrogen from the NHxBHx series of compounds was less exothermic than the loss of hydrogen from the NHxAlHx series of compounds. This could be an important economic factor to consider for potential on-board or off-board recycle.

The possibility of using hydrogen to meet this growing energy need has rekindled interest in the study of safe, efficient, and economical storage of hydrogen. Unfortunately, the current methods for storing hydrogen as a compressed gas or liquid do not meet the industry requirements. An alternate method for hydrogen storage involves metal hydrides. A novel approach for hydrogen storage is to combine the favorable kinetics and thermodynamics of conventional metal hydrides with that of the large hydrogen storing capacity of organic molecules, e.g., CH4. Although alanates, with the chemical composition [Mn+ (AlH4)n-, M = Li, Na, K, Mg], belong to this class, the desorption temperature of hydrogen in these materials is rather high. It was recently discovered that doping of Ti-based catalyst in NaAlH4 can significantly lower the hydrogen desorption temperature. Using first principles calculations, a molecular level understanding of the role of titanium in lowering the hydrogen desorption temperature in NaAlH4 and LiBH4 was provided.

By adjusting the magnetic field to vary the amount of damping, the transmission can be switched between compliant and effectively rigid modes. Transmission compliance between an actuator and its load has several benefits; It enables (1) storage of elastic energy to improve efficiency, (2) filtering of shocks acting on the load that would otherwise be transmitted to the actuator, and (3) facilitation of force control by converting it to a position control problem. Despite these benefits, the design objective for most robotic systems remains to minimize transmission compliance to improve transmission bandwidth, improving the ability to control the position of the load with high precision. With the new transmission presented in this paper, compliance becomes a tunable quantity allowing joint stiffness to be optimized based upon the task requirements.

They thus offer potential for the cheap production of submicron grained materials, in a bulk form. After processing severely deformed materials do not have conventional, idealized, grain structures, contain significant fractions of low angle boundaries, and are often heterogeneous. Due to their high stored energy, they are unstable on annealing and in most cases can be thought of as continuously recrystallizing. However, locally discontinuous behaviors are often observed, due to the retained less mobile low angle boundaries, as well as abnormal grain growth at elevated temperatures.

Furthermore, as an alternative to using high-threshold devices to reduce the bitline leakage through access transistors in drowsy caches, we propose a gated bitline precharge technique. A single threshold process is now sufficient. The gated precharge employs a simple but effective predictor that almost completely hides any performance loss incurred by the transitions between sub-banks.

Memory structures such as caches, Branch Target Buffers (BTBs), and register files occupy significant area in contemporary SoC designs and are the main contributors to system leakage power dissipation. Existing models for leakage power estimation in array structures typically use coefficients derived from elaborate SPICE simulations. However, these methodologies are not applicable to array designs in a newer technology, that require power estimates early in the design cycle. In this paper, we propose analytical models for array structures that are based only on high level design parameters. Assuming typical circuit implementation styles, we identify the transistors that contribute to the leakage power in each array sub-circuit and develop models as a function of the operation (read/write/idle) on the array and organizational parameters of the array. The developed models are validated by comparing their estimates against the leakage power measured using SPICE simulations on industrial array designs belonging to the e5001 processor core. The comparison shows that the models are accurate with an error margin of less than 21.5% and thus can be used in high-level power-performance exploration. Interestingly, in array designs with dual threshold voltage technology, we observed that contrary to the general expectation, the array memory core contributes to just 9% and the address decoder contributes to as much as 62% of the total leakage power.","Estimation; Leakage power; Srams","Capacitance; Computer architecture; Energy efficiency; Estimation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Threshold voltage; Combinational logic; Leakage power; Memory array structures; Power dissipation; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244408347

This paper presents an interrupt-emulation mechanism for flash-memory storage systems with an energy-efficient management strategy.

This decentralized on-chip memory architecture uses multiple SRAMs to provide high intra-processor bandwidth. Each SRAM has an associated stream address generator capable of implementing a variety of addressing modes in conjunction with a shared loop accelerator. The architecture is extremely useful for generating application specific embedded processors, particularly for processing input data which is organized as a stream.

Moreover, there exists a large potential for optimizing the energy consumption of the memory subsystem. Consequently, novel memories as well as novel algorithms for their efficient utilization are being designed. Scratchpads are known to perform better than caches in terms of power, performance, area and predictability. However, unlike caches they depend upon software allocation techniques for their utilization. In this paper, we present an allocation technique which analyzes the application and inserts instructions to dynamically copy both code segments and variables onto the scratchpad at runtime. We demonstrate that the problem of dynamically overlaying scratchpad is an extension of the Global Register Allocation problem. The overlay problem is solved optimally using ILP formulation techniques. Our approach improves upon the only previously known allocation technique for statically allocating both variables and code segments onto the scratchpad. Experiments report an average reduction of 34% and 18% in the energy consumption and the runtime of the applications, respectively. A minimal increase in code size is also reported.","Dynamic allocation; Overlay; Scratchpad","Buffer storage; Computational complexity; Encoding (symbols); Energy utilization; Optimization; Performance; Resource allocation; Dynamic allocation; Overlay; Predictability; Scratchpad; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244399220

In particular, the use of energy consuming memory, SDRAM, has become burdensome in battery-powered embedded systems. Intuitively, though demand paging can be used to mitigate the increasing requirement of main memory size, its applicability should be deliberately elaborated since NAND flash memory has asymmetric operation characteristics in terms of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present energy-aware demand paging technique to lower the energy consumption of embedded systems considering the characteristics of interactive embedded applications with large memory footprints. We also propose a flash memory-aware page replacement policy that can reduce the number of write and erase operations in NAND flash memory. With real-life workloads, we show the systemwide Energy Delay can be reduced by 15∼30% compared to the traditional shadowing architecture.","Demand paging; Embedded storages; Embedded systems; Flash memory; NAND; Page replacement; Virtual memory","Algorithms; Data transfer; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; NAND circuits; Space division multiple access; Demand paging; Embedded storages; NAND flash memory; Page replacement; Virtual memory; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244398863

One of the solutions to this problem involves the use of a microarchitecture based on an Execution Cache (EC) whose role is to cache already done work for later reuse. In this paper, we explore the design space for such a microarchitecture, looking at how the cache size, associativity and replacement algorithm affect the overall performance and power efficiency. We also look at the scalability of this solution across next process generations, evaluating the energy efficiency of such caching mechanisms in the presence of increasing leakage power. Over a spectrum of SPEC2000 benchmarks, an average of 35% energy reduction is achieved for technologies ranging from 130nm to 90nm and 65nm, at the expense of a negligible performance hit.","Design; Measurement; Performance","Buffer storage; Decoding; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Microprocessor chips; Scheduling; Transistors; Leakage power; Microarchitecture; Power consumption; Power efficiency; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244390533

This work presents a design space exploration of potential memory system architectures. A range of low-power memory organizations are considered, from conventional caching to more advanced system-on-chip implementations. We find that, given architectures able to exploit concurrency in this domain, large L2 based cache hierarchies and high bandwidth memory systems employing data stream partitioning and on-chip embedded DRAM and ROM technologies can provide much of the performance of idealized memory systems without violating the power constraints of the low-power domain.","Performance Design","Application specific integrated circuits; Bandwidth; Computer architecture; Concurrency control; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Input output programs; Real time systems; Speech recognition; Chip multiprocessor (CMP); Data stream partitioning; Design space exploration; Multithreading (MT); Systems analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244390011

However, most DVS schemes scale the clock frequency of the supply-voltage-clock-scalable (SVCS) CPU only and do not address the energy consumption of the memory. The memory is generally non-supply-voltage-scalable (NSVS), but its energy consumption is variable to its clock frequency and the total execution time. Thus, DVS for an SVCS CPU cannot achieve an optimal system-wide energy saving without consideration of the memory, as far as it is controlled by an SVCS CPU. We introduce an energy-optimal frequency assignment, for both an SVCS CPU and a synchronous NSVS memory, which optimizes the system-wide energy consumption. We derive the energy-optimal clock frequencies for an SVCS CPU and a synchronous NSVS memory, as a function of the number of processor clock cycles, the number of memory accesses and the hardware energy model. Our technique modifies the frequency assignment of the CPU and the memory used in previous DVS schemes, which ignore the memory energy. It enables the system-wide energy-optimal settings and achieves additional 50% energy reduction over previous DVS schemes. This technique can also be applicable to synchronous NSVS peripheral devices.","Low power; Memory system; SDRAM","CMOS integrated circuits; Electric potential; Energy utilization; Logic devices; Mathematical models; Optimization; Problem solving; Space division multiple access; Theorem proving; Dynamic supply voltage scaling (DVS); Low power; Memory system; Supply-voltage-clock-scalable (SVCS); Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244385916

We have developed a new cache architecture, called a way-halting cache, that reduces energy while imposing no performance overhead. Our way-halting cache is a four-way set-associative cache that stores the four lowest-order bits of all ways' tags into a fully associative memory, which we call the halt tag array. The lookup in the halt tag array is done in parallel with, and is no slower than, the set-index decoding. The halt tag array pre-determines which tags cannot match due to their low-order four bits mismatching. Further accesses to ways with known mismatching tags are then halted, thus saving power. Our halt tag array has an additional feature of using static logic only, rather than dynamic logic used in highly associative caches. We provide data from experiments on 17 benchmarks drawn from MediaBench and Spec 2000, based on our layouts in 0.18 micron CMOS technology. On average, 55% savings of memory-access related energy were obtained over a conventional four-way set-associative cache. We show that energy savings are greater than previous methods, and nearly twice that of highly-associative caches, while imposing no performance overhead and only 2% cache area overhead.","Cache design; Low power techniques","Benchmarking; CMOS integrated circuits; Decoding; Digital circuits; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Power electronics; Static random access storage; Cache design; Low power techniques; Power consumption; Way-halting cache; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244363688

Each time a vehicle stops, its kinetic energy is dissipated as heat. Fuel is then used to accelerate the vehicle again. A flywheel energy storage device that stores the braking energy and then reuses it for acceleration has the potential to improve fuel economy and reduce pollution. It is important to evaluate the application of this technology in transit buses to assess better any need for increased development. A three-step computer simulation is used to evaluate the reduced emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in a flywheel-equipped bus. First, drive cycles over which buses operate are specified. Second, because flywheel energy storage reduces the effects of acceleration and deceleration to the engine, the emissions models (which are sensitive to acceleration and deceleration modes) are identified and selected. Finally, emissions are computed and compared with emissions for a bus without a flywheel. Results indicate conceptually that the flywheel application reduces acceleration effects, which in turn significantly reduce emissions. It is therefore strongly recommended that the flywheel energy storage device be further researched for transportation applications.",,"Acceleration; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Electronic equipment; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuel consumption; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Rapid transit; Electronic storage devices; Emission models; Mobile source emission factor models; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Buses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15544364895

The assessment covered both summer and winter (heating) performance. The main objective was to evaluate overall performance of these systems in terms of thermal comfort and energy use and to compare the findings with more conventional servicing options for the same building. The study demonstrates that active FES can enhance thermal comfort while reducing energy use and emissions. In comparison with conventionally and naturally ventilated systems, the studied FES systems reduced temperature excess hours and peak temperatures, supplied cooler air as a result of overnight cooling, and reduced chiller consumption and boiler ratings as well as emissions. The annual operating costs of these active FES systems increase energy costs by only 13% over that of the naturally ventilated option. The mixed-mode solutions reduce them by over 35% when compared with ail-mechanically cooled alternatives.","Air-conditioning; Conventional cooling; Dynamic thermal simulation; Fabric energy storage; Mechanical ventilation; Natural ventilation; Office buildings; Steel-framed buildings","Conventional cooling systems; Dynamic thermal simulation; Fabric energy storage; Mechanical ventilation; Steel framed buildings; Air conditioning; Computer simulation; Cooling systems; Costs; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Structural frames; Thermal effects; Ventilation; Office buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542712828

For the hydrocarbons (petroleum and gas), these goals relate to the reduction in the consumption of energy, notably in the area of engines, by the progressive replacement of fossil fuels, rich in carbon, by energies, fossil or not, of a lesser content of carbon, and also by the capture and sequestration of CO2. Well known nationally and internationally and having the required key competencies all along the petroleum chain, the IFP intervenes in these three areas. In the area of transportation, the manufacturers have engaged themselves to reduce CO2 emissions to 140 g/km in 2008 and perhaps to 120 g/km in 2012. The difficulty consists of reconciling the increase in efficiency with the increasingly severe specifications relating to the reduction of regulated pollutant emissions. IFP works on optimizing engine design, ignition and diesel, new combustion modes, homogeneous combustion that is expected to reconcile high engine combustion efficiencies with the very low emissions of pollutants. With respect to alternative fuels, the paths that seem to be the most interesting are CNG, bio fuels, and in the long term, hydrogen, even if the obstacles to its use in transportation are now considerable.

A definition of a dissipative dynamical system is introduced in which the storage function does not need to be observable from the variables that enter into the supply rate. It is shown that a controllable system is dissipative if and only if it has an observable storage function, but that there are uncontrollable dissipative systems that do not have an observable storage function. Finally, we argue that unobservable storage functions are indispensable: they occur in physical systems, for example in electrical circuits and in Maxwell's equations.","Behavioral systems; Controllability; Dissipative systems; Observability; Storage functions; Unobservable storage functions","Energy conservation; Large scale systems; Maxwell equations; Observability; Partial differential equations; Signal processing; Vectors; Behavioral systems; Dissipative systems; Flux density; Unobservable storage functions; Controllability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14344260901

In analyzing these large-scale systems, it is often desirable to treat the overall system as a collection of interconnected subsystems. Solution properties of the large-scale system are then deduced from the solution properties of the individual subsystems and the nature of the system interconnections. In this paper we develop an analysis framework for large-scale dynamical systems based on vector dissipativity notions. Specifically, using vector storage functions and vector supply rates, dissipativity properties of the composite large-scale system are shown to be determined from the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and their interconnections. Furthermore, extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions, in terms of the subsystem dynamics and interconnection constraints, characterizing vector dissipativeness via vector system storage functions are derived. Finally, these results are used to develop feedback interconnection stability results for large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems using vector Lyapunov functions.",,"Electric power systems; Energy transfer; Large scale systems; Lyapunov methods; Matrix algebra; Thermodynamics; Vectors; Lyapunov functions; Storage functions; System interconnections; Vector dissipativity theory; Nonlinear systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14244251295

The translational spring element has the additional requirement that, similar to a slider, it resists off-axis loads sufficiently to permit translation along only one axis. Geometric and energy storage parameters have been determined by optimization for five classes of mechanisms. The results of the optimization are values for geometric and energy storage parameters for each mechanism class for various levels of the translational spring parameter and various levels of constant-force behavior. The new configurations experience decreasing performance with increasing translational spring stiffness. The potential to implement a translational spring that also acts as a slider link provides the motivation for the new configurations. Such a spring would have the potential to completely remove friction from the mechanism and provide a constant-force solution that could replace current solutions such as hydraulic or pneumatic devices. The new configurations also have the potential to be manufactured as one piece or in layers, opening up new arenas for compressive constant-force mechanisms.

One disadvantage however is the fact that motion of the mechanism is associated with elastic energy storage in the compliant parts. This is a problem especially in cases where accurate force transmission is of primary concern, such as in medical graspers. A solution to this problem is to statically balance the elastic forces by the addition of a spring force compensation mechanism, such that the effect of the compliance is neutralized. The complete resulting mechanisms resulting from this concept are called statically balanced compliant mechanisms (SBCMs). This paper presents a feasibility study into the design of a grasper for medical purposes and demonstrates that the concept is possible and practically viable. It is shown that the compliant gripper of a laparoscopic forceps can be statically balanced with a single-piece compliant compensation mechanism, with a balancing error of only 0.03N while dimensions are such that the compensation part of the mechanism can be stored inside the hand grip of the instrument.","Compliant mechanism; Laparoscopic instrument; Minimally invasive surgery; Static balancing","Bending (deformation); Elastic moduli; Endoscopy; Error compensation; Force control; Grippers; Mechanical engineering; Stiffness; Compliant mechanism; Laparoscopic instrument; Minimally invasive surgery; Static balancing; Biomedical equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14044278253

Thus, power is only needed to move among the stable states, and each stable configuration represents a level of adaptability. Since stable equilibrium configurations can be defined by potential energy minima, we base the design of MSE systems on shaping the potential energy curve at desired equilibrium configurations. This view allows one to construct a performance space defined by how well candidate systems meet a desired potential energy curve. By using a Monte Carlo mapping to link the performance space to the design space in tandem with stochastic optimization methods, the designer determines whether or not a certain system topology can be designed as a MSE system. Qualitative and quantitative mapping procedures enable the designer to decide whether or not the desired design lies near the center or periphery of a performance space. This dictates how the optimization is to be executed which in turn informs the designer as to whether or not a feasible limit in the system performance has indeed been reached.","Design methodology; Equilibrium; Multistable; Nonlinear systems","Adaptive systems; Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Constraint theory; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Kinematics; Mapping; Microelectromechanical devices; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Potential energy; Design methodology; Equilibrium; Monte Carlo mapping; Multistable systems; Nonlinear systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14044261740

The characteristics that metal hydride generates heat at absorption process and absorbs heat at desorption process is useful for new air conditioning system without chloro-fluorocarbon(CFC). The trial system is composed of two heat storage vessels of a ""shell and tube type"" heat exchanger with heat transfer fins and filled with MH and a compressor equipped for hydrogen transfer. The system proposed in this paper is simple because the heat storage vessel has two functions of heat source and heat storage, and suitable for environment because of no usage of CFC. The purpose of heat storage is to decrease the difference of the electric power demand at daytime and that at night. That is to say, the effective heat storage system consumes electric power at night and requires no power at daytime. In the innovative heat storage system with metal hydride, the hydrogen is transferred using electric power at night and transferred in reverse only by the pressure difference between two heat storage vessels at daytime. The trial system was operated at actual loading condition, and the performance of the MH heat storage system was evaluated. As the experimental result, heat storage finishes in a limited time, and heat quantity for cooling was 13.5MJ, which was sufficient for the heat capacity to cool the 10m 2 room for 3 hours.

Water returning to the hot water storage tank is heated by the solar array when solar energy is available. This new approach, as opposed to the more conventional approach of preheating incoming water, is made possible by the thermal diode effect of heat pipes and low heat loss from evacuated tube solar collectors. The simplicity of this approach and its low installation costs makes the deployment of solar energy in existing commercial buildings more attractive, especially where the roof is far removed from the water heating system, which is often in the basement. Initial observed performance of the system is reported. Hourly simulation estimates annual energy delivery of 111 GJ/year of solar heat and that the annual efficiency (based on the 54 m2 gross area) of the solar collectors is 41%, and that of the entire system including parasitic pump power, heat loss due to freeze protection, and heat loss from connecting piping is 34%.

The page miss ratio curve(MRC), i.e. page miss rate vs. memory size curve, is a good performance-directed metric to serve this purpose. However, dynamically tracking MRC at run time is challenging in systems with virtual memory because not every memory reference passes through the operating system (OS). This paper proposes two methods to dynamically track MRC of applications at run time. The first method is using a hardware MRC monitor that can track MRC at fine time granularity. Our simulation results show that this monitor has negligible performance and energy overheads. The second method is an OS-only implementation that can track MRC at coarse time granularity. Our implementation results on Linux show that it adds only 7-10% overhead. We have also used the dynamic MRC to guide both memory allocation for multiprogramming systems and memory energy management. Our real system experiments on Linux with applications including Apache Web Server show that the MRC-directed memory allocation can speed up the applications' execution/response time by up to a factor of 5.86 and reduce the number of page faults by up to 63.1%. Our execution-driven simulation results with SPEC2000 benchmarks show that the MRC-directed memory energy management can improve the Energy * Delay metric by 27-58% over previously proposed static and dynamic schemes.","Memory management; Power management; Resource allocation","Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Computer simulation; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Multiprogramming; Optimization; Resource allocation; Simulators; Computer Operating System - Linux; Memory management; Power management; Program execution; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844271066

Consequently various proposals have been made which provide incentives for individual users of an ad hoc mobile network to cooperate with each other. In this paper we examine this problem and analyse the drawbacks of currently proposed incentive systems. We then argue that there may not be a need for incentive systems at all, especially in the early stages of adoption, where excessive complexity can only hurt the deployment of ad hoc networks. We look at the needs of different customer segments at each stage of the technological adoption cycle and propose that incentive systems should not be used until ad hoc networks enter mainstream markets. Even then, incentive systems should be tailored to the needs of each individual application rather than adopting a generalised approach that may be flawed or too technically demanding to be implemented in reality.","Cooperation; Incentives; Mobile ad hoc networks","Bandwidth; Computational complexity; Computer hardware; Design; Energy dissipation; Performance; Real time systems; Self organizing storage; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication traffic; Theory; Ad hoc networks; Incentives; Network capability; Relaying functions; Mobile telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244351729

Recent developments in diagnostic techniques enable operators to identify near-wellbore damage and apply a tailored treatment to reverse the deliverability decline. In a Sayre, Oklahoma gas-storage field, gas deliverability was improved 32.5% in 14 wells, using pretreatment damage diagnostic analysis to remove near-wellbore damage with new coiled-tubing- conveyed fluid-oscillation treatments. A fluid-oscillating tool (FOT) is key to the damage-removal technology. The FOT sends out alternating bursts of fluid to create pulsating pressure waves within the wellbore and formation fluids. These pressure waves help break up near-wellbore damage and restore effective permeability by carrying the fluid past the wellbore into the formation. These oscillating pressure waves are not affected by standoff, which is common with conventional jetting or velocity tools. Kinetic energy in the pressure pulse travels through the wellbore fluid with no appreciable energy loss. The pressure waves expand spherically, providing 360° coverage as the tool is moved through the interval. As damage is removed, the waves penetrate deeper into the formation. This paper presents a technical description of the processes incorporated to remediate damage in the Sayre field and the technology used in the oscillation treatments. A case study from West Virginia is also presented.

The combination of incremental methane produced and possible tax incentives might compensate for the costs associated with CO 2 injection. Currently the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is co-funding a pilot CO2 sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) project in the Appalachian Basin, in a thin coal seam. Horizontal wells have been drilled in the seam to increase CO2 injectivity and methane production rate. Previously, the reservoir simulations we performed for the planned pilot pattern indicated an optimum length for the horizontal injectors to maximize methane recovery and CO2 storage. By varying operational parameters such as time of primary production, injector length, injection pressure, injection timing, and production well pressure, we can evaluate different production alternatives to determine possible tradeoffs between optimum recovery of methane and CO2 sequestration, as defined by the amounts of the gases injected or produced. The economics of an ECMB/sequestration project using horizontal wells are sensitive to the design parameters. In commercial practice it is necessary to select a design that maximizes the economic return. In the work presented here, net present value (NPV) was used to optimize the economics of the project. The evaluation used actual design parameters, current costs to equip the field for CO2 injection, and operating costs in the actual price range of ongoing projects: coalbed methane (CBM) and CO2 enhanced oil recovery. Methane recovery and CO2 injection data were obtained from our reservoir simulations. The economic impact of tax incentives was also considered in the analysis. The analysis demonstrates the significance of reservoir size, proper design and implementation, and tax incentives for economic viability of projects for enhanced coalbed methane production and coalseam sequestration.",,"Carbon dioxide; Industrial economics; Methane; Oil wells; Parameter estimation; Pressure effects; Project management; Structural design; Anthropogenic gas; Cost operations; Enhanced oil recovery (EOR); Sequestration; Coal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244302710

The on-chip workload signifies the CPU clock cycles that are required to execute instructions in the CPU whereas the off-chip workload captures the number of external memory access clock cycles that are required to perform external memory transactions. When combined with a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to minimize the energy consumption, this workload decomposition method results in higher energy savings. The workload decomposition itself is performed at run time based on statistics reported by a performance monitoring unit (PMU) without a need for application profiling or compiler support. We have implemented the proposed DVFS with workload decomposition technique on the BitsyX platform, an Intel PXA255-based platform manufactured by ADS Inc., and performed detailed energy measurements. These measurements show that, for a number of widely used software applications, a CPU energy saving of 80% can be achieved for memory-bound programs while satisfying the user-specified timing constraints.","Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Workload decomposition","Computer software; Constraint theory; Data storage equipment; Electric potential; Energy utilization; Frequencies; Program compilers; Clock cycles; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Timing constraint; Workload decomposition; Computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144352494

A finite element model is developed that couples a lumped thermodynamic formulation for the vapor region with a complete solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the flow and temperature fields in the liquid. Numerical results show that buoyancy effects are strong, even in microgravity, and can reposition a vapor bubble that is initially at the center of the tank to a region near the tank wall in a relatively short time. Long-term tank pressurization with the vapor bubble at the tank wall shows that after an initial transient lasting about a week, the final rate of pressure increase agrees with a purely thermodynamic analysis of the entire tank. However, the final pressure levels are quite different from thermodynamic predictions. Numerical results also show that there is significant thermal stratification in the liquid due to the effects of natural convection. A subcooled jet is used to provide simultaneous cooling and mixing in order to bring the tank pressure back down to its initial value. Three different jet speeds are examined. Although the lowest jet speed is ineffective at controlling the pressure because of insufficient penetration into the liquid region, the highest jet speed is shown to be quite effective at disrupting thermal stratification and reducing the tank pressure in reasonable time.","Computational fluid dynamics; Microgravity; Pressure control; Propellant tanks; Space cryogenic tanks; Two-phase storage","hydrogen; propellant; conference paper; cooling; liquid; mathematical computing; mathematical model; microgravity; pressure; storage; stratification; tank; temperature; thermodynamics; vapor; velocity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844242774

Reactor designers successfully rose to these challenges. After years of successful use of the CO2 gas cooled reactors in Europe, the succeeding generation of reactors, called the High Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGR), were designed with Helium gas as the coolant. Again, in the 21st century, with the latest reactor designs under investigation in Generation IV, there is a revived interest in developing Gas Cooled Fast Reactors that use CO2 as the reactor coolant. This paper provides a historical perspective on the 52 CO2 reactors and the reactor programs that developed them.

Compared to a conventional bio-energy cogeneration system, CO2 removal reduces net plant efficiency by 11 to 16 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity by approximately 54 to 89%. The scheme applying reforming and shift reaction and physical absorption of the syngas fuel appears the most appealing option for the short-term implementation of CO2 sequestration bio-energy cogeneration systems. The Graz-Cycle where the syngas is burnt in pure oxygen appears the most appealing option for the long-term option for CO2 sequestration.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Computer software; Costs; Electricity; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Thermodynamics; Bio-energy systems; Ecological evaluation; Shift reactions; Syngas fuels; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10344260178

Sci./T., Japan","A concept of new steam system for hydrogen energy storage application is presented in this paper. Its special, dual-path configuration enables operation in two basic modes. During the nighttime demand trough, one-source mode can be used and the system can be operated as a conventional water-steam cycle. During the daytime demand peak, a second, high-quality heat source in the form of hydrogen-oxygen combustion can be introduced, increasing the system output and efficiency. This concept seems to solve the two most serious problems of hydrogen turbine systems, which are the fuel cost and the requirement of continuous operation. Initial calculations for the proposed system combined with an advanced gas turbine confirmed that a remarkable performance is obtainable under manageable conditions. In one-source mode of operation, the performance corresponds to that of the newest advanced combined cycles, while in two-source mode the overall output is doubled, the electric efficiency exceeds 59% HHV (67% LHV), and the efficiency for heat supplied by hydrogen into the increment of output exceeds 62% HHV (73% LHV). An example of hydrogen energy storage cycle is also discussed in the paper.","Combined cycle; Energy storage; Hydrogen turbine","Combustion; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Potential energy; Power generation; Water power; Combined cycle; Dual-mode operation; Hydrogen turbine; Hydrogen-oxygen combustion; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244255194

Consultant","The proposed novel compressed air energy storage (CAES) concept is based on the utilization of capacity reserves of combustion turbine (CT) and combined cycle (CC) plants for the peak power generation, instead of development of highly customized and expensive turbo-machinery trains. These power reserves are particularly high during high ambient temperatures that correspond to typical summer peak power requirements. The stored compressed air will be injected into the CT after the compressor diffuser to supplement the reduced (due to high ambient temperature or altitudes) mass flow, through the turbine to the full potential (typically achieved at low ambient temperatures). The alternative concept, with stored compressed air, is humidification before injection into the CT, this reduces the auxiliary compressor size, the storage volume and associated costs. Power increase of up to 25% can be realized, coincidental with that which is typical for a CAES plant, significant reduction in the heat rate and emissions. The novel CAES concept reduces specific plant costs by a factor of two, which makes it particularly effective for integration with renewable energy sources, like wind energy plants and landfill gas (LFG) plants. The paper also presents an alternative small capacity CAES plant, which is based on using smaller man-made storage facilities (high pressure pipes and/or vessels), either underground or above ground that can be readily constructed at CT sites without specific geological requirements. The latter part of this paper specifically concentrates on integration of CAES with wind and landfill gas (LFG) plants.",,"Efficiency; Electric loads; Electric power generation; Gas turbine power plants; Gas turbines; Land fill; Turbomachinery; Combustion turbines (CT); Landfill gas (LFG) plants; Profitability; Thermal cycles; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244222813

When a polymer is cooled in normal process from the melt, rapid decrease in the molecular mobility takes place, which results in a sudden decrease in viscosity and modulus as the transition temperature is approached. The polymer molecules will not be able to reach equilibrium in the given time frame of cooling and they will be frozen in higher state of energy and volume corresponding to the equilibrium state. In this review an attempt has been made to explain the origin of the non-equilibrium behaviour, free volume concept and the glass transition phenomenon. The change that takes place during this volume relaxation is emphasised in brief. Amorphous polymers undergo volume and enthalpy relaxations during their storage below Tg due to non-equilibrium nature. This is purely a thermodynamic behaviour. The physical characteristic of polymer polymer that is of prime importance in volume relaxation is its free volume, the higher the free volume the greater the potential to relax. The volume relaxation results in densification of non-crystalline phase and no crystallisation takes place during this phenomenon. The physical thermal and mechanical behaviour of the amorphous polymer undergoes considerable change during volume relaxation.",,"crystallinity; mechanical property; molecular structure; polymer; polymer property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842322758

Magnesium was the main impurity, although it is present only as traces in synthesised Ca-P powders, it concentrates on the surface of the ceramic during the sintering process due to its poor solubility in HA. Carbon pollution is common on all materials and generally assigned to the adsorption of atmospheric volatile organic compounds, although other types of pollution may occur. These surface species alter the surface energy of the ceramics which has been shown to be related to cell adhesion, The change in surface composition and physical properties can interfere with the sintering process as well as with the biological behaviour of the ceramics and a special effort should be made to control these events at all levels from processing to handling, storage and packaging.","Apatite; Surface energy; Tri-calcium phosphate; XPS","Adhesion; Adsorption; Composition; Hydroxyapatite; Interfacial energy; Sintering; Stoichiometry; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Cell response; Surface area; Ceramic materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346255199
