However, most of the existing distributed methods rely on locating systems, which consume more energy, and assume that sensors are uniformly distributed, which is clearly not applicable for the scenarios with nonuniform sensor distribution. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a big data storage and retrieval algorithm for WSNs with nonuniform node distribution, which aims at estimating the real distribution and the addresses of sensor nodes. In particular, we consider the data redundancy among neighbor nodes in the proposed algorithm and exploit a simple routing based on the algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other approaches in terms of data querying efficiency and data loss rate. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","big data; data storage and retrieval; nonuniform distribution; wireless sensor networks","Big data; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Data storage; Distributed methods; Non-uniform distribution; Non-uniform node distributions; Real distribution; Sensor distributions; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983154282

The novel properties of nanostructured carbon nanotubes such as high surface area, good stiffness, and resilience have been explored in many engineering applications. Research on carbon nanotubes have shown the application in the field of energy storage, hydrogen storage, electrochemical supercapacitor, field-emitting devices, transistors, nanoprobes and sensors, composite material, templates, etc. For commercial applications, large quantities and high purity of carbon nanotubes are needed. Different types of carbon nanotubes can be synthesized in various ways. The most common techniques currently practiced are arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition and flame synthesis. The purification of CNTs is carried out using various techniques mainly oxidation, acid treatment, annealing, sonication, filtering chemical functionalization, etc. However, high-purity purification techniques still have to be developed.

However, more than 90% of the society uses biomass as a main source of energy for cooking due to lack of technologies to convert this energy. Replacing these cooking activities by using renewable energy resources decreases pollution and reduces deforestation significantly. Using the solar energy in day time has no problem. For night time however, the system needs some kind of back-up system to make the daytime solar energy available. This back-up should have high-density energy storage and constant working temperature to perform a specific application. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCM) is one way of storing thermal energy. In the current study, a latent heat storage that uses a PCM material is used to store the solar energy aimed at utilizing solar energy for cooking Injera, main staple bread in Ethiopia. The PCM is a mixture of 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3 that are known as solar salts. The storage has a welded parallel aluminum fins with a gap of 40 mm in between to enhance the thermal conductivity during the charging-discharging process of the storage. The fins are extruded outside of the storage container to enable a side charging technique for the PCM. A prototype was developed with a solar salt of 17.5 kg and is tested for charging-discharging. The numerical simulation done on ANSYS and experimental results show an agreement and the system registered a 41.6% efficiency.",,"Deforestation; Energy resources; Engineering research; Fins (heat exchange); Heat storage; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Thermal conductivity; Thermal processing (foods); Back-up systems; Charging techniques; Discharging process; Experimental investigations; High density energy; Source of energy; Storage container; Working temperatures; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960194544

Two types of data determine ATES suitability, and their combination with a 3rd identifies potential hot-spots in the world: 1) geo-hydrological conditions, 2) current and projected climate classification and 3) urbanization. Our method combines the data into an ATES-suitability score as explained in this paper. On the one hand the results confirm the suitability for ATES where it is already applied and on the other they identify places where the technology is or will become suitable. About 15% of urban population lived in areas with high potential for ATES at the start of the 21st century, but this figure will decrease to about 5% during the 21st century as a consequence of expected climate change. Around 50% of urban population currently lives in areas of medium ATES suitability, a percentage that will remain constant. Demand for ATES is likely to exceed available subsurface space in a significant part of the urban areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); World potential for ATES","Aquifers; Digital storage; Heat storage; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Aquifer thermal energy storage; Climatic conditions; Heating and cooling; High potential; Hydrological condition; Stimulation measure; Urban population; World potential for ATES; Climate change; ground water; aquifer; carbon emission; climate change; climate classification; climate conditions; emission control; hydrology; thermal power; aquifer; Article; Belgium; carbon footprint; climate; climatic precondition; environmental parameters; geo hydrological precondition; geothermal energy; Germany; mathematical analysis; Netherlands; priority journal; Spain; United Kingdom; urban area; urbanization; validation study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940121979

The aim of developing the MSRF analysis framework is two-fold; deep understanding of the EAF characteristics, and fast and accurate generation of reference signals to the controllers of the advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters (APF), synchronous static compensators (STATCOM), energy storage systems (ESS), and etc., which may successfully compensate interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker. Online characterization of interharmonics and harmonics by MSRF analysis utilizes continuously measured line currents and line voltages on the medium voltage side of the EAF transformer at a sampling rate of 25.6 kHz per data channel. It has been shown by off-line computations that compensation of the sequence components of interharmonics and harmonics of the EAF currents obtained by the proposed framework, reduces the short term flicker values at the point of common coupling by up to ten fold. The proposed MSRF analysis framework has been successfully verified by comparing the frequency spectrums of the EAF currents with Fourier analysis results based on one-cycle sliding windows of 10-cycle duration. © 2015 IEEE.","Electric arc furnace (EAF); harmonics; interharmonics; multiple synchronous reference frame (MSRF); power quality (PQ)","Digital storage; Electric arcs; Electric energy storage; Electric furnace process; Fourier analysis; Furnaces; Harmonic analysis; Particulate emissions; Static synchronous compensators; Alternating current electric arc furnaces; Asymmetrical three phase; Electric arc furnace; harmonics; Inter-harmonics; Negative sequence components; Point of common coupling; Synchronous reference frame; Electric furnaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957667343

Biosensors, constituting the BANs, collect highly sensitive medical information from their hosts and communicate these data. Considering the nature of the wireless medium, the privacy requirements of the individuals and the extreme energy and storage limitations of the biosensors, BANs require a light-weight and secure key management infrastructure. It has been suggested that the security of a BAN can be guaranteed using the body itself as the communication channel by means of bio-cryptography. Explicitly, physiological parameters generated from different body parts are used to protect the data exchanged among the biosensors. In this paper, we (i) define a novel physiological parameter generation technique, and (ii) identify and evaluate an appropriate physiological parameter that can be used in a bio-cryptographic key management protocol, namely the inter-pulse interval (IPI).

In large scale industrial fabrication, easy, continuous and steady state methods are need to be performed. The main purpose of this study was to prepare leakage-free, thermally stable nanocomposite PCMs (nanoCPCMs) by an easy, continuous and steady state method for high temperature thermal energy storage applications.

The properties of nanoCPCMs have been characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The leak (exudation) test was performed on prepared composites at higher temperatures (95°C) in comparison with literature.

Also, the required program time of the memory with ultra-thin asymmetric Al2O3/HfO2 tunnel oxide with graphene nanoplatelets storage layer is calculated under Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime and found to be 4.1 ns making it the fastest fully programmed MOS memory due to the observed pure electrons storage in the graphene nanoplatelets.

GO was obtained from graphite via oxidation and exfoliation, and GNS was obtained from GO in a subsequent reduction. Both GO and GNS were coated with PPy via in situ polymerization of pyrrole (Py), forming surface-enhanced materials. Scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive x-ray, transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, Raman, and atomic force microscope findings showed that the Pt nanoparticle loading, agglomeration size, aggregate morphology, and surface dispersion varied according to the nanosheet surface, nanocomposite type, and Py/nanosheet feed ratio. Surface oxygen functionalization along GO, GNS, and their nanocomposites influenced the loading, dispersivity, and morphology of nanoparticle agglomerates. PPy/GO nanocomposites yielded an improved nanoagglomerate surface dispersion and loading compared to samples. The PPy-coated substrates offered a greater intrinsic propensity for redox processes, resulting in higher Pt loadings. Additionally, these nanocomposites provided more surface reduction sites compared to bare nanosheets, and the additional sites contributed toward forming smaller, more homogeneously dispersed Pt nanoparticle agglomerates. Bringing together the electrical properties of PPy and physicomechanical traits of carbon nanosheets, it follows to reason that the nanocomposites produced, particularly GO-based nanocomposites, offer promise as a nanoparticle support material for use in catalysis, electrocatalysis, and hydrogen storage. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Dispersion; Graphene nanosheet; Graphite oxide; Nanocomposite; Platinum; Polypyrrole; Size control","Agglomeration; Atomic force microscopy; Catalysis; Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Electrocatalysis; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Graphene oxide; Graphite; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen storage; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Nanosheets; Platinum; Polypyrroles; Scanning electron microscopy; Energy dispersive x-ray; Graphene nanosheets; Graphite oxide; In-situ polymerization; Nanoparticle agglomerates; Size control; Subsequent reduction; Surface oxygen functionalization; Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938717618

The proposed power split control strategy consists of two stages. In the first stage, the load power is split between the two propulsion machines to obtain the highest powertrain efficiency in both propulsion and regenerative braking modes. A real-time implementable power split control strategy is proposed to benefit from complementary operation features of these two propulsion machines. In the second stage, the load power is split between the battery pack and UC in the HESS. To optimize the power split in HESS, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the battery power magnitude and battery current variations to extend the battery lifetime. The implementation of proposed power split control strategy in the powertrain of an EV with two propulsion machines will potentially result in up to 10% improvement in the powertrain efficiency and up to 82% extension of the battery lifetime. The improvement of propulsion efficiency will in turn lead to up to 27% extension of all-electric driving range. © 2015 IEEE.","convex optimization; Electric vehicles; energy management; hybrid energy storage system; ultra-capacitor","Convex optimization; Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy storage; Hybrid vehicles; Power control; Powertrains; Propulsion; Regenerative braking; Secondary batteries; Uranium compounds; Battery lifetime; Battery power; Convex optimization problems; Driving range; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Propulsion efficiency; Ultracapacitors; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028609833

The current tools have various limitations, such as lack of interoperability, slow to transfer huge building model files, and possibility of data inconsistency. Methods: In this paper, we present a cloud-based BIM server framework namely Social BIMCloud that facilitates BIM information exchange through dynamic merging and splitting of building models. The data model of Social BIMCloud is based on but not limited to IFC. The data model of Social BIMCloud was further extended to accommodate social interactions, by studying the formal modes of communication in the AEC industry. An object-based approach to capture and manage social interactions in AEC projects through a BIM-based visual user interface was also developed and demonstrated. Results: Social BIMCloud addresses the issues of inefficient data transfer speed and data inconsistency in a distributed environment by facilitating the storage and partial exchange of integrated nD BIM models. Data interoperability is facilitated through open BIM standards such as IFC and direct integration with construction software. High performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost effectiveness are facilitated through data partitioning, data replication strategies, multi-node structures, and pay-per-use tariff systems, respectively, through a cloud-based NoSQL database. Conclusion: The Social BIMCloud framework helps to develop and exchange BIM models, which are rich in project information such as social interactions, cost, and energy analyses. This framework improves the communication efficiency between project participants, leading to better designs and less rework. The information captured by this framework could also be useful to determine important metrics such as industry trends, relationships among project participants, and user requirements. © 2015, Das et al.; licensee Springer.","Building information modeling; Cloud computing; Distributed data storage; Partial information exchange; Social interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994776255

Methods/Statistical analysis: The tablets have a double-sided oxide layer on the surface of deuterated palladium and titanium. The target is heated in the oxygen environment up to a temperature of 1200 0C. Heating during free oxygen access on the both sides of the tablet leads to the fact that the tablet is oxidized to form TiOx and PdOy oxides. The thickness of the oxide layer is varied from 0.02 to 0.05 microns. The energy of deuterons increases by more than two orders of magnitude during irradiation of tablets by an electron beam with an energy of 30 keV on the both sides as compared to the thermal energy. The proposed method allows us to obtain a greater number of deuterons with an energy exceeding the energy released during one-sided irradiation. Findings: The high kinetic energy of atoms (D) can be achieved due to acceleration in a strong electric field formed during electron irradiation. The effective acceleration energy can be estimated as follows WDeff = + eE(TiO2)h(TiO2), where = 3 eV is the average primary energy of the ion in the target caused by the generation of plasmons; E(TiO2) ≈ 3.107 V/cm is the electric field intensity in the target; h(TiO2) = 1.5 · 10-5 cm is the thickness of the oxide layer on the target surface. Estimations provide the maximum acceleration energy of deuterons 500 WDeff 500 eV.

However, the partial model query mechanism of current BIM data hub collaboration model has several limitations, which prevents designers and engineers to take advantage of BIM. To address this problem, we propose a general and effective approach to generate query code based on a Model View Definition (MVD).

Different Ni:Cu and Ni:Co ratios were deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) at room temperature on carbon microfibers. Since Ni(OH)2 is notorious for poor cycling stability, the goal of the work was to determine if doping with Cu or Co could improve Ni(OH)2 cycling stability performance and conductivity against reaction with electrolyte. It is observed that the electrodes with Ni:Cu and Ni:Co composition ratio of 100:10 result in the optimum capacitance and cycling stability in both Ni-Cu-OH and Ni-Co-OH electrodes. This improvement in cycling stability can be attributed to the higher redox reversibility as indicated by the smaller CV redox peak separation. In addition, it is found that decreasing Cu and Co ratios, with fixed CBD time, enhances nanoflakes formation, and hence increases electrode capacitance. For the optimum composition (Ni:Co = 100:10), composites of the ternary electrodes with graphene and carbon nanofibers were also tested, with resultant improvement in potential window, equivalent series resistance, areal capacitance and cycling stability. © 2015 The Author(s).","Electrochemical supercapacitors; Graphene; Nickel hydroxide","Capacitance; Carbon nanofibers; Cobalt; Copper; Electric resistance; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Graphene; Stability; Chemical-bath deposition; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical supercapacitor; Electrode capacitance; Equivalent series resistance; Nickel hydroxides; Optimum capacitances; Optimum composition; Nickel compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958691640

The small and medium-sized business organization having limited budget can enjoy the scalable services of the cloud. However, the migration of the organizational data on the cloud raises security and privacy issues. To keep the data confidential, the data should be encrypted using such cryptography method that provides fine-grained and efficient access for uploaded data without affecting the scalability of the system. In mobile cloud computing environment, the selected scheme should be computationally secure and must have capability for offloading computational intensive security operations on the cloud in a trusted mode due to the resource constraint mobile devices. The existing manager-based re-encryption and cloud-based re-encryption schemes are computationally secured and capable to offload the computationally intensive data access operations on the trusted entity/cloud. Despite the offloading of the data access operations in manager-based re-encryption and cloud-based re-encryption schemes, the mobile user still performs computationally intensive paring-based encryption and decryption operations using limited capabilities of mobile device.

In a normal PV power generation, the batteries of PHEVs are set in the controlled charging mode. When a PV power generation fluctuates because of fast cloud transients, the developed controller allows PHEVs batteries to compensate for the PV power variations. The advantage of the proposed control method is that the severe voltage transients are avoided in power networks. The developed control strategy uses fuzzy method to operate with bidirectional interface inverter. Actual transformer tap changer and time series data of solar irradiance based on 5-s intervals are used to study the impact of PV power variations on a 33-bus radial distribution feeder. The results show that the reactive power compensation of PV interface inverter enhances the feeder voltage profile during full cloudy skies. However, during cloud transients, the application of PHEVs storage systems is necessary to alleviate the feeder voltage flicker. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cloud transients; fuzzy logic; interface inverter size; PHEV; PV generation; reactive power support","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power system control; Electric vehicles; Feeding; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid vehicles; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Reactive power; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Transients; PHEV; Photovoltaic power generation; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; PV generation; Radial distribution feeders; Reactive power compensation; Reactive power support; Transformer tap changers; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955757512

The control system of a dynamic voltage restorer should have a fast yet smooth response in detecting, synchronizing, and injecting the appropriate level of compensating voltage to protect sensitive electrical components against probable damages. Moreover, an optimal strategy for the energy storage usage is essential to achieve an extended lifetime for it. This paper proposes an improved control algorithm for a dynamic voltage restorer to address these two issues.

Critical comments have been put forward concerning multiport energy storage introduced by other authors or the so-called C-field. In suggested approach, the decision not to use pseudo Bond Graphs has been justified as not being in line with basic BG theory. On the basis of molecular physics it was considered that the state variable, in physical and mathematical sense, should be temperature rather than entropy.

Quantum dots (QDs) can significantly promote the conductivity, buffer volume variation, and introduce novel physical/chemical properties, especially in cooperation with mesoporous carbon (MC), and hence are attracting ever-increasing attention. However, it is still a worldwide challenge to exploit a facile, efficient, environmentally benign, commercially applicable, and, in particular, universal method for varied QDs/MC hybrids. In this work, a powerful approach is proposed on basis of corn straw piths, and a synthetic mechanism is proposed and investigated systematically. According to this route, Ni, Co, Cu, and MnO QDs/MC nanoplates are successfully fabricated. As a typical example, ultrasmall Ni QDs (5-7nm) are homogeneously distributed on the large surface of MC nanoplates and exhibit a reversible capacitance of 2420Fg-1 at 500mAg-1 and rate performance.

It was studied for the first time, here, for two ready-to-eat (RTE) pre-cooked food commercial products and using an industrial-scale pressure equipment. Caldo verde and Bacalhau com natas were stored for 12 h at 0.1, 50, 100 and 150 MPa, at uncontrolled naturally variable room temperature (~ 21 °C). The results showed that HS caused microbial growth inhibition at 100 MPa for all the studied microorganisms. Moreover, an additional inactivation effect at 150 MPa resulted in values below the detection limit for Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts and moulds, resulting in equal to better results when compared to refrigeration. Regardless of HS conditions no changes were verified in physico-chemical parameters when compared to refrigeration storage. Therefore, HS has the potential to substitute refrigeration as a quasi-energetically costless and carbon foot-printless preservation methodology. Industrial relevance Hyperbaric storage (HS) is a very promising technique for microbial proliferation inhibition at room-like temperatures, allowing natural temperature fluctuations. HS has several advantages when compared to refrigeration namely, it is nearly energetically costless (it only requires energy costs during compression to reach the required pressure level and virtually no additional energy is necessary to maintain the product under pressure along the storage), and so it is also basically carbon foot-printeless. This is the first work to study HS of two commercial highly perishable ready-to-eat food products at room temperature conditions and to assess its effect on fatty acid content, using an industrial high pressure equipment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This circumstance plays a crucial role for experiments, making it possible to measure this small effect by a difference method in the same storage rings via a comparison of, for example, decay probabilities in bare nuclei and heliumlike ions.

Since most biological methods do not work in a low-temperature frozen environment, the mechanism and details of the depression of cellular activity in the frozen state remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we propose, to our knowledge, a new approach to study the downregulation of the redox activity of cytochromes b and c in freezing yeast cells in a contactless, label-free manner. Our approach is based on cytochrome photobleaching effects observed in the resonance Raman spectra of live cells. Photoinduced and native redox reactions that contributed to the photobleaching rate were studied over a wide temperature range (from -173 to +25°C). We found that ice formation influences both the rate of cytochrome redox reactions and the balance between the reduced and oxidized cytochromes. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of native redox reaction rates can be well described by the thermal activation law with an apparent energy of 32.5 kJ/mol, showing that the redox reaction rate is ∼1015 times slower at liquid nitrogen temperature than at room temperature. © 2015 Biophysical Society.",,"cytochrome b; cytochrome c; cryopreservation; electron transport; enzymology; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Raman spectrometry; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; temperature; Cryopreservation; Cytochromes b; Cytochromes c; Electron Transport; Oxidation-Reduction; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949657596

Advanced light water-cooled reactors (LWR) cannot be considered for long-term use due to the significant fuel consumption and the inevitable, although in a distant prospect, shortage of 235U, and due to the low initial potential of LWRs, that cannot overcome all the weak links mentioned above. With such challenges, nuclear power can be neither widespread nor effective, so the main objective in the development of the next generation of nuclear reactors should be a drastic reduction or elimination of important risks and threats specific to the current generation of nuclear power. The real solution to this problem can be found in the transition to a new set of fundamental scientific terms and assumptions (a new paradigm), consisting in the deliverance of nuclear power from important risks and threats by innoculating the reactors and their fuel cycles with a guaranteed “risk-free immunity,” which results in a new quality of nuclear power—an Inherent Safety (IS). To present clear criteria of reaching the inherent safety, we introduce a damage ranking, provability, and priority and principles of the immunity formation against severe accidents and the ways of reaching this within the innovative project Proryv (Russian for Breakthrough). © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","closed fuel cycle; fast reactors; large-scale nuclear power industry; nonproliferation; nuclear power; Proryv project; safety; spent fuel","Accident prevention; Accidents; Fast reactors; Fuel storage; Fuels; Investments; Light water reactors; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear reactors; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive wastes; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Spent fuels; Toxic materials; Water cooled reactors; Balance of energies; Closed fuel cycles; Innovative projects; nonproliferation; Nuclear facilities; Nuclear power technology; Nuclear-power industry; Proryv project; Nuclear reactor accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949236597

Efficient radiant space heating and cooling systems can be used to decrease the energy bills and improve occupant thermal comfort in buildings. This study uses the TRNSYS program, for the modeling and simulation of solar assisted radiant heating and cooling of a building with the domestic hot water supply, to examine the effects of various parameters on energy consumption. Calculations are performed for a typical meteorological year (TMY) and ten attached houses in Istanbul, Turkey with hot water and chilled water storages on a six minute time step basis. Graphs showing variations of the room temperature and room relative humidity indicate satisfactory thermal comfort. Daily average COP of the absorption cooling system is improved by suitable choice of the type and size of the collectors. Sizes of the hot water and chilled water tanks are also important parameters; their roles are shown by their effect on the discarded portion of the heat from the collectors and the energy amount supplied by the auxiliary heater. It is concluded that the presented model for a solar assisted radiant heating and cooling of ten attached houses, with the domestic hot water supply, natural gas fueled auxiliary heater, hot water and chilled water storage tanks have considerable advantages; these should be maximized by optimizing the sizes of the solar collectors and storage tanks using a simulation program.","Absorption chiller; Chilled ceiling; Solar cooling; Solar heating","Cooling; Cooling systems; Cooling water; Energy utilization; Heating; Hot water distribution systems; Radiant heating; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Thermal comfort; Thermoelectric equipment; Water; Water supply; Water tanks; Absorption chillers; Chilled ceiling; Heating and cooling; Heating and cooling systems; Model and simulation; Simulation program; Solar cooling; Typical meteorological year; Absorption cooling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948977897

In recent years there has been a dynamic rise in the amount of power obtained from renewable energy sources in the Polish power sector, including power generated in wind power plants in the first place. The efficiency of wind power plants strongly depends on the wind velocity. This paper presents a reliability analysis of the Polish power generation system. The results are compared to the reliability of North American systems given in NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) reports. The analysis takes electricity generation on wind farms into consideration. A forecast of the reliability of the Polish system of power generation is also presented taking account of planned investments and investment projects which are now in progress. The impact of the increased amount of wind energy on the reliability of the bulk system is discussed. It is shown that, from the point of view of the system reliability, there is a limit to the volume of the share of wind energy in the total amount of electricity generated in the system. Increasing the amount of energy generated by wind farms involves the need to store it, e.g. in pumped hydroelectric storage power plants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Indices of reliability; Power generation system; Wind power plants","Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Investments; Power quality; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Electric reliability; Electrical power system; Electricity generation; Investment projects; Planned investments; Power generation systems; Renewable energy source; System reliability; Reliability analysis; comparative study; electricity generation; hydroelectric power plant; investment; reliability analysis; systems analysis; trend analysis; wind power; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947864168

The generated electricity is used to power domestic heat pumps which supply thermal energy for domestic hot water and space heating demand of households. In this paper, we investigate direct control of the heat pumps by the utility and how the large-scale optimization problem that is created can be reduced significantly. Methods: Two different linear programming control methods (global MILP and time scale MILP) are presented. The latter solves large-scale optimization problems in considerably less computational time. For simulation purposes, data of household thermal demand is obtained from prediction models developed for this research. The control methods are compared with a reference control method resembling PI on/off control of each heat pump. Results: The reference control results in a dynamic electricity consumption with many peak loads on the network, which indicates a high level of simultaneous running heat pumps at those times. Both methods of mix integer linear programming (MILP) control of the heat pumps lead to a much improved, almost flat electricity consumption profile. Conclusions: Both optimization control methods are equally able to minimize the maximum peak consumption of electric power by the heat pumps, but the time scale MILP method requires much less computational effort. Future work is dedicated on further development of optimized control of the heat pumps and the central CHP. © 2015, Fink et al.","Demand side management; Heat pumps; Linear programming control; Load balancing; Smart grid; Thermal storage","Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Network management; Optimization; Pumps; Resource allocation; Thermography (temperature measurement); Demand side managements; Electricity-consumption; Heat pumps; Integer Linear Programming; Large-scale optimization; Optimization control; Smart grid; Thermal storage; Integer programming; biogas; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy balance; household energy; linear programing; optimization; thermal power; Drenthe; Meppel; Netherlands; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947236003

This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for designing efficient and accurate 2n RNS scalers for important classes of moduli sets that have large dynamic ranges. These classes include the traditional 3-moduli set, but the exponent of the power of two modulo is augmented by a variable value x ({2n - 1, 2n+x/, 2n + 1}), and any extended set with an additional modulo m4 ({2n - 1, 2n+x/, 2n + 1[,m4/]}). The proposed approach embeds scaling into the formulation of the Chinese remainder theorem and the mixed radix system, and it exploits the properties of the target moduli sets to perform scaling explicitly in the RNS domain. This is accomplished by operating hierarchically on each channel without requiring reverse and forward conversions. Simple memoryless VLSI architectures are proposed based on the obtained formulations. The relative assessment indicates that not only are these architectures comprehensive and suitable for configurable systems, but they are also more efficient than the related state of the art in terms of both performance and energy. The experimental results obtained for a 90 nm CMOS ASIC technology show improvements in the area-delay product, normalized with respect to the dynamic range, of up to 57 and 146 percent with the proposed scalers for the augmented 3-moduli set (dynamic range of 4n-1 bits) and an extended 4-moduli set (dynamic range of 6n bits), respectively. These improvements increase to 64.9 and 263 percent when the energy required per scaling is measured. The proposed scalers are not only flexible and cost-effective, but they are also suitable for designing and implementing energy-constrained devices, particularly mobile systems. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Algorithm design and analysis; Complexity theory; Computer architecture; Dynamic range; Random access memory; Very large scale integration","Computer architecture; Cost effectiveness; Dynamic random access storage; Integrated circuit design; Numbering systems; Random access storage; VLSI circuits; Algorithm design and analysis; Arithmetic operations; Chinese remainder theorem; Complexity theory; Configurable systems; Dynamic range; Random access memory; Residue number system; Memory architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946924535

Storage temperature plays a major role in their rate of respiration and, therefore, in their postharvest life. In this context, reliable predictions of respiration rates are critical for the development of modified atmosphere packaging that ultimately will maximise the quality of the product to be presented to consumers. This work was undertaken to study the influence of storage time and temperature on the respiration rate of oyster mushrooms. For that purpose, oyster mushrooms were stored at constant temperatures of 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 °C under ambient atmosphere. Respiration rate data were measured with 8-h intervals up to 240 h. A decrease of respiration rate was found after cutting of the carpophores. Therefore, time effect on respiration rate was modelled using a first-order decay model. The results also show the positive influence of temperature on mushroom respiration rate. The model explaining the effect of time on oyster mushroom's respiration rate included the temperature dependence according to the Arrhenius equation, and the inclusion of a parameter describing the decrease of the respiration rate, from the initial time until equilibrium. These yielded an overall model that fitted well to the experimental data. Moreover, results show that the overall model is useful to predict respiration rate of oyster mushrooms at different temperatures and times, using the initial respiration rate of mushrooms. Furthermore, predictive modelling can be relevant for the choice of an appropriate packaging system for fresh oyster mushrooms. © The Author(s) 2014.","CO2 production rate; modelling; modified atmosphere packaging; O2 consumption rate; postharvest preservation; respiratory quotient; storage","Digital storage; Energy storage; Food storage; Fungi; Models; Modified atmosphere packaging; Molluscs; Predictive analytics; Shellfish; Temperature distribution; Constant temperature; Consumption rates; Postharvest; Production rates; Rate of respirations; Respiratory quotients; Storage temperatures; Temperature dependence; Atmospheric temperature; carbon dioxide; biological model; food packaging; food preservation; kinetics; metabolism; oxygen consumption; physiology; Pleurotus; procedures; temperature; theoretical model; time factor; Carbon Dioxide; Food Packaging; Food Preservation; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Oxygen Consumption; Pleurotus; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946903604

The size and diameter distribution of the Pd particles were controlled by the application of different experimental conditions. Two methods of synthesis (reflux and impregnation) and two Pd precursors (palladium (II) acetyloacetonate (Pd(acac)2) and palladium (II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2)) were investigated and compared for the preparation of Pd-decorated DMHCS. The hydrogen storage properties of the pristine DMHCS and Pd-modified DMHCS at 40 °C and a pressure range of 0–45 bar were studied. The results showed that Pd-supported carbon samples synthesized in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 exhibited enhanced hydrogen storage capacity in respect to the pristine DMHCS. The maximum hydrogen storage of 0.38 wt.% exhibited the sample with the Pd nanoparticle diameter distribution of 2–14 nm and the average Pd crystallite size of 7.6 nm. It was found that the Pd nanoparticle content, size, and diameter distribution have a noticeable influence on H2 storage capacity. © 2015, Zielinska et al.","Carbon sorbents; Hydrogen storage; Mesoporous carbons; Pd nanoparticles","Crystallite size; Hydrogen; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Organometallics; Palladium compounds; Carbon sorbents; Diameter distributions; Experimental conditions; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage properties; Mesoporous carbon; Methods of synthesis; PD nano particle; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945542757

A miniature laboratory mixing extruder equipped with a ribbon die was used to produce thin ribbons of PLA/HAp biocomposites. The dynamic mechanical parameters (storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G''), complex viscosity (η∗), and degree of crystallinity) increased with increasing HAp loading. In vitro hydrolytic degradation of the PLA biocomposites was conducted in a 0.01-M phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37°C. The presence of HAp tended to increase both the hydrolytic degradability of the PLA and the crystallinity, possibly resulting from the hydrophilicity of the HAp. The thermal stability of the PLA was slightly higher in the composites with HAp. Following hydrolytic degradation, several microholes and cracks appeared on the surface of these biocomposites, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. The Coats-Redfern method was used to evaluate the thermal degradation kinetics of the biocomposites with support from a chemical reaction model. From this evaluation, the activation energies of the biocomposites were found to exceed that of the neat PLA. These energies were observed to decrease after the hydrolytic degradation process. © The Author(s) 2014.","biocomposite; hydrolytic degradation; hydroxyapatite; Poly(lactic acid); viscoelasticity","Activation energy; Blending; Chlorine compounds; Crystallinity; Degradation; Hydrophilicity; Hydroxyapatite; Lactic acid; Organic solvents; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamic stability; Viscoelasticity; Bio-composites; Chemical reaction models; Degree of crystallinity; Dynamic mechanical parameters; Hydrolytic degradation; Phosphate buffered saline solutions; Poly lactic acid; Thermal degradation kinetics; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945539205

The operational principle of the circuits and the design considerations are described. The main advantage of the circuit is that step-down voltage can be achieved in the circuit by simply configuring with cascaded stages, which will be much more convenient to be modular development and easy for replacement and maintenance; the voltage and current stresses of most components are smaller than the conventional converter. Using buffer capacitor to reserve energy, there are no magnetic energy storage elements in the circuits. Weight and size can be further reduced due to high-frequency-power line operation. Zero current switching (ZCS) is achieved by introducing small resonant inductors. Therefore, higher efficiency and power density can be achieved. The performance of the converter has been demonstrated by an experiment with 50 kHz 50 V power feed which is emulated by a signal generator and high-frequency amplifier to prove the concept. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","AC-DC; fabrication; high-frequency rectifier; Power converter; switched capacitor converter","Buffer storage; DC transformers; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Fabrication; High frequency amplifiers; Magnetic storage; Power converters; Rectifying circuits; Superconducting magnets; Switching frequency; Zero current switching; Design considerations; High frequency power; High-frequency rectifiers; Magnetic energy storage; Modular development; Operational principles; Resonant inductors; Switched capacitor converter; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945469149

However, vessel shapes have complex variations, and accurate modeling of retinal vascular structures is challenging. We have therefore developed a new approach to accurately extract blood vessels in non-fluorescein fundus images using an orientation-aware detector (OAD). The detector was designed according to the intrinsic property of vessels being locally oriented and having linearly elongated structures. We employ the OAD to extract vessel shapes with no assumptions on parametric orientations of vessel shapes. The orientations of vessels can be efficiently modeled by the energy distribution of Fourier transformation. Accordingly, both wide and thin vessels can be extracted with two-scale segmentation in which line operators are applied in large scale and the Gabor filter bank is applied in small scale. A post-processing technique, based on the path opening operation, is applied to eliminate false responses to nonvascular areas, such as retinal structures (optic disc and macula) and pathologies (exudates, hemorrhages,and microaneurysms). This makes the detector robust and structure-aware. By achieving a competitive CAL measurement of 80.82% for the DRIVE database and 68.94% for the STARE, the experimental results demonstrated that the OAD approach outperforms existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach effectively works with non-fluorescein fundus images and proves highly accurate and robust in complicated regions such as the central reflex, close vessels, and crossover points, despite a high level of illumination noise in the original data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fundus image; Gabor wavelet; Line operator; Path opening; Vessel extraction","Blood vessels; Digital storage; Extraction; Eye protection; Filter banks; Fourier transforms; Gabor filters; Image enhancement; Medical imaging; Ophthalmology; Fundus image; Gabor wavelets; Line operators; Path opening; Vessel extraction; Image processing; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; data base; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic imaging equipment; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital imaging; exudate; eye fundus; Fourier transformation; fundus camera; human; illumination; image processing; major clinical study; microaneurysm; optic disk; orientation aware detector; priority journal; retina blood vessel; retina hemorrhage; retina macula lutea; angiography; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; diabetic retinopathy; fluorescence angiography; image enhancement; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; retinoscopy; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Angiography; Diabetic Retinopathy; Fluorescein Angiography; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Vessels; Retinoscopy; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944197248

Moreover, its use adds costs to capital investments in energy systems, along with some reliability issues. Therefore, innovative solutions in power networks require power electronics topologies that are less expensive and more dependable. The use of power electronics without DC energy storage elements (all-silicon solution) is one way to address these issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of past and present converter topologies without DC energy storage elements which can be employed in novel energy systems. In this paper the converters are divided into two groups: with constant output frequency, and with variable output frequency. The first group includes topologies of matrix and matrix-reactance choppers and their applications in hybrid transformers and power electronic transformers. The second group includes frequency converters based on the matrix converter, covering the conventional, indirect, sparse matrix converter and the matrix-reactance frequency converter. The second part of the article concerns the application of the mentioned converters in the power system functioning as a power interface with AC distributed sources and systems for improving energy quality and the control of power flow in the power network. The sections in this part of the paper present an operational description, and simulation and experimental test results of selected converters and their applications.

The of that consumption of primary exergy per unit of useful products is called the index of TEC (thermoecological cost).

Therefore, the electrical grid must be adapted into a smart grid which effectively regulates this two-way interaction. With the aid of simulation, stakeholders can obtain information on how to properly develop and control the smart grid. In this paper, we present the development of an integrated smart grid simulation model, using the Anylogic simulation environment. Among the elements which are included in the simulation model are houses connected to a renewable energy source, and batteries as storage devices. With the use of the these elements a neighbourhood model can be constructed and simulated under multiple scenarios and configurations. The developed simulation environment provides users better insight into the effects of running different configurations in their houses as well as allow developers to study the inter-exchange of energy between elements in a smart city on multiple levels. © 2015 The Authors.

These developments require new strategies and paradigm shifts, such as spin-based technologies and the introduction of photonic processors[1]. Since the demonstration of magnetization reversal by a single 40 femtosecond laser pulse, the manipulation of spins by ultra-short laser pulses has become a fundamentally challenging topic with a potentially high impact for future spintronics, data storage and manipulation and quantum computation. The ability to control the macroscopic magnetic ordering by means of femtosecond laser pulses provides an alternative and energy efficient approach to magnetic recording. The realization that femtosecond laser induced all-optical switching (AOS) as observed in ferrimagnets exploits the exchange interaction between their sublattices, has opened the way to engineer new and rare-earth-free magnetic materials for AOS. Expansion to hybrid magnetic materials, multilayers and FePt is an ongoing effort to expand AOS to future magnetic recording media technology. Recent developments using plasmonic antennas and optical waveshaping indicate the possibility to even scale the technique of AOS to the nanoscale. This, together with recent observations of AOS in FePt and other transition metal alloys makes AOS a potential candidate to replace HAMR in the near future. In this contribution, recent developments in this exciting field will be discussed. © 2015 IEEE.","Amorphous magnetic materials; Elementary particle exchange interactions; Magnetic multilayers; Magnetic recording; Magnetic switching; Magnetization; Ultrafast optics","Amorphous materials; Digital devices; Digital storage; Elementary particle interactions; Energy utilization; Exchange interactions; Hybrid materials; Laser pulses; Magnetic materials; Magnetic multilayers; Magnetic recording; Magnetism; Magnetization; Magnetization reversal; Mobile devices; Multilayers; Optical switches; Quantum computers; Spin dynamics; Transition metal alloys; Transition metals; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrashort pulses; All-optical switching; Amorphous magnetic materials; Magnetic recording media; Magnetic switching; Photonic processors; Short laser pulse; Superparamagnetic limit; Ultrafast optics; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962076501

Versatile strategies for microstructural evolution and related performance of SnO2 and graphene composites are of fundamental importance in the development of electrode materials. Here we report that a novel composite, SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) supported by graphene nanosheets (GNSs), has been prepared successfully by a simple hydrothermal method and electron-beam irradiation (EBI) strategies. Microstructure analysis indicates that the EBI technique can induce the exfoliation of GNSs and increase their interlayer spacing, resulting in the increase of GNS amorphization, disorder, and defects and the removal of partial oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GNSs. The investigation of SnO2 nanoparticles supported by GNSs (SnO2/GNSs) reveals that the GNSs are loaded with SnO2 QDs, which are dispersed uniformly on both sides of GNSs. Interestingly, the electrochemical performance of SnO2/GNSs indicates that SnO2 QDs supported by a 210 kGy irradiated GNS shows excellent cycle response, high specific capacity, and high reversible capacity. This novel SnO2/GNS composite has potential practical applications in SnO2 electrode materials during Li+ insertion/extraction. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","electrochemical performance; electron-beam irradiation; graphene nanosheets; microstructural evolution; SnO2 quantum dots","Chemical sensors; Electrodes; Electron beams; Electronic properties; Functional materials; Irradiation; Microstructural evolution; Nanocrystals; Nanosheets; Optoelectronic devices; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solid-state sensors; Strategic materials; Surface defects; Thermoelectricity; Tin dioxide; Electrochemical performance; Electron beam irradiation; Graphene nanosheets; High reversible capacities; Microstructure analysis; Optical and electronic properties; Oxygen-containing functional groups; Technological applications; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948399758

Capacitors are widely adopted as the interim power supplier when power interruption happens. However, since the energy provided by backup capacitors is limited, and the capacitance of a capacitor will gradually degrade with time, it is imperative to improve the efficiency and reliability of the backup process for SSDs with capacitors. This paper presents a novel backup scheme called SmartBackupfor MLC NAND flash-based SSDs with backup capacitors. In SmartBackup, by exploiting the feature of the discharge process of capacitors, all available SSD channels are fully utilized and dynamically adjusted based on the available voltage, so data can be efficiently stored in a reliable manner. Moreover, in SmartBackup, to write data in a time/energyefficient manner with better reliability, we adopt a fast and reliable programming strategy by only writing LSB (Least Significant Bit) pages in MLC NAND flash. To the best of our acknowledge, this is the first work to jointly utilize the property of the multi-page architecture of MLC NAND flash and the discharge characteristic of capacitors to improvethe efficiency and reliability of the backup process in SSDswith backup capacitors. The experimental results show thatSmartBackup can effectively accelerate the backup processand improve the reliability. © 2015 IEEE.","Capacitors; Reliability; SSD","Capacitance; Capacitors; Computers; Digital storage; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Flash-based SSDs; Memory architecture; Paper capacitors; Reliability; Systems engineering; Backup strategy; Discharge characteristics; Discharge process; Efficiency and reliability; Least significant bits; Power interruptions; Reliability problems; Solid state drives; Outages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961763055

Such continuous and data-intensive processing is often achieved through the composition of complex data-intensive workflows (i.e., dataflows). Dataflow management systems typically enforce strict temporal synchronization across the various processing steps. Non-synchronous behavior often has to be explicitly programmed on an ad-hoc basis, which requires additional lines of code in programs and thus the possibility of errors. More so, in a large set of scenarios for continuous and incremental processing, the output of dataflow applications at each execution can suffer almost no difference when comparing to the previous execution, and therefore resources, energy and computational power are unknowingly wasted. To face such lack of efficiency, transparency, and generality, we introduce the notion of Quality-of-Data (QoD), which describes the level of changes required on a data store that cause the triggering of processing steps. This, so that the dataflow (re-)execution is reduced until its outcome would reach a significant and meaningful variation, which is inside a specified freshness limit. Based on the QoD notion, we propose a novel dataflow model, with framework (Fluxy), for orchestrating data-intensive processing steps, which communicate data via a NoSQL storage, and whose triggering semantics is driven by dynamic QoD constraints automatically defined for different datasets by means of Fuzzy Boolean Nets. These nets give probabilistic guarantees about the prediction of the cumulative error between consecutive dataflow executions.

The produced energy can be directly injected in the gas grid, utilized in chemical/mobility industry, and stored in a storage device and later on reconverted back into electrical energy using fuel cells before injecting it to the power grid. The aim of the control process is to maximize the PtG facilities' profit from the produced energy while avoiding overloading grids. The problem is solved by a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach in which each PtG facility makes decisions based on its local information, yet still coordinates its supply bids to the grid operators. In this way, grid operators can manage PtG facilities via shadow prices associated with the grid constraints in order to avoid overloading. We perform simulations to investigate the evolution of shadow prices modified by grid operators and to study the economic feasibility of PtG facilities under realistic estimates of the selling price and demand patterns on the energy grids. © 2015 EUCA.",,"Costs; Direct injection; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel storage; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Virtual storage; Control process; Distributed Model predictive Control; Distributed MPC; Economic feasibilities; Electrical energy; Gas facilities; Grid constraint; Local information; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963854382

In such a network, a heat carrier is used in the form of water, where heat is injected and extracted through heat exchangers. The network can transport and store heated water in stratification tanks to shift loads in time. A setup is considered, which includes a single producer with a storage tank and multiple consumers. For this topology, a model is derived consisting of differential equations that describe temperature and volume dynamics. We design a controller such that both the volume and the temperature converge to specified setpoints. The extracted heat that is demanded is unknown, while the flow rates passing through the heat exchanger of the consumers are set to a measurable constant. We regard both the flow rates and the heat injection of the producer as the control input. The controller uses techniques from output regulation, such that the prescribed setpoints are reached while satisfying the demand. We prove that under the proposed controller all solutions are bounded and convergence to the desired setpoints.

However, the research on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in the O&G industry context are still lacking in terms of understanding the factors that facilitates or hinders its implementation. Therefore, this paper aims at addressing the gap by assessing the importance of the external forces within the O&G operating environment that could affect its SSCM strategy. A literature review was conducted where we identified six external forces namely economic stability, political stability, stakeholder pressure, competition, energy transition and regulations. A multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) method called Best Worst Method (BWM) was used to assess the importance of the forces based on data collected using a questionnaire sent to academic experts in the fields of SSCM and O&G. It is found that economic stability followed by competition and political stability are the most important external forces and regulations and energy transition are the least important forces influencing the SSCM of the O&G companies. The outcome of this study could help O&G companies to identify external forces that can drive (hinder) their SSCM implementation. Consequently, it enable them to develop a strategy that take into account their resources and capabilities to address the external forces as they strive to make their supply chains more sustainable. © 2015 IEEE.","best worst method (BWM); external forces; oil and gas; Sustainable supply chain","Decision making; Digital storage; Gas industry; Gases; Stability; Sustainable development; best worst method (BWM); External force; Multiple criteria decision making; Oil and gas; Resources and capabilities; Stakeholder pressures; Supply chain management practices; Sustainable supply chains; Supply chain management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963502705

Though there are uncertainties in both load and price but the optimal utilization of EVs can make the operation more flexible for LAs. Generally LAs predict the day-ahead load and price, as they are price taker they submit their offer based on forecasted load but with the proper utilization of EVs helps them to maximize profits.

In order to incorporate full models of ESS and its interface with the power system, in this paper an algorithm to incorporate electrochemical ESS management on the UC problem is presented.

These features include low power, high density, and better scalability. However, most existing NVMs suffer from two drawbacks, namely, limited write endurance and expensive write operation in terms of both time and energy. These problems are worsen when modern high-level languages employ virtual machine with garbage collector that generates a large amount of extra writes on non-volatile main memory. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes three techniques: Living Objects Remapping (LORE), Dead Object Stamping (DOS), and Smart Wiping with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (SMILE) to reduce the unnecessary writes when garbage collector handles objects. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques not only significantly reduce the writes during each garbage collection cycle but also greatly improve the performance of virtual machine. © 2015 IEEE.","Maximum likelihood estimation; Memory management; Nonvolatile memory; Random access memory; System performance; Virtual machining","Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Data storage equipment; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Java programming language; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Phase change memory; Random access storage; Refuse collection; Memory management; Non-volatile memory; Random access memory; System performance; Virtual machining; High level languages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962325857

Spontaneous emulsification was carried out by titrating an organic phase (oil and phospholipid) into an aqueous phase with continuous stirring. The influence of phospholipid composition, surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR), initial phospholipids location, storage time, phospholipid type, and preparation method was tested. The initial droplet size depended on the nature of the phospholipid used, which was attributed to differences in phospholipid composition. Droplet size decreased with increasing SOR and was smallest when the phospholipid was fully dissolved in the organic phase rather than the aqueous phase. The droplets formed using spontaneous emulsification were relatively large (d > 10 μm), and so the emulsions were unstable to gravitational separation. At low SORs (0.1 and 0.5), emulsions produced with phospholipids had a smaller particle diameter than those produced with a synthetic surfactant (Tween 80), but at a higher SOR (1.0), this trend was reversed. High-energy methods (microfluidization and sonication) formed significantly smaller droplets (d < 10 μm) than spontaneous emulsification. The results from this study show that low-energy methods could be utilized with natural surfactants for applications for which fine droplets are not essential. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","emulsion; low-energy methods; natural surfactants; phospholipids; spontaneous emulsification; sunflower","Drops; Emulsions; Phospholipids; Sunflower oil; Surface active agents; Continuous stirrings; Gravitational separation; Low-energy methods; Natural surfactants; Oil-in-water emulsions; Spontaneous emulsification; sunflower; Synthetic surfactants; Emulsification; emulsifying agent; emulsion; phospholipid; surfactant; vegetable oil; chemistry; emulsion; particle size; sunflower; Emulsifying Agents; Emulsions; Helianthus; Particle Size; Phospholipids; Plant Oils; Surface-Active Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947786442

Initially, energy integration is used to identify minimum heating and cooling utility targets. Next, a genetic algorithm approach is employed to optimize the external heating load and generated power of the cogeneration system that includes a steam Rankine cycle. An outer loop is used to optimize the flowrate, temperature, and pressure of the steam entering and exiting the turbine. A multiperiod optimization approach is developed to account for the diurnal variability of solar energy. Direct usage of collected solar energy is considered along with the option of thermal storage and dispatch.

High-technology development and advanced knowledge has made it possible to defend the feasibility and the safety of such facilities, making the European Union a leader in the field. Other European countries are closely behind, developing high competence through advanced research programmes, research infrastructures and public engagement. At the other extreme, there are countries whose GD programmes are at an early stage and no systematic research programmes exist. These include several new Member States but not the Czech Republic and Hungary, both of which have already initiated a siting process. There are several common reasons for this delay in schedule: small and relatively younger nuclear energy programmes, return of the spent fuel (especially from research reactors) to the countries of origin, open fuel cycle concept (requiring at least 50 years of wet and dry storage). In this context, there has been little pressure on setting up an early GD programme. Currently their disposal concepts are only generic and in most of these countries need updating, taking into account the current socio-economic context. However, some of these new Member States still aim to have a GD in operation within several decades, e.g. 2055 in Romania and 2067 in Slovenia. Strategic planning based on the experience of more advanced programmes shows the GD process should start immediately in order to be able to achieve these deadlines. In this context, the implementation of the EC Directive 70/2011 gives the opportunity to progress the advancement of the GD process in these countries. © 2016 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","geological disposal; New Member States; Romania","Fuel storage; Geology; Radioactive wastes; Waste disposal; Advanced researches; European Countries; Geological disposals; New Member States; Public engagement; Research infrastructure; Romania; Systematic research; Radioactive waste disposal; European Union; feasibility study; implementation process; radioactive waste; research program; safety; strategic approach; waste disposal; Finland; France; Slovenia; Sweden",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964725525

In addition to traditional regulation methods using hydroelectric and thermal power plants, the possibilities of storing power in different forms, including stationary electrochemical storage systems, are being more and more widely used at present. It is planned in future to use the on-board storage batteries of electric vehicles (V2G technology) for this purpose. Traditional and promising future technologies for compensating load fluctuations in electric power systems have their own niche applications and costs under different operating conditions. In this paper we provide comparative estimates of the specific costs when compensating load fluctuations of different duration using traditional technologies, which use flexible power units and peak power plants, and also technologies based on the use of electrochemical electric power storage. The costs for 1 kW h of peak electric power and the costs in theory per 1 kW of peak power are estimated. As follows from the results of the calculations, the use of electrochemical storage is economically useful for continuous operating times of less than 1 h. To cover longer electric consumption fluctuations, the most suitable technologies remain flexible gas turbine systems and simple-cycle and gas-piston equipment under peak conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","efficiency; electric car; grid-to-vehicle charging; load regulation; storage battery; thermal electric power plant","Charging (batteries); Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Costs; Efficiency; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Gas turbines; Secondary batteries; Thermoelectric power plants; Different operating conditions; Electric cars; Electrochemical storage; Electrochemical storage system; Load regulations; Storage battery; Traditional regulations; Vehicle charging; Electric power plants; comparative study; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; hydroelectric power plant; technology; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958895390

Based on a comparative analysis of the spectra of samples of the used oil and the resins separated from it and the spectrum of fresh oil it was concluded that, besides oxidative mechanism, resinous compounds are formed in the oils as a result of oligomerization of the hydrocarbons. The molecules of the latter suffer, in the thermomechanical deformation process, profound stereostructural change at the level of distortion of the torsion angles and bond lengths. This leads to increase of the potential energy, corresponding dissociation of the R-C⋯H bonds in the hydrocarbons, and increase of their acidity, which stimulates oligomerization at these protonated bonds, i.e., initiates the oligomerization process and formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, or aging of the oil. The distortion of the stereostructure of the hydrocarbons in the oil during use remains in the mechanochemical memory of the molecules. This is why the purified used oil, even without oxidation of the hydrocarbons, becomes dark during storage because of the chromophoric -C-H acids that are formed. The latter are neutralized in the presence of alkaline reagents. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","1H NMR spectroscopy; industrial oil; IR spectroscopy; oligomerization; protonated hydrocarbons; resins; used oil","Bond length; Hydrocarbons; Molecules; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oligomerization; Oligomers; Potential energy; Resins; Alkaline reagents; Comparative analysis; IR and NMR spectroscopy; Mechanism of formation; Mechanochemicals; Oxidative mechanism; Structure change; Thermomechanical deformations; Aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958055585

Motivated by the popularity of prefetch-friendly or delay-tolerant apps (e.g., social networking, app updates, cloud storage), we design and implement an application-layer transmission protocol, AppATP, which leverages cloud computing to manage data transmissions for mobile apps, transferring data to and from mobile devices in an energy-efficient manner. Measurements show that significantly amount of energy is consumed by mobile devices during poor connectivity. Based on this observation, AppATP adaptively seizes periods of good bandwidth condition to prefetch frequently used data with minimum energy consumption, while deferring delay-tolerant data during poor network connectivity. Using the stochastic control framework, AppATP only relies on the current network information and data queue sizes to make an online decision on transmission scheduling, and performs well under unpredictable wireless network conditions. We implement AppATP on Samsung Note 2 smartphones and Amazon EC2. Results from both trace-driven simulations and extensive real-world experiments show that AppATP can be applied to a variety of application scenarios while achieving 30 - 50 percent energy savings for mobile devices. © 2015 IEEE.","energy efficiency; Mobile cloud computing; stochastic optimization; transmission management","Cloud computing; Delay tolerant networks; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Information management; Mobile devices; Optimization; Social sciences computing; Minimum energy consumption; Real world experiment; Stochastic optimizations; Trace driven simulation; Transmission management; Transmission protocols; Transmission scheduling; Wireless transmissions; Mobile cloud computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958040090

The implementation of this stand-alone system is chosen due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in producing electricity, under low head conditions. This type of turbine is capable of producing power outputs of up to 5 kW. It is green energy technology that does not require water storage, and the initial set-up is very easy and straight forward. The propeller turbine is one of the most popular types of pico-hydro scheme that have been implemented extensively in remote areas, especially in Asia. However, little research has been conducted regarding the enhancement or development of pico-hydro turbines. This study will review previous research on the propeller hydro turbine, which mostly deals with low head and high flow rate conditions. The main components of the propeller turbine and the basic working principles of the run-of-river type will be highlighted. The conclusions will consider the main components in propeller hydro turbine systems which have been investigated by previous researchers to enhance the efficiency and performance.

The approach is focused on solving the problem of generating statistics using analysis of energy consumption profiles. Structural solutions to arranging a system providing collection, transmission, and processing of measuring information from mobile object energy customers are considered. Based on the mixed implementation, a scheme of the measuring unit including a set of temperature, voltage, current, and speed sensors is developed. A data exchange scheme corresponding to the upper level of energy monitoring automation is developed. The control level in the scheme is established by JEVis local and global information systems with an open source. It is proposed to use a VIDA44M module remote telemetry and control line as a controller to collect data. The modules of the energy monitoring system can be supported by one server or distributed among several ones forming a cloud server. The data collection controllers communicate wirelessly with the server. The main calculation parameters of mobile object power supply, as well as the results of energy profile processing using hardware-in-the-loop simulations of the static and dynamic electric drive load, are considered. Based on the graphic profiles obtained by automated energy monitoring, one can assess the energy consumption of mobile objects, including public transport vehicles in a specific form, compare flow rates between similar objects, reveal faults or improper adjustment of the equipment, rank objects in power consumption, work out solutions to replace inefficient parts and mechanisms, predict power consumption, etc. As a result, power supply indices can be calculated and energy efficiency can be estimated; in addition, as energy audit of a transport company can be carried out and management decisions concerning energy efficiency can be suggested. © 2015, Allerton Press, Inc.","automated system; energy monitoring; energy profile; hardware-in-the-loop simulation; JEVis; mobile object; remote monitoring; VIDA44M","Automation; Braking; Computer hardware; Controllers; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Electronic data interchange; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hardware; Interplanetary spacecraft; Open systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Synthetic apertures; Traction (friction); Automated systems; Energy monitoring; Energy profile; Hardware in-the-loop simulation; JEVis; Mobile objects; Remote monitoring; VIDA44M; Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955583057

This shift is accompanied by a considerable increase of the absorption coefficient (photodarkening effect) in the measured wavelength range (3502500 nm). These effects could be attributed to both the additional defect introduction and the increased graphitization, as confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.

In the present study, effect of metallic mesh size on the thermal characteristics of latent heat thermal storage system is investigated. Charging time is predicted for various mesh sizes, and the influence of the amount of mesh material on the charging capacity is examined. An experiment is carried out to validate the numerical predictions. It is found that predictions of the thermal characteristics of phase change material with presence of metallic meshes agree well with the experimental data. High conductivity of the metal meshes enables to transfer heat from the edges of the thermal system towards the phase change material while forming a conduction tree in the system. Increasing number of meshes in the thermal system reduces the charging time significantly due to increased rate of conduction heat transfer in the thermal storage system; however, increasing number of meshes lowers the latent heat storage capacity of the system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aluminum mesh; Latent heat; Phase change material; Thermal storage","Digital storage; Forecasting; Heat conduction; Heat convection; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Mesh generation; Metals; Phase change materials; High conductivity; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Latent heat thermal storage; Numerical predictions; Thermal characteristics; Thermal storage; Thermal storage system; Thermal systems; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949096449

The MetS subjects had increased fasting concentrations of biomarkers representing the 3 core processes, glucose, TG, and inflammation control, and the challenge response curves ofmost biomarkers were altered. After the 4 wk hypercaloric dietary intervention, these 3 processes were not changed, as compared with the preintervention state in the healthy subjects, whereas the challenge response curves of almost all endocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory processes regulating these core processes were altered, demonstrating major molecular physiologic efforts tomaintain homeostasis.This study thus demonstrates that change in challenge response is a more sensitive biomarker of metabolic resilience than are changes in fasting concentrations.","Clinical study; Eicosanoids; Human physiology; Nutrition; Systems biology","fat; glucose; biological marker; fat intake; glucose blood level; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; glucose metabolism; health; homeostasis; human; male; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; open study; pilot study; priority journal; provocation test; quantitative analysis; stress; administration and dosage; blood; clinical trial; drug effects; fat intake; glucose blood level; middle aged; time; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Dietary Fats; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Time Factors; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948807803

In this work, carbon doped Mo(Se0.85S0.15)2 (i.e., Mo(Se0.85S0.15)2:C) hierarchical nanotubes have been synthesized for the first time and serve as a robust and high-performance anode material. The hierarchical nanotubes with diameters of 300 nm and wall thicknesses of 50 nm consist of numerous 2D layered nanosheets, and can act as a robust host for sodiation/desodiation cycling. The Mo(Se0.85S0.15)2:C hierarchical nanotubes deliver a discharge capacity of 360 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 2000 mA g-1 and keep a 81.8% capacity retention compared to that at a current density of 50 mA g-1, showing superior rate capability.

Solar energy incident on the ETHPSC is collected and stored in the LHTES tank. The stored heat is then transferred to the domestic hot water supply via a finned heat exchanger pipe placed inside the tank. A combination of mathematical algorithms is used to model a complete process of the heat absorption, storage and release modes of the proposed system. The results show that for a large range of flow rates, the thermal performance of the ETHPSC-LHTES system is higher than that of a similar system without latent heat storage. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the efficiency of the introduced system is less sensitive to the draw off water flowrate than a conventional system. Analysis indicates that this system could be applicable as a complementary part to conventional ETHPSC systems to be able to produce hot water at night time or at times with weak radiation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat pipe; Latent heat system; Phase change material; Solar water heater; Thermal energy storage","Energy storage; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Water; Water supply; Conventional systems; Heat exchanger pipes; Heat-pipe solar collectors; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Mathematical algorithms; Solar hot water systems; Theoretical modeling; Thermal Performance; Storage (materials); absorption; algorithm; array; heat transfer; latent heat flux; phase transition; photovoltaic system; pipe; solar power; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946095746

This paper assesses it's different possible uses, the competition between these uses, and the implications for long-term global energy demand and energy system emissions. A scenario analysis is performed using the TIMER energy system model. Under baseline conditions, 170 EJ yr-1 of secondary bioenergy is consumed in 2100 (approximately 18% of total secondary energy demand), used primarily in the transport, buildings and nonenergy (chemical production) sectors. This leads to a reduction of 9% of CO2 emissions compared to a counterfactual scenario where no bioenergy is used. Bioenergy can contribute up to 40% reduction in emissions at carbon taxes greater than 500/tC. As higher CO2 taxes are applied, bioenergy is increasingly diverted towards electricity generation. Results are more sensitive to assumptions about resource availability than technological parameters. To estimate the effectiveness of bioenergy in specific sectors, experiments are performed in which bioenergy is only allowed in one sector at a time. The results show that cross-sectoral leakage and emissions from biomass conversion limit the total emission reduction possible in each sector. In terms of reducing emissions per unit of bioenergy use, we show that the use of bioelectricity is the most effective, especially when used with carbon capture and storage. However, this technology only penetrates at a high carbon price (&gt;100/tC) and competition with transport fuels may limit its adoption. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bioenergy; Climate policy; Competing biomass applications; Cross-sectoral leakage; Energy system modelling; Scenario analysis","Bioconversion; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Electrophysiology; Emission control; Energy management; Bio-energy; Climate policy; Electricity generation; Energy system modelling; Global energy demand; Resource availability; Scenario analysis; Technological parameters; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; carbon emission; chemical compound; electricity generation; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; leakage; resource availability; scenario analysis; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943664391

Fatty acids are derivatives of materials readily found in nature and labeled as bio-based. In this study, we tested binary mixtures of capric acid (CA), myristic acid (MA), lauric acid (LA), and palmitic acid (PA) as candidate materials for building applications. The melting points of such fatty acid mixtures may further be adjusted, to agree with human comfort zone temperatures by regulating their compositions. We developed two binary mixtures of CA-LA and CA-MA as candidate PCMs for building applications. Thermal storage capacities were measured to be 109.0-155.4 J/g with a differential scanning calorimeter. Thermal cycle tests showed that both PCMs are thermally and chemically stable. Durabilities of PCM mixtures determined by the thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that degradation started at 120 °C. The compressive strengths of 1 wt.% PCM added to concrete mixtures were reduced by 12%, yet stayed within the desired limits for C35/45 concretes. However, when PCM contents were increased to 2 wt.%, compression strengths were reduced further, to be within the limits of C30/37 concretes.

TES in microencapsulated phase change materials provides a new solution to thermally regulated energy efficient buildings. This study summarizes the investigations and analysis of microencapsulated PCMs for building applications. Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) can be incorporated with many materials that are commonly used in building construction. This paper provides overview of various encapsulation techniques, test methods for MPCMs as well as applications of MPCMs in buildings. There are several micro-encapsulation methods by which the microcapsules of a wide range of sizes between 0.05 μm and 5000 μm can be produced. The MPCM incorporated with concrete, mortar, plaster and other materials have a significant potential to increase the thermal capacity of the mixture. Several authors reported testing of building materials with MPCM. Though the increase of thermal capacity with addition of MPCM is significant the decrease of mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, is relatively small. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ultrasonic treatments may also be used to extend the shelf life of egg during storage period in ambient temperature. The effectiveness of ultrasound treatment with different power levels (200 W, 300 W, 450 W) and treatment times (2 min and 5 min) was evaluated for enhancing the functional properties of eggs during storage at 24 ° C for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Ultrasound treatment power and treatment time had significant effects on Haugh unit, yolk index, albumen pH, dry matter, relative whipping capacity, and albumen viscosity resulting in extended shelf life. Attributes such as yolk index, Haugh unit, pH, whipping capacity, dry matter for 300 W and 450 W treatments were better than control and 200 W treatments. Longer treatment time and power showed a significant influence on functional properties. CONCLUSION: Power levels of 300 W and 450 W of ultrasound treatments had improved internal quality of fresh eggs during storage, but negative effect on shell strength.

According to previous works, an optimal particle volume fraction became a major objective of many researchers in order to obtain highly conductive ECAs, realizing that the need for transitions from an insulator to a conductor is controlled by the geometric arrangement of particles. In the current study, particle arrangement models of ECAs are developed by establishing the effects of van der Waals’ attraction energy and particle motion, which act as a kind of particle interaction to generate a conducting structure. The methodology is divided into three major parts: the formulation of a particle arrangement technique, and numerical and experimental studies. The formulation of particle arrangement is developed in an epoxy colloidal system. During verification, the particle arrangement model is validated by the theoretical fractal dimension and guided by a morphological study of the experimental assessments. The model was simulated through representative volume elements with the volume fraction factor, which was set in the range of 2–8 vol.%, while electrical conductivity was an observed parameter.

However, research on other economic impacts of using CCS is scarce. In this paper, we look into economic upstream impacts of CCS use in terms of employment, Gross Value Added (GVA) and import dependency on the macro- and sector-level in Western Europe. We determine these impacts by a static comparison of two scenarios of power production with and without CCS (differences in energy efficiency investments between these scenarios were not accounted for). The two scenarios, both representing a stringent climate policy regime, were produced with the energy-system-simulation-model (TIMER) following the same emission profile until 2050. Data from the two scenarios were respectively implemented into a projected version of a global-multiregional IO-Model (EXIOBASE). Macro-level results suggest slightly higher gross employment, but lower Gross Value Added (GVA) (by 25%), and higher import dependency in the CCS-including scenario compared to the CCS-excluding scenario, given that biomass with CCS (BECCS) is available. Sector-level results show disproportionally higher differences between the scenarios in GVA and employment for some sectors compared to other sectors. Particularly, sectors providing fuels (here mostly bio-energy) have significantly higher GVA and employment in the CCS scenario. This study thus reveals interesting upstream economic effects, which can be linked to the technology choice. However, the exact quantitative results depend strongly on model assumptions. Results therefore need to be further explored in other models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 capture and storage (CCS); Economics of climate change; GHG mitigation technologies; Greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategy; Sector-impacts of CCS; Socio-economic impacts of CCS","Carbon; Carbon capture; Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Economics; Electric power generation; Employment; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Ionization of gases; Carbon capture and storage; Energy efficiency investments; Energy system simulations; GHG mitigation; Mitigation strategy; Multi-regional io models; Sector-impacts of CCS; Socio-economic impacts; Economic and social effects; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; environmental economics; future prospect; mitigation; socioeconomic impact; strategic approach; technological development; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942014160

The performance of a Lithium-Ion, Nickel-Metal, recent Lead-Acid batteries or Supercapacitors are shown to touch on the most general features of power using in mobile applications. Two aspects of batteries are considered in this paper, battery-capability versus temperature and load-effects of high currents during the charging and discharging process. It is shown that there is an overall reduction in the internal losses due to temperature effects to take a significant reduction in battery-efficiency, so to change battery-capability. The main features of several different types of batteries are shown in this paper including their detailed analysis to show the effect of temperature change. Three possible temperatures are explored: a) -10 °C (14 F); b) 10 °C (50 F); and c) +25 °C (77 F) for low-current and a maximum-current loading to get the performance of batteries behaviors.

However, a ripple power at twice the grid frequency may be injected from the AC grid into the DC bus if the ripple power is not properly compensated. In this paper, a family of bidirectional single-phase AC-DC three-phase-leg PWM converters for use in the nanogrid system is analyzed. The averaged DC power and the second-order AC power of the AC grid are actively decoupled. A proper AC voltage reference for AC power compensation is analyzed and selected for the charge storage capacitor for better efficiency. A generalized control structure is proposed for the family of converters. Applying modulation with extra zero-sequence voltage injection derived from the three-phase-leg PWM voltages, a significant reduction of the AC storage capacitance is achieved and the converter efficiency is also improved.

In many urban areas with contaminated aquifers, there exists a desire for sustainable heating and cooling with UTES and a need for remediation. We investigated the potential synergy between UTES and bioremediation with batch experiments to simulate the effects of changing temperature and liquid exchange that occur in ATES systems, and of only temperature change occurring in BTES systems on cis-DCE reductive dechlorination. Compared to the natural situation (NS) at a constant temperature of 10°C, both UTES systems with 25/5°C for warm and cold well performed significantly better in cis-DCE (cis-1,2-dichloroethene) removal. The overall removal efficiency under mimicked ATES and BTES conditions were respectively 13 and 8.6 times higher than in NS. Inoculation with Dehalococcoides revealed that their initial presence is a determining factor for the dechlorination process. Temperature was the dominating factor when Dehalococcoides abundance was sufficient. Stimulated biodegradation was shown to be most effective in the mimicked ATES warm well because of the combined effect of suitable temperature, sustaining biomass growth, and regular cis-DCE supply. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Aquifers; Bioremediation; Dechlorination; Energy storage; Groundwater pollution; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Microbiology; Thermal energy; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Borehole thermal energy storage; Cis-1 ,2-dichloroethene; Constant temperature; Contaminated aquifer; Reductive dechlorination; Removal efficiencies; Thermal energy storage systems; Biodegradation; 1,2 dichloroethylene; 1,2-dichloroethylene; ground water; vinylidene chloride; water pollutant; biodegradation; bioremediation; dechlorination; ethane; microbial activity; temperature effect; thermal power; urban area; aquifer; Article; biodegradation; biomass; bioremediation; controlled study; cooling; dechlorination; Dehalococcoides; energy resource; heating; inoculation; nonhuman; reduction; simulation; urban area; bioremediation; chemistry; Chloroflexi; halogenation; heat; metabolism; stereoisomerism; water pollutant; Dehalococcoides; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chloroflexi; Dichloroethylenes; Energy-Generating Resources; Groundwater; Halogenation; Hot Temperature; Stereoisomerism; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947276755

For an optimal operation, the efficient and economical storage system for an HPS should be selected. This work introduces a new systematic generic framework to determine the most cost-effective storage technology for an HPS. A Power Pinch Analysis tool called the AC/DC modified storage cascade table has been developed to optimise the HPS by considering various storage technologies. The economics of the various types of storage modes was analysed, taking into account the associated energy losses, among others. The method was applied to two case studies with different power trends to evaluate the effect of storage efficiencies and storage form on the performance of HPS.

Renewable energy sources such as sunlight, wind, or water are the most common. However, since the 1990s, other sources for energy production have been studied. The use of microorganisms such as bacteria or archaea to produce energy is currently in great progress. These present several advantages even when compared with other renewable energy sources. Besides the energy production, they are also involved in bioremediation such as the removal of heavy metal contaminants from soils or wastewaters. Several research groups have demonstrated that these organisms are able to interact with electrodes via heme and non-heme iron proteins. Therefore, the role of iron as well as iron metabolism in these species must be of enormous relevance. Recently, the influence of cellular iron regulation by Fur in the Geobacter sulfurreducens growth and ability to produce energy was demonstrated. In this review, we aim to briefly describe the most relevant proteins involved in the iron metabolism of bacteria and archaea and relate them and their biological function with the ability of selected organisms to produce energy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bacterial iron metabolism; Bioenergy; Bioremediation; Green energy; Microbial fuel cells","Bacteria; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Energy policy; Heavy metals; Iron; Iron research; Metabolism; Microbial fuel cells; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Natural resources; Physiology; Porphyrins; Proteins; Renewable energy resources; Alternative energy source; Bio-energy; Biological functions; Energy productions; Geobacter sulfurreducens; Green energy; Iron metabolism; Renewable energy source; Chemicals removal (water treatment); ferric ion; ferric uptake regulator; ferritin; ferrous ion; heavy metal; iron; water; iron; bacterium; bioenergy; bioremediation; electrode; eukaryote; fossil fuel; fuel cell; growth rate; heavy metal; iron; metabolism; renewable resource; research work; alternative energy; archaeon; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; bacterium; biofilm; biomass energy; bioremediation; cell metabolism; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Desulfovibrio desulfuricans; electric conductance; electric current; electricity; electrode; energy metabolism; energy yield; Enterobacter aerogenes; Geobacter metallireducens; Geobacter sulfurreducens; heavy metal removal; homeostasis; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; membrane transport; microbial biomass; microbial fuel cell; microorganism; mineralization; nonhuman; nuclear accident; nuclear waste; oxidation; renewable energy; Review; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Shewanella putrefaciens; soil pollution; sunlight; waste water management; wind; bioenergy; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Geobacter sulfurreducens; Archaea; Bacteria; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Electricity; Electrodes; Iron",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941992902

Sustainable use of the ground as a renewable energy source depends on the seasonal energy load balance. One of the critical factors for the sustainable operation of heat exchanger piles is that a constant temperature of the ground is maintained over seasons. The entire soil mass can be gradually heated up or cooled down if the energy demand is unbalanced. This paper presents the findings on the long-term performance of heat exchanger piles and their efficiency for areas where the demand is nonsymmetrical. Analyses have been performed to investigate the long-term performance of several pile arrangements ranging from single pile to numerous pile groups with a selection of 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4 and 5 × 5 rectangular grids.

From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers. It was found that shortening the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 linker resulted in a noticeable enhancement in the working volumetric capacity at specific temperatures and pressures with amply conserved gravimetric uptake/working capacity. In contrast, further expansion of the organic linker (branches and/or core) led to isostructural Al-soc-MOFs with enhanced gravimetric uptake but noticeably lower volumetric capacity. The collective experimental and simulation studies indicated that the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits the best compromise between the volumetric and gravimetric total and working uptakes under a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crystal chemistry; Crystalline materials; Java programming language; Methane; Naphthalene; Organometallics; Department of Energy; Metal organic framework; Molecular building blocks; Molecular simulations; Pressure and temperature; Simulation studies; Structure property relationships; Volumetric capacity; Aluminum; aluminum; anthracene; carbon dioxide; metal organic framework; methane; naphthalene; methane; oxygen; Article; chemical structure; crystal; crystal structure; environmental sustainability; gas; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; simulation; storage; thermogravimetry; chemistry; crystallization; X ray crystallography; Aluminum; Carbon Dioxide; Crystallization; Crystallography, X-Ray; Methane; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945252985

The main issue that hinders broad adoption of this technique is the massive computing workload in CNN that prevents real-time implementation on low-power embedded platforms. Recently, several dedicated solutions have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency and throughput, nevertheless the huge amount of data transfer involved in the processing is still a challenging issue. This work proposes a new CNN accelerator exploiting a novel memory access scheme which significantly improves data locality in CNN related processing. With this scheme, external memory access is reduced by 50% while achieving similar or even better throughput. The accelerator is implemented using 28nm CMOS technology. Implementation results show that the accelerator achieves a performance of 102GOp/s @800MHz while consuming 0.303mm2 in silicon area. Power simulation shows that the dynamic power of the accelerator is 68mW.

Our gut microbiota might affect the cardiometabolic phenotype by fermenting indigestible dietary components and thereby producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA are not only of importance in gut health and as signalling molecules, but might also enter the systemic circulation and directly affect metabolism or the function of peripheral tissues. In this Review, we discuss the effects of three SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) on energy homeostasis and metabolism, as well as how these SCFA can beneficially modulate adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver tissue function. As a result, these SCFA contribute to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we also summarize the increasing evidence for a potential role of SCFA as metabolic targets to prevent and counteract obesity and its associated disorders in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. However, most data are derived from animal and in vitro studies, and consequently the importance of SCFA and differential SCFA availability in human energy and substrate metabolism remains to be fully established. Well-controlled human intervention studies investigating the role of SCFA on cardiometabolic health are, therefore, eagerly awaited. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"acetic acid; butyric acid; G protein coupled receptor; glucagon like peptide 1; incretin; leptin; peptide YY; short chain fatty acid; volatile fatty acid; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; caloric intake; dietary fiber; energy balance; energy expenditure; food intake; gluconeogenesis; glucose homeostasis; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; lipid absorption; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; liver function; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; skeletal muscle; stomach absorption; stomach acid secretion; stomach emptying; weight control; body weight; drug effects; gastrointestinal tract; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Body Weight; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Microbiota",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941879755

In the analysis, experimental values obtained from the system operation over 12 representative days of each month in the period of January to December 2011 were utilized. The wind turbine and the solar panels considered for the assessment are subparts of a hybrid wind-PV system with hydrogen storage, installed at the Sustainable Energy Technology (SET) Center, Mechanical Engineering Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Various parameters, such as global irradiance, exergy of solar radiation, exergy losses and exergy efficiency of solar modules, and velocity of wind were analyzed and compared at the location. Among the selected days, the maximum average value of the solar irradiance was 631.49 Wm-2 on July 7 and the corresponding average exergy rate value of the solar radiation was 583.82 Wm-2 with a conversion efficiency of 4.38%, while the absolute exergy losses was calculated to be 95.61%. The minimum average value of the irradiance and the exergy of solar radiation were measured and calculated to be 350.45 and 326.56 Wm-2, respectively, with an exergy efficiency of 8.42% on a cloudy day in May 2011. It was calculated through the wind data analysis that the maximum average wind power density available on November 1, 2011 was 807.51 Wm-2, while the maximum average energy available to the wind turbine for the conversion into the useful output of the inverter was 53,855.74 Wh. It was also determined that the minimum value of the power density was 22.24 Wm-2 on January 3, 2011 and the corresponding maximum energy available to the turbine for conversion was 1,483.22 Wh.

One of possible ways to solve the above problem is to use an inductively-coupled duel transformer storage the solution allows one to solve the following two problems simultaneously: compensation of the poloidal current and increase of the load current. © 2015 IEEE.","Coatings; Electrodes; Generators; Magnetic circuits; Pulse generation; Resistance; Windings","Amplification; Artificial intelligence; Coatings; Electric generators; Electric resistance; Electric windings; Electrodes; Electromagnetic induction; Energy storage; Gas generators; Machine windings; Magnetic circuits; Problem solving; Winding; Coefficient of power; High-power pulse; Inductive storage; Inductively-coupled; Pulse generation; Repetitive pulse; Technical solutions; Unsolved problems; Pulse generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953455798

The very first basic one is a high-density energy source with long-Time energy storage and fast-Time release of the stored energy to the load. Another ones are associated with the pulsed generator operating either without additional external power sources or, at least, with the minimum number of ones, and the time varying external magnetic field which is inherent to all railguns. All the applied problems are associated with the type of the load. The revolver railgun design is proposed to solve these problems. This design has a number of advantages over the conventional railgun design. One can see for example that the railgun discharge current decreases proportionally to number of armature in the revolver railgun while the applied voltage increases, which is subject of the equality of both mass and velocity of armature. This allows one to optimize the parameters of the inductive storage and its opening switch. The revolver railgun design also increases its own spatial stability during series of repetitive shots of armatures, as well as stability of radial component of the railgun discharge currents and stability of launched armatures, which is associated with non uniformity of the radial magnetic field. Some specific space applications of a revolver railgun combined with a space-propulsion ion engine is discussed in the Appendix. © 2015 IEEE.","Electrodes; Engines; Force; Friction; Magnetic fields; Railguns; Rails","Design; Electrodes; Engines; Friction; Ion engines; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Problem solving; Rails; Solar system; Space applications; Stability; Discharge currents; External magnetic field; Force; High density energy; Inductive storage; Radial magnetic field; Space propulsions; Spatial stability; Rail guns",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953432618

Various biological and thermochemical processes of biomass are taken into consideration to find the most economical method of hydrogen production. Biohydrogen generated by biophotolysis method, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation is studied with respect to various feedstocks in Malaysia. The fermentation approaches of biohydrogen production have shown great potential to be a future substitute of fossil fuels. Dark fermentation method is a simple biological hydrogen production method that uses a variety of substrate and does not require any light as a source of energy. A promising future for biohydrogen production is anticipated by this process both industrially and commercially. Feasibility of hydrogen production from pyrolysis and water gasification of various biomass feedstock confirm that supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is the most cost-effective thermochemical process. Highly moisturized biomass could be employed directly in SCWG without any high-cost drying process. Indeed, a small amount of energy is required to pressurize hydrogen in the storage tank because of highly pressurized SCWG process. The cost of hydrogen produced by SCWG of biomass is about US$3/GJ (US$0.35/kg), which is extremely lower than biomass pyrolysis method (in the range of US$8.86/GJ to US$15.52/GJ) and wind-electrolysis systems and PV-electrolysis systems (US$20.2/GJ and US$41.8/GJ, respectively). The best feedstock for biomass-based hydrogen production is identified based on the availability, location of the sources, processes required for the preparation of the feedstock and the total cost of acquiring the feedstock. The cheapest and most abundantly available biomass source in Malaysia is the waste of palm industry. Hydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent and palm solid residue could play a crucial role in the energy mix of Malaysia. Malaysia has this great capability to supply about 40% of its annual energy demand by hydrogen production from SCWG of palm solid waste. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Biological process; Biomass; Hydrogen; Thermochemical process","Biomass; Cost effectiveness; Effluents; Electrolysis; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fossil fuels; Gasification; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Palm oil; Petroleum industry; Pyrolysis; Substrates; Bio-hydrogen production; Biological hydrogen production; Biological process; Biomass pyrolysis methods; Hydrogen production technology; Palm oil mill effluents; Supercritical water gasification (SCWG); Thermo chemical process; Photobiological hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940896296

In such a system, power is a key factor in the design requiring thermal and energy-saving considerations. Modern power estimators for FPGA either support specific hardware provided by FPGA vendors or contain power models for certain types of conventional FPGA architectures. However, with technology advancement, novel versatile FPGA architectures are introduced to further augment current FPGA architecture, such as emerging FPGA with non-volatile memory, nano-wire interconnection of reconfigurable array, etc. To evaluate the power consumption of various FPGA designs, the power estimator has to be made more flexible and extensible to support new devices and architectures. We introduce a novel power estimator with hierarchical library supporting power models at different levels, e.g. novel circuits of components, emerging memory devices, time-multiplexing architecture etc. The power estimator also supports coarse-grain or fine-grain power estimation defined by users for achieving complexity-accuracy trade-off. Simulation results of benchmarks on the proposed power estimator against commercial estimators demonstrate accuracy of our tool.

Up to now, it is significant but still a big challenge to exploit a facile and good-adaptability method to prepare QDs/GNS nanohybrids. In this work, a gel-like film (GF) mechanism was proposed for the first time, with easy operation, low cost, and universal applications in particular. By this route, millions of MnO QDs were homogeneously dispersed on the GNS surface, very similar to the dot fabric in real life, and presented superior long-term and rate performances for lithium storage benefiting from the positive effect of QDs and GNS. The reversible capacity after 80 cycles was 766.8mAhg-1, still higher than the theoretical value of MnO. More importantly, this GF method has universal adaptability for several types of MO (where M=Mn, Co, Fe, Ni) QDs/GNS nanohybrids.

Secondly, guided drop tests are performed to study the response of these materials when subjected to multiple dynamic loading (two impacts). Thirdly, finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out in order to simulate the compressive behavior of the studied materials under dynamic loading. Results show that agglomerated cork is an excellent alternative to the synthetic materials.

Various promising solvents are used to capture CO2 such as MEA, DEA, potassium carbonate and recently co-blending of solvents. However, the major drawbacks of using these solvents are degenerative issue, energy intensive for regeneration process and environmental impact. Traditionally, designing a solvent for carbon capture involves a trial and error approach where potential candidates are subjected to laboratory testing. However, this process is time-consuming and often has no guarantee that the tested solvent properties adhere to the desired property range. Hence, a systematic framework for optimal solvent design for CO2 capture is discussed in this paper. The solvent design problem has been formulated using model-based approach to meet specified target properties such as density, solubility, viscosity, vapour pressure, CO2 absorption capacity and thermal stability. The number of blend solvent was then systematically ranked according to a desired process performance, cost and environmental friendliness.

This pre-treatment process on fresh fruit bunches often involves a large amount of steam and pre-treatment processes. Hence, this produces a large amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and empty fruit bunch wastes. Moreover, additional drying processes are required to reduce the fruits' moisture content for quality and storage purposes. Microwave energy is perceived as an alternative bringing improvement to the current process by introducing rapid heating as well as to improve process efficiency. The rapid heating process can effectively reduce power, energy and time required, yet capable of achieving the desired temperature through interaction between microwave, polar water molecules and charged ions in fresh fruit bunches. Other than that, microwave pre-treatment is a good alternative as it not only reduces the moisture content of fresh fruit bunches but also eliminates the production of POME, which is inevitable in the current process. Therefore, microwave technology is regarded as a clean process in the fresh fruit bunches pre-treatment. This paper reports the effects of microwave on the flesh of the oil palm fruits - mesocarp. Moisture content, dimensions and structure of the mesocarp are evaluated. The experimental results show that under the microwave treatment, the drying time required to reduce the moisture content of the mesocarp to 10 %, at power levels of 50-200 W, ranged from 2-35 min with the reduction of dimensions ranged from 3.6-6.2 %. Although varying the power level of microwave showed some degree of shrinkage, no significant changes were observed on the surface of the mesocarp. The experimental results demonstrated that microwave drying could provide a quicker drying process that resulted in least destruction occurred on the surface of the mesocarp.

Most of the relevant biomass is produced in abundance in agriculture sector. In Malaysia, biomass supply is obtained mainly from oil palm plantation which governed under Federal Land Development Authority. Biomass supply chain deals with harvesting, storage, pretreatment and transportation. Low energy density of biomass combined with availability of biomass that is widely distributed contributes huge constraints to the problem. To address this issue, P-graph modelling is used as the methodology to solve combinatorial complexity of the biomass supply chain in Federal Land Development Authority Jengka. Few possible locations for building new biomass processing plant and storage hubs were introduced in the optimisation problem. Existing plant mills, hubs and possible plant locations were interconnected to create a network. Fuel consumption for transportation was calculated by taking into account the road profiles of the routes in Jengka. The resulting solution from Accelerated Branch and Bound algorithm in P-graph shows that the optimal solution is through building new plant in location 1, 2 and 4 for a profit of 77.35 M MYR/y (18.3 M €/y).

By assuming that the power generator will operate at full load at all time, the optimal capacity of the power generator and the energy storage (ES) device including the optimal schedule of the system is revealed. While the generator operates at maximum thermal efficiency, it may results in higher energy losses due to extensive inversion of current, and storage of energy. It also may lead to the needs of larger ES which could be expensive. In this article, the trade-of between generator thermal efficiency and ES-related losses is studied upon. A new set of heuristic is also introduced to discuss on the flexibility of operating the power generator. It is revealed that indeed by increasing the capacity of the generator and allowing flexibility to its operation, the overall efficiency of the DEG system will be higher. As for the economics, the cost of the system increases with increasing capacity of the power generator despite decreasing capacity of ES.

Carbon (more precisely, CO2) Capture and Storage (CCS) has been one of the proposed solutions to control CO2emissions. However, mitigating CO2emissions via CO2storage in geological reservoirs without utilisation is neither a sustainable solution, nor really a clean technology option. This paper introduces a new algebraic method for targeting the optimum CO2capture, utilisation and storage based on the Pinch Analysis approach. A new Total Site CO2Integration concept is introduced. The concept is to capture CO2with certain quality from various plants on the Total Site and inject it into CO2headers. The CO2headers are divided into certain composition ranges. The CO2headers can satisfy the CO2demands for various industries located along the headers, which require CO2as its raw material. The CO2can be further regenerated, and mixed as needed with pure CO2generated from one or multiple centralised CO2plant if required. The excess CO2is to be sent to geological storage. The proper utilisation of CO2will reduce the amount of CO2needed to be stored. This will extend the geological carbon storage-life capacity. Aside from estimating CO2utilisation, this method also allows an industrial site planner to identify the suitable industries that can act as CO2sources or CO2demands for a given region.

In this work, the possibility of the existence of longlived clusters of discrete breathers of different configurations is shown, their properties are studied, and the possibility of energy exchange between the discrete breathers in the cluster is demonstrated. These results are important for the discussion of physical processes occurring during dehydrogenation of graphane at high temperatures, which, in turn, is of great importance for the development of the hydrogen storage and transport devices based on sp2-carbon materials. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","a discrete breather; cluster; energy exchange; graphane; molecular dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944916463

Obesogenic EDCs have the potential to inappropriately stimulate adipogenesis and fat storage, influence metabolism and energy balance and increase susceptibility to obesity. Developmental exposure to obesogenic EDCs is proposed to interfere with epigenetic programming of gene regulation, partly by activation of nuclear receptors, thereby influencing the risk of obesity later in life. The goal of this minireview is to briefly describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity and to evaluate the evidence of a mechanistic link between altered epigenetic gene regulation by early life EDC exposure and latent onset of obesity. We summarize the results of recent in vitro, in vivo, and transgenerational studies, which clearly show that the obesogenic effects of EDCs such as tributyltin, brominated diphenyl ether 47, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mediated by the activation and associated altered methylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, the master regulator of adipogenesis, or its target genes. Importantly, studies are emerging that assess the effects of EDCs on the interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications in altered chromatin structure. These types of studies coupled with genome-wide rather than gene-specific analyses are needed to improve mechanistic understanding of epigenetic changes by EDC exposure. Current advances in the field of epigenomics have led to the first potential epigenetic markers for obesity that can be detected at birth, providing an important basis to determine the effects of developmental exposure to obesogenic EDCs in humans. © 2015 by the Endocrine Society.",,"endocrine disruptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tributyltin; endocrine disruptor; organotin compound; adipogenesis; chromatin structure; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; epigenetics; gene control; gene expression; histone modification; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; Review; animal; chemically induced; disease predisposition; drug effects; environmental exposure; epigenetics; female; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; obesity; pathophysiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Adipogenesis; Animals; Disease Susceptibility; DNA Methylation; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Trialkyltin Compounds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943644853

However, the ideal perfusion temperature for protection of the bile ducts is unknown. In this study, the optimal perfusion temperature for protection of the bile ducts was assessed. DCD rat livers were preserved by SCS for 6 hours. Thereafter, 1 hour of oxygenated MP was performed using either hypothermic machine perfusion, subnormothermic machine perfusion, or with controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR) conditions. Subsequently, graft and bile duct viability were assessed during 2 hours of normothermic ex situ reperfusion. In the MP study groups, lower levels of transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured compared to SCS. In parallel, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were significantly higher in the MP groups. Biomarkers of biliary function, including bile production, biliary bicarbonate concentration, and pH, were significantly higher in the MP groups, whereas biomarkers of biliary epithelial injury (biliary gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] and LDH), were significantly lower in MP preserved livers. Histological analysis revealed less injury of large bile duct epithelium in the MP groups compared to SCS. In conclusion, compared to SCS, end-ischemic oxygenated MP of DCD livers provides better preservation of biliary epithelial function and morphology, independent of the temperature at which MP is performed. End-ischemic oxygenated MP could reduce biliary injury after DCD liver transplantation.

The activities of the international community show an increase of ecological awareness. In the Central European countries the share of renewable energy in overall energy production is relatively small. One sector where some progress can be made is agriculture. This paper presents simulation results of CO2 reduction potential by replacing conventional heating system for a poultry house with a hybrid solar-wind system. Heat requirement for 2400 birds was calculated. Simple models for solar collector, wind turbine and heat storage tank are presented. The system is modelled in a Matlab/Simulink environment and various system configurations are analysed for climatic conditions typical for Central Europe. The solar collector area was varied between 0 and 80m2, wind turbine diameter was varied in the range of 0-20m and 1 to 4 heat storage tanks. Apart from percentage of CO2 emission reduction two other indicators are introduced: renewable energy utilisation ratio and weighted CO2 emission reduction - renewable energy utilisation coefficient. The results show that larger systems provide higher CO2 reduction but the energy utilisation ratio decreases. © 2015.","CO2 reduction; Renewable energy heating; Solar energy; Wind energy","bird; carbon dioxide; climate change; electrical power; emission control; energy use; greenhouse gas; heating; poultry; power generation; renewable resource; solar power; thermal power; wind power; Central Europe; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939510926

The losses of N, P, and C contribute to adverse environmental impacts, such as climate change, terrestrial acidification, and marine eutrophication. Manure management technologies to reduce losses and impacts have been developed, but often focus on a single compound only or a single stage in the management system and lead to trade-offs, such as pollution swapping. The aim of this study was to design strategies for integrated manure management (IS) which prevent pollution swapping and show that the environmental impact can be reduced throughout the manure management system. We used a structured design approach based on engineering design (ED) that consists of eight main steps: 1. define the goal of the design task and the system boundaries, 2. formulate a brief of requirements stating the needs for environmental reduction, 3. analyze the functions in the current manure management system, 4. list and describe emission processes and their process variables that lead to N, P, and C losses and resource use, 5. describe the functions needed in the manure management system to limit the emission processes or resource use, 6. generate principle-options that can fulfill the functions, 7. generate technical solutions for the principle-options, and 8. combine the principle-options and technical solutions into strategies for integrated manure management. In the design of strategies we considered the management of liquid and solid dairy cattle manure applied to grass and maize, and liquid pig manure applied to wheat, all under North West European conditions. The IS included the segregation of pig and dairy cattle urine and feces to reduce CH4, NH3, and N2O emission, addition of zeolite to solid cattle manure to reduce NH3 emission, bio-energy production from biogas that avoids fossil-based electricity and heat, acidification of urine during storage and acidification of feces prior to application, sealed storages, and improved application timing, place, and method of application. It was concluded that we were able to successfully design IS with high potential to reduce environmental impact. The design approach adapted from ED proved to be useful to structure the design process to provide insight into interactions of emission processes and find principle-options and technical solutions to prevent pollution swapping. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia; Eco-design; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen use efficiency; Slurry management; System analysis","acidification; ammonia; bioenergy; biogas; carbon; climate change; crop production; design; emission control; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; livestock farming; manure; nitrogen; nutrient loss; nutrient use efficiency; phosphorus; pollution incidence; slurry; systems analysis; trade-off; Europe; Animalia; Bos; Suidae; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934990866

Experimental results show that GTM nanohybrids have excellent photocatalytic activity for organic dyes under UV-vis light and good antibacterial activity. Besides, UV preexcitation can improve the adsorbability and photocatalytic durability of GTM nanohybrids for high-concentration dyes. These enhancements are attributed to the rapid separation of photogenerated carriers from reduced graphene oxide and surface defects induced by UV excitation, and the broad light absorption aroused by the narrow band gap and MnOx quantum dots simultaneously. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antibacterial activity; Energy storing; MnOx quantum dots; Reduced graphene oxide; UV preexcitation","Energy gap; Energy utilization; Light absorption; Nanocrystals; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Semiconductor quantum dots; Surface defects; Anti-bacterial activity; Energy storing; Environmental treatment; Excellent photocatalytic activities; High photocatalytic activities; Microwave methods; Photogenerated carriers; UV preexcitation; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928228600

Due to its high generation cost, it is expected that insular power systems experience an important increment in the power generation from renewable energy sources and, under this perspective, an energy storage system (ESS) could be the key factor to meet this goal. For these reasons, new approaches are necessary to optimize the scheduling of insular power systems, considering the specific characteristics of available ESSs.

The meta-heuristics implemented are Differential Search Algorithm (DSA) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) to solve the hard combinatorial scheduling problem. The deterministic method employs a relaxation of the non-convex Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) formulation in order to reduce the computational burden and the number of iterations in meta-heuristics. The implemented methods are tested with a 33-bus distribution network, 1800 Electric Vehicles (EV), 15 fixed storage, 66 Distributed Generation (DG), 10 energy suppliers and 1 utility-scale wind generation facility.

Adipocytokines control nutrition, thermogenesis, immunity, thyroid and reproductive hormones, and neuroendocrine functions. One of the most important new members of this family is apelin. In patients with thyroid dysfunctions, there are usually changes in weight, thermogenesis and adipose tissue lipolysis. Here, we investigated the serum apelin levels in different thyroid hormone states. Our study group consisted of the following patients: 32 thyrotoxicosis, 32 subclinical hyperthyroidism, 31 hypothyroidism, 34 subclinical hypothyroidism and 31 healthy control cases. In addition to routine blood tests, serum free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4), TSH and apelin levels were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) was recorded. In terms of the demographic characteristics, age and BMI, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P>0.05). The mean serum apelin levels of the groups were as follows: thyrotoxicosis group, 4.6±1.9 ng/ml; subclinical hyperthyroidism group, 3.7±1.9 ng/ml; hypothyroid group, 4.8±2.5 ng/ml; subclinical hypothyroidism group, 4.3±2.2 ng/mL; and control group, 3.4±1.4 ng/ml, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the mean apelin levels between the groups (P>0.05). The hypothyroid group had the highest and the control group had the lowest mean apelin levels. As a result, the apelin levels were higher in both the patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, in comparison with the normal population, but without statistical significance. © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The heat accumulator is located below a 9×15 m high plastic tunnel destined for tomato and cucumber production and contains two sections of 12.7 m3 of rock and one section of 26.1 m3 of rock. Several charging and discharging cycles have been conducted between 29 April and 14 May 2012 to evaluate storage potential and gain an insight into dynamics of storage operation. When the regular day-night charging and discharging cycles were conducted the mean night temperature between plants was higher by 3.7-9.5°C than mean temperature outside.

For the same chemical structure of the outer layer, a change in the radii of nanoparticles from 0.9 to 2.0 nm entails a sharp decline in the rate of their mass transfer to the polymer bulk. Dendrimers of the first and third generations are characterized by substantially different compatibilities with polystyrene. It is assumed that this effect is associated with an increase in the energy of interaction between dendrimers. When dendrimers of the first generation are introduced into polystyrene, the viscosity, glass-transition temperature, and storage modulus decrease, while the filling of polystyrene with dendrimers of the third generation insignificantly affects these characteristics of the polymer. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Glass transition; Mass transfer; Phase structure; Polystyrenes; Carbosilane dendrimer; Outer layer; Polymer bulk; Structure and properties; Terminal groups; Third generation; Dendrimers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941950634

There is broad agreement on the typical patterns that these dynamics follow, and models are readily available to forecast future technology adoption and diffusion. Most of the existing research, however, has not considered the dynamics of adoption and diffusion for technologies which rely on a common-pool resource (CPR). The sustainable exploitation of a common-pool resource imposes a natural limit on usage, and exploitation beyond this limit may deteriorate the resource. Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems use aquifers in the subsurface for space heating and cooling. Although these systems may significantly reduce the energy consumption of buildings, over-adoption or exploitation of the aquifer will yield thermal interactions between systems, reducing their efficiencies. The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the adoption dynamics of ATES systems, notably in regards to the effects of overexploitation on subsequent adoption. We present a hybrid model that connects an agent-based model of ATES adoption with a geohydrologic model of the aquifer, including building energy flows. We explore the behavior of the model across a range of alternative parameterizations, identify typical dynamics, and analyze the conditions under which each of the dynamics occurs. © 2014 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology.",,"Aquifers; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Diffusion; Dynamics; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Natural resources; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Adoption and diffusion; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Common pool resources; Future technologies; Heating and cooling; Sustainable exploitation; Technology diffusion; Thermal interaction; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955594093

This study uses 24 full-factorial designs, a factorial arrangement with four factors at two-levels and one center point. The following factors are considered in this study: the inlet diameter of the inlet flow, the direction of the flow, the fuel cell orientation and the height of the second storage vessel. The inlet diameters of the inlet flow under consideration are 1.5, 2.38 and 4 mm. The directions of the flow are bottom and top. The orientation is selected between vertical and horizontal. The height of the second storage tank varies from 50 mm to 70 mm, in 10 mm intervals. The results show that the direction of the flow has the most significant effect on the greatest methanol flux, and the next most significant factor is the orientation, while the inlet diameter of the inflow and the height of the second storage vessel play only minor roles. However, the interaction between the inlet diameter of the inflow and the height of second storage tank shows a significant effect that must be considered.

In order to effectively make use of the demand response potentials of buildings, this paper presents a novel air-conditioning system with proactive demand control for daily load shifting and real time power balance in the developing smart grid. This system consists of a chilled water storage system (CWS) and a temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) air-conditioning system, which can significantly reduce the storage volume of the chilled water tank and effectively enable a building with more flexibility in changing its electricity usage patterns. The power demand of the proposed air-conditioning system can be flexibly controlled as desired by implementing two types of demand response strategies: demand side bidding (DSB) strategy and demand as frequency controlled reserve (DFR) strategy, in respond to the day-ahead and hour-ahead power change requirements of the grid, respectively. Considerable benefits (e.g., energy and cost savings) can be achieved for both the electricity utilities and building owners under incentive pricing or tariffs.

The wound rotor synchronous generator operates as AC voltage source whereas the power electronic converter as fully controllable current source. The converter with embedded energy storage delivers active and reactive power. The first main role of the converter is to deliver reactive power, what results in zero reactive power demanded from the synchronous generator. Thus the synchronous generator moves from cosφ = 0.8 to cosφ = 1. So if the generator keeps its rated current and unity power factor than its active power rises about 25%. Moreover the operation with cosφ = 1 results in significant reduction of its excitation current. Additionally the ability of quick production of the active and reactive power, by the parallel connected converter, keeps voltage and frequency stability in transients and so it permits to accept step load. Such a generation system that consists of the wound rotor synchronous generator, the parallel power electronic converter and common control of power flow is called 'Synchrogenverter'.

We found that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of Co-on-graphene and Os-doped-MoTe2 systems change linearly with electric field, opening the possibility of electric field tuning MA of these compounds. In addition, charging can rotate the easy-axis direction of Co-on-graphene and Os-doped-MoTe2 systems from the out-of-plane (in-plane) to in-plane (out-of-plane) direction. The tunable MA of the studied materials is crucial for nanoscale electronic technologies such as data storage and spintronics devices.

However, due to the huge propagation attenuation, energy efficiency is widely regarded as the biggest bottleneck for large-scale applications. Thus, it is significantly essential to explore appropriate transmission policies for the system to improve the global energy efficiency. To this end, this paper focuses on the optimum transmission policies in sensor networks scenario, where a mobile control center powers the sensor node by RF signal and then collects information from sensor node. Based on whether there is an energy storage at the sensor node, two related schemes, called as harvest-and-use scheme and harvest-store-use scheme, are investigated, respectively. In harvest-and-use scheme, as a baseline, both constant and optimal adaptive transmission strategies are discussed. In harvest-store-use scheme, an explicit closed-form expression of optimal transmission policy is derived in terms of throughput maximization, which can greatly enhance the system performance by opportunistic energy transfer with the help of energy storage. According to the simulation results, a considerably large improvement can be observed by employing the optimum transmission policy developed in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.","energy harvesting; opportunistic energy transfer; optimum transmission policy; throughput maximization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953729471

The HEV derives its propulsion power from two sources - an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor. The EMS receives inputs of throttle position, vehicle speed, engine rpm and battery state of charge (SOC). Based on a certain control algorithm, it then determines the two sources' operation status and power distribution, and charging of battery pack.

Determination of the most suitable energy storage alternative can be analyzed by using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. There are many criteria that affect the best energy storage alternative and the aims are contrasting so, MCDM methodology is a good approach to solve these problems. In this paper, a hybrid MCDM methodology that consists of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and TOPSIS based on type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed. To obtain more flexible evaluation and more precise results the proposed methodology combines type-2 fuzzy AHP that used to determine the weights of criteria and type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS methodology that analyzes the alternatives with respect to criteria and weights. The proposed methodology has been used to determine the most suitable energy storage alternatives. For this aim, 6 electrical energy storage alternatives are considered with a hierarchical structure of 4 main and 18 sub–criteria.

Researchers uses mathematical or physical models while the industry uses test vehicle or high-fidelity test rigs. However, both have a common objective: reducing the gap between the model and the reality. Accurate estimation of energy losses is necessary to provide a better estimate of the amount of energy that can be harvested and to determine project feasibility. This paper presents an off-line Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation wherein physical models and realtime data are used to estimate the kinetic energy losses in the urban driving cycle. A physical model of an drive-train of a passenger car is modeled using Bond Graph which also estimates the kinetic energy losses at the wheels. This model is further modified to include a modulated input with real-time urban driving cycle, thus forming a off-line HIL model. The real-time urban driving cycle is generated for representative road network using a passenger car fitted with a data acquisition unit. The physical model with modulated effort provides an estimate the amount of energy that can be gainfully harvested using Parallel Regenerative Braking System (PRBS). Using physical models and real data from actual vehicles in a low cost, general, off-line Hardware-in-the Loop (HIL) simulation, we show that designers can validate new automotive concepts even before prototypes become available while maintaining strict performance, quality requirements and time-to-market constraints. © 2014 IEEE.","Acceleration Assist; Energy Harvesting; Light Motor Vehicles; Off-line Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation; Pneumatic drive train; Regenerative Braking","Artificial intelligence; Automobiles; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Energy harvesting; Estimation; Graphic methods; Hardware; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Passenger cars; Reconfigurable hardware; Regenerative braking; Synthetic apertures; Traction (friction); Transportation; Vehicles; Accurate estimation; Data-acquisition units; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Hardware in-the-loop simulation; Motor vehicle; Quality requirements; Regenerative braking systems; Urban driving cycles; Graph theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944410574

Freight transport is usually motorized, at least in developed countries. It consumes considerable amounts of energy, which lead to considerable emissions of greenhouse gas CO2 and air pollutants like NOx, SO2, PM10(and PM2.5) both on land and at sea. These emissions constitute a serious threat to planet earth and the health of the species living on it. Awareness of this problem has led to various steps by governments, vehicle suppliers and transport vehicle users to mitigate these emissions. Containers are a very economical, practical and increasingly popular means of transport and storage of goods. Forecasts indicate that the number of TEU's transported worldwide is likely to at least triple in the next 20 years. Global problems start with local decisions. A local case study is used to answer the question if it is feasible to triple the handling of containers in a specific seaport container terminal by 2033 and maintain its 2008-emission levels of CO2, NOx and PM10 by operational measures at the marine side of this terminal? This paper indicates that if instruments like fleet renewal, cleaner ship fuels and shore power are combined, a container terminal can triple the number of TEU handled while stabilizing marine CO2 emissions, nearly halving its marine NOx emissions and drastically reducing its PM10 emissions.","Container terminals; Energy and emission reduction potential; Operational choices","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Earth (planet); Economics; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Population statistics; Port terminals; Railroad yards and terminals; Ship instruments; Container terminal; Developed countries; Economic growths; Energy and emissions; Freight transport; Operational choice; Transport vehicles; World population; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119636969

A low-energy particle can flip the output of a gate, resulting in a soft error if it propagates to a circuit output. Thus, soft error tolerance has become an important criterion in digital system design. In this work, we propose a simulation-based approach to reduce the soft error probability of circuit failure in combinational logic circuits. The proposed method is based on maximizing the probability of logical masking when a soft error occurs. This maximization is done by extracting sub-circuits from an original multi-level circuit, and then re-synthesizing each extracted sub-circuit to increase fault masking against a single fault. We present a two-level synthesis scheme to maximize soft error masking on each extracted sub-circuit. This scheme provides a heuristic that finds the best set of cubes to cover the input patterns of an extracted sub-circuit. A Fast Extraction (FX) algorithm is used to enhance the area overhead of synthesized two-level sub-circuits. Experimental results on some MCNC combinational benchmarks show that, on average, a probability of circuit failure reduction of 32% is achieved compared to the original circuit. The average area overhead is 40% of the original circuit. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Combinational circuit reliability; fault tolerance; single event transient; single event upset; Soft errors","Combinatorial circuits; Cosine transforms; Cosmology; Digital storage; Error correction; Errors; Fault tolerance; Integrated circuits; Microprocessor chips; Probability; Radiation hardening; Transients; Combinational benchmarks; Combinational logic circuits; Digital system design; Simulation based approaches; Simulation-based method; Single event transients; Single event upsets; Soft error; Low power electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027936260

Based on the theoretical point of view, graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) crystal structure with sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arrangement and has attracted extensive attention in a considerable number of applications such as solar energy, sensor and energy storage, naming a few. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) is synthesized from graphite flakes using the Improved Hummer's method. The results demonstrated the comparison of synthesized GO samples based on stirred duration of 6 h and 72 h. The FTIR results proved that the 72 h GO sample was well-bonded with the C-O functional group, signifying the successful synthesis of GO under an extended stirred duration. The FESEM images showed that the synthesized GO was well-arranged in crystal lattice of graphene sheets whereas the EDX result showed that higher atomic% of Oxygen, O2 was obtained with a longer stirred duration due to the high opportunity for oxygenated bonded to occur on the C-C functional group.

As such, it is the primary sensor for nutrient availability in the milieu of an organism, which it communicates to the body through the excretion of hormones. Adipose tissue regulates a multitude of body functions associated with metabolism, such as gluconeogenesis, feeding and nutrient uptake. The immune system forms a vital layer of protection against micro-organisms that try to gain access to the nutrients contained in the body. Because infections need to be resolved as quickly as possible, speed is favored over energy-efficiency in an immune response. Especially when immune cells are activated, they switch to fast, but energy-inefficient anaerobic respiration to fulfill their energetic needs. Despite the necessity for an effective immune system, it is not given free rein in its energy expenditure. Signals derived from adipose tissue limit immune cell numbers and activity under conditions of nutrient shortage, whereas they allow proper immune cell activity when food sources are sufficiently available. When excessive fat accumulation occurs, such as in diet-induced obesity, adipose tissue becomes the site of pathological immune cell activation, causing chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Obesity is therefore associated with a number of disorders in which the immune system plays a central role, such as atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In this review, we will discuss the way in which adipose tissue regulates activity of the immune system under healthy and pathological conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adipocytes; Immune system; Inflammation; Malnutrition; Obesity; Starvation","adipocytokine; adipocytokine; adipocyte; adipose tissue; cell activation; diet induced obesity; homeostasis; human; immune system; immunity; immunocompetent cell; immunoregulation; intraabdominal fat; malnutrition; nutrient; obesity; Review; starvation; tissue metabolism; adipose tissue; animal; cytology; diet; energy metabolism; food; homeostasis; immune system; immunology; immunomodulation; malnutrition; metabolism; signal transduction; Adipokines; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Food; Homeostasis; Humans; Immune System; Immunity; Immunomodulation; Malnutrition; Obesity; Signal Transduction; Starvation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952877023

This kind of investigation with the use of numerical methods implementation is much easier and less expensive than stand tests. Various 3D models of the landing gear part are defined for the multistage static FE analysis. A complete system of the main landing gear was mapped as a deformable 3D numerical model for dynamic analysis with the use of LS-Dyna code. In this 3D deformable FE model, developed in a drop test simulation, the following matters were taken into consideration: contact problems between collaborating elements, the phenomena of energy absorption by a gas-liquid damper placed in the landing gear and the response of the landing gear during the touchdown of a flexible wheel with the ground. The results of numerical analyses for the selected drop tests and the results from the experiments carried out on a real landing gear were used for verification of FE models and a methodology of the landing gear dynamics analysis. The results obtained from the various simulations of the touchdown have proved the effectiveness of the 3D numerical model and how many problems can be solved in the course of only one numerical run, e.g. geometric and material nonlinearities, a question of contact between the mating components, investigation of the landing gear kinematics, investigation of the energy dissipation problem in the whole system and the stresses influence on the structure behaviour, which can appear in some elements due to overload. © Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Such elementwise troubleshooting of electric equipment components does not allow evaluation of their interaction within the complex system of start and brake operating modes of subway cars. Thus, car-repair workshops may deliver subway cars with hidden flaws that are difficult to detect. In order to avoid such a situation, a test run of subway cars is carried out. However, this method does not always allow detecting the exact cause of breakdown, since evaluation of the quality of electric equipment functionality is difficult—only the observable features of car movement are checked (smoothness, presence or lack of shoves, intensity of acceleration and braking, behavior of protection units of the traction motors and power circuits). Thus, a necessity arises to carry out additional test runs of subway cars, which leads to an increase of the costs of adjustment and commissioning. This article covers the results of work on improvement of the procedure of electric equipment functional inspection for subway cars (type 81-717/714), which was done in the Vykhino electric engine house. It is offered to check functioning of electric equipment of subway cars in the car-repair workshop using a stationary testing stand by means of simulation of electric equipment operating regimes that correspond to actual conditions at the operating values of current and voltage in power circuits of subway cars. Actual operating regimes of power equipment of subway cars are simulated using a condenser-type energy storage charged in advance using an external power source. Quality inspection of functioning of the subway cars electric equipment is based on analysis of the power circuit current graphs obtained during stand testing. Use of the proposed system of functional inspection of electric equipment reduces labor by 20–30% for adjustment and commissioning of subway cars that underwent rehabilitation repair. © 2015, Allerton Press, Inc.","current graph; electric equipment; energy storage; functional inspection; power circuit; subway car; testing stand","Electric equipment; Electric equipment protection; Electric network analysis; Electric traction; Energy storage; Inspection; Quality control; Railroads; Repair; Subway cars; Terminals (electric); Actual conditions; Electric engines; Element by elements; Operating regimes; Power circuit; Protection units; Quality inspection; Testing stand; Equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947077793

Many metabolites are intrinsically instable, particularly some of those associated with central carbon metabolism. While enzymatic conversions have been studied in great detail, nonenzymatic, chemical conversions received comparatively little attention. This review aims to give an in-depth overview of nonenzymatic energy metabolite degradation/interconversion chemistry focusing on a selected range of metabolites.

The MVN NWs have abundant active sites accessible to charge storage, and the N-doped carbon shell suppresses electrochemical dissolution of the inner MVN NWs in an alkaline electrolyte, leading to excellent capacitive properties. The flexible MVN@NC NWs film electrode delivers a high areal capacitance of 282 mF cm-2 and exhibits excellent long-term stability with 91.8% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles in a KOH electrolyte. All-solid-state flexible SCs assembled by sandwiching two flexible MVN@NC NWs film electrodes with alkaline poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), sodium polyacrylate, and KOH gel electrolyte boast a high volumetric capacitance of 10.9 F cm-3, an energy density of 0.97 mWh cm-3, and a power density of 2.72 W cm-3 at a current density of 0.051 A cm-3 based on the entire cell.

The X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed the presence of two phases in the composites: a crystalline Ni phase and an amorphous PNBZT phase. Composites (x)Ni-(1-x)PNBZT with compositions below the percolation threshold manifest a negative magnetoresistance, whose highest values of 0.13% at 287K and 0.78% at 77K are observed near the percolation threshold at kh{cyrillic}s{cyrillic}=35 at.% for a composite sample of 0.31Ni-0.69PNBZT placed in a constant magnetic field with the strength of 8000Oe.

The charge transport in the composites (x)Ni-(1-x)PNBZT over a temperature interval of 188-287K is shown to be attributed to the inelastic resonant tunneling of electrons through energy barriers in a dielectric layer of PNBZT between crystalline ferromagnetic nanogranules of Ni.

Recently, micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have advanced rapidly as potential micro-sized power sources, but it is still challenging to build the micro-device using cost-effective technologies for large-scale manufacture. Here, we developed a simple solution-processible method to fabricate microelectrode patterns using a water-dispersible graphene/sulfonated polyaniline (rG/SP) as the active MSC material. The highly stabilized rG/SP dispersion in aqueous solution enables the direct thin-film deposition on flexible substrates and the formation of interdigital patterns by plasma etching. The as-fabricated solid-state MSC delivers an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 3.31mF/cm2 and volumetric stack capacitance of 16.55F/cm3 with excellent rate and cycling performance. Furthermore, the rG/SP based MSC demonstrates a superior energy density of 1.51mWh/cm3 while maintaining high power density.

SnO2 is considered as a high capacity anode for Na-ion batteries with a theoretical capacity of 1378mAh/g. However, several limitations, such as large volume expansion with cycling, slow kinetics and low electrical conductance, have severely limited its performance. In this article, we demonstrate an anode consisting of a SnO2 nanocrystal layer grown on hierarchical microfibers of carbon cloth (CC) with extra surface coating to addresses the above challenges associated with SnO2 anodes. The soft nature of CC and the nanocrystal structure of SnO2 layers can effectively accommodate the volume change associated with the sodiation process. In addition, the effect from an extra coating layer of carbon (C/SnO2/CC) and Al2O3 (Al2O3/SnO2/CC) have been explored and the results showed that the extra coating layer can further enhance the performance of SnO2 anode. The C/SnO2/CC core-shell structure anode achieved a 501mAh/g and a 144mAh/g capacity at 0.1C and 30C charge/discharge rate, respectively. Meanwhile, a 375mAh/g specific capacity after 100 deep cycles with an 80% retention is achieved by Al2O3/SnO2/CC anode.

In response, the Dutch government initiated a gas-hub strategy, which is the policy to transform the gas industry from an export-oriented business into a transit-oriented business. This policy included a number of investments in the gas infrastructure as well as institutional reforms to enhance the liquidity of the gas market. We study the effects of this gas-hub policy. Using hourly data on the Dutch gas balance over the period 2006-2013, we find that gas storage and trading have become more important, but that the level of gas in transit in the Netherlands remained fairly constant. Consequently, the Dutch gas industry is still mainly oriented on domestic production and export of gas, while the Dutch gas hub (TTF) has become a key virtual trading place. The policy lesson from the Dutch experience is that implementing a gas-hub strategy requires significant investments in the gas infrastructure, while their effects do not necessarily become visible in the short run. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Gas depletion; Gas policy; Gas transport; Gas-hub strategy; The Netherlands","Digital storage; Gas producers; Gases; International trade; Investments; Natural gas deposits; Domestic production; Gas balances; Gas storage; Gas transport; Hub strategy; Institutional reforms; Netherlands; Virtual trading; Gas industry; energy market; energy policy; gas industry; gas production; gas trade; natural gas; policy strategy; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937719803

In this study, we aimed to assess the potential of newly designed strategies for integrated manure management (IS) to reduce environmental impact. An important aspect of the strategies was that they prevented pollution swapping. Life cycle assessment was used to compute climate change (CC), fossil fuel depletion (FFD), terrestrial acidification (TA), marine eutrophication (ME), particulate matter formation (PMF), N use efficiency (NUE), and phosphorus over application rate (POA), relative to the crop demand for N. We applied the IS to North West European practice (Ref) and included the Dutch current situation of progressive manure management (NL) to illustrate the potential of the IS to reduce environmental impact. Manure management in Ref included production and management of liquid and solid dairy cattle manure applied to maize and grass, and liquid pig manure applied to wheat. A Monte Carlo uncertainty simulation was done to assess the effect of variation in N and C losses and N uptake by crops on the comparison with Ref, IS, and NL. Results showed that the IS reduced all environmental impacts in all manure product and crop combinations and more than doubled the NUE (70% compared with maximum 33% in Ref). Main causes were: segregation of pig and dairy cattle urine and feces inside the housing system reduced methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) emissions; addition of zeolite to solid dairy cattle manure reduced NH3 emission; sealed storages in all IS reduced volatilization of N and C; bio-energy production from the feces reduced the production of fossil electricity and heat; and finally N emissions in the field were reduced by ammonia emission reducing application techniques and improved application management (tillage, field traffic en synchronization of manure product application with crop demand). Compared with the Ref, NL had lower TA, PMF, POA, and higher NUE, except for solid cattle manure applied to grass.

However, economically feasible and sustainable energy production from microalgae requires optimization of cultivation conditions for both biomass yield and lipid production of microalgae. Biomass yield and lipid production in microalgae are a contradictory problem because required conditions for both targets are different. Simultaneously, the mass cultivation of microalgae for biofuel production also depends extremely on the performance of the microalgae strains used. In this study a green unicellular microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana (DS6) isolated from the holding tanks of farm wastewater treatment plant using multi-step screening and acclimation procedures was found high-lipid producing facultative heterotrophic microalgae strain capable of growing on dairy farm effluent (DFE) for biodiesel feedstock and wastewater treatment.

In the half cell test, the 3D LiMn2O4 nanorod arrays exhibit both high gravimetric capacity (∼130 mAh g-1) and areal capacity (∼0.25 mAh cm-2), while maintaining good cycling stability and rate capability.

Nevertheless, the PV circuit can be left in open-circuit mode to increase the effective thermal absorption or the PV electricity generated can be used to heat the storage fluid through a secondary electrical heating element. Annual dynamic simulations using representative solar water heating system sizes and representative PV-T technology were conducted for these three configurations. The purpose was to indirectly determine how they would perform on a temporary basis if used on demand by grid-operators as part of the renewable energy resources at their disposal. The results show that the use of local PV electricity to heat the storage fluid caused the shortest pump running time and lowest auxiliary energy consumption of all cases considered. In light of these results, it is reasonable to state that this solution is more efficient than disabling the PV array to increase the heat available at the collector.

In order to cope with the challenges of demand uncertainty under the unbundled electricity market, the concept of Market-based Control Mechanism (MCM) in retail market environment has been emerging. This paper presents the concept considering demand elasticity as an opportunity in retail market environment for inventing a new bid mechanism. This work formulates demand elasticity model as a Markov decision problem and implements pursuit algorithm as a machine learning technique to evaluate the price elasticity of demand by predicting the price. The performance of the algorithm is compared with the numerical calculation of price elasticity of demand for the given simulation settings. © 2015 IEEE.","Demand Elasticity; Demand Response; Electricity Market; Pursuit Algorithm","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Decision theory; Economic analysis; Elasticity; Electric industry; Learning systems; Power markets; Sales; Demand elasticities; Demand response; Liberalized energy markets; Machine learning techniques; Markov decision problem; Numerical calculation; Price-elasticity of demand; Pursuit algorithms; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951336018

Methods to model households at individual level are discussed in this paper for the purposes of evaluating the integration of PV-systems and HPs and applying distributed energy storage within LV networks. The paper demonstrated that current LV-network design assumptions are insufficient regarding these expected developments.

As a result, the distribution system (DS) has been given specific importance. Especially, residential end-users have been rendered active trough the introduction of several assets such as electric vehicles, energy storage systems and self-production units. Although many opportunities emerge from the spreading of these so-called 'smart' households, the DS may be negatively affected if appropriate coordination techniques are not developed. At this point, the distribution system operators (DSO) that are responsible for the operation of the DS need to intervene. The smart households struggle to minimize their daily electricity procurement cost by exploiting dynamic pricing tariff schemes. On the other hand, the DSO aims to minimize the active power losses of the DS. DS reconfiguration is a core element of the daily operational practice of DSO and should be considered in the development of coordination strategies. In this study, a two-side interaction framework is proposed in order to guarantee that both the smart households and the DSO sufficiently achieve their individual goals. State-of-the art computing techniques are also used in order to render the proposed formulation tractable for real-life applications. © 2015 IEEE.","demand response; distribution system reconfiguration; grid computing; smart households","Costs; Electric energy storage; Grid computing; Coordination technique; Demand response; Distribution system reconfiguration; Electricity procurement; Energy storage systems; Environmental concerns; Real-life applications; smart households; Digital instruments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951320163

The ACs’ application potentials in dye removal and supercapacitor electrodes were also demonstrated. The porous structure and surface properties of the ACs were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the surface area of the as-prepared ACs was up to 1000 m2/g. In the dye removal tests, these DDGS-based ACs exhibited a maximum adsorption ratio of 477 mg/g on methylene blue. In electric double layer capacitors, electrochemical tests indicated that the ACs had ideal capacitive and reversible behaviors and exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance varied between 120 and 210 F/g under different scan rates and current densities. In addition, the capacitors showed excellent stability even after one thousand charge–discharge cycles. The specific capacitance was further increased up to 300 F/g by in situ synthesis of MnO2 particles in the ACs to induce pseudo-capacitance. This research showed that the DDGS-based ACs had great potentials in environmental remediation and energy storage applications.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to separate CO2 from the rest of the flue gas. The main disadvantage of these techniques is the large amount of energy that is required for the separation, which means a relative reduction of the overall efficiency of a power plant. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a new developing clean-combustion technology that has the advantage of inherent CO2 separation ability. Thus, storage-ready, concentrated CO2 can be obtained without the use of above-mentioned energy-intensive separation operations. This process involves two separate reactors, i.e., an air and a fuel reactor, and an oxygen carrier material which circulates between the reactors in order to extract and transport oxygen from air to fuel for many cycles. It is essential for oxygen carrier to be reactive, cheap to prepare, and durable over many cycles of reduction and oxidation at high reaction temperatures. Because of its good thermodynamical properties, physical strength, low cost, and low toxicity, iron oxide is a good candidate to be an oxygen carrier in CLC. This study will present a brief summary of developments obtained via CLC processes utilizing iron oxides as oxygen carrier. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Temperature-programmed-desorption results showed that the addition of 10 wt.% of Co2NiO to the 4MgH2-Li3AlH6 composite improved the onset desorption temperature to 125 °C and 230 °C for the first two dehydrogenation stages. The temperatures were reduced to about 65 °C and 30 °C compared to un-doped composite. The rehydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics of 4MgH2-Li3AlH6 composite doped with 10 wt.% Co2NiO were also enhanced significantly compared to un-doped composite. The activation energy for the hydrogen desorption decreased after 10 wt.% of Co2NiO was added, which was 124 kJ/mol compared to un-doped 4MgH2-Li3AlH6 composite which was 149 kJ/mol. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the new phase formation of Co1.29Ni1.71O4 and Al-Ni in the doped composite after the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation processes. It was believed that these two compounds acted as a catalyst in the 4MgH2-Li3AlH6-10 wt.% Co2NiO composite which may promote the interaction of MgH2 and Li3AlH6. The reduction of particle's size due to the presence of Co2NiO may also accelerated the hydrogen sorption performance of the MgH2-Li3AlH6 composite system. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This paper presents the different options of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies regarding the legislative initiatives implemented in the new European energy policy. This new European energy strategy was established taking into consideration not only energy demand but also social and environmental requirements. Taking that into account, the different strategies adopted by the European energy council are discussed and an overview of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies—a mitigation strategy able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—and the CO2 potential utilization were also addressed. Conventional and unconventional CO2 geological storage/sequestration reservoirs are analysed, taking into consideration the different properties of both types of reservoirs. Finally, it is possible to conclude that coal seams must play a major role in CCS/CCUS technologies, since coal is considered as an efficient technological solution to CO2 geological storage/sequestration. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CCS technologies; CCUS technologies; CO2; Coal seam; European energy policy; Reservoir","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Energy management; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Reservoirs (water); Carbon capture and storage; CCS technologies; Coal seams; European energy policy; Legislative initiatives; Renewable energy use; Social and environmental; Technological solution; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; coal seam; demand analysis; emission; emission control; energy policy; energy use; greenhouse gas; literature review; renewable resource; reservoir; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937520931

The technical, social, regulatory and economical effects of the renewable energy and ICT driven energy transition are discussed based on requirements which the distribution network should comply with. The discussed technologies all have effects on multiple requirements for the distribution network and the mitigation of unwanted effects should be assessed on these areas simultaneously.

As opposing to the existing literature, we focus on implementation of a dual technology ESS, which we believe is more beneficial than a single ESS. To show this, we introduce an optimal control model, in which the goal is to maximize the revenues of the dual technology energy storage system applied into two different energy markets, assuming the selling and buying electricity prices are exogenous.

In this paper, two candidate methods to address the flexibility issues in such models are evaluated. A unit commitment model developed at the JRC, DispaSET 2.0, is used as a test case for the different simplified flexibility assessment tools. The modelled geographical area is Belgium, using historical data for the demand and VRE curves and their day-ahead forecast. Different VRE penetration scenarios are simulated to evaluate the flexibility of the power system. The simplified assessment tools are then run with the same inputs.

The thermophysical properties of the GM-MPCM and the thermal and mechanical properties of the GM-MPCM mortar were investigated. The results indicated that more than 50% of the paraffin (PCM used in this study) could be effectively encapsulated in the GM-MPCM. A thermal cycle test showed that thermal energy storage capacity of the GM-MPCM had not been reduced undergoing 10 thermal cycles. In addition, the diameters of the most GM-MPCM with approximately 7.74 μm polyurea shell ranges from 150 to 350 μm. Thermal performance tests using room models revealed that the small room models prepared with GM-MPCM-CM panels can reduce both the temperature fluctuations and maximum indoor centre temperature effectively. The cement mortars with GM-MPCM can be used for thermal energy storage in buildings. Moreover, adding GM-MPCM into cement would also lower and delay the hydration heat, which is helpful to reduce the thermal cracking of cement-based materials. Although adding GM-MPCM can weaken the mechanical strength of cement mortar, the compressive and flexural strengths of cement mortar with 20% GM-MPCM by weight of cement were still as high as 32.9 MPa and 7.6 MPa, respectively. Therefore, the cement mortars with different GM-MPCM are suitable structural and functional building materials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows the method of estimation the battery service life in a photovoltaic system under variable irradiance. The results are computed for one year period and presented in respect to PV and consumption ratio for various buffer sizes.

In this study, a single leg multi-mode power converter, which includes a boost and bidirectional converters to control power flows between energy sources and loads, has been used as a dc/dc converter. This converter has cost effectiveness and fault tolerance features with respect to fewer switches. In order to ensure optimal power flow between energy sources and loads, a novel power control algorithm has been developed. This power control algorithm operates based on input energy from wind turbine, battery state of charge (SOC), and load condition. The proposed system is implemented with Matlab&Simulink software and to verify the performances of the proposed power management control strategy, several simulation studies are performed under different operation conditions.

In this work, the focus is to manage the energy among the PV based active generator, load and interconnected grid and energy controller architecture for that purpose is presented. It considers availability of the solar resources, storage system and load requirements. If there is lack of energy from the active generator, then the grid supplies remaining energy. For architecture of energy controller, Stateflow ® model is used. It uses available energy information from PV array, battery storage with super-capacitors and load requirements for managing the energy flow and it provides control signals to the power conditioning devices, which are used for integrating the sources.

In particular, we will concentrate on electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion using nanoporous metal-polymer composite materials. A materials system that mimic the properties of human skeletal muscles upon an outside stimulus is coined an ‘artificial muscle.’ In contrast to piezoceramics, nanoporous metallic materials offer a unique combination of low operating voltages, relatively large strain amplitudes, high stiffness, and strength. Here we will discuss smart materials where large macroscopic strain amplitudes up to 10 % and strain-rates up to 10−2 s−1 can be achieved in nanoporous metal/polymer composite. These strain amplitudes and strain-rates are roughly 2 and 5 orders of magnitude larger than those achieved in common actuator materials, respectively. Continuing on the theme of energy-related applications, in the summary and outlook, we discuss two recent developments toward the integration of nanoporous metals into energy conversion and storage systems. We specifically focus on the exciting potential of nanoporous metals as anodes for high-performance water electrolyzers and in next-generation lithium-ion batteries. © 2015, The Author(s).",,"Composite materials; Energy conversion; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Metals; Muscle; Nanostructured materials; Piezoelectric ceramics; Actuator materials; Energy conversion and storages; Low operating voltage; Macroscopic strains; Materials systems; Mechanical energies; Nanoporous metals; Orders of magnitude; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946493938

For that purpose gelatins with various degrees of succinylation are obtained. Extensive succinylation hampers helix formation and gel strength is slightly reduced. At high degrees of succinylation the helix propensity, gelling/melting temperatures, concomitant transition enthalpy, and gel strength become calcium-sensitive, and relatively low calcium concentrations largely restore these properties. Although succinylation has a major impact on the brittleness of the gels formed and the addition of calcium makes the material less brittle compared to nonmodified gelatin, the modification has no impact on the energy balance in the gel, where all energy applied is elastically stored in the material. This is explained by the unaffected stress relaxation by the network and high water-holding capacity related to the small mesh sizes in the gels. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","calcium binding; gelatin; protein gel; rheology; succinylation","Binding energy; Brittleness; Food storage; Fracture mechanics; Gels; Plasticity; Restoration; Rheology; Stress relaxation; Calcium binding; Calcium concentration; Electrostatic repulsion; gelatin; Intermolecular interactions; Protein gel; Succinylation; Textural characteristic; Calcium; calcium; gelatin; gelatin succinate; protein binding; succinic acid derivative; animal; chemistry; elasticity; flow kinetics; pig; taste; temperature; viscosity; Animals; Calcium; Elasticity; Gelatin; Protein Binding; Rheology; Succinates; Swine; Taste; Temperature; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938723458

In this letter, a rapid and facile approach to synthesize high quality graphene layers with large mass production has been developed. The method depends on the intercalation of graphite flakes with tartaric acid. The treated graphite subjected to a thermal shock at 750 °C for 60 s and followed by solvothermal treatment in the presence of isopropanol at 400 °C for 2 h. The produced graphene layers have an average thickness of 0.53 nm which depicted the production of a monolayer graphene. The FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the produced graphene layers have very low surface defects compared to reported approaches. The XPS spectra revealed that the surface of the produced graphene layers contains only 6 at% oxygen, which is better than the reduced graphene by conventional methods.

Conversion and storage of solar energy via a renewable method, such as photocatalysis, holds great promise as such an alternative. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have gained attention in solar energy conversion because they have a long axis to absorb incident sunlight yet a short radial distance for separation of photogenerated charge carriers. In particular, well-ordered spatially high dimensional architectures based on 1D nanostructures with well-defined facets or anisotropic shapes offer an exciting opportunity for bridging the gap between 1D nanostructures and the micro and macro world, providing a platform for integration of nanostructures on a larger and more manageable scale into high-performance solar energy conversion applications. In this review, we focus on the progress of photocatalytic solar energy conversion over controlled one-dimension-based spatially ordered architecture hybrids. Assembly and classification of these novel architectures are summarized, and we discuss the opportunity and future direction of integration of 1D materials into high-dimensional, spatially organized architectures, with a perspective toward improved collective performance in various artificial photoredox applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930236669

Nature is replete with examples where the handling and storing of data occurs with high efficiencies, low energy costs, and high-density information encoding.

Data centers require massive amount of computational power to drive complex systems. In return these massive systems bring many challenges and concerns including power dissipation and environmental sustainability. Higher power demand in data centers and changes in computing technology together to maximize data center performance has led to deploying multitude methods to estimate power intensity. Energy cost increment, global economic downturn, and global warming and other concerns have resulted in new research in achieving power efficient data centers. The research proposed in this paper evaluates three task scheduling algorithms RASA, TPPC, and PALB to get the most energy efficient task scheduling algorithm to be used in data centers for measuring their performance and efficiency. The three algorithms are evaluated for performance using three parameters; power efficiency, cost effectiveness, and amount of CO2 emissions. On top of that data center location and climate conditions are also considered and analyzed as parameters as they directly effect the operating costs, the amount of power consumption and CO2 emission. To minimize the power wasted by data center cooling systems is directly related to data center location and climate change.

Oil binding capacities of sunflower wax oleogels were higher than 99%, while carnauba wax had a maximum value of 97.6% for 10% addition level. At 3% addition level of carnauba wax, no gel developed. The crystal formation time of sunflower wax was shorter. Although the highest (8.5%) solid fat content was observed in the 10% carnauba wax containing oleogel (HC10) sample, it was 30.4% in the commercial shortening sample at 20°C. The peak melting temperature of commercial shortening was 52.3°C, and among all organogels, sunflower wax oleogel at 3% addition level had the closest value (58.4°C). The melting enthalpies of the oleogels ranged from 4.3 to 20.3 J/g, while it was 10.9 J/g for the commercial shortening sample. The firmness and stickiness values in the oleogel samples were lower than that of commercial shortening sample. On the other hand, there was no significant change of firmness and stickiness during storage, indicating good stability (p ≤ 0.001). Especially the sunflower wax oleogels were very homogenous and smooth in structure. The polarized light microscopy pictures revealed needle-like crystals for sunflower wax and aggregate-like crystals for carnauba wax oleogels. The x-ray diffraction measurements of the crystals showed the β' types of the polymorphic structures. Furthermore, the oleogels were very stable against oxidation during the storage period. Hazelnut oil organogels prepared with sunflower wax can be good source material for shortening or margarine-like products.

In the present study, the samples synthesized via HTC with and without iron oxide catalyst were characterized in detail (i.e., XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and ultimate CHNS elemental analyzer). Results demonstrated that incorporating iron oxide catalyst was equally effective in both functionalization and acceleration of the HTC reactions (hydrolysis, degradation, and re-polymerization) for the carbon formation.

However, long write latency and high write energy are the two challenges for STT-RAM. Recently, researchers propose to improve the write performance of STT-RAM by relaxing its non-volatility property. To avoid data losses resulting from volatility, refresh schemes have been proposed. However, refresh operations consume additional overhead. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce the number of refresh operations through re-arranging program data layout at compilation time. An N-refresh scheme is also proposed to further reduce the number of refreshes. Experimental results show that, on average, the proposed methods can reduce the number of refresh operations by 84.2 percent, and reduce the dynamic energy consumption by 38.0 percent for volatile STT-RAM caches while incurring only 4.1 percent performance degradation. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Compilation; Refresh; Volatile STT-RAM","Digital storage; Energy utilization; Compilation; Dynamic energy consumption; High storage density; Performance degradation; Refresh; Spin transfer torque; Stt rams; Ultra low leakages; Random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960957144

Despite complexity and processing costs, microfabrication techniques are being employed in fabricating a great variety of microsupercapacitor devices. Here, a simple, cost-effective, and versatile strategy is proposed to fabricate flexible and curvilinear microsupercapacitors (MSCs). The protocol involves writing sacrificial ink patterns using commercial marker pens on rigid, flexible, and curvilinear substrates. It is shown that this process can be used in both lift-off and etching modes, and the possibility of multistack design of active materials using simple pen lithography is demonstrated. As a prototype, this method is used to produce conducting polymer MSCs involving both poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), polyaniline, and metal oxide (MnO2) electrode materials. Typical values of energy density in the range of 5-11 mWh cm-3 at power densities of 1-6 W cm-3 are achieved, which is comparable to thin film batteries and superior to the carbon and metal oxide based microsupercapacitors reported in the literature. The simplicity and broad scope of this innovative strategy can open up new avenues for easy and scalable fabrication of a wide variety of on-chip energy storage devices. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

To ensure a good experience for an end user, we target the optimization of the delay performance of an EH wireless system with finite energy storage. As such, it is necessary to adapt the resource allocation to the channel fading information, data queue length, and energy queue length information. The channel fading information provides the channel quality, the data queue length information provides the dynamic urgency of the transmitted data flows, and the energy queue length information provides the information on how much available energy is left in the energy buffer. Such a problem is quite challenging because it belongs to an infinite dimensional stochastic optimization. In this article, we review the existing works on the resource allocation problem in EH wireless systems. We also propose a low-complexity delay-sensitive resource control scheme and discuss valuable design insights. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Digital storage; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Fading channels; Optimization; Queueing theory; Resource allocation; Available energy; Delay performance; Delay-sensitive applications; Dynamic resource control; Future wireless systems; Infinite dimensional; Resource allocation problem; Stochastic optimizations; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939239538

This communication system is powered by both grid and renewable power sources. First, we consider the average grid power consumption minimization subject to the data queue stability and renewable energy availability constraints. By exploring the optimality property and using the theory of random walks, we transform the grid power minimization problem to an asymptotically equivalent problem. Using the Lyapunov drift approach, we obtain an online dynamic power control policy to solve the asymptotically equivalent problem. Then, we introduce a novel analysis framework to study the grid power-delay tradeoff relationship of the online power control in the small delay regime. Specifically, using continuous-time approximation, dynamic programming and sample-path approach, we obtain bounds on the average delay and grid power consumption, which are asymptotically tight in the small delay regime. Based upon the derived closed-form expressions, we quantify the impacts of energy storage capacity and some other system parameters on the grid power-delay tradeoff. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","dynamic programming; Energy harvesting; finite energy storage; Lyapunov drift; power-delay tradeoff,; renewable and grid power control; wireless networks","Continuous time systems; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Power control; Social networking (online); Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Closed-form expression; Delay-sensitive applications; Dynamic power control; Energy storage capacity; Grid power; Power-delay tradeoff; Renewable energy storages; Wireless communication system; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937795090

However the random variability and unpredictability of solar energy makes difficult the penetration of PV implementations and complicate the system design. An optimal sizing of these systems proves to be essential. This paper recommends a techno-economic optimization model to determine optimally the capacity of the components of PV water pumping system using a water storage tank. The proposed model is developed regarding the reliability and cost indicators, which are the deficiency of power supply probability and life-cycle costs, respectively. The novelty is that the proposed optimization model is analytically defined for two-objectives and it is able to find a compromise solution. The sizing of a stand-alone PV water pumping system comprises a detailed analysis of crop water requirements and optimal tilt angles. Besides the necessity of long solar radiation and temperature time series, the accurate forecasts of water supply needs have to be determined. The calculation of the optimal tilt angle for yearly, seasonally and monthly frequencies results in higher system efficiency. It is, therefore, suggested to change regularly the tilt angle in order to maximize solar energy output. The proposed optimal sizing model incorporates all these improvements and can accomplish a comprehensive optimization of PV water pumping systems. A case study is conducted considering the irrigation of citrus trees yard located in Antalya, Turkey. The proposed model is also compared with a computational method and it is shown that sizing results are technically and economically more suitable than computational algorithm according to the applications on a 5-yearly basis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of the incubation temperature and the carbon source composition were evaluated in order to select the best production profile according to the characteristics of the microalgal biomass. C. butyricum showed a clear preference for monomeric sugars and starch, the latter being the major storage compound in microalgae. The highest H2 production reached by this strain from starch was 468 mL/g, whereas the mixed culture incubated at 37°C (LE37) produced 241 mL/g. When the mixed culture was incubated at 58°C (LE58), a significant increase in the H2 production occurred when xylose and xylan were used as carbon and energy source. The highest H2 yield reached by the LE37 culture or in co-culture with C. butyricum was 1.52 and 2.01 mol/mol of glucose equivalents, respectively. However, the ratio H2/CO2 (v/v) of the biogas produced in both cases was always lower than the one produced by the pure strain. In kinetic assays, C. butyricum attained 153.9 mL H2/L h from S. obliquus biomass within the first 24 h of incubation, with a H2 yield of 2.74 mol/mol of glucose equivalents. H2 production was accompanied mainly by acetate and butyrate as co-products.

The n-nonadecane nanocapsules were prepared by a one-step miniemulsion in situ polymerisation method. n-Nonadecane was used as a core while styrene (St) and methylmethacrylate (MMA) was used as a vinyl copolymer shell. The Fourier transform infrared results confirmed that n-nonadecane nanocapsules were successfully synthesised. Morphological characteristic analysis indicates that these nnonadecane nanocapsules that were prepared using St/MMA (4:1) have a spherical shape and a narrow particle size distribution, with an average diameter of 160±11 nm. The maximum encapsulation ratio for n-nonadecane nanocapsules is 45.8 wt%. The DSC result of pure n-nonadecane and n-nonadecane nanocapsules exhibits two different peaks, which are related to their carbon numbers. The temperature and latent heat of melting and freezing of the n-nonadecane nanocapsules were determined to be 33.1 °C, 76.9 J/g and 30.2 °C, 82.0 J/g, respectively. Moreover, n-nonadecane nanocapsules exhibit good thermal and chemical stability, even after 1000 cycles of a thermal cycling test. Based on all of the results, it can be concluded that the n-nonadecane nanocapsules exhibit better energy storage and have good potential for buildings, textiles or other applications.

Besides consuming electricity increasingly produced by renewable energies, heat pumps can also have an important role to balance supply and demand, allowing the integration of intermittent renewable generation in smart grids. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that ground source heat pumps are a very high efficiency technology for buildings space conditioning, and present a high potential for electric load management as a flexible load, when combined with the thermal storage capacity of the building. The very high efficiency of an advanced ground source heat pump system, which integrates state of art components in an optimal manner, was assessed considering the seasonal performance factors for one complete heating season and one complete cooling season, calculated based on the monitored data of an experimental site installed in a service building in Portugal. Innovative load management strategies to control the heat pump coupled with the thermal mass of the building were tested and its associated benefits, including integration for intermittent generation, were evaluated. The thermal response of the building was analyzed applying a model based on the lumped capacitance method, and it was validated with experimental data. A load shifting strategy by preheating the building and avoiding peak periods is proposed to allow the use of lower electricity rates leading to a reduction of electricity costs of 34%. Additionally preheating the buildings also contributes a larger integration of the renewable generation surplus (19-30% of the surplus generation). The implementation of Demand Response actions by switching off heating loads, during some periods of time, to compensate the variations and forecasting errors of wind power is also evaluated with positive impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand response; Demand side management; Ground source heat pumps; Renewable heating and cooling; Smart grids; Thermal storage","Buildings; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Economics; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Integration; Preheating; Pumps; Smart power grids; Storage management; Wind power; Demand response; Demand side managements; Renewable heating; Smart grid; Thermal storage; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938099922

However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable, which could frequently interrupt a processor's execution. To tackle this problem, nonvolatile processors have been proposed to checkpoint the whole volatile processor state into attached non-volatile memories periodically. When power resumes, the processor can copy the checkpointed state back to volatile memories and continue execution. However, without careful consideration, the process of checkpointing and resuming could cause inconsistency among different memory addresses and lead to irreversible errors. In this paper, we present a consistency aware checkpointing scheme that ensures correctness for all checkpoints. The proposed technique efficiently identifies all possible inconsistency positions in programs and inserts auxiliary code to ensure correctness. Evaluation results show that the proposed checkpointing technique can successfully eliminate inconsistency errors and greatly reduce the checkpointing overhead. © 2015 ACM.",,"Computer aided design; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Check pointing; Checkpointing schemes; Checkpointing techniques; Evaluation results; Inconsistency error; Memory address; Non-volatile memory; Volatile memory; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944111497

The changeable and limited solar power supply seriously affects the deadline miss rates (DMRs) of tasks on these nodes and therefore energy-driven task scheduling is necessary. However, current algorithms focus on the single period (or the current task queue) for high energy utilization and suffer from bad long term DMR. To get better long term DMR, we propose a long term deadline-aware scheduling algorithm with energy migration strategies for distributed super capacitors.

The relative potency of different flavonoids in causing beneficial effects on energy and lipid metabolism has not been investigated. Effects of quercetin, hesperetin, epicatechin, apigenin and anthocyanins in mice fed a high-fat diet (HF) for 12 weeks were compared, relative to normal-fat diet. HF-induced body weight gain was significantly lowered by all flavonoids (17–29 %), but most by quercetin. Quercetin significantly lowered HF-induced hepatic lipid accumulation (71 %). Mesenteric adipose tissue weight and serum leptin levels were significantly lowered by quercetin, hesperetin and anthocyanins. Adipocyte cell size and adipose tissue inflammation were not affected. The effect on body weight and composition could not be explained by individual significant effects on energy intake, energy expenditure or activity. Lipid metabolism was not changed as measured by indirect calorimetry or expression of known lipid metabolic genes in liver and white adipose tissue. Hepatic expression of Cyp2b9 was strongly downregulated by all flavonoids. In conclusion, all flavonoids lowered parameters of HF-induced adiposity, with quercetin being most effective. © 2015, The Author(s).","Bioactive food components; Gene expression; Lipid metabolism; Polyphenols; Quercetin; Whole-body homeostasis","anthocyanin; apigenin; epicatechin; fat droplet; flavonoid; hesperetin; leptin; monounsaturated fatty acid; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; quercetin; adipocyte; animal behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body composition; caloric intake; calorimetry; cell size; comparative study; controlled study; Cyp2b9 gene; diet supplementation; dietary intake; down regulation; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatty acid omega oxidation; food composition; gene; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; glucose oxidation; inflammation; Lep gene; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid storage; liver weight; macrophage; male; motor performance; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein blood level; trend study; weight gain; white adipose tissue; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937412703

Effective utilization of available conventional and renewable energy sources (RES) by tri-generation and with the aid of energy storage facilities (ESF) can ensure clean and energy efficient power generation. Such power generation can play an important role in countries, like Saudi Arabia, where abundant fossil fuels (FF) and renewable energy sources (RES) are available. Hence, effective modeling of such hybrid power systems scheduling is essential in such countries based on the available fuel resources. The intent of this paper is to present a simple model for tri-generation based hybrid power system scheduling for energy resources rich area in presence of ESF, to ensure optimum fuel utilization and minimum pollutant emissions while meeting the power demand. This research points an effective operation strategy which ensure a clean and energy efficient power scheduling by exploiting available energy resources effectively. Hence, it has an important role in current and future power generation. In order to illustrate the benefits of the presented approach a clean and energy efficient hybrid power supply scheme for King Saud University (KSU), Saudi Arabia, is proposed and analyzed here. Results show that the proposed approach is very suitable for KSU since adequate solar power is available during its peak demand periods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clean energy; Energy efficient; Energy storage; Power dispatch; Renewable energy; Tri-generation","Electric industry; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy storage; Fuels; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Solar energy; Clean energy; Energy efficient; Power dispatch; Renewable energies; Tri-generation; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937211259

The use of wide SIMD architecture is a promising approach to build energy-efficient high performance embedded processors. In this paper, we propose a design framework for a configurable wide SIMD architecture that utilizes an explicit datapath to achieve high energy efficiency. The framework is able to generate processor instances based on architecture specification files. It includes a compiler to efficiently program the proposed architecture with standard programming languages including OpenCL. This compiler can analyze the static memory access patterns in OpenCL kernels, generate efficient mappings, and schedule the code to fully utilize the explicit datapath. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed architecture is efficient and scalable in terms of area, performance, and energy. In a 128-PE SIMD processor, the proposed architecture is able to achieve up to 200 times speed-up and reduce the total energy consumption by 50 % compared to a basic RISC processor. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Code Generation; Compiler; Low Power; OpenCL; SIMD","Buffer storage; Design; Energy utilization; Program compilers; Reduced instruction set computing; Code Generation; Compiler; Low Power; OpenCL; SIMD; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941731969

The nitrogen species were found to undergo the N• to N- transformation during sample storage under different conditions, with an activation energy of about 0.45 eV. Three main possible evolution pathways for the dopant state were identified and discussed. It was established that the most probable transformation consists of migration of an oxygen vacancy site to an interstitial nitrogen atom followed by the formation of a nonparamagnetic substitution nitrogen center.

Several interleukins have been implicated in the pathology and physiology of lipodystrophy. The present study aimed to compare the levels of IL-4 and IL-6 in HIV-1 patients under cART with and without, clinically and fat mass ratio defined, lipodystrophy and in four different groups of fat distribution: (1) no lipodystrophy; (2) isolated central fat accumulation; (3) isolated lipoatrophy and (4) mixed forms of lipodystrophy. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study we evaluated IL-4 and IL-6 levels, insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity indexes in 86 HIV-infected adults under cART. Results: No significant differences in IL-4 and IL-6 levels between the four groups of body composition were observed. Patients with HOMA-IR >4 presented higher levels of IL-6 and lower levels of IL-4, although without statistical significance. No correlation between IL-6, or IL-4, HOMA-IR and quantitative body fat mass distribution was found. Conclusion: Although there was a tendency for patients with isolated lipoatrophy and isolated fat accumulation to present higher IL-6 levels, these differences were not statistically significant.

Herein, we report a novel self-templating strategy to fabricate well-defined single- and double-shell NiCo2S4 hollow spheres, as a promising electrode material for pseudocapacitors. The surfaces of the NiCo2S4 hollow spheres consist of self-assembled two-dimensional mesoporous nanosheets. This unique morphology results in a high specific capacitance (1263 F g-1 at 2 A g-1), remarkable rate performance (75.3% retention of initial capacitance from 2 to 60 A g-1), and exceptional reversibility with a cycling efficiency of 93.8% and 87% after 10 000 and 20 000 cycles, respectively, at a high current density of 10 A g-1. The cycling stability of our ternary chalcogenides is comparable to carbonaceous electrode materials, but with much higher specific capacitance (higher than any previously reported ternary chalcogenide), suggesting that these unique chalcogenide structures have potential application in next-generation commercial pseudocapacitors.

We have examined structural and spectroscopic properties of wild-type rhodopsin (with 11-cis-9,13-dimethyl-RPSB) and artificial rhodopsins, hosting four 11-cis-RPSB derivatives, 13-demethyl-, 9-demethyl-, 10-methyl-13-demethyl-, and 10-methyl-RPSB, evolving along the photoisomerization coordinate. It is found that the addition of 10-methyl or/and deletion of 9-/13-methyl groups do not appear to interfere structurally with the photoisomerization pathway in the S1 excited state. Remarkably, the two-mode space-saving mechanism initiated by bond order inversion and followed by asynchronous bicycle-pedal distortion in the RPSB backbone drives the photoreaction in all rhodopsin analogues studied here. However, methylation and/or demethylation is responsible for perturbation of excess energy deposited in the conical intersection structures. The analysis of photon energy stored by bathorhodopsin in synthetic pigments reveals that it is affected by steric crowding of methyl substituents in the RPSB backbone.

However, OPCMs suffers from liquid leakage problem and low thermal conductivity, which limit their application as TES material. Encapsulation of OPCMs using organic or inorganic supporting materials is an effective way to overcome the leakage problem and enhancing their thermal conductivity property. In addition, the capsules could prevent possible interaction between OPCMs with the environment. There are many technologies described the encapsulation of OPCMs which depending on the type of supporting material and chemical properties of the OPCMs used. However, no complete overview of the techniques for encapsulation of OPCMs is available in the open literature. In this paper, we reviewed the techniques used for encapsulation of OPCMs and the method used to characterize the physico-chemical and thermal properties of encapsulated OPCMs. We believed that this review could provide useful information on the various encapsulation methods of OPCMs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Encapsulation methods; Inorganic supporting materials; Organic phase change materials; Organic supporting materials; Physico-chemical characterization","Characterization; Encapsulation; Heat storage; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Conductivity properties; Encapsulation methods; Leakage problems; Low thermal conductivity; Physico-chemical characterization; Physico-chemicals; Supporting material; Phase change materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936856046

Glucose binding protein (GBP) fused to two fluorescent indicator proteins (FLIP) was used in the present study such as FLIP-glu- 3.2 mM. Recombinant Escherichia coli whole-cells containing genetically encoded nanosensors as well as cell-free extracts were immobilized either on inner epidermis of onion bulb scale or on 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of glutaraldehyde. Glucose monitoring was carried out by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis due the cyano and yellow fluorescent proteins (ECFP and EYFP) immobilized in both these supports. The recovery of these immobilized FLIP nanosensors compared with the free whole-cells and cell-free extract was in the range of 50-90%. Moreover, the data revealed that these FLIP nanosensors can be immobilized in such solid supports with retention of their biological activity. Glucose assay was devised by FRET analysis by using these nanosensors in real samples which detected glucose in the linear range of 0-24 mM with a limit of detection of 0.11 mM glucose. On the other hand, storage and operational stability studies revealed that they are very stable and can be re-used several times (i.e. at least 20 times) without any significant loss of FRET signal. To author's knowledge, this is the first report on the use of such immobilization supports for whole-cells and cell-free extract containing FLIP nanosensor for glucose assay.

A lot of power electronics topology has been tried for cell balancing in the battery packages. Active cell balancing topologies transfer energy from the cells showing higher performance to the cells showing lower performance to balance voltages across the cells of the battery using energy storage elements like combination of inductor-capacitor or transformer-capacitor or switched capacitor or switched inductor. In this study an active balancing topology without using any energy storage element is proposed. The idea is similar to the switched capacitor topology in which a capacitor or capacitor banks is switched across the cells of battery to balance the voltages. Since a basic battery cell model includes capacitance because of capacitive effect of the cell, this capacitive effect can be utilized in cell balancing. Hence the equalizer capacitors in switched capacitor topology can be eliminated and the cells of battery can be switched with each other. This allows faster energy transfer and hence results in quick equalization. The proposed topology removes the need of extra energy storage elements like capacitors which frequently fails in power electronic circuits, reduces the losses inserted by extra energy storage elements and cost and volume of the circuits and simplifies control algorithm. The proposed balancing circuit can be implemented according to the application requirement. The proposed topology is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment and showed better results in terms of balancing speed in comparison to switched capacitor topologies. © 2015 IEEE.","Battery cell balancing; capacitorless topology; switched capacitor converters","Capacitance; Distributed computer systems; Electric batteries; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Equalizers; Life cycle; MATLAB; Power electronics; Topology; Application requirements; Balancing circuits; Battery cells; Capacitor-less; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Switched capacitor converter; Switched inductors; Switched-capacitor topology; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941125130

Results strongly revealed the tunable thermal conduction behavior of the solid-state composite PCMs versus cooling rate. As the cooling rate was ascended from 2.03 to 30.94 °C/min, more than 25% drop of the solid-state thermal conductivity was observed for the samples containing graphite nanosheets. Besides a percolation threshold around 1 wt.%, measured thermal conductivities increased linearly with the particle concentration, achieving the highest value of 1.57 W/m K by GNS-30 at 5 wt.%. Moreover, the graphite nanosheets with a larger size were found to cause higher improvement in thermal conductivity, and also the relatively higher viscosity of PCM suspensions. DSC results indicated the decrease in latent heat capacity of samples is negligible after the incorporation of graphite nanosheets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal evaporation is the most widely used technique in industrial fruit juice concentrate production. In addition to high energy consumption, a large part of the characteristics determining the quality of the fresh juice including aroma, color, vitamins, and antioxidants undergoes remarkable alterations through the use of high operation temperatures. Increasing consumer demand for minimally or naturally processed stable products able to retain as much possible the uniqueness of the fresh fruit has engendered a growing interest for development of nonthermal approaches for fruit juice concentration. Among them, membrane distillation (MD) and its variants have attracted much attention for allowing very high concentrations to be reached under atmospheric pressure and temperatures near ambient temperature. This review will provide an overview of the current status and recent developments in the use of MD for concentration of fruit juices. In addition to the most basic concepts of MD variants, crucial suggestions for membrane selection and operating parameters will be presented.

The configurations include the PCM only, aluminum foam filled with the PCM, and aluminum mesh in the presence of the PCM. The time taken for the complete melting of the PCM is predicted for each configuration. In the analysis, the amount of PCM is kept the same for all configurations, and the amount of aluminum material is kept constant in the aluminum foam and the aluminum mesh configurations. The performance characteristics are the dimensionless temperature ratio ((Tmax - Tb)/(Tmax - Tin), where Tmax is the maximum temperature, Tb is the bulk temperature, and Tin is the initial temperature), the minimum liquid fraction, the ratio of the cumulative energy stored during phase change over the total energy input to the storage system, and the total molten mass over the total mass of the PCM in each configuration. An experiment is conducted to verify the predictions of the numerical simulations for the aluminum foam. It is found that the experimental findings of the molten states of the PCM in the aluminum foam agree well with their counterparts predicted from the simulations.

The ESR dose response curve presents linear behaviour in the dose range of 250-1000Gy followed by sublinear behaviour in the dose range of 2-8kGy. Kinetic behaviors and activation energy of the free radical were also calculated using the data obtained from annealing studies performed at four different temperatures (220, 240, 260 and 280°C). The activation energy value was calculated as 1.47eV. The long-term fading of the ESR signal at room temperature turned out to be best described by a second-order kinetic decay function. The presence of measurable ESR signal intensity even after a storage period of 90 days was considered as providing an opportunity in the dose estimation of irradiated sand sample. Although the TL glow curve of the natural (unirradiated) sand sample only has a single broad peak at 317°C, the glow curve of the irradiated sample has four glow peaks located at ~115°C, ~156°C, ~231°C and ~308°C and their intensity tends to be increased with absorbed dose. Tmax-Tstopand glow curve fitting results showed that presence of at least five peaks located at ~116°C, 149°C, 228°C, 306°C and 360°C. This result suggests that the apparently single glow peak D may consist of two or more overlapping glow peaks. According to the thermal fading of the sand sample at room temperature, the TL signal intensities (23°C and 308°C) were found to be quite large after 30 days of storage this allows a more accurate measurement of the glow peak intensity. The additive dose method, variable heating rate method (VHRM), Tmax-Tstop and glow curve fitting method were used to number of peaks, dosimetric properties and kinetic parameters. This study shows that ESR and TL techniques could be successfully used to investigate the kinetics and dosimetric properties of sand sample. Furthermore, the results in this study plus the previous work done by the authors suggest that sand could, by using the ESR and TL techniques, be a suitable material for alternative dose measurement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electron spin resonance (ESR); Kinetic; Radiation dosimetry; Sand; Thermoluminescence (TL)","Activation energy; Chemical activation; Curve fitting; Digital storage; Dosimetry; Electrospinning; Free radicals; Kinetics; Magnetic moments; Sand; Spin dynamics; Thermoluminescence; Tissue; Accurate measurement; Additive dose method; Dose-response curves; Dosimetric properties; Irradiated samples; Kinetic properties; Second order kinetics; Variable heating rates; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; absorption; Article; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dosimetry; electron spin resonance; energy transfer; high temperature; irradiation; kinetics; physical parameters; priority journal; radiation dose; reproducibility; room temperature; sand; thermoluminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961385795

The main objective is to minimize the hourly power system operation cost with a cleaner, socially responsible, and sustainable generation of electricity. Emission constraints are enforced to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional thermal generating units. The stationary electric vehicles (EV) are considered as an example of distributed storage and vehicle to grid (V2G) technology is considered to demonstrate the bilateral role of EV as supplier and consumer of energy. Battery storage can ease the impact of variability of renewable energy sources on power system operations and reduce the impact of thermal generation emission at peak hours. We model the day-ahead scheduling of electric power systems as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem for solving the hourly security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC). In order to expedite the real-time solution for large-scale power systems, we consider a two-stage model of the hourly SCUC by applying the Benders decomposition (BD). The Benders decomposition would separate the hourly generation unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the power network security check in subproblem. The subproblem would check dc network security constraints for the given UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure dc power flow can be obtained. If any power network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts are formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until the network violations are eliminated and a converged hourly solution is found for scheduling the power generating units. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP approach and its potentials as an optimization tool for sustainable operations of electric power grids. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Million tons of fly ashes are generated on a yearly basis. For now, only 20 % of such fly ashes can be utilized and the remaining amount is used for land filling purposes or deposited in surface impoundments. The most important waste material in modern thermal power plants is very fine ash particles generated through the combustion of powder coals and spread by flue gases. About 110 g ashes release as a waste material in the generation of 1 kWh energy by a thermal power plant. Approximately 650.000 tons of fly ashes and bottom ashes are obtained from a power plant with the capacity of 1000 MW. Such toxic trace elements as arsenic, cadmium, lead, antimony, selenium, tin, molybdenum and zinc are transferred to wastes upon the combustion of lignite coals. Toxic trace elements contained in fly ashes can sweep even into surface and underground waters as a result of the contact of ash with water under suitable atmospheric conditions due to improper storage of the ashes. Furthermore, there are many studies conducted in terms of the recovery of precious metals and radioactive minerals in fly ashes. Such studies are important both for economical purposes and environmental pollution. Within the scope of this study, a series of characterization studies then leaching tests were carried out on the samples of fly ashes taken from a thermal power plant operated in Turkey. In order the ashes to be evaluated, the leaching of the samples and the optimum leach parameters were investigated with the use of acetic acid.

It can have widespread usage area such as energy storage devices, sensors, catalysis, biological applications. As seen from literatures, the studies on GO fiber produced by wet spinning technique are very limited because only a few years ago, the studies on this area were started. In this study, different dispersion rate, different dispersion time and different content of acetone in the last coagulation bath have been studied. Thus, for the first time, the effect of preparation method of GO dispersion and the content of highly evaporative solvent in the last coagulation bath on mechanical and electrical properties of GO fiber have been examined. It has been seen that dispersion rate has higher positive effect on mechanical properties than dispersion time. The samples lasted by %100 acetone coagulation bath have a lower mechanical property than the sample lasted by % 20/80 (distilled water/acetone). Among samples, highest mechanical properties belong to sample with coagulated by CaCl2-ethanol and dispersed for 90 minute by 15 000 rpm. Meanwhile coagulated samples with NaOH-acetone had the lowest mechanical properties. With regard to electrical conductivity, all samples are in the semi conductive range (10-4 S/cm).","Acetone; CaCl2; Coagulation Bath; Dispersion Rate; Dispersion Time; Electrical Conductivity; Ethanol; Graphene Oxide Fiber; Mechanical Properties; NaOH; Semi Conductive; Wet Spinning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946034076

The products crystallize in the rock salt unit cell, similarly to the pristine AgF and AgCl phases. The members of the Ag(F1-xClx) series exhibit an almost linear relationship of the cubic cell vector with the composition parameter, x, which indicates that AgF and AgCl form a solid solution with a disordered anionic sublattice. The AgF0.5Cl0.5 phase exhibits quite a low melting point of 307°C (as compared with 435°C for AgF and 455°C for AgCl), and small entropy change at melting, some 10 J (mol K)-1 (as compared to 23.6 J (mol K)-1 for AgF, and 18.1 J (mol K)-1 for AgCl), indicative of high disorder and large absolute entropy of AgF0.5Cl0.5 solid. Despite that, the Ag(F1-xClx) phases show smaller specific electric conductance than the end members of the series, AgCl and AgF. Parent AgF turns out to have rather high specific conductance of 3 × 10-2 mS cm-1 at a room temperature and rather small activation energy for conductivity (29.2 kJ mol-1) which suggest the presence of high concentration of defects and substantial electron doping to the conduction band. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Chloride; Electronic conductivity; Fluoride; Ionic conductivity; Semiconductors; Silver",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939991061

Plant biomass such as oil palm shell fiber (OPSF) is a renewable source of carbon for the production of advanced carbon nanomaterials. In the present study, two types of carbon-based precursors i.e., OPSF and glucose were treated via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) method using a ZnCl2/NaCl catalyst mixture as chemical activator and for pore creation. The resultant samples were then analysed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and CHNS elemental analysis. Based on the results obtained, the lignocellulosic structure of OPSF underwent complete degradation in the presence of ZnCl2/NaCl catalyst mixture, coupled with the onset of nanographitic structure formation. The effect of the catalyst was more significant on the samples obtained from OPSF, due to the additional catalytic role of zinc chloride in the presence of nitrogen-containing structures in plant biomass. Further thermal annealing of HTC-treated OPSF revealed an interesting observation of amorphous carbon nanoparticles decorated with graphitized, 4-5 nm sized-carbon nanoparticles. BET surface analysis shows a large surface area up to 597.6 m2 g-1 was obtained from OPSF using the present method. The micropore volume was increased from 0.148 (Sample American B1) to 0.243 (Sample B3) cm3 g-1 with the addition of ZnCl2/NaCl catalyst. The adsorption isotherm indicated Type 1 adsorption-desorption behaviour, which corresponds to the formation of microporous structure in the carbon nanoparticles. Such a mechanistic understanding is important for the controlled growth of high content advanced carbon-based materials, which may be used in energy storage applications.

The promising fields of application include wave energy converters, muscle-like actuators, sensors, robotics, and biomimetics. For an electrical engineer, electroactive polymers can be seen as a dielectric elastomer film or a compliant capacitor with a highly deformable elastomeric medium. If the elastomer is pre-stretched and pre-charged, a reduction of the tensile force lets the elastomer revert to its original form and increases the electrical potential. The light weight of electroactive polymers, low cost, high intrinsic breakdown strength, cyclical way of operation, reliable performance, and high efficiency can be exploited to utilize the elastomeric material as a transducer. The energy storage for a linear dielectric polymer is determined by its relative permittivity and the applied electric field. The latter is limited by the dielectric breakdown strength of the material.

We provide sufficient conditions under which the optimization problem can be solved via its convex relaxation. Using data from existing networks, we show that these sufficient conditions are expected to be satisfied by most networks. We also provide an efficient distributed algorithm to solve the problem.

Its current energy needs are heavily dependent upon conventional thermal power plants which mainly use oil and gas. In addition to the economic problems associated with importing oil for Pakistan, the burning of fossil fuels for the production of electricity releases vast amounts of greenhouse gases. As an alternative to the current scenario, in this paper the energetic and economic performance of green energy technologies such as photovoltaic (PV), parabolic trough collector (PTC) with and without storage, and wind energy systems are analyzed and compared with respect to their potential for electricity generation for the city of Multan, Pakistan. Each system is designed taking a nominal 10 MWe capacity as a reference. Hourly meteorological data are used to estimate hourly insolation on a fixed PV module and for PTC's with East-West and North-South tracking. Results show that PV and PTC systems without storage have approximately the same output with capacity factors of approximately 20%. The electrical energy output of the wind turbines was very low with a capacity factor of ∼2%. PTC's with 7.5 h storage and a solar multiple of 3.5 showed the best result for electrical energy output with a capacity factor of 46%. A cost analysis is performed assuming a 30 year lifetime for PV and a 35 year lifetime for PTC. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is found to be 0.192 USD/kWh for PV systems, 0.273 USD/kWh for PTC systems without storage, and 0.226 USD/kWh for PTC systems with 7.5 h of storage. The results of the economic study show that based strictly on economic considerations green energy technologies can be utilized if the government supports the investment by giving incentives and subsidies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In a developing country like Malaysia, the development of islands is mostly related to the availability of electric power. Power generated by renewable energy sources has recently become one of the most promising solutions for the electrification of islands and remote rural areas. But high dependency on weather conditions and the unpredictable nature of these renewable energy sources are the main drawbacks. To overcome this weakness, different green energy sources and power electronic converters need to be integrated with each other. This study presents a battery storage hybrid standalone photovoltaic-wind energy power supply system. In the proposed standalone hybrid system, a DC-DC buck-boost bidirectional converter controller is used to accumulates the surplus hybrid power in the battery bank and supplies this power to the load during the hybrid power shortage by maintaining the constant dc-link voltage. A three-phase voltage source inverter complex vector control scheme is used to control the load side voltage in terms of the voltage amplitude and frequency. Based on the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink, it has been found that the overall hybrid framework is capable of working under variable weather and load conditions. © 2015 Samrat et al.

The secondary-hydride system was found to initiate a transformation of the NaAlH4/Mg(BH4)2 to Mg(AlH4)2/NaBH4 during ball milling, and there was a mutual destabilization among the hydrides. Three major dehydrogenation steps were observed in the systems, which corresponded to the decomposition of Mg(AlH4)2, MgH2, and NaBH4. Temperature-programmed desorption results showed that the TiF3-doped NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2 (2:1) composite sample started to release hydrogen at about 75 °C, which was 60 °C lower than that of undoped NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2 (2:1) composite sample. In addition, the reaction pathway of the NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2 (2:1) composite system, and the mechanisms that worked in this composite during the de/rehydrogenation process were determined by X-ray diffraction. The Kissinger analysis has shown that the apparent activation energy, EA, for decomposition of NaBH4 in the NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2-TiF3 composite reduced to 139.85 kJ/mol compared with 155.73 kJ/mol in NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2 composite. It is believed that the enhancement of the de/rehydrogenation properties of undoped NaAlH4/Mg(BH4)2 was attributed to the formation of intermediate compounds, including Mg-Al and Mg-Al-B alloys, upon dehydrogenation, which changed the thermodynamics of the reactions by altering the de/rehydrogenation pathway. Meanwhile, as for the doped sample, the TiF3 component played a catalytic role through the formation of Ti-containing and F-containing catalytic species, which might have promoted the interaction of Mg(AlH4)2 and NaBH4, and thus, further improved the dehydrogenation of the NaAlH4-Mg(BH4)2 (2:1) system. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Catalysts; Complex hydride; Hydrogen storage; Reactive hydride composite","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Aluminum alloys; Ball milling; Binary alloys; C (programming language); Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds; Reaction intermediates; Sodium Borohydride; Temperature programmed desorption; Thermodynamics; Titanium compounds; X ray diffraction; Apparent activation energy; Catalytic species; Complex hydrides; Hydrogen storage properties; Intermediate compound; Kissinger analysis; Reaction mechanism; Reaction pathways; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930377101

It was found that the addition of K2TiF6 resulted in both decreased decomposition temperature, and enhanced sorption kinetics, compared to undoped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of the 10 wt% K2TiF6-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 sample was reduced by about 50 °C compared to the as-milled undoped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4, and the saturation of dehydrogenation process for the K2TiF6-added 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 sample was achieved within 25 min compared with 45 min for the undoped sample. From the Kissinger plot, the activation energy for the MgH2-relevent decomposition was reduced from 126 kJ/mol for 4MgH2-LiAlH4 composite to 107 kJ/mol after addition of K2TiF6. The differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicated that the enthalpy change in the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system was unaffected by the addition of K2TiF6. It was believed that the formation of Ti-containing and Al-containing species together with a small amount of Li-containing species during the ball milling or the dehydrogenation process might be actually responsible for the catalytic effects, and thus, further improved the dehydrogenation of the K2TiF6-added 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Catalyst; Hydrogen storage; Lithium alanate; Magnesium hydride","Activation energy; Aluminum compounds; Ball milling; Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds; Magnesium compounds; Potassium compounds; Titanium compounds; Catalytic effects; Decomposition temperature; Enthalpy change; Hydrogen storage properties; Lithium alanate; Magnesium hydride; Reaction mechanism; Sorption kinetics; Fluorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930323922

Anthropogenic lowering of the water table in many wadi aquifers has also reduced the potential recharge by increasing the thickness of the vadose zone, causing interflow water loss from surface emergence and evaporation. A method to enhance recharge is to slow the flow within wadi channels by placement of dam structures, thereby ponding water and increasing the vertical head gradient to create a more rapid rate of infiltration and percolation. Effectiveness of wadi dams to enhance aquifer recharge reduces over time due to mud deposition within the reservoir caused by storm events. Up to 80 % of the water in old wadi reservoirs is lost to free-surface evaporation before infiltration and recharge can occur. One method to maintain or increase the rate of recharge is to convey clean water by gravity flow from the reservoir down-gradient to artificially recharge the aquifer using existing wells. This type of system is a low-cost and low-energy recharge method which could greatly enhance groundwater storage in wadi aquifers. Modeling results show that existing wells could store up to 1,000 m3/day under gravity-feed conditions and up to 3,900 m3/day with the shut-in of the well to produce a pressurized system. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aquifer storage and recovery; Dams; Groundwater modeling; Recharge; Wadi aquifers","Aquifers; Dams; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Floods; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Infiltration; Reservoirs (water); Solvents; Underground reservoirs; Water conservation; Aquifer heterogeneity; Aquifer storage and recovery; Evapotranspiration loss; Groundwater modeling; Potential recharges; Pressurized systems; Recharge; Vertical hydraulic conductivities; Recharging (underground waters)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929959061

The aim of this research is to recover a valuable amount of this energy to develop an efficient desalination system coupled with solar energy. Experiments were performed in the month of June 2014 at Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia (26°4′53″N, 43°58′32″E) for different hot air (waste gas) flow rates and evaporator inlet water temperature to study the effect on daily potable water productivity. The proposed setup comprised an evaporator, condenser, air blower, electric heaters, storage tank and evacuated tube solar collectors. It was found that increasing the hot air flow rate increases the water productivity up to the critical flow rate after which the productivity decreases.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on the prevention of osteoporosis and dyslipidemia in ovariectomized rats fed with high-fat emulsion. The 3-month-old female rats were subjected to either sham operations (n = 8) or ovariectomized operations (OVX, n = 24). The OVX rats were orally administered deionized water (n = 8) or standardized high-fat emulsion without (n = 8) or with atorvastatin (n = 8). All rats were injected twice with calcein before sacrificed for the purpose of double in vivo labeling. After 12 weeks, all rats were sacrificed under anesthesia. Biochemistry, histomorphometry, mechanical test, micro-computed tomography analysis, mechanical test, histology, and component analysis were performed. We found that high-fat emulsion significantly decreased body weight, bone formation, collagen content of bone, and bone biomechanics, while increased blood, liver, and bone marrow lipids. Atorvastatin treatment prevented dyslipidemia, reversed hepatic steatosis, optimized composition of bone, and improved bone mechanical properties. The current study provided further evidence that atorvastatin might be useful for the treatment of osteoporotic patients with dyslipidemia. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Atorvastatin; Dyslipidemia; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; Rat","atorvastatin; calcein; calcium; cholesterol; collagen; high density lipoprotein; hydroxyproline; low density lipoprotein; phosphorus; triacylglycerol; water; atorvastatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biomechanics; body weight; bone demineralization; chemical composition; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cortical bone; drug effect; dyslipidemia; energy absorption; fatty liver; female; histology; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver weight; mechanical stimulus test; micro-computed tomography; morphometrics; nonhuman; ossification; osteoporosis; ovariectomy; priority journal; rat; trabecular bone; triacylglycerol blood level; uterus weight; weight change; animal; animal food; bone density; disease model; drug effects; Dyslipidemias; human; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Sprague Dawley rat; Animal Feed; Animals; Atorvastatin Calcium; Bone Density; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Dyslipidemias; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Ovariectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; X-Ray Microtomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929705475

Health can be determined with biomarkers, but functional health status is likely better reflected by challenge tests that assess metabolic flexibility. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of high-fat diets with different fatty acid compositions, but similar n6/n3 ratio, on metabolic flexibility. Therefore, adult male mice received isocaloric high-fat diets with either predominantly PUFAs (HFpu diet) or predominantly SFAs (HFs diet) but similar n6/n3 ratio for six months, during and after which several biomarkers for health were measured. Metabolic flexibility was assessed by the response to an oral glucose tolerance test, a fasting and re-feeding test and an oxygen restriction test (OxR; normobaric hypoxia). The latter two are non-invasive, indirect calorimetry-based tests that measure the adaptive capacity of the body as a whole. We found that the HFs diet, compared to the HFpu diet, increased mean adipocyte size, liver damage, and ectopic lipid storage in liver and muscle; although, we did not find differences in body weight, total adiposity, adipose tissue health, serum adipokines, whole body energy balance, or circadian rhythm between HFs and HFpu mice. HFs mice were, furthermore, less flexible in their response to both fasting- re-feeding and OxR, while glucose tolerance was indistinguishable. To conclude, the HFs versus the HFpu diet increased ectopic fat storage, liver damage, and mean adipocyte size and reduced metabolic flexibility in male mice.

It is an ideal fuel source for direct oxidation fuel cells for portable and mobile applications, as it offers multiple advantages over hydrogen and methanol, including ease of transportation, storage and handling as well as higher energy density. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) that use proton exchange membranes. This type of acid DEFC still exhibits low performance (the state-of-the-art peak power density is 96 mW cm-2 at 90°C), despite employing expensive platinum-based catalysts. However, it has been recently demonstrated that the use of anion exchange membranes and non-platinum catalysts in DEFCs enables a dramatic boost in performance (the state-of-the-art peak power density can be as high as 185 mW cm-2 at 60°C).

During normal operation the SCESS will be used to minimize the short term fluctuation as it has high power density and during fault at the grid side it will be used to store the generated power from the PV array for later use and for fault ride through. To capture the maximum available solar power, Incremental Conductance (IC) method is used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). An independent P-Q control is implemented to transfer the generated power to the grid using a Voltage source inverter (VSI). The SCESS is connected to the system using a bi-directional buck boost converter. The system model has been developed that consists of PV module, buck converter for MPPT, buck-boost converter to connect the SCESS to the DC link. Three independent controllers are implemented for each power electronics block. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is examined on Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results verify the superiority of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.","Active and reactive power control; Fault ride through; MPPT; Photovoltaic system; RTDS supercapacitor energy storage","Controllers; DC-DC converters; Electric current regulators; Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Reactive power; Solar energy; Supercapacitor; Active and reactive power controls; Fault ride-through; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Photovoltaic systems; Power management and control; Real time digital simulator; Supercapacitor energy storages; Voltage source inverter; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937710936

Though there is uncertainties in both load and price but the use of EVs storage capacity can make the operation of load aggregator flexible. LA submits its offer to day-ahead market based on predicted loads and optimized use of its EVs to maximize its profit as well as in real time operation it uses its energy storage capacity such as way that it can maximize its profit.

As long as the response is not instantaneous, the models that are derived cannot be differentiated from the Maxwell and Oldroyd-B models, respectively. The models can be viewed within the context of materials whose natural configuration evolves, the evolution being determined by the maximization of the rate of entropy production of the material. However, the underpinnings to develop the model are quite different from an earlier development by Rajagopal and Srinivasa [8] in that while the total response of the viscoelastic fluid satisfies the constraint of an incompressible material, the energy storage mechanism associated with the elastic response is allowed to be that for a compressible elastic solid and the dissipative mechanism associated with the viscous response allowed to be that for a compressible fluid, the total deformation however being isochoric. The analysis calls for a careful evaluation of firmly held customs in viscoelasticity wherein it is assumed that it is possible to subject a material to a purely instantaneous elastic response without any dissipation whatsoever. Finally, while the model developed by Rajagopal and Srinivasa [8] arises from the linearization of the non-linear elastic response that they chose and leads to a model wherein the instantaneous elastic response is isochoric, here we develop the model within the context of a different non-linear elastic response that need not be linearized but the instantaneous elastic response not necessarily being isochoric. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover volt-ampere power of the generation system rises 25%.

The vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) seem to have several advantages among the existing types of flow batteries as they use the same material (in liquid form) in both half-cells, eliminating the risk of cross contamination and resulting in electrolytes with a potentially unlimited life. Given their low energy density (when compared with conventional batteries), VRFB are especially suited for large stationary energy storage, situations where volume and weight are not limiting factors. This includes applications such as electrical peak shaving, load levelling, UPS, and in conjunction with renewable energies (e.g. wind and solar). The present work thoroughly reviews the VRFB technology detailing their genesis, the basic operation of the various existing designs and the current and future prospects of their application. The main original contribution of the work was the addressing of a still missing in-depth review and comparison of existing, but dispersed, peer reviewed publications on this technology, with several original and insightful comparison tables, as well as an economic analysis of an application for storing excess energy of a wind farm and sell it during peak demand.

Substantial heat losses in buildings occur through glazing areas, so it is crucial to mitigate the energy transfer between through these areas. The use of phase change materials (PCMs) is presently a technology advanced solution to improve the energy performance of building elements, particularly with window blinds or shutter protections. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign of a window shutter containing PCM during the summer season. The shutter prototype was applied in an outside cell test composed by two compartments (side by side) and oriented to South. It was monitored and analysed the indoor air temperatures, the outside weather conditions and the heat flux of the interior wall partition. During the experiment, the range of the external air temperature changes from 13 °C to 25 °C and the average solar radiation recorded is 237 W m-2 to 306 W m-2. The measured results shows that the compartment with the PCM window shutter can reveals thermal regulating capacity of the indoor temperature about 18%-22%. The maximum and minimum temperature peaks decreased 6% and 11%, respectively.

Renewable energy (RE) resources can be used extensively to support and fulfill the demand of the expected loads of these areas. This article presents an analysis of a complete off-grid wind-diesel-battery hybrid RE model. The main objective of the present analysis is to visualize the optimum volume of systems capable of fulfilling the requirements of 85 kWh/day primary load in coupled with 8.7 kW peak for 2 residential hotels of Cameron Highlands. The hybrid power system can be effective for the tourists of that area as it is a decentralized region of Malaysia.

Biomass based organic aerogels and carbon aerogels, featuring low cost, high scalability, and small environmental footprint, represent an important new research direction in (carbon) aerogel development. Cellulose and lignin are the two most abundant natural polymers in the world, and the aerogels based on them are very promising. Classic silicon aerogels and available organic resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) or lignin-resorcinol-formaldehyde (LRF) aerogels are brittle and fragile; toughening of the aerogels is highly desired to expand their applications. This study reports the first attempt to toughen the intrinsically brittle LRF aerogel and carbon aerogel using bacterial cellulose. The facile process is catalyst-free and cost-effective. The toughened carbon aerogels, consisting of blackberry-like, core-shell structured, and highly graphitized carbon nanofibers, are able to undergo at least 20% reversible compressive deformation. Due to their unique nanostructure and large mesopore population, the carbon materials exhibit an areal capacitance higher than most of the reported values in the literature. This property makes them suitable candidates for flexible solid-state energy storage devices. Besides energy storage, the conductive interconnected nanoporous structure can also find applications in oil/water separation, catalyst supports, sensors, and so forth. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The MnO2 ink exhibits long-term stability and continuous thin films can be formed on various substrates without using any binder. To obtain a flexible electrode for capacitive energy storage, the MnO2 ink was printed onto commercially available A4 paper pretreated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 1035 Fg-1 (91.7 mFcm-2). Paper-based symmetric and asymmetric capacitors were assembled, which gave a maximum specific energy density of 25.3 Whkg-1 and a power density of 81 kWkg-1. The device could maintain a 98.9% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles at 4 Ag-1. The MnO2 ink could be a versatile candidate for large-scale production of flexible and printable electronic devices for energy storage and conversion. Printing the future: A simple chemical reduction method has been used to synthesize aqueous MnO2 ink that exhibits long-term stability and can form continuous thin films on various substrates without the need for any binder.

Comparative proteomics of cultures of A. denitrificans strain BC grown on either acetone or acetate with nitrate was performed to study the enzymes involved in the acetone degradation pathway. In the proposed acetone degradation pathway, an acetone carboxylase converts acetone to acetoacetate, an AMP-dependent synthetase/ligase converts acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA, and an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase cleaves acetoacetyl-CoA to two acetyl-CoA. We also found a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase associated with acetone degradation. This enzyme functioned as a β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase catalyzing the conversion of surplus acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate that may be converted to the energy and carbon storage compound, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate. Accordingly, we confirmed the formation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate in acetone-grown cells of strain BC. Our findings provide insight in nitrate-dependent acetone degradation that is activated by carboxylation of acetone. This will aid studies of similar pathways found in other microorganisms degrading acetone with nitrate or sulfate as electron acceptor. © FEMS 2015.","Acetone; Alicycliphilus denitrificans; Anaerobic; Nitrate; Proteome; β-hydroxybutyrate","3 hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; acetoacetic acid; acetone; acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; carboxylase; nitrate; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetoacetic acid derivative; acetoacetyl CoA; acetone; acetone carboxylase; acetyl coenzyme A; acyl coenzyme A; aldehyde dehydrogenase; carboxylyase; hydroxybutyric acid; nitric acid derivative; poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; Alicycliphilus denitrificans strain BC; Article; bacterial cell; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; carbon storage; carboxylation; cell migration; controlled study; degradation kinetics; energy conversion; enzyme mechanism; Gram negative bacterium; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; proteomics; Comamonadaceae; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; phylogeny; proteomics; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Acetoacetates; Acetone; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Acyl Coenzyme A; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Carboxy-Lyases; Comamonadaceae; Hydroxybutyrates; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Nitrates; Phylogeny; Polyesters; Proteomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948951906

Post-combustion capture based on aqueous amine scrubbing is one of the most promising technologies for CO2 capture currently. This technology, however, possesses a number of shortcomings, including high regeneration energy requirement, high solvent loss, degradation of solvent, etc. To overcome these limitations, researchers suggested different solvents and alternative technologies to replace the current amine scrubbing technique. Ionic liquids (ILs) are the most potential substitute among all. This is mainly because they have negligible vapour pressure and high thermal stability, which reduce solvent loss. However, there are up to a million possible combinations of cation and anion that may make up the ILs, which makes experimental works very time consuming and costly. In this work, optimal IL solvents specifically for carbon capture purpose are designed using computer-aided molecular design approach. This approach utilises group contribution method to estimate the thermophysical properties of ILs, and UNIFAC model to predict CO2 solubility in the ILs. Structural constraints are included to ensure that the synthesised ILs structure will satisfy the bonding requirement.

Global warming and urban heat island (UHI) effect impose a dual warming impact on cities, especially compact ones. Green roofs offer a plausible solution for climate adaptation. In compact humid-tropical Hong Kong, two green-roof and a control bare-roof plots were installed on a high-rise building. Precision sensors were installed along a holistic vertical temperature profile extending from outdoor air to roof surface, green-roof material layers, and indoor ceiling and air. Three apartments under the plots were kept vacant to monitor air-conditioning energy consumption. The comprehensive-systematic data allowed in-depth analysis of thermal performance of vegetation (Sedum and Perennial Peanut) and weather (sunny, cloudy and rainy) in summer. Intense solar radiation at Control plot triggered significant material heating, which in turn warmed near-ground air to intensify UHI effect and indoor space to lift energy consumption. Sedum plot with incomplete plant cover, sluggish transpiration and limited substrate moisture storage had feeble evapotranspiration cooling. The warmed roof passed heat to near-ground air and subsurface layers to impose a small indoor cooling load. Peanut plot with high transpiration rate can significantly cool foliage surface and near-ground air to ameliorate UHI. Its high moisture-holding capacity, however, can generate an appreciable heat-sink to push heat downwards and increase indoor cooling load. Practical hints on green roof design and management were distilled from the findings for application in Hong Kong and beyond and to contribute to climate-resilient cities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate adaptation; Cooling load; Extensive green roof; Greenery infilling; Heat sink effect; Urban heat island","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Energy utilization; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Heat sinks; Moisture; Oilseeds; Sun; Tall buildings; Transpiration; Vegetation; Climate adaptation; Cooling load; Extensive green roofs; Infilling; Urban heat island; Roofs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939998547

Samples of fat body were collected 2 h and 24 h after hormone injection. The administration of 20 pmol of Zopat-SK-1 to feeding larvae significantly increased concentrations of lipids and proteins and decreased the content of glycogen in fat body tissue in the 24 h experimental group. In contrast, the only increase in total lipid concentration in prepupal fat bodies was observed 24 h after Zopat-SK-1 treatment. Simultaneously, changes in the quality and quantity of free sugars in the hemolymph were measured. In larval hemolymph, a marked increase in free sugar concentration and a decrease in glucose content were observed 24 h and 2 h after Zopat-SK-1 application, respectively. No changes in the prepupal stage were observed. For the first time we show potent metabolic activity of sulfakinin in the fat body tissue of an insect.

We review the state of the art in physical modelling, simulation and control of ventilated bulk storage facilities, and in particular the storage of potatoes, from a state-space perspective. The basic physical relations that describe the dynamic behaviour of air and potatoes in a storage facility use laws of conservation of mass, energy and momentum and corresponding constitutive laws. However, a very complex physically based storage model is obtained if the macro climate in the air channels and the micro climate around the potato and all the interactions between air and potato are taken into consideration. Therefore, lumped, 1-D, 2-D and 3-D macro, and also some micro climate storage models were developed. These models basically focus on heat and moisture generation and transportation. The latest developments give more and more insight into the spatial distribution of the macro climate, using CFD simulation techniques. Traditionally, the indoor climate instead of the potato quality is controlled, to maintain a good product quality. However, quality control of the product can be realised if there is knowledge between the spatial distribution of temperature and moisture and the product quality. With the developments in CFD simulation, control algorithms and the state space framework, modelling and control of product quality is within reach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate control; Computational fluid dynamics; Food storage; Potatoes; State-space modelling","Algorithms; Climate control; Climate models; Computational fluid dynamics; Moisture; Quality control; Spatial distribution; Storage (materials); Conservation of mass , energy and momentum; Modelling and controls; Moisture generation; Potatoes; Spatial distribution of temperature; State-space framework; State-space modelling; Storage facilities; Food storage; agricultural technology; computational fluid dynamics; food storage; literature review; microclimate; moisture; potato; quality control; spatial distribution; ventilation; Solanum tuberosum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937947658

We define HCEs as emulsions with a volume fraction above the maximum closest packing fraction of monodisperse spheres, φm = 0.74, even if droplets are not of polyhedron shape. The solid-like rheological behavior of HCEs is characterized by yield stress and elasticity, properties which depend on droplet polydispersity and which are affected by caging at volume fractions about the jamming concentration, φj. A bimodal size distribution in HCEs diminishes caging and facilitates droplet movement, resulting in HCEs with negligible yield stress and no plateau in storage modulus. Thermodynamic forces automatically move HCEs toward the lowest free energy state, but since interdroplet forces create local minimums - points beyond which free energy temporarily increases before it reaches the global minimum of the system - the free energy of HCEs will settle at a local minimum unless additional energy is added. Several attempts have been undertaken to predict the elasticity of HCEs. In many cases, the elastic modulus of HCEs is higher than the one predicted from classical models, which only take into account spatial repulsion (or simply interfacial energy). Improved models based on free energy calculation should be developed to consider the disjoining pressure and interfacial rheology in addition to spatial repulsion. The disjoining pressure and interfacial viscoelasticity, which result in the deviation of elasticity from the classical model, can be regarded as parameters for quantifying the stability of HCEs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Disjoining pressure; Elasticity; Highly concentrated emulsions; Stability; Yield stress","Convergence of numerical methods; Drops; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Physical chemistry; Volume fraction; Yield stress; Bimodal size distribution; Disjoining pressures; Droplet polydispersities; Free-energy calculations; Highly concentrated emulsion; Lowest free-energy state; Physicochemical property; Rheological behaviors; Free energy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937759631

Pure magnesium and calcium hydroxides are convenient materials for storage of middle temperature heat (250-500 °C), however, both suffer from kinetic impediments. In this work, we studied the doping effect of various salts in order to affect the dehydration dynamics of these hydroxides. The screening among the selected classes of salts, namely, chlorides, nitrates, sulphates and acetates of alkaline metals, showed a valuable possibility to a) improve the dehydration dynamics, and b) manage the dehydration temperature. Variation of the dehydration temperature was shown to depend on the salt nature and content. A strong effect of nitrates and acetates on the dehydration rate of both hydroxides was revealed.

The effects of the weight ratios of the SA/titania precursor TTIP (titanium tetraisopropoxide) on the morphology, thermal performance and thermal conductivity of the prepared nanocapsules are discussed. The experimental results indicate that the SA was encapsulated in spheres with minimum and maximum diameters of 583.4 and 946.4 nm, at encapsulation ratios between 30.36% and 64.76%. The results indicated that there was no chemical interaction between the core and shell materials, SA and TiO2, which were compatible with each other under controlled synthesis conditions of pH 10. The NEPCMs with high mass ratios of SA/TTIP exhibited enhanced phase change properties and higher encapsulation efficiencies but lower thermal conductivities than NEPCMs with low mass ratios. Good thermal reliability and chemical stability of the NEPCMs were obtained by cycling the material through 2500 melting/solidifying cycles.

This uncertain load brings new challenges to market-oriented demand response programs (DRPs) specifically in the presence of renewable energy resources (RER). Being a special type of load, EVs are highly capable of providing a significant amount of flexible load demand through participating in various types of DRPs, while using their battery storage potentials allows a higher penetration level of intermittent RER in the grid. Therefore, there is a strong need to increase EV owner’s participation in the market by providing attractive financial benefit-based decision-making tools and simplifying the market process to enhance system reliability and reduce price volatility. In this paper, a novel optimal decision-making methodology is proposed which, unlike previous works, utilizes a grid characteristic’s model within a game-theoretical approach, conflicting and capturing economic interests of both players together and evaluates the optimum strategies for a successful market operation in simplest way. This approach can facilitate both EV owners and utilities to derive their robust bidding strategies, in which they can create a simple business case analysis to weigh their benefits of participation in the market. To evaluate the performance, a simulation framework with uncertain load demands and generation has been developed and compared.

It is assumed that the tank is initially stratified during its previous heat storing/charging operation. Meanwhile, the collector loop is assumed to be active. Three-dimensional (3D) unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation program (Fluent 14.0) was constructed based on the actual operation conditions and the actual geometry of a mantle solar storage tank (MSST). The laminar model was thought for treating convection in the flow field. The governing equations in the cylindrical coordinate have been used in the simulation of flow fields inside the mantle storage tank where realistic boundary and initial conditions were applied and discretised by employing the finite volume method. Validation of the unsteady flow computation results with experimental data found in the literature has shown a good agreement. The obtained results from the computer simulations were discussed and concluded as depending on the thermal stratification parameters. The results show that for higher values of Grashof number, the pre-established thermal stratification is well preserved during the discharging operation mode and thus supplied hot water for usage as long as possible. In order to increase levels of thermal stratification or have least mixing inside the tank during the consumption period, the tank inflow Reynolds number should be kept below certain values. In these cases, the storage tank is enabling to provide proper amount of hot water with a proper temperature for consumption purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","3D unsteady CFD simulation; Mantle heat exchanger; MIX number; Thermal energy storage; Thermal stratification; Thermocline","Computational geometry; Digital storage; Finite volume method; Flow fields; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Oceanography; Reynolds number; Solar water heaters; Tanks (containers); Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Thermal stratification; Unsteady flow; Water; Boundary and initial conditions; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Cylindrical coordinates; Numerical investigations; Solar domestic hot water systems; Stratification parameters; Unsteady cfd simulations; Unsteady flow computations; Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; cylinder; finite volume method; model validation; performance assessment; solar power; thermocline; three-dimensional modeling; unsteady flow; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928227292

It is responsible for emitting 4-5% of the total anthropogenic CO2. Due to consistently increasing demand of iron and steel products for human needs, fossil-fuel energy use and CO2 emission will continue to grow in this industry. So there is a strong motivation to develop and implement energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies as well as carbon reduction programs for this industry. Enhancing the development and deployment of high-temperature waste heat energy recovering technologies along a desired combination of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will be the effective solution to reducing CO2 emissions from iron and steel production. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the worldwide carbon reduction programs and new CO2 breakthrough technologies for energy saving and carbon capture and storage in iron and steel making processes by collating updated information from a wide range of sources. Also, a discussion on the selection of the appropriate technology and their barriers and stages of development and deployment is presented. It is found that lots of factors that limit the role of using biomass in CO2 abatement, so implementation of CCS technology in coal-based integrated steel plant would be an efficient means for sustainable green iron and steel manufacturing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifi c application areas such as photovoltaic, energy storage, and sensors will also be given in a subsection of the chapter. Moreover, our approach to building nanocrystalline chalcopyrite semiconductor thin fi lms for photovoltaic applications is given. Chalcopyrite semiconductors are good alternatives to silicon-based photovoltaic devices because of their appropriate band gap energy, high absorption coeffi cient, and stability. Although selenium-based chalcopyrite materials have very high energy conversion effi ciencies in photovoltaics, sulfur-based semiconductors have been quickly replacing them due to the non-toxicity of the sulfur-containing materials. Th is chapter gives information on the nanocrystalline thin-fi lm deposition of both selenium- and sulfur-based chalcopyrite semiconductors via SP. Applications of these materials in the photovoltaic area are also discussed. Furthermore, our very recent work on the SP of copper-based photovoltaic devices on fl exible substrates is summarized. Usage of fl exible substrates, polymers, and metal foils, which combine the advantages of being very lightweight with mechanical robustness, is discussed.

Two different methods for measuring these form factors, the method proposed by Rosenbluth and the polarization-transfer method, yield contradictory results. It is assumed that this contradiction can be removed upon taking into account the hard part of the contribution of two-photon exchange to the cross section for elastic electron-proton scattering. This contribution can measured experimentally via a precision comparison of the cross sections for the elastic scattering of positrons and electrons on protons. Such a measurement, performed at the VEPP-3 storage ring in Novosibirsk at the beam energies of 1.6 and 1.0 GeV for positron (electron) scattering angles in the ranges of θe = 15°–25° and 55°–75° in the first case and in the range of θe = 65°–105° in the second case is described in the present article.

To account for technological progress over time, an ""experience curve"" approach is used to project future levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) based on technology progress ratios and deployment rates in worldwide energy scenarios, together with European energy and technology cost estimates. Under base case assumptions, the LCOE in 2040 for baseload NGCC-CCS plants is estimated to be 71 €2012/MWh. In contrast, the LCOE for electricity generated intermittently from IRES is estimated at 68, 82, and 104 €2012/MWh for concentrated solar power, offshore wind, and photovoltaic systems, respectively. Considering uncertainties in costs, deployment rates and geographical conditions, LCOE ranges for IRES are wider than for NGCC-CCS. We also assess energy storage technologies versus NGCC-CCS as backup options for IRES. Here, for base case assumptions NGCC-CCS with an LCOE of 90 €2012/MWh in 2040 is more costly than pumped hydro storage (PHS) or compressed air and energy storage (CAES) with LCOEs of 57 and 88 €2012/MWh, respectively. Projected costs for battery backup are 78, 149, and 321 €2012/MWh for Zn-Br, ZEBRA, and Li-ion battery systems, respectively. Finally, we compare four stylised low-carbon systems on a common basis (including all ancillary costs for IRES). In the 2040 base case, the system employing only NGCC-CCS has the lowest LCOE and lowest cost of CO2 avoided with CO2 emissions of 45 kg/MWh. A zero CO2 emission system with IRES plus PHS as backup is 42% more expensive in terms of LCOE, and 13% more costly than a system with IRES plus NGCC-CCS backup with emissions of 23 kg CO2/MWh.

However, the lack of industrially weavable and knittable conductive yarns in conjunction with high capacitance, limits the wide-scale application of such textiles. Here pristine soft conductive yarns are continuously produced by a scalable method with the use of twist-bundle-drawing technique, and are mechanically robust enough to be knitted to a cloth by a commercial cloth knitting machine. Subsequently, the reduced-graphene-oxide-modified conductive yarns covered with a hierarchical structure of MnO2 nanosheets and a polypyrrole thin film were used to fabricate weavable, knittable and wearable yarn supercapacitors. The resultant modified yarns exhibit specific capacitances as high as 36.6 mF cm-1 and 486 mF cm-2 in aqueous electrolyte (three-electrode cell) or 31 mF cm-1 and 411 mF cm-2 in all solid-state two-electrode cell.

Whether an expansion device can function properly despite the fluctuations is decisive to the successful use of SEHRAC. Capillary tube (CT) and thermostatic expansion valve (TEV) are the two most used expansion devices in SEHRAC, but a suitable type has never been identified in extant literature. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to enable a side-by-side comparison of the two expansion devices. A prototype SEHRAC, which could be switched between the CT and TEV systems, was designed and setup in a test facility for two identical sets of experiments. For each set of experiments, a series of tests under different outdoor temperatures were conducted. It was found that an overall better performance was achieved by the TEV system. The space cooling and water heating capacities were on average 16.3-19.4% and 18.5-23.4% larger than the CT system. The overall coefficient of performance was also found 12.5-20.9% higher. The results confirmed that TEV is preferred for use in SEHRAC. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air-conditioner; Capillary tube; Heat recovery; Space cooling; Thermostatic expansion valve; Water heating","Capillary tubes; Cooling; Domestic appliances; Energy conservation; Expansion; Intensive care units; Phase change materials; Tubes (components); Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Coefficient of Performance; Experimental investigations; Laboratory experiments; Refrigerant pressure; Room air conditioners; Space cooling; Thermostatic expansion valves; Water heating; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929996451

The sol-gel method was used to synthesize the BNT nanopowder and spin coating was used to fabricate the nanocomposite films. The volume fraction of the BNT (∅) was in the range of 0.1-0.3. The structural, dielectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties of the samples were extensively investigated. Theoretical models, including Maxwell, Furukawa, Clausius-Mossotti, and effective medium theory (EMT), were employed to describe the effective dielectric permittivity of the composites. It is shown that the incorporation of BNT into the copolymer as a composite film significantly enhances the pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties. The P(VDF-TrFE)-BNT nanocomposite film with ∅=0.2 exhibits an exceptionally high remanent polarization of 115 mC/m2 and pyroelectric coefficient of 50 μC/m2 K1.

The system integrates also secondary energy components as an energy storage (ESC) that combines a water electrolyzer and a storage gas tank, an energy recovery (ERC) based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and an ultra-capacitor storage (USC). This components work together to keep the energy storage in one hand and to satisfy the load requirements in other hand.

This study compared the increase in liver fat content in response to overfeeding with a high fat diet in South Asian and Caucasian men when matched for body fat percentage. Methods: Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/m2) and 10 Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/m2), aged 20-40 y, matched for body fat percentage, were included. A weight maintenance diet was given for 3 days based on the individual energy requirement. Individual energy requirement of the subjects was calculated based on their body composition (measured by hydro densitometry and deuterium dilution) and activity counts (accelerometer). Liver fat content was measured before and after 4 days of overfeeding (50 % excess energy need) with a high fat diet (60 % energy from fat). Fat distribution was measured by anthropometry and an MRI scan of the abdomen while liver fat content using 1H-MRS. Results: While having a similar body fat % (P∈=∈0.58), South Asians had a lower BMI (P∈=∈0.04) than Caucasians. Liver fat content at baseline did not differ between ethnicities (P∈=∈0.48) and was associated with visceral fat area (P∈=∈0.002, R2∈=∈0.56) but not with ethnicity (P∈=∈0.13). Overfeeding with a high fat diet significantly increased liver fat (P∈=∈0.01) but the increase did not differ between ethnicities (P∈=∈0.47). There was no difference in the total abdominal fat area (P∈=∈0.37), subcutaneous abdominal fat area (P∈=∈0.18) and visceral fat area (VAT, P∈=∈0.32). However as a percentage of the total abdominal fat area, VAT was higher in South Asians (P∈=∈0.003). Conclusion: Despite a relatively higher percentage of visceral fat area, liver fat increased similarly in South Asian and Caucasian men in response to overfeeding with a high fat diet.

Generally, renewable technologies require higher initial investments in infrastructure than fossil-based power systems. To assess the tradeoffs of increased up-front emissions and reduced operational emissions, we present, to our knowledge, the first global, integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) of long-term, wide-scale implementation of electricity generation from renewable sources (i.e., photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and hydropower) and of carbon dioxide capture and storage for fossil power generation. We compare emissions causing particulate matter exposure, freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and climate change for the climate-change-mitigation (BLUE Map) and business-as-usual (Baseline) scenarios of the International Energy Agency up to 2050. We use a vintage stock model to conduct an LCA of newly installed capacity year-by-year for each region, thus accounting for changes in the energy mix used to manufacture future power plants. Under the Baseline scenario, emissions of air and water pollutants more than double whereas the low-carbon technologies introduced in the BLUE Map scenario allow a doubling of electricity supply while stabilizing or even reducing pollution. Material requirements per unit generation for low-carbon technologies can be higher than for conventional fossil generation: 11-40 times more copper for photovoltaic systems and 6-14 times more iron for wind power plants. However, only two years of current global copper and one year of iron production will suffice to build a low-carbon energy system capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

However, the kinetics of OER is typically sluggish, and conventional OER catalysts are scarce and expensive. Hence, inexpensive and effective catalysts that accelerate the OER kinetics and reduce the overpotential are urgently needed. In this paper, we reported multi-layer graphene-supported perovskite Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ (BLF-MLG) as a highly active OER catalyst. Electrochemical results showed that the BLF-MLG hybrid exhibited a high current density (∼23 mA/cm2 at 0.60 V vs. mercury/mercury oxide electrode (MMO)) and a more negative onset potential (∼0.43 V vs. MMO). Furthermore, the hybrid showed a smaller Tafel slope (77 mV/decade) and improved long-term stability. The remarkable OER performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between BLF and graphene. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2012, energy-related CO2 emissions reached a record of 31.6 gigatonnes which corresponds to 1.4% comparing to 2011. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy revolution is needed to achieve a 50% reduction of global CO2 emissions relative to current levels by 2050. In this revolution, energy efficiency, energy storage, new transport technologies, nuclear energy and CO2 capture and storage should play a crucial role. Furthermore, renewable energy technologies comprise a large potential for emission reductions which takes second place after energy efficiency improvements. Until 2035, renewable energy will also have greater impact than other potential alternatives including both CO2 capture and storage or nuclear energy. For this reason, renewable energy industries, markets, and policy frameworks are developed rapidly in recent years, and they will play a substantial role in the world's future. This paper presents an overview of renewable electric power capacity worldwide and discusses the current status, technologies, industry and recent developments of renewable energy sources (RESs) in detail. In addition, the top countries in terms of total installed renewable electric power capacity are also identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report on the synthesis of PdxPt(100-x)/C nanoparticles and their electrocatalytic properties for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, compared with their activity for the reverse oxidation of formic acid to CO2. We find that PdxPt(100-x)/C nanoparticles have a very low onset potential for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid of ca. 0 V vs RHE, which approaches the theoretical equilibrium potential of 0.02 V vs RHE for this reaction. Furthermore, the Pd70Pt30/C catalyst shows a faradaic efficiency of 88% toward formic acid after 1 h of electrolysis at -0.4 V vs RHE with an average current density of ∼5 mA/cm2. Therefore, this catalyst shows a competing or even better faradaic efficiency toward formic acid compared to recently reported catalysts, at a substantially lower overpotential, while avoiding a strong deactivation that was observed with previously reported Pd-based catalysts. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; electrocatalysis; formic acid; nanoparticles; palladium-platinum catalysts","Carbon; Catalyst deactivation; Catalysts; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Formic acid; Nanoparticles; Platinum; Reduction; Synthesis (chemical); Average current densities; Electrocatalytic properties; Electrochemical reductions; Equilibrium potentials; Faradaic efficiencies; Oxidation of formic acids; Palladium-platinum; Pd-Pt nanoparticles; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941775961

In the first step, the dispersed GNPs were mixed with palmitic acid (PA) particles using an ultra-sonication method. Then, the prepared material was added to form-stable phase change materials (PA/PPy) obtained by a polymerisation technique. The amount of PA particles remained constant in the prepared form-stable phase change materials. FT-IR and SEM analyses were used to investigate the structure and surface morphology of form-stable PCMs, respectively. The thermal properties, stability and conductivity of the materials were also characterised using DSC, TGA and thermal conductivity analysis, respectively. The results indicated that GNPs had a significant effect on improving the thermal conductivity of form-stable PCMs (PA/PPy). By doping 1.6% of GNPs, the thermal conductivity and thermal capacity of PA/PPy/GNPs form-stable PCMs could reach up to 0.43 W/m K and 151 J/g, respectively.

Therefore, the single-phase AC-DC converter should be designed to avoid using the short lifetime electrolytic capacitor. In this paper, a bidirectional single-phase AC-DC PWM converter using an additional line-level AC storage capacitor as the AC-DC power balancing device is proposed. A condition for zero ripple DC bus voltage is established such that a small DC bus capacitor can be used. Both the AC-DC power balancing and DC bus filtering capacitors can be designed small without using electrolytic capacitor in order to extend the converter lifetime. A control strategy that minimizes the size of capacitance is proposed, analyzed and verified.

However, in most instances the control law is obtained without any performance considerations and it has to be calculated by solving a complex partial differential equation (PDE). In order to address these issues we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) approach into the energy-balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) method, which is a form of PBC in which the closed-loop energy is equal to the difference between the stored and supplied energies. We propose a technique to parameterize EB-PBC that preserves the systems's PDE matching conditions, does not require the specification of a global desired Hamiltonian, includes performance criteria, and is robust. The parameters of the control law are found by using actor-critic (AC) RL, enabling the search for near-optimal control policies satisfying a desired closed-loop energy landscape. The advantage is that the solutions learned can be interpreted in terms of energy shaping and damping injection, which makes it possible to numerically assess stability using passivity theory. From the RL perspective, our proposal allows for the class of port-Hamiltonian systems to be incorporated in the AC framework, speeding up the learning thanks to the resulting parameterization of the policy. The method has been successfully applied to the pendulum swing-up problem in simulations and real-life experiments. © 2014 IEEE.","Actor-critic (AC); energy-balancing (EB); passivity-based control (PBC); port-Hamiltonian (PH) systems; reinforcement learning (RL)","Closed loop control systems; Control theory; Energy balance; Machine learning; Power control; Reinforcement learning; Actor critic; Energy-balancing; Partial differential equations (PDE); Passivity based control; Pendulum swing-up problem; Performance criterion; Port hamiltonians; Port-Hamiltonian systems; Hamiltonians",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027922109

One barrier to the widespread usage of hydrogen as a transportation fuel is its safe, efficient, and inexpensive on-board storage, which is a combination currently lacking in conventional hydrogen storage technologies including cryogenic and high-pressure vessels. Chemical hydrides hold great promise in this respect due to their capacity to store hydrogen as a solid. Among the chemical hydrides, boron hydrides have the largest volumetric and mass hydrogen densities. The two major methods to produce hydrogen from a chemical hydride are hydrolysis and thermolysis. Since hydrolysis has very slow kinetics, catalytic hydrolysis can be used to achieve higher production rates. Previously reported work on hydrogen generation from chemical hydrides always used very small systems, and so they produced a limited amount of hydrogen. In contrast, in this paper the usage of novel catalysts and catalyst morphologies to yield the highest possible hydrogen generation kinetics is presented. An effective hydrolysis reaction occurs only when chemical hydrides are in contact with a certain catalyst. Ruthenium (Ru), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), cobalt (Co), Ni-B, Co-B, Co-P, Ni-Co-B, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and graphene are examples of these catalysts. Moreover, platinum supported on carbon (Pt/C), which is extensively utilized in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is also appropriate for hydrogen gas generation. Precious metal catalysts are costly, whereas metal and alloy catalysts from iron, nickel, and cobalt are more inexpensive. Therefore, researchers have been trying to replace precious metal catalysts with inexpensive materials to make hydrogen generation less costly. The hydrogen gas generation rate is a very important performance metric for these catalytic systems. Interestingly, the hydrogen generation rate has been measured in several different ways. One of these ways is to measure the volume produced over the entire experiment and report as ml/min, L/h, L/day, m3/h, etc. The other is in situ measurement of hydrogen mass flow rates possibly by using a mass flow meter. However, for most of the studies, the reported hydrogen generation rate is normalized by the grams of catalyst and reported as L min-1 g-1 catalyst. However, this is not a robust way to express the catalytic activity since the catalytic activity is a function of the active surface area which is related to but not directly proportional to the amount of catalyst. In this work, the hydrogen generation rates and the rate equations reported in the literature are reinvestigated. The types of catalysts, novel catalyst morphologies, mechanisms for hydrogen generation, hydrogen generation models, and application areas for on-board hydrogen generation are discussed. Moreover, our group's current research investigating novel catalyst morphologies and the approach are discussed. © 2015 by Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Although there are several animal models of NASH, consensus regarding the optimal model is lacking. We aimed to compare features of NASH in the two most widely-used mouse models: methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet and Western diet. Methods: Mice were fed standard chow, MCD diet for 8 weeks, or Western diet (45% energy from fat, predominantly saturated fat, with 0.2% cholesterol, plus drinking water supplemented with fructose and glucose) for 16 weeks. Liver pathology and metabolic profile were compared. Results: The metabolic profile associated with human NASH was better mimicked by Western diet. Although hepatic steatosis (i.e., triglyceride accumulation) was also more severe, liver nonesterified fatty acid content was lower than in the MCD diet group. NASH was also less severe and less reproducible in the Western diet model, as evidenced by less liver cell death/apoptosis, inflammation, ductular reaction, and fibrosis. Various mechanisms implicated in human NASH pathogenesis/progression were also less robust in the Western diet model, including oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy deregulation, and hedgehog pathway activation. Conclusion: Feeding mice a Western diet models metabolic perturbations that are common in humans with mild NASH, whereas administration of a MCD diet better models the pathobiological mechanisms that cause human NAFLD to progress to advanced NASH. © 2015 Machado et al.

From this perspective, restricted energy resources are considered as sufficient to satisfy the energy demand. Taken these issues into account, the resources to meet the energy demand must be created. Furthermore, the existing energy must be used efficiently, which makes the energy saving more important. In this case, the energy saving in lighting is also quite important. The energy consumed for lighting makes up the 20 % of the total consumed electrical energy. With this purpose, more efficient lighting components should be used. Power LEDs are currently manufactured as an alternative lighting source to conventional lighting used at present. A constant current is required for operation of power LEDs. In the present study, the current limited low power LED drivers were examined. For this aim, three different current driving circuits were investigated in terms of their powers. First circuit is a basic driving circuit with a resistance. Second circuit is a LED driving circuit with LM117 regulator, and third one is a current limiting LED driver circuit based on the DC-DC buck converter. Simulations of the current limiting LED driving circuits based on the DC-DC buck converter were prepared. The data from the simulation applications were obtained. Then, the circuit applications were conducted under laboratory conditions. The input current, the total loss, the output power, and the output current of the circuit were measured. The data of output current of these drive circuits were examined in terms of the energy optimization. Efficiencies of these circuits were obtained at the result of simulation and laboratory measurements.","Energy optimization; Lighting efficiency; Power LED drivers","Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy management; Light emitting diodes; DC-DC buck converter; Energy optimization; Energy saving in lightings; Laboratory conditions; Laboratory measurements; Lighting efficiency; Power LED; Simulation applications; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941264701

The study involved monitoring of the thermal impact and modeling of the three-dimensional temperature evolution of the storage aquifer and over- and underlying units. Special attention was paid to non-uniformity of the background temperature, which varies laterally and vertically in the aquifer. Two models were applied with different levels of detail regarding initial conditions and heterogeneity of hydraulic and thermal properties: a fine-scale heterogeneity model which construed the lateral and vertical temperature distribution more realistically, and a simplified model which represented the aquifer system with only a limited number of homogeneous layers. Fine-scale heterogeneity was shown to be important to accurately model the ATES-impacted vertical temperature distribution and the maximum and minimum temperatures in the storage aquifer, and the spatial extent of the thermal plumes. The fine-scale heterogeneity model resulted in larger thermally impacted areas and larger temperature anomalies than the simplified model. The models showed that scattered and scarce monitoring data of ATES-induced temperatures can be interpreted in a useful way by groundwater and heat transport modeling, resulting in a realistic assessment of the thermal impact. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Groundwater monitoring; Heterogeneity; Numerical modeling; The Netherlands; Thermal conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939937789

SIRT1 is a NADdependent protein deacetylase possessing antiaging activities in a wide range of organisms. The current study demonstrates that mice with adipose tissue-selective overexpression of hSIRT1(H363Y), a dominant-negative mutant that disrupts endogenous SIRT1 activity, show accelerated development ofmetabolic aging. These mice, referred to as Adipo-H363Y, exhibit hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, ectopic lipid deposition, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance at a much younger age than their wild-type littermates. The metabolic defects of Adipo- H363Y are associated with abnormal epigenetic modifications and chromatin remodeling in their adipose tissues, as a result of excess accumulation of biotin, which inhibits endogenous SIRT1 activity, leading to increased inflammation, cellularity, and collagen deposition. The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 plays an important role in biotin accumulation within adipose tissues of Adipo- H363Y. Calorie restriction prevents biotin accumulation, abolishes abnormal histone biotinylation, and completely restores the metabolic and adipose functions of Adipo- H363Y. The effects are mimicked by short-term restriction of biotin intake, an approach potentially translatable to humans for maintaining the epigenetic and chromatin remodeling capacity of adipose tissues and preventing aging-associated metabolic disorders. © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 2; biotin; collagen; glucose; histone; insulin; sirtuin 1; unclassified drug; Acacb protein, mouse; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; histone; RNA; SIRT1 protein, human; sirtuin 1; aging; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; biotinylation; caloric restriction; chromatin assembly and disassembly; controlled study; dyslipidemia; enzyme activity; epididymis fat; epigenetics; gene overexpression; glucose intolerance; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; male; metabolic aging; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; wild type; adipose tissue; aging; animal; DNA microarray; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; mutation; physiology; transgenic mouse; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Animals; Biotinylation; Caloric Restriction; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Gene Expression Regulation; Histones; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA; Sirtuin 1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933504140

Evaluation of these materials has focused on adsorption of pure methane, although commercial natural gas also contains small amounts of higher hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane, which adsorb more strongly than methane. There is, thus, a possibility that these higher hydrocarbons will accumulate in the MOF after multiple operating (adsorption/desorption) cycles, and reduce the storage capacity. To study the net effect of ethane and propane on the performance of an adsorbed natural gas (ANG) tank, we developed a mathematical model based on thermodynamics and mass balance equations that describes the state of the tank at any instant. The required inputs are the pure-component isotherms, and mixture adsorption data are calculated using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST). We focused on how the ""deliverable energy"" provided by the ANG tank to the engine changed over 200 operating cycles for a sample of 120 MOF structures. We found that, with any MOF, the ANG tank performance monotonically declines during early operating cycles until a ""cyclic steady state"" is reached. We determined that the best materials when the fuel is 100% methane are not necessarily the best when the fuel includes ethane and propane. Among the materials tested, some top MOFs are MOF-143 &gt; NU-800 &gt; IRMOF-14 &gt; IRMOF-20 &gt; MIL-100 &gt; NU-125 &gt; IRMOF-1 &gt; NU-111.

Field data, such as drill cuttings and a calcite cap-rock overlying the high-temperature geothermal reservoir, suggest that mineral CO2 and H2S sequestration already plays an important role within Hellisheidi geothermal system. The data indicate CO2 sequestration to be most intensive from 550–800-m depth below surface, while H2S sequestration is most intensive below 800-m depth. Injecting and precipitating CO2 and H2S into nearby formations with the objective of imitating and accelerating natural sequestration processes should therefore be considered as an environmentally benign process. Reactive transport simulations predict rapid and efficient mineralization of both CO2 and H2S into thermodynamically stable minerals, with calcite, magnesite, and pyrrhotite being the favored carbonate and sulfide minerals to form. At intermediate depths and low temperatures (25–90 ∘C), calcite is the main CO2 sequestering carbonate predicted to form, while magnesite is the only carbonate predicted to form at high temperatures ((Formula presented.)). Despite only being indicative, it is concluded from this study that the capture and sequestration of CO2 and H2S from geothermal power plants are a viable option for reducing their gas emissions and that basalts may comprise ideal geological CO2 and H2S storage formations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CO2 sequestration; CO2–H2S–water–basalt interaction; H2S sequestration; Reactive transport modeling","Basalt; Calcite; Carbonation; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Geothermal fields; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal wells; Magnesite; Sulfur compounds; CO2 sequestration; Environmentally benign process; H2S sequestration; Mineral sequestration; Reactive transport modeling; Reactive transport models; Sequestration process; Thermodynamically stable; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; geothermal energy; geothermal power; power plant; reactive transport; waste management; Iceland; Reykjavik",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928720225

As a new type of consumer load in the electric power system, electric vehicles (EVs) also provide different opportunities, including the capability of utilizing EVs as a storage unit via vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) options instead of peak power procurement from the grid. In this paper, as the main contribution to the literature, a collaborative evaluation of dynamic-pricing and peak power limiting-based DR strategies with a bi-directional utilization possibility for EV and energy storage system (ESS) is realized.

Communicating that environmental policies and activities are motivated by concern for the environment could elicit positive reactions, but may also lead to accusations of corporate greenwashing - the idea that companies deliberately frame their activities as 'green' in order to look environmentally friendly. The results of three experiments demonstrate that people easily suspect greenwashing when an energy company invests in environmental measures. Importantly, suspicions of corporate greenwashing are reduced by acknowledging economic motives instead of communicating environmental motives for such investments. Suspicion of strategic organizational behavior mediates the effect of communicated motive on perceived corporate greenwashing. This indirect effect occurs primarily among people who are not by nature very skeptical about organizational communications in general.

In addition, remanufacturing and recycling options related to the end of life for tires are crucial issues at present because of difficulties related to the degradation of these scrap tires in the environment and the economic benefits of material and energy recovery. Thus, effective collection, storage, recycling, and appropriate disposal methods are required for used tires without damaging the environment by designing an efficient closed-loop supply chain network. Based on this motivation, we present a holistic modeling approach for a tire closed-loop supply chain using mixed integer linear programming. Alternative recovery options such as remanufacturing, recycling, and energy recovery are considered simultaneously in the model. The main objective of this study was to develop a multi-objective, multi-echelon, multi-product, and multi-period logistics network design model in a more holistic manner while also considering environmental issues. To quantify the environmental impact and the closed-loop supply chain, we used a life cycle assessment-based and damage-oriented method (eco-indicator 99). We applied the model to an illustrative case study and an interactive fuzzy goal programming approach was utilized to solve the proposed fuzzy multiple-objective network optimization model. In order to obtain the best profit values and to satisfy the environmental indicator targets, we examined the effects of some parameters (factors) within the profit and damage function using an experimental technique based on the Taguchi design.

Besides the characterisation of the isolates, the main focus of this work was to evaluate their ability to survive through simulated gastrointestinal tract passage as well as the effect of the spray drying process to be used as concentrated cultures in the food industry. Both lactic acid bacteria produced any of the virulence determinants investigated; they exhibited no significant antibiotic resistances and <1 log unit reduction in viable counts was obtained after exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. Concentrated cultures of P. acidilactici HA-6111-2 in 10% (w/v) of reconstituted skim milk were obtained by spray drying and, after 60 days of storage at 4 °C, <1 log unit reduction in viable count was recorded. In conclusion, from these preliminary characterisation tests and its extended viability in the dried form, this P. acidilactici strain should be considered as a potentially useful probiotic. The probiotic nature of Pediococcus acidilactici HA-6111-2 strain was investigated and results of each characterization test performed were compared with a commercial probiotic. All the prerequisites tested to consider our strain as probiotic were achieved. Pediococcus acidilactici HA-6111-2 survived after spray-drying in reconstituted skim milk and during storage at 4 °C for 60 days, thereby showing to be a potential candidate to be used in the production of functional foods. © 2015 Institute of Food Science and Technology.","Antibiotic susceptibility; Beneficial characteristics; Concentrated cultures; Dried powder; Gastrointestinal tract simulation; Lactic acid bacteria; P. acidilactici HA-6111-2; Spray drying; Storage; Survival; Virulence factors","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Dairies; Energy storage; Food microbiology; Food storage; Lactic acid; Spray drying; Antibiotic susceptibilities; Beneficial characteristics; Concentrated cultures; Dried powder; Gastrointestinal tract; Lactic acid bacteria; P. acidilactici HA-6111-2; Survival; Virulence factors; Probiotics; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pediococcus acidilactici",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927798350

The factors evaluated were the presence or absence of the inner skin, geographical origin, storage conditions (ambient temperature, in a stove at 30 and 50 °C, in a chamber at 30 and 50 °C and 90 % RH, refrigerated and freezing) and type of package (none, low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene). The fruits studied were almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts from different countries. The properties measured were moisture content, water activity, colour coordinates (L*, a* and b*) and texture parameters (hardness and friability). Experimental data were modelled using neural networks. The results showed that the almonds from Spain and Romania had aw greater than 0.6, and therefore, its stability was not guaranteed, contrarily to the other samples that presented values of aw lower than 0.6. The colour coordinate lightness varied from 40.60 to 49.30 in the fresh samples but decreased during storage, indicating darkening. In general, an increase in hardness and friability was observed with the different storage conditions. Neuron weight analysis has shown that the origin was a good predictor for moisture content and texture; whereas, the storage condition was a good predictor for aw and colour. In conclusion, it was possible to verify that the properties of nuts are very different depending on origin; they are better preserved at lower temperatures and the type of package used did not impact the properties studied. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Colour; Neural network analysis; Nut; Storage; Texture; Water activity","Color; Digital storage; Energy storage; Hardness; Moisture; Moisture determination; Neural networks; Polyethylenes; Textures; Geographical origins; Lower temperatures; Nut; Physical and chemical properties; Storage condition; Texture parameters; Water activity; Weight analysis; Food storage; Corylus; Juglans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926155679

Typically, mono-well storage systems are thought to require the use of separate aquifers. This study assessed the suitability of using heat and cold storage in a single deep geothermal aquifer for district heating and cooling. An integrated modelling approach was used for evaluating the controls on the energy efficiency of high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES). The temperature difference (δ. T) of 40 °C between the injection temperatures for the cold and warm storages 20 °C and 60 °C was significant, which required accounting for transient variation of density and viscosity due to temperature and pressure within the modelling code SEAWAT. The developed model was applied for a geothermal reservoir from the Moesian platform, in the Bucharest area, Romania. The sensitivity of the system efficiency was analyzed with respect to the main physical (density, viscosity, longitudinal dispersivity) and operational design parameters (distance between warm and cold storage volumes, flow rates). Uncertainties in geological heterogeneity and the associated range in longitudinal dispersivity values (5-50. m) resulted in significant efficiency differences (80-55%). While reducing the lateral distance between multiple mono-well systems increased their overall efficiency due to positive thermal interference, a minimum vertical distance of (160. m) was required between the injection/extraction filters to prevent interaction between the cold and warm storage volumes.

The compensator obtains energy from the dc link to sustain the voltage on its dc side and generates an ac voltage to counteract the voltage ripple on the dc link. As the compensator processes small ripple voltage on the dc link and reactive power, it can be implemented with low-voltage devices, and thus, its volt-amp rating is small. As the required energy storage of the dc link, formed by a reduced value of the dc-link capacitor and the compensator, is reduced, the architecture allows replacing popularly used electrolytic capacitors with alternatives of longer lifetime, such as power film capacitors, or extending the system lifetime even if there is a significant reduction in the capacitance of electrolytic capacitors due to aging. Detailed mathematical analysis on the static and dynamic behaviors of the overall system, and the control method will be presented. A simplified design procedure for the compensator will be given. A 2-kW, 220-V, 50-Hz prototype has been built and evaluated. The theoretical predictions are compared favorably with experimental results.

By using the method of quantum NEMS kinetics (NK) the relaxation NEMS energy storage in the form of limited planes (100) Fe172 cube in fcc iron crystal was studied. For comparison, the calculation a similar structure atomic cluster Fe172 was carried out by the molecular dynamics method (MD) for temperature T = 293 K. Analysis of computer-related experiments have shown that the relaxation of the NEMS energy storage Fe172 and the MD atomic cluster Fe172 from an initial nonequilibrium state has significant differences both in the kinetics, and in a variety of structural transformations. It is shown that the iron MD cluster relaxation is insignificant and its final total binding energy per atom is 2 eV/at lower than the crystal one. The NK-method revealed that after relaxation there is a significant change in the shape and the pair radial distribution function of nuclei the NEMS energy storage. It significantly increases the binding energy up to 3.34 eV/at, which is only about 1 eV/at less than the binding energy of the crystalline iron. It is shown an opportunity to undergo a process of self-organization the NEMS energy storage through several intermediate metastable states. It is manifested that fluctuation rebuild the cube into a cuboid with a strong bending of the cube surfaces occurs at 20 ps of relaxation, and there is the second transformation being with trapezoid change of faces at 40 ps of relaxation process. This effect cardinally differentiates NK relaxation of the NEMS energy storage cube Fe172 from MD relaxation of the atomic cluster Fe172 in the crystalline iron. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","computer simulation; energy storage; iron cluster; Quantum NEMS","Atomic beams; Atoms; Computer simulation; Crystal atomic structure; Crystals; Distribution functions; Energy storage; Geometry; Iron; Iron compounds; Molecular dynamics; Nanocrystalline materials; Storage (materials); Iron cluster; Molecular dynamics methods; Nano electromechanical systems; Nonequilibrium state; Quantum relaxation; Radial distribution functions; Self organizations; Structural transformation; Binding energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928494380

Energy harvesting instead of battery is a better power source for these wearable devices due to many advantages. However, harvested energy is naturally unstable and program execution will be interrupted frequently. Non-volatile processors demonstrate promising advantages to back up volatile state before the system energy is depleted. However, it also introduces non-negligible energy and area overhead. Since the chip size is a vital factor for wearable devices, in this work, we target non-volatile register reduction for application-specific systems. We propose to analyze the application program and determine efficient backup positions, by which the necessary non-volatile register file size can be significantly reduced.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of heat pasteurization, pH adjustment, ascorbic acid addition as well as storage under agitation and light or dark condition on betacyanin content in red-fleshed dragon fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus) juice and concentrate. The concentrate was produced by concentrating clarified red-fleshed dragon fruit juice in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. UV-Visible spectrophotometer was used for analyzing betacyanin content. Addition of 0.25 % ascorbic acid, pH 4.0, and pasteurization at 65 °C for 30 min were selected as the best processing conditions to retain betacyanin content in red-fleshed dragon fruit juice. Storage at the agitation speed of 220 rpm showed that the concentrated samples had higher betacyanin stability compared to juice, while both juice and concentrate had almost similar betacyanin stability when tested for storage in the presence of light. In summary, ascorbic acid stabilized betacyanin in both juice and concentrate at agitated or non-agitated conditions. In contrast, light degraded betacyanin in both juice and concentrate models. © 2014, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Ascorbic acid; Betacyanin; Concentrate; Dragon fruit; Juice; Storage","Antioxidants; Energy storage; Food storage; Fruit juices; Fruits; Organic acids; Pasteurization; pH effects; Agitation speed; Betacyanin; Concentrate; Heat pasteurization; Juice; Processing condition; Rotary evaporators; UV-visible spectrophotometer; Ascorbic acid; Hylocereus polyrhizus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938151669

In this paper, we show that on electrodeposited palladium on platinum, a good formic acid oxidation catalyst, the onset potential for CO2 reduction to formic acid is dramatically reduced in comparison to bulk palladium. Two different reaction pathways are observed; a pathway at low overpotential in which formic acid is produced from either direct bicarbonate reduction or from the reduction of CO2 generated from bicarbonate near the surface, and a pathway at more negative potentials where formic acid is produced from direct CO2 reduction. Furthermore, we show that reversible formic acid oxidation and CO2 reduction is possible on this catalyst, although unfortunately the processes are hindered by poisoning of the catalyst, most likely by CO. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the incorporation of MPCM has been found to degrade the mechanical properties of cement based composites. Therefore, in this research, the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the properties of MPCM cement paste was evaluated. Test results showed that the incorporation of CNTs in MPCM cement paste accelerated the cement hydration reaction. SEM micrograph showed that CNTs were tightly attached to the cement hydration products. At the age of 28 days, the percentage increase in flexural and compressive strength with different dosage of CNTs was found to be up to 41% and 5% respectively. The optimum dosage of CNTs incorporated in MPCM cement paste was found to be 0.5 wt %. From the thermal performance test, it was found that the cement paste panels incorporated with different percentages of MPCM reduced the temperature measured at the center of the room by up to 4.6 °C. Inverse relationship was found between maximum temperature measured at the center of the room and the dosage of MPCM. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon nanotube; Cement paste; Mechanical properties; Microencapsulated phase-change material; Structural–functional integrated materials; Thermal energy storage","carbon nanotube; cement; bone cement; carbon nanotube; Article; calorimetry; chemical structure; compressive strength; controlled study; dispersion; electric conductivity; energy consumption; flexural strength; hydration; mechanics; microcapsule; microencapsulated phase change material; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; thermal conductivity; chemistry; drug formulation; materials testing; procedures; temperature; Bone Cements; Compressive Strength; Drug Compounding; Materials Testing; Nanotubes, Carbon; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927621181

The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of modest, temporary PGC-1α knock-down on L6 myotubes insulin resistance in a light of cellular lipid metabolism. Methods: Gas liquid chromatography was applied for assessing FAs content and composition. For the expression of mitochondrial enzymes, as well as FA and glucose transporters, Western Blot technique was adopted. Additionally, radiolabelled glucose and palmitic acid uptake was performed to estimate the nutrients cellular influx. Results: Modest (-24%) PGC-1α protein ablation resulted in decreased mitochondrial activity in general (reduced Cyt C content) and FAs oxidation in particular (diminished β-HAD expression) without increased FAs cellular influx. The aforementioned intervention led to significantly increased TAG cellular level, but not DAG nor CER. Consequently, no changes in cellular insulin responsiveness were noticed. Conclusions: Modest (-24%) PGC-1α protein depletion results in lipid accumulation, without causing insulin resistance. Importantly, it seems that this TAG loading is a result of decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and/or possibly increased lipid biosynthesis but not fatty acid cellular influx. © 2015 S.

An adhesion layer of Cu2O is sputtered on the clean silicon substrate. Cu thin film is then deposited on it by E-beam evaporation. Nanostructured CuO is formed by thermal oxidation of Cu thin film. Mg and fluorocarbon layers are then deposited sequentially by thermal evaporation and sputtering, respectively. The nanostructured energetic composite is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Accelerated aging test is performed in a temperature and humidity chamber (35°C, 95% relative humidity) and the heat-release characteristics are studied in detail by differential scanning calorimetry. It is found that Mg layer obtains the nano-texture from CuO and engenders superhydrophobicity after being coated with a fluorocarbon layer. Both the fluorocarbon coating and the CuO layer react with Mg intermediate layer but in different temperature ranges. Thus, the respective heat release can be adjusted almost independently. Because of the superhydrophobicity, CuO/Mg/fluorocarbon maintains about 82% chemical energy after 240h exposure. The nanoenergetic composite holds more than 50% of the original energy after 6h underwater storage.

Load curtailment bids are provided by individual DRX participants and the DRX is cleared by maximizing the total social welfare, which is subject to supply-demand balance and individual bidders' inter-temporal operation constraints. The proposed DRX model is further integrated in the current context of the ISO's day-ahead scheduling in electricity markets. A two-step sequential market clearing framework is presented in which the ISO's stochastic day-ahead scheduling is simulated first for calculating the expected locational marginal prices (LMPs) and then, the proposed DRX is cleared successively using the expected LMPs. The simulation of the ISO's stochastic day-ahead scheduling incorporates random outages of system components and forecast errors for hourly renewable generation and loads. The decomposition-based method is employed to solve the ISO's day-ahead scheduling in the base case and scenarios. Numerical tests are performed for a 6-bus system and an IEEE 118-bus system.

However, relatively low endurance has limited its practical applications. In this paper, in addition to existing hardware level optimizations, we propose software enabled wear-leveling techniques to further extend PCMs lifetime when it is adopted in embedded systems. Most existing software optimization techniques focus on reducing the total number of writes to PCM, but none of them consider wear leveling, in which the writes are distributed more evenly over the PCM. An integer linear programming formulation and a polynomial-time algorithm, the software wear-leveling algorithm, are proposed in this paper to achieve wear leveling without hardware overhead. According to the experimental results, the proposed techniques can reduce the number of writes on the most-written addresses by more than 80% when compared with a greedy algorithm, and by more than 60% when compared with the existing optimal data allocation algorithm with under 6% memory access overhead. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","DRAM; energy; main memory; nonvolatile memories (NVMs); phase change memory (PCM); wear leveling; write reduction","Algorithms; Dynamic random access storage; Hardware; Integer programming; Phase change memory; Polynomial approximation; energy; Main memory; Nonvolatile memory; Phase change memory (pcm); Wear leveling; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027944508

Typically, the chillers are operated in ON/OFF modes to charge TES and supply chilled water to satisfy the campus cooling demands. A bilinear model is established to describe the system dynamics of the central plant. A model predictive control (MPC) problem is formulated to obtain optimal set-points to satisfy the campus cooling demands and minimize daily electricity cost. At each time step, the MPC problem is represented as a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. We propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions for it via dynamic programming (DP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The system dynamics is linearized along the simulated trajectories of the system. The optimal TES operation profile is obtained by solving a DP problem at every horizon, and the optimal chiller operations are obtained by solving an MILP problem at every time step with a fixed TES operation profile. Simulation results show desired performance and computational tractability of the proposed algorithm. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Central chiller plant; dynamic programming; heuristic algorithm; mixed integer linear programming; model predictive control; supervisory control; thermal energy storage","Cooling systems; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Heat storage; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Integer programming; Model predictive control; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Problem solving; Scheduling; System theory; Thermal energy; Chiller plants; Computational tractability; Electrical chillers; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Simulated trajectories; Suboptimal solution; Supervisory control; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027927707

Grid infrastructures have been harnessing computational resources all around the world allowing all kinds of parallelisms to be explored. Other approaches to parallel and distributed computing still exist like the use of dedicated high-performance (HPC) infrastructures, and the use of clouds for computing and storage, but grid computing continues to be the predominant technology used for scientific computing in Europe, through the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) and the European Middleware Initiative (EMI). Currently, there is a trend towards the use of cloud technologies for computing and storage. In Europe, this trend is being followed by taking advantage of all the experiences gained from building grid infrastructures and the technologies developed around them (resource management orchestration, unified job description languages, security, user interfaces, programming models, and scheduling policies, among others). As a result, the European Grid Infrastructure Federated Cloud is being built on top of the grid infrastructure already available. After almost two decades of the development of grid software and components and the emergence of competing technologies, now is the time to discuss current trends and to assess future prospects. When organizing this book, the authors considered contributions that would review the current grid computing scenario as well as contributions that would summarize the main tools and technologies used so far. The chapters in this book provide reviews for the following topics: a) performance prediction for parallel and distributed computing systems, b) resource sharing on computational grids, c) economic models for resource management, and d) programming frameworks. The chapters address grid issues such as a) the challenges of designing efficient job schedulers for production grids, b) scalability analysis of bag-of-tasks applications, c) the energy efficiency of resource reservation-based scheduling, and d) the development of parallel applications using the grid environment. Additionally, the following tools are presented: a) a programming framework based on the concept of a pluggable grid service that avoids explicit calls to grid services in scientific code and b) a desktop grid framework that runs on top of a cloud and can be deployed on the fly. The authors were each invited to contribute a chapter to this book, which were carefully revised and selected based on their originality and the value of their contribution to the overall discussion on grid computing and its future prospects. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The anionic surfactant mediates the process of electropolymerisation at a lower anodic potential while causing template effects in producing porous conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes. Using this strategy, PEDOT MSCs with remarkable performance in terms of tunable frequency response and energy density are achieved. Specifically, ultrahigh scan rate capability up to 500V/s is achieved with a crossover frequency of 400Hz at a phase angle of -45°. This is the first polymer-based redox microsupercapacitor with excellent frequency characteristics other than carbonaceous-based electrochemical double layer capacitors reported so far in the literature. Thus, the micro-supercapacitors exhibit maximum areal cell capacitance of 9mF/cm2 with a volumetric stack capacitance of 50F/cm3 in 1M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The flexibility and stability of these PEDOT MSCs is tested in aqueous gel electrolyte which showed a capacitance retention up to 80% over 10,000 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. The maximum energy density of solid state ion gel based PEDOT MSCs was found to be 7.7mWh/cm3, which is comparable to the lithium based thin film batteries and superior to the current state-of-the-art carbon and metal oxide based MSCs. Further, the tandem configuration of flexible solid state ion gel based PEDOT MSCs is employed to demonstrate it as a power source for glowing a red light emitting diode. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ac-line filtering; Conducting polymer; Flexible; Micropseudocapacitors; Solid state","Anionic surfactants; Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon; Cell culture; Conducting polymers; Electrolytes; Filtration; Flowcharting; Frequency response; Light emitting diodes; Metals; Photolithography; Reduction; Solid electrolytes; Surface active agents; Conventional photolithography; Cross-over frequencies; Electrochemical deposition; Electrochemical double-layer capacitors; Flexible; Frequency characteristic; Micropseudocapacitors; Poly(3 ,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT); Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935009273

Apart from providing energy savings, the use of LED lighting technology creates scope for an innovative optical wireless communication technology known as visible light communication (VLC), which takes advantage of the superior modulation capability of LEDs to transmit data through a wireless channel. VLC is capable of concurrently providing communication as well as illumination. For making commercial implementation of VLC feasible, it is necessary to incorporate it with dimming schemes that will provide energy savings, moods, and increase the aesthetic value of the place using this technology. However, general dimming techniques have an adverse effect on communication since they limit the achievable data rate of a VLC link. This drives the necessity of formulating efficient dimming techniques, which will create a balance between the two most basic functions of VLC: illumination and communication. This paper focuses on dimming mechanisms that can be implemented in VLC systems to save energy and provide precise illumination control. The motivation behind this control mechanism, current challenges in practical implementation, driver circuitry, recent progress, and future prospects are also concisely presented. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Energy conservation; Light; Light emitting diodes; Light sources; Lighting; Optical communication; Wireless telecommunication systems; Commercial implementation; Control mechanism; Fluorescent light sources; Future prospects; Modulation capability; Optical wireless communications; State of research; Visible light communications (VLC); Visible light communication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929454648

Yet, the cycling instability of PAni resulting from structural alteration is a major hurdle to its commercial application. Here, the development of nanostructured PAni-RuO2 core-shell arrays as electrodes for highly stable pseudocapacitors with excellent energy storage performance is reported. A thin layer of RuO2 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on PAni nanofibers plays a crucial role in stabilizing the PAni pseudocapacitors and improving their energy density. The pseudocapacitors, which are based on optimized PAni-RuO2 core-shell nanostructured electrodes, exhibit very high specific capacitance (710 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1) and power density (42.2 kW kg-1) at an energy density of 10 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, they exhibit remarkable capacitance retention of ≈88% after 10 000 cycles at very high current density of 20 A g-1, superior to that of pristine PAni-based pseudocapacitors. This prominently enhanced electrochemical stability successfully demonstrates the buffering effect of ALD coating on PAni, which provides a new approach for the preparation of metal-oxide/conducting polymer hybrid electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance. Polyaniline RuO2 core-shell electrodes are fabricated by dilute chemical polymerization and atomic layer deposition. The RuO2 layer stabilizes the polyaniline pseudocapacitors and significantly improves their energy density.

Its current prevalence (i.e., approximately 30%) is continuously increasing. MetS by itself is considered a risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED). Aim: To focus on the definition epidemiology, pathogenesis, and possible mechanistic links between MetS and ED in order to provide guidelines for treating such individuals. Methods: The search strategies yielded total records screened from PubMed. Main Outcome Measures: Regardless of the definition, MetS consists of insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. MetS is not an end disease but is a disorder of energy utilization and storage. Results: The prevalence of ED in patients with MetS is almost twice than in those without MetS, and about 40% of patients with ED have MetS. An important mechanism linking MetS and ED is hypogonadism. Conclusions: Recognizing through ED, underlying conditions such as hypogonadism, diabetes and MetS might be a useful motivation for men to improve their health-related choices. The clinical management of MetS can be done by therapeutic interventions that include lifestyle modifications, hormone replacement alone or in combination with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, and other pharmacological treatments.

This two-stage discharging regime is designed and experimented in such a way to represent the two shower taking periods after the hot water preparation in the tank is accomplished. From the experimental results, correlations between exergy destruction and the standing time between the two discharging periods, for different initial volume extractions are developed. Using these correlations it is deduced that in order to minimize the cost of exergy destruction in a two stage discharging regime, the initial withdrawal of hot water volume must be maximized, while the standing period between the two discharges is minimized.

However, given these studies assumed a theoretical maximum recoverable heat, whether its use is still energy effective in practice, in particular under intermittent operation, is of concern. Intermittent operation of the SEHRAC can lead to significant fluctuations in operating conditions. Adding that capillary tube is often used as the expansion device to magnify the fluctuations, whether SEHRAC can still operate satisfactorily despite the fluctuations is another concern. To address these concerns, a prototype which can be switched between the combined CH (cooling and heating) mode and the CC (conventional cooling) mode was set-up for laboratory experiments. The results showed that the water heating objective can be achieved. The operating parameters also confirmed the satisfactory operation of SEHRAC. Energy performance of the CH mode was found better than the CC mode. A prediction model was developed for evaluating the use of SEHRAC. On wider application of SEHRAC, energy use of the residential sector in Hong Kong can be reduced by 9.1%.

The method is based on the simultaneous measurements of the temperature and displacement distributions on the specimen surface during a tensile deformation. The experimental procedure involves two complementary techniques: i.e. infrared thermography (IRT) and visible light imaging. It has been experimentally shown that during the evolution of plastic strain localization the energy storage rate in some areas of the deformed specimen drops to zero.

In order to examine the influence of GNP loading into the base material (AA), composite PCMs were prepared with three different fractions (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 in wt%). The thermal, chemical and morphological characteristics of the samples were introduced in terms of differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction analyses. Moreover, the thermal conductivity values of samples in the liquid state were measured by means of 3ω method. It was found that, for GNP fractions of 0.5, 1, and 2 wt. %, the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs have been increased by 15, 30 and 43% in comparison to the pure AA. Results also revealed that the GNP loading into the pure AA led to a reduction in the degree of subcooling and a small diminution in the latent heat values. Considering the thermal cycling tests, it was also obtained that the proposed composite PCMs remained stable even at the highest GNP loading.

Recognition of the role of aeration and microbial activity in the purification of sewage in the early studies established the basis for the accidental discovery of the process, which was immediately adapted into practice. The problems encountered during operation started a period of empirical expansion with many process modifications. As scientific support lagged behind practice, efforts were then directed towards exploring and understanding the fundamentals of the system related to substrate removal mechanisms, microbiology, process kinetics and stoichiometry, nitrogen transformations and, then, translating accumulated information into design. Extensive research generated remarkable findings which should be regarded as major milestones for future progress in many areas such as fractionation of substrate and biomass, particle size distribution, and substrate storage. A rational foundation of the activated sludge process for the removal of organic carbon could then be established based on mass balance. This approach also defined essential parameters that could relate microbial reactions involved with plant design and operation.

However, a grand challenge still exists in developing facile and generalized approaches for rational design and fabrication of them in large scale. Here we first present a facile general strategy, namely, chemical bath deposition followed by calcination, for the scalable synthesis of diverse NTMOs arrays with hierarchically porous structures and their corresponding hybrid nanowire arrays that are directly grown on conductive substrates. When directly used as binder- and conductive-agent-free anodes for LIBs, the resultant nanoarchitectured electrodes manifest outstanding electrochemical performances with high specific capacity, superior rate capability and excellent cycling stability. Specifically, a high reversible capacity of 1145mAhg-1 is retained after 100 cycles at 100mAg-1, and a reversible capacity up to 639mAhg-1 even after 500 cycles at a current density as high as 1000mAg-1 can be maintained by using hierarchically porous flower-like ZnCo2O4 nanosheets as anode material, holding great promise as efficient electrodes for LIBs.

In this study, we examined the possibility of incorporating nanoemulsions into clear gelatin hydrogels to form optically translucent hydrogels. The effect of preparation and storage conditions on the formation and stability of nanoemulsion-filled gelatin hydrogels was studied. Nanoemulsions were produced using the spontaneous emulsification (SE) method, which simply involves addition of an organic phase (oil+surfactant) to an aqueous phase. Droplet size decreased and optical clarity increased when the SE method was performed at an elevated temperature (60°C) rather than at ambient temperature (20°C). Translucent filled hydrogels could be formed by incorporating the nanoemulsions into gelatin gels. The optical and rheological properties of a model gelatin gel and a commercial gelatin dessert did not change appreciably after the nanoemulsion droplets (1%) were incorporated.

The closed-loop output impedances of the converter under single-voltage-loop and dual-loop controls are derived and compared. It is shown that both control strategies can effectively reduce the converter's closed-loop output impedance, thus favoring the flow of harmonic current and prevent it from being drawn from either the fuel cell branch or the dc-link capacitor. However, as shown by experimental results, the use of conventional PI control alone still produces noticeable voltage ripple on the dc voltage bus due to harmonic current being drawn from the dc-link capacitor. Proportional-resonant control is proposed to effectively compensate for the dc-bus voltage variation by generating an extremely low impedance path for harmonic current flow at specific frequency. An analog-based frequency tracking circuit is further proposed to adjust the resonant frequency for compensating the effect of harmonic frequency variation. © 2014 IEEE.","DAB dc-dc converter; Fuel cell control; Low-frequency current ripple; Multi-input dc-dc converter; PR control; Renewable energy system","Fuel cell controls; Low-frequency currents; Multiinput; PR controls; Renewable energy systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910071573

The government has encouraged industry, society, and non-government organizations to work together to achieve this objective. The government has provided incentives through several energy programmes such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, green technology, and green building. One key area that has been targeted is logistics and supply chain, which has been contributing to high carbon emissions in manufacturing industries. Scholars and practitioners have only recently begun to pay attention to creating a low carbon supply chain. Furthermore, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have faced several challenges in adopting low carbon activities. SMEs are unable to take the advantage of energy initiatives because of a lack of knowledge, a shortage of funds, and inadequate facilities. Almost 90% of firms are in the service industry working with large manufacturing firms and some SMEs working in manufacturing industry are working closely with their supply chain networks; achieving low carbon targets is hampered by the readiness of the manufacturing itself. This chapter discusses the challenges and future agenda of creating low carbon supply chains in manufacturing in Malaysia.

The influence of the mesh geometry on the phase change duration is predicted for two cases of the metallic mesh arrangements. In the first case, the constant area of the mesh with different geometries, namely triangular, rectangular, and hexagonal, is considered; in which case, the amount of phase change material accommodated in each mesh remains the same for all the meshes incorporated. In the second case, the perimeter of the three meshes is considered to be the same. This arrangement results in variation of the mesh area for different mesh geometric configurations. An experiment is carried out to validate the predictions of melt isotherms. Since the mesh size used in the experiments is in the order of 50 mm, an optical microscope is used to monitor the melting process under the controlled environment. It is found that the predictions of the melt isotherm are in good agreement with that of the experimental data. Triangular mesh geometry resulted in the early initiation of the phase change in the mesh. In addition, the total melting time becomes less for the triangular mesh as compared to those of square and hexagonal mesh geometries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its rapid capacity degradation, mainly caused by huge volume changes during lithium insertion/extraction processes, remains a significant challenge to its practical application. Engineering Si anodes with abundant free spaces and stabilizing them by incorporating carbon materials has been found to be effective to address the above problems. Using sodium chloride (NaCl) as a template, bubble sheet-like carbon film supported core-shell Si/C composites are prepared for the first time by a facile magnesium thermal reduction/glucose carbonization process. The capacity retention achieves up to 93.6% (about 1018 mAh g-1) after 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. The good performance is attributed to synergistic effects of the conductive carbon film and the hollow structure of the core-shell nanospheres, which provide an ideal conductive matrix and buffer spaces for respectively electron transfer and Si expansion during lithiation process. This unique structure decreases the charge transfer resistance and suppresses the cracking/pulverization of Si, leading to the enhanced cycling performance of bubble sheet-like composite. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The assessment shows that the electricity economy proves more preferable in the case of short-term energy storage, whereas the use of hydrogen is more beneficial in the case of long-term storage.

The proposed approach estimates the hourly DHW load, and proposes and simulates different DR (demand response) strategies, from the supply side, to minimize the dispatch costs of an energy system. The case study consists on optimizing the electricity load, in a representative day with low solar radiation, in Corvo Island, Azores. The DHW backup is induced by three different demand patterns. The study compares different DR strategies: backup at demand (no strategy), pre-scheduled backup using two different imposed schedules, a strategy based on linear programming, and finally two strategies using genetic algorithms, with different formulations for DHW backup - one that assigns number of systems and another that assigns energy demand. It is concluded that pre-determined DR strategies may increase the generation costs, but DR strategies based on optimization algorithms are able to decrease generation costs. In particular, linear programming is the strategy that presents the lowest increase on dispatch costs, but the strategy based on genetic algorithms is the one that best minimizes both daily operation costs and total energy demand, of the system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand response; Domestic hot water; Genetic algorithms; Linear programming; Renewable energy; Thermal storage","Algorithms; Costs; Energy management; Genetic algorithms; Heat storage; Hot water distribution systems; Linear programming; Optimization; Sun; Water; Demand response; Domestic hot water; DR (demand response); Electricity load; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energies; Solar thermal systems; Thermal storage; Cost benefit analysis; demand-side management; electrical power; genetic algorithm; linear programing; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; solar power; Azores; Corvo; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926199827

The DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) results revealed that the paraffin has melting temperature and latent heat of 26.7°C and 138.0J/g, respectively. The EP/PA composite can be obtained by absorbing the paraffin into the porous structures of expanded perlite, which showed good thermal storage and thermal stability properties. The incorporation of EP/PA composite caused not only 80% reduction in thermal conductivity, but also 14 min peak load shifting in thermal cycling test due to the improved thermal storage capacity.

Cobalt oxides prepared by calcination of cobalt salts at 500°C were used as precursors of the catalyst active phase. It was shown that the nature of the cobalt oxide precursor has a substantial influence on the rate of formation of active component in the reaction medium of sodium borohydride and, hence, on its activity in NaBH4 hydrolysis. The length of the activation period and catalytic activity do not correlate with the dispersion and the specific surface area of the synthesized Co3O4 samples but depend on their inhomogeneity and the defect structure of the oxide due to the distribution of cobalt ions in the crystal lattice. The more defects are present in of Co3O4 the faster the rate of its reduction and, hence, the higher its catalytic activity in NaBH4 hydrolysis. On the basis of active oxide prepared from cobalt chloride, solid state NaBH4 pellets have been prepared. For the first time, NaBH4 pellets were used as a source of H2 source for a thermo-electrical energy conversion device based on combustion technologies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM outperforms single level cell (SLC) PCM in terms of storage capacity but requires an iterative programming-and-verifying scheme to program cells to different resistance levels. The energy consumed in programming different MLC states varies significantly, thus motivating a state remapping technique to minimize the overall write energy. In this paper, we first compare dynamic and static state remapping strategies in terms of their efficacy in reducing energy, and then propose an effective and low-cost static state remapping algorithm. The experimental studies show 10.6% average (up to 16.9%) reduction in MLC PCM write energy, achieved within negligible hardware and performance overhead. Compared with the most related work, the proposed scheme saves more write energy on average, with near-zero performance, area and energy overhead. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Dynamic random access storage; Iterative methods; Phase change memory; Deep sub-micron; Energy overheads; Multi level cell (MLC); Related works; Remapping algorithms; Resistance level; Single level cells; Storage capacity; Cost reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926483310

While capturing proteins in materials could create devices that mimic these functions, this process is challenging due to the sensitivity of protein structure to the chemical environment. Using recombinant DNA methods, specific functions can be incorporated by fusing the gene encoding a self-assembling protein and the desired functional protein, to produce a single polypeptide that self-assembles into functionalized materials. However, the functional protein has the potential to disrupt protein production, protein assembly, and/or the structure and mechanical properties of the resulting materials. 24 fusion proteins are created based on Ultrabithorax, a Drosophila transcription factor that self-assembles into materials in vitro. The appended proteins dictate the solubility and purification yield of the corresponding protein fusions. Any loss of solubility and yield can be mitigated by fusing a third protein that is highly soluble. All protein fusions self-assemble equally well to produce materials with similar morphologies. Fusing enhanced green fluorescent protein to Ultrabithorax influences mechanical properties of the resulting fibers. It is concluded that a far wider range of proteins can be successfully incorporated into elastomeric protein-based materials than originally anticipated. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For both solid solutions, the measured 1H spin-lattice relaxation rates are governed by reorientations of BH4 groups, and the experimental data can be satisfactorily described by the model with a Gaussian distribution of the activation energies. The average values of the activation energies derived from the 1H spin-lattice relaxation data are 192 ± 7 meV for Na(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 and 120 ± 3 meV for Na(BH4)0.5I0.5.

Although such a method provides insight into total mitigation costs, it does not provide much information about how to achieve a transition towards a low-carbon energy system, which is of critical importance to achieving ambitious climate targets. To enable sensible deep emission reduction strategies, this study analysed the effectiveness of 16 specific mitigation measures on a global level up to 2050, by using an energy-system simulation model called TIMER. The measures range from specific energy efficiency measures, like banning traditional light bulbs and subsidizing electric vehicles, to broader policies like introducing a carbon tax in the electricity sector. All measures combined lead to global CO2 emission reductions ranging between 39% and 73% compared to baseline by 2050, depending on the inclusion of sectoral carbon taxes and the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power. Although the effectiveness of the measures differs largely across regions, this study indicates that measures aimed at stimulating low-carbon electricity production result in the highest reductions in all regions.Policy relevanceThe results of the calculations can be used to evaluate the effects of individual climate change mitigation measures and identify priorities in discussions on global and regional policies. The type of fragmented policy scenarios presented here could provide a relevant bottom-up alternative to cost-optimal implementation of policies driven by a carbon tax.

In this study, computational tools were utilized to examine CH4 storage capacity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under practical operating conditions. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to calculate CH4 uptake capacity of 45 MOFs. Results were confirmed with experimental data available in the literature. Motivated from the good agreement between experiments and simulations, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis was performed. Making use of this analysis, multivariable linear models with one-, two-, three-, and four-variables that can accurately predict CH4 uptake of MOFs at room temperature and pressures ranging from 1 to 65bar were developed. Model parameters were based on easily measurable/computable structural properties, such as pore volume, surface area, and density. Models that predict CH4 uptake at 5 and 35bar were studied in detail to investigate the viability of reaching CH4 storage target for vehicular systems set by DOE. At both pressures the models with four-variables outperformed other models at the same pressures, and void fraction (Vf) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) were found to be the most significant parameters. In order for a material to exceed the DOE target of 0.5g/g CH4 uptake at a storage pressure of 35bar, the material should have high gravimetric surface area (Sg), reaching 6000m2/g, void fraction (Vf), as high as 0.9, dominant pore diameter (DPD) approximately 30Å, and Qst value around 30kJ/mol. Results of this work reveal the structural properties controlling the CH4 storage capacity of MOFs. Such information can guide experimental studies to tune the MOFs in the way of designing new materials with desirable structural properties that will reach the storage targets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","GCMC; Metal-organic framework; Methane storage; QSPR","Crystalline materials; Digital storage; Forecasting; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Storage (materials); Void fraction; GCMC; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Metal organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Methane storage; Practical operating conditions; QSPR; Quantitative structure property relationships; Structural properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923933809

Impedance-based methods are effective for stability assessment of voltage-source systems and current-source systems. However, these methods may not be suitable for applications involving variation of practical parameters, loading conditions, system's structures, and operating modes. Thus, for systems that do not resemble simple voltage-source systems or current-source systems, stability assessment is much less readily performed. This paper proposes an impedance-based criterion for stability assessment of dc DPS. We first classify any converter in a dc DPS as either a bus voltage controlled converter (BVCC) or a bus current controlled converter (BCCC). As a result, a dc DPS can be represented in a general form regardless of its structure and operating mode. Then, the minor loop gain of the standard dc DPS is derived precisely using a two-port small signal model. Application of the Nyquist criterion on the derived minor loop gain gives the stability requirement for the dc DPS. This proposed criterion is applicable to dc DPSs, regardless of the control method and the connection configuration. Finally, a 480 W photovoltaic (PV) system with battery energy storage and a 200 W dc DPS, in which the source converter employs a droop control, are fabricated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Battery energy storage; DC distributed power system (DPS); photovoltaic system; stability criterion","Electric power system stability; Photovoltaic cells; Stability criteria; Battery energy storage; Distributed power systems; Impedance based methods; Loading condition; Photovoltaic systems; Small signal model; Stability assessment; Stability requirements; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027926684

Moreover, economic and environmental pressure has led to an increasing renewable power penetration, particularly in wind generation and solar photovoltaics (PV). Simultaneously, significant technological progress has been made in terms of control capability of grid assets [generators, controllable loads such as electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems], mostly exploiting the capabilities of power ?electronics. In this context, several advanced control solutions can be implemented, supporting and improving the robustness of the operation in terms of fast frequency and voltage control responses. In this article, the Portuguese islands are taken as a case study. Within the Madeira archipelago (Porto Santo and Madeira islands), two approaches were envisioned. For Porto Santo Island, the main goal is the sizing of a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) to avoid frequency stability problems. For Madeira Island, the objective relies on the exploitation of hydro resources through the quantification of the technical benefits resulting from variable speed hydro pumping stations that are able to provide primary frequency regulation services in the pump operation mode. In addition, this article also addresses the benefits of introducing EVs in Flores Island in the Azores Archipelago. Finally, to support the development of innovative technological solutions for this type of power system, a laboratory setup based on scaled test systems was also set up and is described. A set of applications was specifically developed for such autonomous power systems. The laboratorial infrastructure allowed the testing of ?solutions and prototypes for hardware and software modules related to those applications. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Energy storage; Software prototyping; Software testing; Solar power generation; Autonomous power system; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; Environmental pressures; Flywheel energy storage system; Primary frequency regulation; Technological progress; Technological solution; Electric power system control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924322716

Among recent findings for trehalose and its metabolism, the role of signalling in the regulation of growth and development and its potential for use as a storage energy source can be listed. The xerophytic plant Capparis ovata (caper) is well adapted to drought and high temperature stress in arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. The contribution of trehalose and the trehalose biosynthetic pathway to drought stress responses and tolerance in C. ovata are not known. We investigated the effects of PEG-mediated drought stress in caper plants and analysed physiological parameters and trehalose biosynthetic pathway components, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP), trehalase activity, trehalose and proline content in drought stress-treated and untreated plants. Our results indicated that trehalose and the trehalose biosynthetic pathway contributed to drought stress tolerance of C. ovata. Overall growth and leaf water status were not dramatically affected by drought, as both high relative growth rate and relative water content were recorded even after 14 days of drought stress. Trehalose accumulation increased in parallel to induced TPS and TPP activities and decreased trehalase activity in caper plants on day 14. Constitutive trehalose levels were 28.75 to 74.75 μg·g·FW-1, and drought stress significantly induced trehalose accumulation (385.25 μg·g·FW-1 on day 14) in leaves of caper. On day 14 of drought, proline levels were lower than on day 7. Under drought stress the discrepancy between trehalose and proline accumulation trends might result from the mode of action of these osmoprotectant molecules in C. ovata. © 2014 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Caper; Proline; Trehalase; Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase; Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase","adaptation; amino acid; deciduous tree; drought resistance; drought stress; enzyme activity; growth rate; high temperature; metabolism; sugar; water content; Capparis ovata; Capparis spinosa; glucosyltransferase; phosphatase; proline; trehalose; trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; trehalose-phosphatase; biosynthesis; Capparis; drought; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; Biosynthetic Pathways; Capparis; Droughts; Glucosyltransferases; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Proline; Stress, Physiological; Trehalose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924225903

Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Genting Kelang, Kuala Lumpur, 53300, Malaysia","The amount of small-scaled renewable energy sources is anticipated to increase on the low-voltage distribution networks for the improvement of energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emission. Malaysia has a high solar irradiance level that is ideal for photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the growth of the PV systems on the low-voltage distribution networks can create a number of technical issues such as voltage rise, voltage unbalance, and reversed power flow. Usually, these issues happen with little fluctuations. However, these issues tend to fluctuate very rapidly in Malaysia because this region has a very low clear sky index. A large amount of clouds often passes over the country, hence making the incident solar irradiance to be highly scattered and fluctuating. Therefore, the power output of the PV systems fluctuates substantially. To ensure an effective operation of the distribution networks with the PV systems, a novel fuzzy control method is developed and implemented to govern the operation of an energy storage system consisting of a bidirectional inverter coupled with lead-acid batteries. The fuzzy controlled energy storage system is able to mitigate the fluctuating voltage rises and voltage unbalances on the networks by actively manipulating the flow of real power between the networks and the batteries. To verify the effectiveness of this fuzzy control method, an experimental network integrated with 7.2-kW photovoltaic systems was set up. A number of case studies are performed to show that the proposed fuzzy control system is able to mitigate fluctuating voltage rises and voltage unbalances under the highly intermittent power output of the PV systems. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Energy storage system; Fuzzy control method; Low-voltage distribution networks; Photovoltaic system; Voltage rise; Voltage unbalance","Data storage equipment; Electric batteries; Electric power distribution; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy storage; Fuzzy control; Greenhouse gases; Incident solar radiation; Lead acid batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Energy storage systems; Fuzzy control methods; Low voltage distribution network; Photovoltaic systems; Voltage rise; Voltage unbalances; Voltage distribution measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923145828

However, the initial setup costs of these systems are very high. To reduce these costs, both the energy usage and the prevention of losses from irrigation systems are very important. In this study, a drip irrigation control system of 1000 dwarf cherry trees was controlled using soil moisture sensors in order to prevent excessive water consumption and energy losses in a solar-powered irrigation system. The control system comprises units that are energized with solar panels, and the flow of information is implemented via radio frequency. Thus, by removing the cables that create difficulties in the cultivation of gardens, both the easy cultivation of the soil is enabled and cable costs are eliminated. The portability of the units is enabled by using solar energy; thus, units might be mounted wherever the user wishes. It has been indicated that the moisture of the application area varies depending on the data obtained regarding volumetric water content and the defined area in need of irrigation. In this way, there are reductions in the dependence on instantaneous water demand, the amount of water to be pumped, and the energy requirements needed for irrigation. In addition, pump power and the power of the motor that drives the pump are also reduced. According to the obtained measurement values, it was calculated that hourly water demand decreased by 36%. Thus, the numbers of solar panels, electrical machines, batteries, and units of power control that supply all the energy of the system and constitute a large part of the initial setup costs are reduced at the same rate by means of the applied technique.

Among alternatives being developed, this review focused on hyperbaric storage (food preservation under pressure). This new preservation methodology has as main objective microbial growth inhibition similarly to freezing and refrigeration, showing a great potential to lower energy costs since refrigerated/room temperatures (RT) can be used. This, even at variable (uncontrolled) RT (up to 37 °C), has been shown to preserve foods and thus achieving significant energy savings. Covering the earliest up to the more recent studies, this review aimed to gather information about the state of art of hyperbaric storage at refrigerated and RTs, with the primary objective of showing it potential and possible future applications of this new preservation method based on microbial growth inhibition under pressure, using pressure as the main variable to slow down microbial growth. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Food preservation; High pressure; Hyperbaric storage; Microbial growth inhibition; Refrigeration; Spoilage","Energy conservation; Food preservation; Refrigeration; Spoilage; High pressure; High-energy costs; Lower energies; Microbial growth; Possible futures; Preservation methods; Primary objective; Food storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921700896

This paper focuses on AC-AC power converter technologies without DC-link energy storage elements. The presented converter topologies are fully solid state devices with small passive elements, which are implemented to filter off the high frequency current or voltage components. In the paper the converters are categorized into two groups: with constant output frequency, and with variable output frequency. The first group includes topologies of matrix and matrix-reactance choppers. The second group includes frequency converters based on the matrix converter, taking into account indirect (indirect matrix converter, sparse matrix converter) and multi-level topologies (three-level-output-stage indirect matrix converter, indirect three-level sparse matrix converter, multimodular matrix converters), as well as the topology allowing an increase in the output voltage (matrix-reactance frequency converters). Various converter topologies are presented, compared, and evaluated against output voltage and phase control, input power factor control, and number of components.

Using a portable emission measurement system, fuel consumption was quantified in a second-by-second basis under on-road conditions for 19 vehicles (spark-ignition, compression-ignition and hybrids). This data allowed building generic curves of fuel consumption as a function of the specific power, according to Vehicle Specific Power methodology. Comparing on-road measurements and the model estimates, a R2 higher than 0.9 for conventional and hybrid vehicles was obtained regarding modal fuel consumption. Comparing the fuel consumption measured on the drive cycles performed by each vehicle and the correspondent estimates, an absolute deviation of 9.2% ± 9.2% was found for conventional vehicles and 4.7% ± 1.8% for hybrids vehicles. This methodology was validated and applied to estimate the energy impacts of the best-selling vehicles in Portugal for different driving cycles. This prompt method, that does not require vehicle monitoring, can estimate curves of fuel consumption in g/s, as a function of specific power, which allows quantifying the absolute fuel use for any driving cycle. ©2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models are a useful tool in this context, as they quantitatively link the energy taken up by feeding to energy-demanding traits such as growth, development and reproduction. The copepod life cycle, however, has several features that require closer investigation. Firstly, they sport larval development through six naupliar stages (of which the initial stages do not feed), followed by six copepodite stages (which have a different shape from the nauplii). Furthermore, growth stops rather abruptly after the final moult to the adult stage, and many species build up a large lipid storage to survive, and initiate reproduction, in absence of food. After a few modifications, the simple and generic DEBkiss model could be calibrated for Calanus sinicus using data on body composition and size at age for different temperatures. Embryo and naupliar development were well explained by the model, after correcting for their deviating shape from the copepodites. Ceasing of growth after the final moult was implemented as a size-dependent switch in allocation. With these assumptions, predictions could be made for the rates of ingestion, respiration and reproduction in adults. The predictions were consistent with observed rates, which indicates the realism of the model structure and its parameterisation. Several issues remain to be addressed, specifically, the dynamics of lipid storage and its use. However, the present study provides a starting point for applications of DEB theory to copepods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Calanus sinicus; Copepods; DEBkiss; Dynamic energy budget; Life-history traits; Parameter estimation","Biochemistry; Digital storage; Food storage; Forecasting; Parameter estimation; Calanus; Copepods; DEBkiss; Dynamic energy budgets; Life-history traits; Budget control; anthropogenic effect; bioenergy; crustacean; energy budget; energy efficiency; estimation method; growth rate; larval development; life history trait; marine environment; numerical model; parameterization; prediction; reproduction; respiration; taxonomy; temperature effect; Calanus sinicus; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920677592

Since water heating was required for domestic hot water supply rather than space heating, a separate or an integrated provision of solar cooling and heating could be considered. In the separate provision, cooling was handled by an independent solar absorption air-conditioning system, while water heating was offered by a packaged solar thermal collector already equipped with a storage tank. In the integrated provision, all the solar collectors and a centralized hot water storage tank were collectively applied for both driving the absorption chiller and generating domestic hot water. Through year-round dynamic simulation, it was found that the integrated provision could have annual primary energy saving of 13.5% against the separate provision. The effectiveness of the integrated provision was further verified through two energy-saving scenarios, with energy reduction by 17.7% and 18.0% correspondingly as compared to the separate provision. Under the synergistic effect of centralized thermal harness and storage, the integrated solar cooling and heating is more appropriate for typical low-rise residential application in Hong Kong. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Integrated design; Renewable cooling and heating; Renewable energy; Solar air-conditioning; Solar cooling and heating; Solar water heating","Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Separation; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Tanks (containers); Water absorption; Water supply; Integrated designs; Renewable energies; Solar air-conditioning; Solar cooling; Solar water heating; Absorption cooling; air conditioning; cooling; energy conservation; energy resource; heating; renewable resource; residential location; solar power; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909989559

In the near term, however, renewable sources such as solar energy are expected to provide a small fraction of the world's energy demand due to intermittancy and storage problems. A potential solution is the use of hybrid solar-fossil fuel power generation. Previous work has shown the potential of steam redox reforming for hybridization. However, this type of reforming requires some water consumption (which may be infeasible in certain locations) as not all the water can be recovered through recycling. An alternative is to utilize dry (or CO2) redox reforming. In this paper, a system analysis for a CO2 redox reforming hybrid cycle and comparison of cycle and reformer performance between a CO2 redox reformer and steam redox reformer hybrid cycle are presented. The effect of important operating parameters such as pressure, amount of reforming CO2, and the oxidation temperature on the reformer and cycle performance are discussed. Simulation results show that increasing the oxidation temperature or the amount of reforming CO2 leads to higher reformer and cycle efficiencies. In addition, the comparison between the CO2 and steam redox reformer hybrid cycles shows that the CO2 cycle has the potential to have better overall performance. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Chemical looping; Dry redox; Hybrid solar-fossil fuel; Solar reforming; System analysis; Thermodynamic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Solar energy; Steam; Systems analysis; Thermoanalysis; Water recycling; Chemical looping; Operating parameters; Oxidation temperature; Performance analysis; Reformer performance; Renewable resource; Solar reforming; Thermo dynamic analysis; Steam reforming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922428611

Aluminum isopropoxide (AIP) was used as a precursor for the aluminum hydroxide oxide shell. The MEPCMs were synthesized using four different weight ratios of PA/AIP. The effects of the PA/AIP weight ratio on the encapsulation characteristics and thermal properties of the MEPCMs have been investigated. The microcapsules were spherically shaped with an average diameter of 1.689-3.730 μm. Encapsulated PA confirmed the outstanding phase-change performance with specific heat and thermal stability enhancement. The final results suggested that the weight ratio of PA/AIP has an important effect on the morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and durability of the MEPCMs. A higher weight ratio of AIP/PA led to a smaller diameter size with enhanced thermal conductivity, thermal effusivity, and thermal stability of the MEPCMs. The thermal conductivity of PA microcapsules was considerably increased because of the fabrication of a thermally conductive aluminum hydroxide oxide shell. It can be concluded that the prepared MEPCMs employ an excellent energy storage potential because of their ideal latent heat, high thermal conductivity, and thermal stability. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Alumina; Aluminum hydroxide; Aluminum oxide; Fabrication; Microencapsulation; Microstructure; Palmitic acid; Phase change materials; Saturated fatty acids; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Specific heat; Thermodynamic stability; Aluminum isopropoxides; Encapsulation efficiency; Enhanced thermal conductivity; High thermal conductivity; Microencapsulated phase change material; Stability enhancement; Storage potential; Thermal effusivity; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923275075

Dynamic control is based on stress response of the fruits, which can be defined as ethanol production (DCS and ILOS) or increased chlorophyll fluorescence status (DCA). Important advantages of these systems are disorder prevention and firmness retention. In The Netherlands, a complete new system is being developed: Dynamic Control of Respiration (DCR). CO2 production as well as oxygen uptake are measured to determine the respiratory quotient (RQ). RQ-values were calculated by dividing accumulation of CO2 by uptake of oxygen. The DCR system adjusts O2 levels in the storage room based on RQ-values. Important questions around the RQ measurement: is the respiration quotient a reliable marker to determine the lowest tolerable oxygen concentration for the fruits and is it possible to use in commercial rooms? Apples of 'Elstar' were exposed to extremely low, dynamic oxygen levels. Apples stored for 5 months in 1.2 kPa O2 combined with 2% CO2 in 1.8°C were placed in cuvettes. RQ and ethanol measurements started at 1.2% O2 and subsequent continued in 0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05% O2 executed with the same fruits, continuously after 6 days adaptation. At 0.3% O2 RQ increased gradually followed by increased ethanol production proving that RQ seems to be a reliable marker for fermentation. The DCR system has been applied in 6 commercial ULO rooms, and 2 16-t semi-practice rooms. RQs were determined by shutting down all conditioning of a ULO room while monitoring O2 and CO2 evolution. In all commercial rooms the final oxygen conditions were set by the measurement of RQ indicating that the DCR system is a promising interactive storage system. DCR also reduced respiratory heat production up to a factor 2 compared to standard ULO, resulting in significant energy savings.","ACP; Apple; DCR; Ethanol; Fermentation; Low-oxygen; Malus domestica; Respiratory quotient","Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928326168

With rapid depletion of nonrenewable traditional fossil fuels, which currently account for almost 86% of the worldwide energy output, the search for viable alternative energy resources is becoming more important from a national security and economic development standpoint. Nuclear energy, an emission-free, high-energy-density source produced by means of controlled nuclear fission, is often considered as a clean, affordable alternative to fossil fuel. However, the successful installation of an efficient and economically viable industrial-scale process to properly sequester and mitigate the nuclear-fission-related, highly radioactive waste (e.g., used nuclear fuel (UNF)) is a prerequisite for any further development of nuclear energy in the near future. Reprocessing of UNF is often considered to be a logical way to minimize the volume of high-level radioactive waste, though the generation of volatile radionuclides during reprocessing raises a significant engineering challenge for its successful implementation. The volatile radionuclides include but are not limited to noble gases (predominately isotopes of Xe and Kr) and must be captured during the process to avoid being released into the environment. Currently, energy-intensive cryogenic distillation is the primary means to capture and separate radioactive noble gas isotopes during UNF reprocessing. A similar cryogenic process is implemented during commercial production of noble gases though removal from air. In light of their high commercial values, particularly in lighting and medical industries, and associated high production costs, alternate approaches for Xe/Kr capture and storage are of contemporary research interest. The proposed pathways for Xe/Kr removal and capture can essentially be divided in two categories: selective absorption by dissolution in solvents and physisorption on porous materials. Physisorption-based separation and adsorption on highly functional porous materials are promising alternatives to the energy-intensive cryogenic distillation process, where the adsorbents are characterized by high surface areas and thus high removal capacities and often can be chemically fine-tuned to enhance the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions for optimum selectivity. Several traditional porous adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon have been tested for noble gas capture but have shown low capacity, selectivity, and lack of modularity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are an emerging class of solid-state adsorbents that can be tailor-made for applications ranging from gas adsorption and separation to catalysis and sensing. Herein we give a concise summary of the background and development of Xe/Kr separation technologies with a focus on UNF reprocessing and the prospects of MOF-based adsorbents for that particular application. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923091477

A nanostructured C:TiO2-TiOF2 composite has been synthesized in plasma in the course of destruction of titanium electrodes and polytetrafluoroethylene wire. Physicochemical characterization of composite was carried out by means of infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It has been established that as-synthesized C:TiO2-TiOF2 consists of nanocrystallites of sizes ranging from 40 to 200 nm having a porous surface morphology. The average diameter of the pore is 3-5 nm. Carbon has the function of matrix containing ab embedded nanocomposite consisting of TiO2 and TiOF2 particles. Electrochemical properties of the nanostructured porous C:TiO2-TiOF2 composite were investigated in view of its application as an anode-active material for lithium-ion batteries. The initial high specific capacity of the composite is equal up to 1370 mA h g-1 at a rate of 20 mA g-1. It is higher (due to the TiO2 presence) in comparison with advanced TiOF2 anode materials.

In the present study, we investigated the hepatic protein expression profiles of both male and female marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) exposed to low concentrations of DCOIT at 2.55 μg/L (0.009 μM) or butenolide, a promising antifouling agent, at 2.31 μg/L (0.012 μM) for 28 days. The results showed that proteins involved in phase I (CYP450 enzyme) metabolism, phase II (UDPGT and GST) conjugation as well as mobilization of retinoid storage, an effective nonenzymatic antioxidant, were consistently up-regulated, possibly facilitating the accelerated detoxification of butenolide. Increased synthesis of bile acid would promote the immediate excretion of butenolide metabolites. Activation of fatty acid β-oxidation and ATP synthesis were consistent with elevated energy consumption for butenolide degradation and excretion. However, DCOIT did not significantly affect the detoxification system of male medaka, but induced a marked increase of vitellogenin (VTG) by 2.3-fold in the liver of male medaka, suggesting that there is estrogenic activity of DCOIT in endocrine disruption. Overall, this study identified the molecular mechanisms and provided sensitive biomarkers characteristic of butenolide and DCOIT in the liver of marine medaka. The low concentrations of butenolide and DCOIT used in the exposure regimes highlight the needs for systematic evaluation of their environmental risk.

In this paper, f-chart method has been used due to its simplified design procedure, analysis and low cost in selecting the sizes and type of solar collectors and in estimating the annual thermal performance of solar heating system. Using this method, the design of liquid solar heating system and the estimation of the fraction of total heating load (domestic water and space heating load) that will be supplied by solar energy for a family of six in Riyadh have been conducted. The study includes the effect of different collector areas and storage capacity per square meter of collector area and collector tilt angle on fraction of the load supplied by solar energy. It has been found that increasing the collector area results in an increasing of annual load fraction supplied by solar energy. It has also been seen that increasing the specific storage capacity results in small increase in solar load fraction and the effect is more visible during the summer than during the winter. The result of the study reveals that collector configurations with lower tilt angles are better during the summer and higher values of angles are better during the winter. The optimal annual collector configuration tilt angle which gives the maximum solar load fraction has been found to be 30°.","Annual thermal performance; F-chart method; Heating load; Solar energy; Solar fraction; Solar heating system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034851108

One of the main innovations of the smart grid is its organization over an energy plane that involves the actual exchange of energy, and a data plane that regards the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure used for the management of the grid's data. In the particular case of the data plane, the exchange of large quantities of data can be facilitated by a middleware based on a messaging bus. Existing messaging buses follow different data management paradigms (e.g.: request/response, publish/subscribe, data-oriented messaging) and thus satisfy smart grids' communication requirements at different extents. This work contributes to the state of the art by identifying, in existing standards and architectures, common requirements that impact in the messaging system of a data plane for the smart grid.

To determine the nature of interactions between hydrogen and the metallic center, variation-perturbational decomposition of interaction energy was applied together with ETS-NOCV analysis. The results obtained suggest that the aromatic character comes from three π orbitals located mainly on the C5H5− fragment. The high hydrogen adsorption energy (up to 6.5 kcal mol−1) results from two types of interaction. In C5H6Be2, adsorption is controlled by interactions between the empty metal orbital and the σ orbital of the hydrogen molecule (Kubas interaction) together with corresponding back-donation interactions.

Hence, the protocols and algorithms used in this network should operate with minimum possible energy in order to improve overall energy efficiency. Utilizing mobile base station to collect data from sensor nodes in the field is one of the approaches that can be used to minimize the energy consumption of the sensor nodes. This is because the base station is usually equipped with high storage capacity and rechargeable battery supply. This paper proposed a method to optimize the movement of mobile base station in randomly distributed wireless sensor networks using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for the purpose of prolonging network lifetime. Based on simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed technique can improve the network lifetime, data delivery and energy consumption when compared to existing energy-efficient protocols developed for this network. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Mobile base station; Particle swarm optimization; Wireless sensor networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937934284

So far, carbon nanofibers have been mainly produced by electrospinning and subsequent heat treatments. However, the great difficulty of carbon nanofibers to be scaled up through electrospinning confines the productivity and practical application of this extensively investigated material category. Recently, centrifugal spinning has drawn attention due to its high production rate (500 times faster than traditional electrospinning), simple set-up, and ease of scaling-up. Herein, tin-containing carbon nanofibers were prepared by facile centrifugal spinning from tin chloride-polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions and subsequent thermal treatments. Polymer-salt-solvent relations and resultant rheological effects upon solution properties and fiber structures were discussed, and the performance of centrifugally spun tin-containing carbon nanofibers as anode material for lithium-ion batteries was evaluated. An excellent reversible capacity of 607 mAh g−1 was achieved at the initial cycle and a relatively high specific capacity of 430 mAh g−1 was maintained after 100 cycles. It is, therefore, demonstrated that centrifugal-spun tin-containing carbon nanofibers are promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, and centrifugal spinning, as a nanofiber fabrication alternative to electrospinning, shows great potential in large-scale nanofiber production. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Anodes; Carbon nanofibers; Centrifugation; Chlorine compounds; Electrospinning; Heat treatment; Ions; Tin compounds; Tissue engineering; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Centrifugal spinning; High production rate; High specific capacity; Polyacrylonitrile precursors; Reversible capacity; Rheological effect; Solution property; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925510402

Three surfactants were also tested on the properties of the hexadecane/water emulsions. Thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) indicated that the degree of supercooling of the emulsion was significantly decreased by the nucleating agent. The effective nucleating agent concentrations required for the PCM liquid were found to be low, which agrees with the previous finding, but for the emulsion there appeared to be a minimum effective concentration to reduce the supercooling.

This was achieved by using a model for electricity consumption on dairy farms. The model simulated the effect of 6 technology investment scenarios on the electricity consumption and electricity costs of the 3 largest electricity-consuming systems within the dairy farm (i.e., milk-cooling, water-heating, and milking machine systems). The technology investment scenarios were direct expansion milk-cooling, ice bank milk-cooling, milk precooling, solar water-heating, and variable speed drive vacuum pump-milking systems. A dairy farm profitability calculator was combined with the electricity consumption model to assess the effect of each investment scenario on the total discounted net income over a 10-yr period subsequent to the investment taking place. Included in the calculation were the initial investments, which were depreciated to zero over the 10-yr period. The return on additional investment for 5 investment scenarios compared with a base scenario was computed as the investment appraisal metric. The results of this study showed that the highest return on investment figures were realized by using a direct expansion milk-cooling system with precooling of milk to 15°C with water before milk entry to the storage tank, heating water with an electrical water-heating system, and using standard vacuum pump control on the milking system. Return on investment figures did not exceed the suggested hurdle rate of 10% for any of the ice bank scenarios, making the ice bank system reliant on a grant aid framework to reduce the initial capital investment and improve the return on investment. The solar water-heating and variable speed drive vacuum pump scenarios failed to produce positive return on investment figures on any of the 3 farm sizes considered on either the day and night tariff or the flat tariff, even when the technology costs were reduced by 40% in a sensitivity analysis of technology costs. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.","Dairy technology; Electricity; Milk production; Profitability","animal; cost; dairying; economics; electricity; energy conservation; environment; milk; procedures; technology; theoretical model; Animals; Conservation of Energy Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dairying; Electricity; Environment; Milk; Models, Theoretical; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922278868

In FT EDL muscle, a 30%-50% increase in fatty acid (FA) content and doubling of long-chain acylcarnitine (C14-C18) content in response to HFL and HFP feeding were accompanied by increase in protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in mitochondrial FA β-oxidation. Peak force of FT EDL twitch and tetanic contractions was unaltered, but the relaxation time (RT) of twitch contractions was 30% slower compared to LFD controls. The latter was caused by accumulation of lipid intermediates rather than changes in the expression levels of proteins involved in calcium handling. In ST soleus muscle, no evidence for lipid overload was found in any HFD group. However, particularly in HFP group, the peak force of twitch and tetanic contractions was reduced, but RT was faster than LFD controls. The latter was associated with a fast-to-slow shift in troponin T isoform expression. Taken together, these data highlight fiber-type-specific sensitivities and phenotypic adaptations to dietary lipid overload that differentially impact fast- versus slow-twitch skeletal muscle contractile function. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Fatty acid metabolism; Fiber type; High-fat-diet-induced obesity; Oxidative phosphorylation; Skeletal muscle function; Troponin T","acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; acylcarnitine; fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; troponin T; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; acylcarnitine; carnitine; fatty acid; glycogen; multienzyme complex; Ppargc1a protein, mouse; transcription factor; troponin T; adaptation; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; C57BL 6 mouse; calcium mobilization; controlled study; energy metabolism; extensor digitorum longus muscle; fast muscle fiber; fatty acid oxidation; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; muscle contractility; muscle metabolism; muscle mitochondrion; muscle relaxation; muscle strength; muscle tetanic contraction; muscle twitch; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; phenotype; protein expression; sarcoplasmic reticulum; slow muscle fiber; soleus muscle; adverse effects; allostasis; analogs and derivatives; animal; C57BL mouse; comparative study; enzymology; fast muscle fiber; lipid diet; low fat diet; metabolism; muscle contraction; obesity; pathophysiology; randomization; slow muscle fiber; Mus; Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase; Allostasis; Animals; Carnitine; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Diet, High-Fat; Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins; Fatty Acids; Glycogen; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch; Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch; Muscle Relaxation; Obesity; Random Allocation; Transcription Factors; Troponin T",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921274027

Substantially heat losses occur through windows and translucent areas, therefore it is crucial to mitigate the energy transfer between these boundaries. The use of phase change materials (PCMs) is presently a good solution to improve the energy performance of building components, namely the glazing or window shutter protections. It is presented and discussed an experimental campaign of a full scale outdoor test cell that is composed by two side-by-side compartments. The internal compartments were submitted to similar weather conditions in a Mediterranean climate during the winter season. The south oriented facade is a glazed area that incorporates a window protection system-window shutter. It was tested and compared two similar windows shutters, one containing PCMs and the other without PCMs (referred to as reference compartment). During the experimental period the external air temperature fluctuated from 4.5 °C to 14 °C, which represent maximum thermal amplitude of 9.5 °C and the relative humidity ranged between 75% and 95%. The daily average solar radiation ranged from 25 W m-2 to 110 W m-2 and the maximum value reached was 310 W m-2. The maximum indoor air temperature measured of the compartment with the PCM shutter was 37.2 °C, which is 16.6 °C lower than the indoor air temperatures in the reference compartment that reached 53.8 °C. The minimum indoor air temperature for both compartments is similar, however the minimum air temperature of the reference compartment drops faster. The maximum heat flux on the internal wall surface of the compartment with the PCM shutter was 6.5 W m-2 and the minimum -3 W m-2 against 16 W m-2 and -8 W m-2 of the reference compartment. The results reveal the PCM potential for the thermal regulation of indoor spaces as well as improving the energy efficiency of building spaces. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, for the efficient carbonation, the calcium ions need to be extracted in the solution phase, followed by the carbonation reaction. Therefore, the extraction step is the key of successful mineral carbonation. In this study, solvent extraction of calcium and iron ions has been carried out using different types of acids and bases. In addition, the kinetic study of the extraction has also been performed. The study showed that the base solution was not capable of extracting significant amounts of calcium and iron, while acid solution was very efficient in extracting the ions. However, H2SO4 resulted in higher calcium extraction efficiency as compared to HCl and HNO3. Increasing reaction temperature from 30 to 70 °C and also increasing reaction time from 5 to 120 min were found to be effective in enhancing the degree of extraction for all the three acids used. Kinetic analyses found that the dissolution rate of red gypsum is controlled by the combination of product layer diffusion and chemical reaction control. The calculated activation energy of calcium extraction was 44.02, 37.68, and 42.73 kJ/mol for H2SO4, HCl and HNO3, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, upcoming demand of energy requirement is growing faster in developing countries as compared to developed ones. Malaysia is one of the fastest growing, developing countries, which is experiencing drastic and regular growth in population and economy in the recent years. It is an urgent requirement for the government and policy makers to explore alternative energy sources to accomplish upcoming demands of a growing population in the form of energy sufficiency. Malaysia is blessed with tropical and sub-tropical climates, which are suitable for exploring the green agriculture and forest potential. Most of the available energy resources in the form of fossil fuels have already been explored, and it is expected that energy demand will grow continuously by two to three fold in the next decades. Biomass resource is abundant in Malaysia. This can be considered as an alternative source of renewable and sustainable energy, with a promising future to fulfil continuous and uninterrupted supply of energy. Agricultural biomass such as Industrial Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) has been successfully investigated as a great potential to be used as a renewable and sustainable feedstock for the production of bio-energy. Kenaf regarded as a traditional crop of Malaysia. Kenaf biomass would appear as a potential material for great sustainable energy (bioethanol, biohydrogen, bioenergy) supplier in the coming future. In this review, we have provided an insight of kenaf biomass, its morphology, structure, chemical compositions, storage and sowing, cultivation, harvesting, yield and different sustainable energy possible to get from it. We also discuss the feasibility of kenaf biomass as a sustainable energy source supplier in Malaysian prospective. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Failure to the proper integration of distributed energy resources might lead to violation of technical limits in the grid, thus lower power quality for the end-user, and reduces the efficiency of the electricity market. Nevertheless, the coexistence of generation and consumption at the premises of a neighborhood, caused by the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic generators in the distribution grid, diminishes the power transmission losses, inherent to a grid based on central power generation. Moreover, it enables the creation of a local electricity market, a step towards the market and technical integration of distributed energy resources if combined with the concept of market-based control. While market-based control seems to be the dominant solution for the control of distributed energy resources, the implementation of market-based control can be distributed or centralized and depends on the electricity market design. This work focuses on identifying the characteristics of the participants of the electricity market for the case study of residential customers with photovoltaic generation, residential energy storage and inelastic demand.

This fact has led to violation of the maximum overvoltage limit at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) of power plants as well as violation of the maximum short-circuit power at many HV/MV substations. Therefore, the utilities are reluctant in penetration of additional RES plants to the system. Thus, coordination between distributed generators, energy storage systems and flexible loads is expected to add a great value to the grid operation and facilitate further RES penetration. The increased penetration of buildings' energy efficiency technologies at demand-side and their control possibilities over electrical energy consumption may also make valuable contributions to grid operations.

These proteins are stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, in which cytoplasmic and exoplasmic water plays a special role. Water structural ordering generates the dipole potential that typically overcompensates for an intrinsic membrane-protein potential gradient, and thus it modifi es and sustains an overall cellular electrostatics. Although the transmembrane voltage has been extensively studied, the dipole potential has attracted very little attention. Here, by using molecular dynamics, we examined water electrostatic response to the transmembrane charge, field, and potential asymmetry introduced by the presence of four integral membrane proteins: typical of inner (α-helix) and outer membrane (β-barrel). In all cases, the protein presence introduces electrostatic directionality in the transmembrane dipole field and voltage. In particular, water generates a deep potential sink if strongly polar residues are densely packed on one side of bilayer, as frequently occurs in a selectivity filter of the K+ channel. We also found that protein secondary structure is less important than the polar residue distribution along the protein channel. Our findings are relevant for understanding the driving force behind biomembrane conductivity: the ability of biological water to electrostatically screen the transmembrane voltage.

The observation of anthocyanins profile by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS was conducted. Red cabbage products contained twenty different nonacylated and acylated anthocyanins with main structure of cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside. Treatments applied affected concentration and profile of red cabbage anthocyanins. Anthocyanins content was reduced by 24%, 25% and 34% in fermented and stewed (30 and 60-min) red cabbage, respectively. The intensity of anthocyanins degradation during storage depended on the process length. Derivatives of cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside acylated with sinapic acid were characterised by the highest losses. Five assays were used to analysis of antioxidant capacity. Fresh red cabbage had stronger antioxidant capacity in comparison to fermented, stored and stewed red cabbage.

We have previously shown that finding the arbitrage value of BES with known historical price data can be solved by iterative linear programming. The objective of the present paper is to show that, when the price information remains unknown, finding the optimal economic value of lifetime-constrained BES falls within the purview of stochastic shortest path problems, and the optimal policy presents the property of a threshold structure. To overcome the dimensionality difficulty, we propose a structure-based aggregation method, i.e., Layer and Group, to construct optimal trading policies. The elegance of this approach lies in its circumventing of the need for exhausted value iteration over the entire state space. Instead, the approach works in a hierarchical and parallel fashion, thus significantly speeding up the convergence to the optimality. Extensive experimental results show that this approach can dramatically reduce the computational complexity, thus contributing to the computationally tractable optimality without requiring any approximation. Numerical simulation also demonstrates the validity of the proposed framework, and various trading insights for practical BES systems have been formed. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Graph theory; Iterative methods; Linear programming; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Aggregation methods; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storages (BES); Mathematical frameworks; Optimal policies; Price information; Stochastic Shortest Path Problem; Structure-based; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922424042

The IEEE 118-bus Test System has been modified with some generation replaced by wind, solar, hydro, batteries and diesel generation to consider the complementary strengths of each source. The system is divided into 3 areas, and in each area power is generated by one or more of the renewable energy sources. Wind and solar generation provide intermittent generation, but hydro is a more reliable source of generation. In the daytime, when there is less wind, the solar panels will cover the extra load. At night, the wind turbines will be generating more power. If the solar panels and wind turbines do not create enough power, the diesel generator will automatically run to compensate for the deficiency and batteries, as storage, will help to reduce the burden of the diesel generator. Since the back-up generators are fuelled by diesel and turn on only when needed, this can actually save a lot on fuel cost.

In the same way, by injection of wind power into the electric grid some power quality may varies because of a wind fluctuating inherent and relatively new types of generators. The measurements and the guidelines indicated in International Electro Technical Commission 61400 Standards the quality of power generated and the performance of wind turbines are derived. As far as the measurements of the generated power quality is concerned while the turbine is connected to an electrical grid there are certain associated powers such as active and reactive powers, flicker, the switching function's electrical behaviour, voltage swell, harmonics and voltage sag. Their measurements are done according to national and international guidelines. This paper studies the static synchronous compensator and battery energy storage system implementation in order to address the issue of voltage stability in wind farms connected to the distribution network. It has been obtained from the results that the STATCOM-battery combination can be very effective in compensating generator rotor angle oscillations and thus well suited for improving transient stability and the dynamic behaviour of the power system. It should also be noted that in this study the STATCOM provides a real power flow path for battery, but the operation of the battery is independent of the STATCOM controller. While the STATCOM is controlled to absorb or inject reactive power, the battery is controlled to absorb or inject real power. Results obtain shows that, during the voltage sag voltage drops to 0.7pu and after connection of STATCOM voltage will improve to 0.89pu and after applying BESS voltage will improve to 0.95pu. © 2014 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; DFIG; Power Quality; Power Quality; STATCOM; Voltage Sag; Wind Farm","Data storage equipment; Electric batteries; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Electric generators; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Power quality; Reactive power; Static synchronous compensators; System stability; Voltage control; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Wind power; Wind turbines; Active and reactive power; Battery energy storage systems; DFIG; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); International electro-technical commissions; Power quality improvement; Voltage sags; Wind farm; Asynchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990878471

Different filling strategies in terms of pressure and temperature of the gas injected into the cylinder and their effects on key parameters like maximum temperature, state of charge, and energy cooling demand are investigated. It is shown that pre-cooling of the gas is required but is not necessary for the whole duration of the filling. Relevant energy savings can be achieved with pre-cooling over a fraction of the time. The most convenient filling strategy from the cooling energy point of view is identified: with an almost linear pressure rise and pre-cooling in the second half of the process, a 60% reduction of the cooling energy demand is achieved compared to the case of pre-cooling for the whole filling. © 2014 The Authors.

The system consists of Photovoltaic (PV) panels, polymer electrolyte based electrolyzers, H2 and O2 storage tanks and a commercial PEFC stack. A PEFC is numerically investigated both as new and as degraded (for about two years). Using a variety of observed degradation patterns reported in the literature, the degraded PEFC is parametrically analyzed by using ANSYS Fluent. The investigated parameters are the membrane equivalent weight, the Catalyst Layer (CL) porosity and viscous resistance, the Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL) porosity and viscous resistance, and the bipolar plate contact resistance. By comparing the simulation results for the new and the degraded fuel cells, it is concluded that the effects of overall degradation on cell potential is significant - being about 20% around the operating point of the fuel cell. This degraded fuel cell is incorporated into the TRNSYS model of the energy system, and then the effects of the PEFC degradation on the performance of the energy system are estimated. It is observed that the degradation has substantial impact on the overall system performance. System down time of approximately one month is possible.

Due to these features, latent heat Thermal Energy Storage (TES) devices using PCMs are widely used to store heat in thermal systems. The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the performance of water PCM in an improved milk storage cooling cycle integrated with a TES device. In this prototype, water is used as the PCM media which serves as both the PCM and HTF in a direct TES device. The system is designed based on an energy analysis to cool 100 litres of milk from 35 oC to 4 oC and keep it at this temperature for 48 hours before it is collected. The TES device contains 27 meters of R404 refrigerant pipes with water passing through baffles. Performance of the cooling system is experimentally investigated for both freezing (charging) and melting (discharging) of water PCM inside the device. Ice formation around cooling coils and temperature variations in TES device and milk silo are recorded. Also, energy consumption during charging and discharging modes are separately reported. Based on the results, 11.52 kWh is used to form 60 mm of ice around cooling coils of TES device in 225 minutes and 2.42 kWh is required to reduce the milk temperature from 35 oC to 4 oC three times with one charging of TES device. Finally, a parametric study is performed for two diffenret pump massflows at 11.1 and 8.3 L/min and the results are reported. © 2015 Begell House Inc..

It has 3.5 H2%wt and is soluble in solutions (Jaska et al., 2001). More importantly, it is able to release hydrogen via a room-temperature dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of a suitable catalyst (Pun et al., 2007). The catalysts tested for DMAB dehydrogenation have mainly included nanoparticles (NPs) of noble metals Rh (Zahmakiran et al., 2009), Ir (Jaska et al., 2001) and Ru (Duman et al., 2013) which are all unsuitable for practical applications due to their limited resources and high price tags. However, in literature, there are no report concerning the use of non-noble Fe, Ni, Co, Cu and noble Pt catalysts in the DMAB dehydrogenation conditions. Therefore, synthesis of highly efficient bimetallic catalysts with much reduced usage of noble metals Rh, Ir, Ru, and Pt with non-noble metals is desired for dehydrogenation of DMAB. Herein, we reported in situ generation, characterization, and catalytic activity of 4.8 + 0.2 nm oleylamine (OAm)-stabilized CuPt NPs in the synergistic dehydrogenation of DMAB at room temperature. In this synthesis, OAm acted as the solvent, surfactant, and reductant. These NPs were reproducibly isolated from the reaction solution by filtration and characterized by TEM, XRD, HRTEM, ICP-OES,11B NMR, ATR-IR and UV-Visible spectroscopy. Among the 4.8 + 0.2 nm OAm-stabilized CuPt NPs tested for the dehydrogenation of DMAB, the Cu39Pt61 NPs exhibited the highest catalytic activity and durability at room temperature. We also reported the results of a kinetic study on the hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of DMAB catalyzed by OAm-stabilized CuPt NPs depending on the catalyst concentration, substrate concentration, and temperature as well as the activation parameters of catalytic dehydrogenation of DMAB calculated from the kinetic data. Highly active OAmstabilized Cu39Pt61 NPs providing a release of 1.0 equivalent H2 per mole of DMAB with initial turnover frequency and activation energy were 121 h-1 and 47 kJmol-1, respectively. The kinetic studies on these Cu39Pt61 NPs reveal that the synergistic dehydrogenation of DMAB is first-order with respect to both catalyst concentration and substrate concentration. The poisoning experiments showed that the synergistic dehydrogenation of DMAB catalyzed by OAm-stabilized Cu39Pt61 NPs is heterogeneous catalysis. Testing the isolability and reusability of OAm-stabilized Cu39Pt61 NPs showed that the isolated and bottled sample of OAm-stabilized Cu39Pt61 NPs is readily dispersible in hexane and remains active in the synergistic dehydrogenation of DMAB. They retain 87% of their initial catalytic activity even at the fifth run with the complete conversion of Me2NHBH3 to [Me2NBH2]2 plus 1.0 equivalent of H2 per mol of DMAB at room temperature. On that account, OAm-stabilized Cu39Pt61 NPs are isolable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts in the synergistic dehydrogenation of DMAB. These results indicate that synthesis of OAmstabilized CuPt NPs may represent a new approach to replace noble metals for the catalysis for future development of DMAB into a practical hydrogen storage material for renewable energy applications. Moreover, easily isolable, reusable, lower cost than alone Pt, most stability and the high catalytic activity of the in-situ generated OAm stabilized CuPt NPs make them a promising candidate to be employed as a catalyst in developing highly efficient portable hydrogen generation systems using DMAB as solid hydrogen storage material. © 2015, Avestia Publishing.

Recently, the H1 Collaboration has discovered that the relative strength of these two components in Deep Inelastic Scattering depends drastically upon the global structure of the event - namely, the exponential component is absent in the diffractive events characterized by a rapidity gap. We discuss the possible origin of this effect, and speculate that it is linked to the mechanism of confinement. Specifically, we argue that the thermal component is produced in the fragmentation of the color string due to the effective event horizon introduced by confinement, in analogy to the Hawking-Unruh effect. In diffractive events, the t-channel exchange is color-singlet and there is no fragmenting string - so the thermal component is absent. Analyzing the data on non-diffractive pp collisions, we find that the slope of the thermal component of the hadron spectrum is proportional to the saturation momentum that drives the deceleration in the color field, and thus the Hawking-Unruh temperature. © Published by ARISF, 2015",,"Color; Digital storage; Hadrons; Inelastic scattering; Deep inelastic scattering; Exponential components; Global structure; High-energy collisions; Non-diffractive; Relative strength; Thermal component; Transverse momenta; Momentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090391371

The reserves for improvement TEP depending on the degree of development of the technological process are available on any electric furnace. To search for these reserves requires holding furnace on special studies or work-related furnace for a given program for some time (active experiment, the preferred option), or without interfering with the normal course of its operation (passive experiment). The main ways to increase TEP operation of the electric furnace: - monitoring the state of the elements of its construction; - reduction of the heat losses (based on heat balance); - providing input into the bath furnace maximum useful power; - ensuring the stability of the process parameters; - determination of rational parameters of power furnace operation on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the array data; - improvement of the automated control system of an electric furnace. The technique of long-term comprehensive experimental studies of electrical, thermal and technological processes for operating electric furnace for the production of carbon ferrochrome at the application of various types of charge materials is considered. The description used measurement systems, methods of processing, storage and presentation of the information received. Recommendations for improving the energy efficiency of the furnace are provided. The issues related to the creation and the use of systems to make operational decisions and management of electro-technological process of production of ferroalloys are analyzed. The complexity of maintaining a rational mode of operation of the electric furnace is also related to the fact that the process in it is a complex multifactorial system that fails to fully give way to prior analytical calculations, so the task requires experimental solution due to the need for additional instrumentation of the furnace. The implementation of the provisions set forth is also contributed by specifically developed for this purpose POLINOM program. This program set in ACS furnace allows tracking additional relationships between parameters and facilitating maintenance of electro-technological process either in the form of advice to the operator or automatically. The algorithms used in the ACS on the basis of the work carried out in electric furnaces in the smelting of high-carbon ferrochrome can be used in the smelting of other types of ferroalloys with minor adjustments. © Proceeding of the 14th International Ferroalloys Congress: Energy Efficiency and Environmental Friendliness are the Future of the Global Ferroalloy Industry, INFACON 2015.

However, this technology, unfortunately, is not widely used in Russia. The purpose of this work is the study and improving of the oil production technology with jet pumps, and developing of recommendations for its effective application. The analysis of the field experience of implementation has shown that, despite the achievements, the effectiveness of the known systems of oil jet pumps production is currently low. To solve this problem, various methods have been developed. One is the well operation with jet pumps driven by electric submersible pump (ESP), located in the bore pit, which is also the storage capacity and phase separator. The use of ESP, which is located in the bore pit, can significantly improve the reliability of the hydraulic drive of jet pumps in compare to the power plunger pumps. It is necessary to achieve the best balance between ESP energy cost and efficiency of jet pumps. To optimize the system of oil production and achieve the highest efficiency of the jet operation of wells were developed methods and programs of software equipment selection and analysis, combined in a single software product. It allows select the most energy-efficient equipment and design the best system for the jet operation well cluster using ESP as a power unit deflated in bore pit. The developed method of jet pump selection and the calculation of ESP mode allows make a choice of the most suitable equipment for the jet operation of wells, including the power unit with the ESP and to increase the efficiency of the entire system.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the vortex-induced flow-vibrations for our setup have been presented.

The cathode-electrolyte-anode is also called membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA), which is the key component of SOFCs. The commonly used materials for the electrolyte, anode and cathode, are yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), YSZ-Ni composite, and a lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM)-YSZ composite. In operation, hydrogen and carbon monoxide can react with oxygen ions to produce electrons, steam, and carbon dioxide. The produced electrons flow through the external circuit to produce power and then flow to the cathode side. In the porous cathode, oxygenmolecules reactwith electrons to produce oxygen ions, which are subsequently transported through the dense electrolyte to the porous anode to complete the cycle. Theworkingmechanisms of SOFCs are similar to those of batteries, since both devices produce electric energy via electrochemical reactions. Batteries are essentially energy storage devices, as the reactants are stored in batteries (Yang et al., 2011). Thus, the capacity and lifetime of the batteries depend on their size. Although rechargeable batteries can be recharged and used repeatedly, the charging process is usually time-consuming.

The observed results are explained in terms of the modifications in structure, elemental composition, electrical conductivity, Cl-rGO/PVDF interfacial interaction and PVDF phase transformation. GO sheets are doped with chlorine by mixing thionyl chloride into the GO dispersion, resulting in the formation of both charge transfer complexes and covalently bonded chlorine on GO sheets. Cl functions as an electron acceptor, i.e. p-type dopant, and an optimal chlorination gives rise to a maximum ionic Cl along with the highest charge carrier density of GO and the highest electrical conductivity of the composites. Strong interfacial interactions exist between the Cl-rGO sheets and PVDF chains due to chlorination, allowing the adsorption of F atoms onto the basal plane of GO sheets to form β-phase PVDF, to the benefit of enhanced dielectric constants of the composites. The Cl-rGO/PVDF composites with 0.2-0.4 vol% graphene present high dielectric constants and moderate loss tangents: e.g. a dielectric constant of 364 - equivalent to 13 times that of the neat PVDF - with a moderately increased loss tangent of 0.077 at 1 kHz with 0.2 vol% graphene. These values are among the best dielectric performance ever reported to date for composites containing graphene, CNTs and other carbon fillers. The synergy stemming from chlorination of GO sheets on the dielectric properties of Cl-rGO/PVDF are identified.

Besides, the structures may also suffer from damages due to meteoroid attack, in which many tiny particles left over from the formation of the solar system and they are travelling at very high speed to cause serious impact and abrasion onto the structures. In the new Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle (for the Mar's mission) designed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the core fuel storage tank will be made by using polymer-based composites and many materials science and engineering research have been conducted to better understand the behavior of these materials at cryogenic condition. In view of all aforementioned problems, composites used at the high attitude (at the level above the Troposphere) should be able to maintain high strength at low temperature environment. Epoxy-based composites are very popular for making advanced composites due to their high strength and chemically-inert properties, making them excellent to be used as aircraft and aerospace structural materials. However, epoxy normally behaves very brittle and therefore, loss of its toughness and impact performance at low temperature. Besides, due to their low energy dissipatability at low temperature, any impact imposed onto its structures would cause delamination and debond at an interface between reinforced fibre and matrix. Many studies have addressed that the use of single-walled (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon (MWNTs) nanotubes could enhance the mechanical properties of polymer-based composites. However, interfacial bonding properties are always an issue as it would affect the efficiency and effectiveness of stress transfer in the composites. This paper addresses the viability of using coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNT) and randomly-oriented nanoclay-supported nanotubes (NSCNT) to enhance the mechanical properties of epoxy resin at the cryogenic environment. The results obtained from experimental fundings have shown that these nano-reinforcements could effectively enhance the property of epoxy due to their i) surface configuration which could induce the mechanical interlocking between the reinforcements and surrounding matrix and ii) the residual stress due to the shrinkage of the epoxy at low temperature environments. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

Integration of nano - particles into fiber composites concludes to multi-scale reinforced composites and has opened up a new range of multifunctional materials in industry. Structural, electrical and thermal properties of nano - reinforced CFRPs promise high efficient multifunctional materials. Up to now there are certain limitations on the content of nano - particles dispersed into composite matrices. The %wt. content of nano - particles should to be kept low due to viscosity and uniform dispersion issues. A promising technique to overcome these limitations and increase the content of nano - particles into composites is to develop preformed stable structures of nano - particles and integrate them to conventional fiber reinforced composites. Nano - particle films are stable preformed structures that could be integrated into composite materials and enhance their multifunctionality depending upon the nano - particles used to manufacture the films. In this work Multiwall Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) films and hybrid films with MWCNTs and Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNPs) were fabricated. The nano - materials dispersed into distilled water with polymer dispersants and mixed using sonication to form uniform and stable aqueous dispersions. The nano - particle films prepared using a casting method. These polymer based self - supported nanomaterial films were used also as integrated interleaves into CFRPs in order to enhance electrical and thermal conductivity. Scanning Electron Microscopy used to evaluate the internal structure of the polymer based nanoparticle films. Tensile tests performed to the nanoparticle films to measure their mechanical properties. Surface Electrical Conductivity was also measured using a 4-point measurement method; the results are promising for the electrical applications of these materials (e.g. self-sensing materials, lightning strike protection systems, energy storage devices). Finally Thermal Conductivity tests performed to evaluate their thermal performance and also their influence on the thermal properties of the composite materials. The next step of the work involves the introduction of the polymer based nanoparticle films into CFRP laminates. Cross ply CFRPs were manufactured and mechanical characterization together with electrical and thermal conductivity measurement were performed. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

In contrast, the composites containing conductors as fillers could exhibit a colossal dielectric constant but accompanied with a high dielectric loss. Using ceramic-metal hybrids as fillers, of which the nano metal particles are discretely grown on the ceramic grain surface, is a new strategy leading to enhanced dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. In this research, composites consisted of heterogeneous BaTiO3-supporting Ag (BT-Ag) hybrid fillers and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix were prepared. BT-Ag hybrid particles were synthesized via a seed-mediated growing process by a redox reaction between silver nitrate and ethylene glycol. Investigations were carried out on how to achieve desirable dielectric properties by controlling the size and amount of the sliver nanoparticles on BT surface, based on different size of BT. The results showed that the size of the deposited nano Ag increased with the size of BT particle. The sizes of the discretely deposited Ag nanoparticles were 20~30 nm, 50~70 nm and 70~90 nm on the 100 nm, 300 nm and 500 nm BT, respectively, which in consequence, affected the dielectric properties of the composites. The BT-Ag/PVDF with 300 nm BT show better dielectric behavior than the composites with 100 nm and 500 nm BT. A dielectric constant of 235 was obtained with (300nm) BT-(50~70nm)Ag and the dielectric loss was 0.11 at 1 kHz, demonstrating promising applications in the electronic devices. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

A very promising technology to capture CO2 is oxy-combustion. Oxy-combustion offers several advantages over conventional combustion technologies, such as flue-gas volume reduction, high combustion efficiency, low fuel consumption, and significant reduction in NOx emissions. Liquid fuel is available and it is the most widely used source of energy in the world. Easy handling and transporting, less storage volume and higher flame temperature are some of the features of liquid fuel which give it an upper hand over other sources. In this study, an experimental work on oxygen enriched combustion of ethanol in a vertical reactor by Lacas et al. (2005, ""Experimental Study of Air Dilution in Oxy-Liquid Fuel Flames,"" Proc. Combust. Inst., 30(2), pp. 2037-2045) has been modeled numerically. Nonpremixed model using probability density function (PDF) has been incorporated to simulate the combustion process of ethanol droplets. Predicted combustion characteristics are found to be in good compliance with the experimental data. In addition to this, effects of dilution of carbon dioxide in oxygen on the flame properties have also been presented. Combustion of ethanol in oxygen-carbon dioxide environment has been compared with that of the conventional air environment.

Two identical groups each consisted of four containers with different packaging shapes were manufactured. The containers were used to store natural mineral water for 30 days at ambient room temperature (25°C). One group was shielded by applying Faraday’s shield. The surrounding electromagnetic fields were measured during the storage period by using TS-EMF portable measurement system. During the storage period, samples were collected for analysis at the end of one week, two weeks and one month. The relationship between the containers’ packaging shape and the electromagnetic fields to their effects on the physicochemical and microbiological parameters of water were explored by electromagnetic (EM) simulation. The physicochemical parameters of the stored water remained within the permissible guidelines of the World Health Organization. It was observed that variations in the HPC of the water samples stored both shielded and unshielded containers during the storage period. There was no coliform count detected in the stored water in the three trials during the three phases of the study period.The EM simulation showed variations in the total SAR and maximum point SAR values, which is the energy absorbed by water at 2,400 MHz for both vertical and horizontal polarizations.

For accurately modeling such systems, the fluidized bed numerical model should be correctly representing the behavior of the actual bed. There are several suggested partial semi-empirical models in the literature considering distinct phenomena related to fluidization and void fraction distribution in a fluidized bed. In this study, combinations of the available partial models are tested for the purpose of generating a viable fluidized bed model. For the drag model, the Syamlal-O'Brien model and the Gidaspow model are tested against the available experimental data for a fluidized bed of glass beads. While considering the effects of drag model selection, different solid phase and gas phase model options are also investigated. For the gas phase, the laminar and turbulent flow (with k-epsilon model) cases are investigated. For the solid phase, as a stress model, the Cao-Ahmadi model is considered as a modification of the k-epsilon model. Together with these modeling options, the Johnson-Jackson wall boundary condition with different specularity coefficients and particle-wall restitution coefficients and the Jenkins boundary condition are considered. The data from the resulting large number of cases are compared against the experimental time averaged axial void fraction distributions at two different sections of the investigated bed.

The new design is a solar water heater system consisting of an array of evacuated tube heat pipe solar collectors connected to a common manifold filled with phase change material and acting as a latent heat storage tank. Solar energy incident on the evacuated tube is collected and stored in the latent heat storage tank. The stored heat is then transferred to the domestic hot water supply via a finned pipe placed inside the tank. The performance is analyzed based on an accurate set of mathematical equations. The various climatic conditions of a tropical region are considered as operating environment of the device. The thermal performance of the new design is compared with the conventional evacuated tube heat pipe solar water heater to have a better observation about the differences and advantageous of the new design. The results showed that the thermal performance of the proposed system is higher than a conventional system at certain conditions, which depend to the weather conditions and flowrates, but the sensitivity of the efficiency of the proposed system to the supply water flowrate is less than the conventional system. © 2016.

Smart metering and development of smart grid open new prospects for the prosumer distributed energetics. Among the distributed generation sources, the issue connected with adequate energy management and storage of generated energy becomes more and more essential. In the first part of this article, using μCHP has been analysed, on the basis of the daily energy power demand profile at the prosumer's household. In the second part of this article the cooperation of the electrochemical cell at the given load cycle (resembling the daily power demand of the household) with the μCHP(Micro Combined Heat and Power) has been simulated. The change in the degree of the cell charge - SOC (State of Charge), the charge/discharge currents curves, voltage values on the cell's terminals, emf (electromotive force), as well as the cell's temperature increase at charging/discharging with the preset current, have been presented for the given load cycle. Attention has been focused on the parameters significantly influencing efficiency of the generated electric energy storage and of its renewed use. The possibilities of managing the sales of the stored electric energy from the micro cogeneration system to the grid, have also been discussed.","Energy management; Energy storage; Load cycle; Microcogeneration; Prosumer",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013377898

The linac was designed to produce either a single bunch with a charge of 0.5 nC of electrons or a train of bunches up to 300 ns long containing a total charge of 15 nC. The booster was designed to accelerate up to 15 nC each cycle in a train of bunches up to 300 ns long. Linac commissioning was completed in April 2012. Booster commissioning was started in November 2013 and completed in March 2014. All of the significant design goals were satisfied including beam emittance, energy spread, and transport efficiency. While the maximum booster charge accelerated was only 10 nC this has proven to be more than sufficient for storage ring commissioning and operation. The injector has operated reliably during storage ring operation since then. Results will be presented showing measurements of linac and booster operating parameters achieved during commissioning and initial operation. Operating experience and reliability during the first year of NSLS-II operation will be discussed.

But neither of them seems to be much better than others due to different power source, converter or storage issues. Due to high reliability demands, a scalable converter able to be coupled with different energy sources with minor efficiency loss is preferable. The greatest problem for solar powered systems is a need for 350 hrs energy storage. This seems realistic only at Lunar resources use, the easiest option is for thermal energy storage. Operation conditions require high reliability through 100k hrs without service. But direct converters have low efficiency and mass specific power, and for machine converters this seems real and is proven for Stirling engines only. Reduction of mechanical connections and rotation to linear motion substitution should help to improve converter reliability. Recent progress in linear generators allows considering them as a proper alternative to rotary ones. Using regolith (Lunar soil) for heat accumulation should be mainly considered in terms of material mining, preparation, loading, storage and distribution being implemented using brought facilities (not single-purpose preferably). The performed analysis shows that thermochemical storage fits well demanded temperature range and has ca. 20 times less weight, than analogous encapsulated phase-change material one. The most compact heat-exchange surface configurations for both hot and cold Stirling sides seem to be slit ones. Piston is connected to a linear alternator slider, being driven back by a gas spring. There's a tradeoff between alternator weight (cubic frequency) and engine lifetime (linear frequency), which is resolved at ca. 100 Hz.

However, the large areas required for the installation of solar thermal collector's array can be discouraging, especially in the apartment buildings where the apartment's roof is a common area. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of using compound parabolic concentrating (CPC) solar collectors instead of the commonly used flat-plate collectors (FPCs) in such systems. It is aimed to explore the feasibility of area reduction required by the collectors. Second, the temperature profiles of circulating water loop and the concrete slabs are sought to be examined. The system consists of solar thermal collectors, a storage tank, and circulation of water to transport the heat to four similar floor slabs. The CPC collector outlet fluid's temperature can reach a maximum of 95 °C, compared to 70 °C obtained from the FPCs. The results from the simulations show that a 2 m2 CPC collector array can perform satisfactorily to match the job of an 8 m2 FPC array, obtaining the same required circulating water's temperature in the slabs.

Meanwhile it's becoming more important to use up-to-date highly cost-effective technologies for conventional field development to keep oil production rate fixed. Well stock analysis based on open-source data demonstrates in this paper and represents considerable quantity of idle, or uneconomical, wells in Russian Federation. Thus, they make up about 14% of the total number of production wells. Marginal wells, or wells with low flow rates, are considered to be the most subjected to be 'uneconomical'. Sidetracking as a stimulation of marginal well production seems like the most effective method to boost the production rate of mature oil field. But most of artificial-lift technologies aren't cost effective in sidetrack applications for some reasons. Review of up-to-date artificial-lift technologies used for sidetrack application is also presented in this paper. The author designed new kind of equipment permitting operating inside sidetracks-rodless reciprocating electric submersible hydraulic pump unit. It consists of electric submersible motor, protector, and specially designed both transmission to transform mechanical energy into hydraulic and double-acting hydraulic pump. The key unit elements are reviewed in this paper. So, double-acting hydraulic pump is composed of two hydraulic cylinders (actuator) and two piston pump, connected with each other by valve box where suction and discharge valves are placed. Transmission representing by hydraulic fluid tank, power pump and sleeve valve is to drive hydraulic pump and also provide reciprocating pistons moving.

Different LNG deliveries potentially have different density caused by different gas composition. Although the LNG composition depends on LNG source, it mainly consists of methane, ethane, propane, butane and trace nitrogen. When a new supply of LNG is transported to the tank, the LNG composition and temperature in the tank can be different from LNG as delivered. This may lead to the liquid stratification in the tank, and consequently the rollover. As a result, LNG rapidly evaporates and the pressure in the tank increases. More and more restrictive safety regulations require fuller understanding of the formation and evolution of layers. The paper is focused on the analysis of liquid stratification in the tank which may take place when storing LNG, and which process leads to the rapid evaporation of considerable quantities of LNG. The aim was to attempt modeling of the process of liquid stratification in an LNG tank.

In this database information on technical maturity, technology readiness level and forecasting is included for a number of technologies.

So switching to renewable energy technologies is an urgent need. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies are one of renewable technologies that are able to solve the present and future electricity problems. In this paper the historical evolution for the cornerstone plants of CSP technologies to generate clean electricity was reviewed and the current projects worldwide of CSP technologies were presented to show that the CSP technologies are technically and commercially proven and have the possibility for hybridization with fossil fuel or integration with storage systems to sustain continuous operation similar to conventional plants. Among all solar thermal technologies parabolic trough is the most technically and commercially proven. It also has the possibility for hybridization since it is proven by operating in several commercial projects for more than 28 years. It has a high maturity level and able to provide the required operating heat energy either as a stand-alone or in hybrid systems at the lowest cost and lower economic risks. For this reason, this technology is dominant in the operational and under-construction projects. However, currently there is a trend toward employing the other CSP technologies in the future projects as a result of the improvement in their performance. The use of PTC technology in the operational CSP projects is 95.7% and has decreased to 73.4% for the under-construction projects. Meanwhile, the uses of Fresnel collector (LFC), Tower power (TSP) and Stirling dish (SDC) technologies in the operational projects are 2.07%, 2.24%, and 0% respectively and have increased to 5.74%, 20.82% and 0.052% respectively for the under-construction projects.

Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) were developed to use ground energy for residential heating. The most important part of a GSHP is the Ground Heat Exchanger (GHE) that consists of pipes buried in the soil and is used for transferring heat between the soil and the heat exchanger of the GSHP. Soil composition, density, moisture and burial depth of pipes affect the size of a GHE. There are plenty of works on ground source heat pumps and ground heat exchangers in the literature. Most of the works on ground heat exchangers are based on the heat transfer in the soil and temperature distribution around the coil. Some of the works for thermo-economic optimization of thermal systems are based on thermodynamic cycles. GHEs is commonly sized according to short time (one year or less) simulation algorithms. Variation of soil temperature in long time period is more important and, therefore, long term simulation is required to be assure the performance of the GSHP system. In this study, long time (10 years) simulation for parallel pipe GHE of a GSHP system was performed numerically with dynamical boundary conditions. In the numerical study ANSYS CFD package was used. This package uses a technique based on control volume theory to convert the governing equations to algebraic equations so they can be solved numerically. The control volume technique works by performing the integration of the governing equations about each control volume, and then generates discretization of the equations which conserve each quantity based on control volume. Thermal boundary conditions can be defined in four different types in ANSYS Fluent: Constant heat flux, constant temperature, convection-radiation and convection. In this study, periodic variation of air temperature boundary at upper surface condition is applied, the lateral and bottom surface of the solution domain are defined as adiabatic wall type boundary condition; the pipe inner surface is taken as wall with a constant heat flux. In order to provide the periodic variation of air temperature boundary at upper surface condition a User Defined Function (UDF) was written and interpreted in ANSYS Fluent. Likewise, a UDF was also written to give constant heat flux intermittently for the pipe inner surface. Constant heat flux of 10, 20, 30 W per unit length of pipe used for calculations.

There are several possible technologies for these vehicles but Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and Fully Electric Vehicles (FEV) are becoming popular. They both require advanced energy storage and management systems. In the design of these powertrains it is of capital importance to evaluate, not only the required traction energy, but also the energy involved in braking and that has the possibility of being regenerated, in real-world routes and traffic conditions. Typeapproval driving cycles are insufficient for this purpose, as they do not include parameters that substantially affect the vehicle dynamics, such as road slope and additional friction due to road winding. This work presents a methodology for the energy characterization of driving cycles, based on the numerical integration of specific power, including new parameters such as specific traction and braking energies, cumulative uphill and downhill slopes and cornering friction energy, as well as energy-power distributions. The methodology will help in the comparison of the available type-approval driving cycles and in the definition of more realistic ones that can be used for better assessment of fuel consumption and emissions of vehicles. With input data from real routes, the procedure will be useful in the design of advanced electrical or hybridized powertrain systems, both to size the components and to define appropriate energy management strategies, with the final goal of an improved efficiency. The methodology will also be valuable in the energy classification of European roads. The paper describes the mathematical model, which allows the quantification of all the important energy flows involved in the evolution of a reference vehicle, following a route. This model was developed in the MatLab/Simulink environment and was applied to the characterization of three type-approval cycles and to three real routes. The results indicate that the typeapproval cycles are too soft to adequately emulate present day aggressive traffic conditions. Driving cycles simulating significant road slopes and sinuosity should be used in the future, both for consumption and emissions certification and in the development of new powertrains.

A detailed numerical study was performed for representative single-pass, two-pass, and three-pass heat exchangers. Numerical predictions were obtained for cases where the minimum capacity rate fluid was subjected to a step change in inlet temperature in absence of mass flow rate perturbations. Likewise, numerical predictions were obtained for the heat exchangers operating initially at steady state, where a step mass flow rate change of the minimum capacity rate fluid was imposed in the absence of any fluid temperature perturbations. The transient performance of this particular heat exchanger configuration subjected to these temperature and flow disturbances has not been discussed previously in the available literature. In the present study the energy balance equations for the hot and cold fluids and the heat exchanger wall were solved using an implicit central finite difference method. A parametric study was conducted by varying the dimensionless quantities that govern the transient response of the heat exchanger over a typical range of values. Because of the storage of energy in the heat exchanger wall, and finite propagation times associated with the inlet perturbations, the outlet temperatures of both fluids do not respond instantaneously.

This led to the production of new materials and devices. Nanotechnology has become an important priority in many countries. Despite its unique advantages and applications in everyday life and industry, the use of materials with nanometer dimensions raised a question of their safety for consumers and the environment1.The rapid propagation of various nanomaterials is a dilemma for regulatory authorities in relation to their hazard identification2. Recently, it has been written a lot about the urgent need to develop rules for nanomaterials. Such rules are needed for legislators to protect people from potentially adverse effects. As for manufacturers these rules are necessary in order to prove that nanoproducts must be produced carefully and with caution to avoid possible negative effects. However, it is turned out to be difficult to develop such rules3. At present, many efforts are made to use relatively simple nano-structured materials, such as metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes in the content of high-strength materials, self-cleaning surfaces and stain-resistant textiles and for energy storage and conversion4. The study of more complex nanomaterials will lead to the use of these data in medical diagnostics and treatment, and modern electronics5.Within the past decade nanomaterials are used on a new commercial scale, it increases risks of possible toxic effects of nanoparticles that enter the environment because their potential toxicity for aquatic organisms is high6. Toxic effect of nanoparticles for aquatic ecosystems is associated with their physical and chemical properties and their action in aqueous media where dissolution, aggregation and agglomeration may occur7. Despite the fact that the production of these particles increased considerably in recent years, there are little data on their toxicity. Results of toxicity differ mainly due to the different methodology8. Different biological tests were discussed; they have been successfully used to assess the environmental impact of pollutants on invertebrates, algae and bacteria. Now they are more often used for risk assessment of nanoparticles on different levels of the aquatic food web9.Environmental risks and methodological approaches for testing the toxicity of nanomaterials using aquatic organisms were considered in recent publications10. For example, the toxicity of CuO and ZnO nanoparticles was assessed using a simplified model of the aquatic food chain in order to determine the bioaccumulation of toxic effects and particle transport through the trophic levels11.The experiment of using bacteria, protozoa, yeast, rotifer, algae, nematodes, crustaceans, fish, and amphibians as test objects in wastewater toxicological studies was described12. Only individual effects of nanoparticles were studied in most works. Despite the implementation of these data as a tool for assessing risks to the aquatic environment, there are still not enough data to fully understand the toxic effects of nanoparticles on aquatic organisms13. © 2015, Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

Most of the MAVs developed to date are powered by electrochemical batteries coupled with an electric motor. In a previous study, several potential alternative energy storage/power systems were examined, evaluated for their specific energy and specific power, and compared to electrical batteries and hydrocarbon fuel storage. Additionally, the power and energy requirements of fixed wing MAV and rotary wing MAV were calculated, for comparison with the different alternatives. In the present study a novel PCM open cycle storage/power system forMAV applications is proposed, based on those requirements. It is an open cycle that utilizes the ambient temperature as its hot reservoir, thus being able to receive the required energy for the phase change from liquid to vapor.

Moreover, since sensor nodes have restricted transmission range, multiple hops are needed by the node in order to forward the packets from one node to the other and this raises very challenging issues when designing routing protocols. Most of the proposed single path routing schemes use a periodic low-rate flooding of data in order to recover from path failures, which causes higher consumption in sensor node resources. So multipath routing is an optimal approach to enhance the network lifetime. In this paper, a robust path construction for a reliable data transmission in node-disjoint multipath routing (RNDMR) is proposed for WSNs. The proposed RNDMR has the ability to provide a low overhead path construction as well as provide data transmission reliability by using XORbased coding algorithm, which entails low utilization of resources, such as low storage space and lesser computing power. In the proposed RNDMR, the procedure involves the splitting up of all transmitted messages into many different segments of equal size, before adding the XOR-based error correction codes and distributing it among multiple paths simultaneously in order to boost reliable data transmission and to be assured that the essential fragment of the packet arrives at the sink node without any additional consumption of energy and undue delay. By using simulations, the performance of RNDMR was assessed and compares it with ReInForm routing. The results illustrate that RNDMR attains low energy consumption, records low average delay and routing overhead, as well as increased packet delivery ratio when compared with ReInForm Routing. © 2015 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Forward error correction; Node-disjoint multipath routing; Reliability; Robust path construction; Wireless sensor network","Data transfer; Digital storage; Electric power transmission; Energy utilization; Error correction; Forward error correction; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Reliability; Routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks; Error correction codes; Low energy consumption; Node-disjoint multipath routing; Packet delivery ratio; Path construction; Reliable data transmission; Utilization of resources; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979752624

As a result of a composite pattern of neural excitations, muscles contract coordinately to produce forces that are transmitted by tendons to the skeletal system, causing its movement or keeping its pose. Often undervalued in the current muscle models, the elastic properties of tendon present an important action in the dynamic interaction between the muscular and skeletal system, influencing the force transmission, energy storage and joint control. This work aims to develop a musculotendon model within the framework of multibody systems dynamics with natural coordinates to be applied both in inverse and forward dynamics analyses of human body. An efficient methodology to compute the musculotendon forces and activations is presented, considering the Hill-type muscle model as basis. The proposed model considers a muscle unity in series with a spring element, which is defined according the elastic properties of the tendon The assessment of the methodology is performed by applying the proposed model in the inverse dynamic analysis of a 3D human biomechanical model, characterized by 43 muscles per leg. The influence of the tendon in the produced muscle force and activation is analysed for different daily activities and the results compared to a biomechanical model with stiff (rigid) tendons. The results indicate that the tendon allows the muscle to work, predominantly, in its optimal configuration, decreasing the non-physiological passive forces and the activations needed to perform the required contractile force.","Multibody dynamics; Muscle model; Musculotendon contraction dynamics; Musculotendon model; Tendon model","Biomechanics; Chemical activation; Dynamics; Elasticity; Inverse problems; Muscle; Central nervous systems; Hill type muscle model; Human biomechanical models; Inverse dynamic analysis; Multi-body dynamic; Multi-body systems dynamics; Muscle modeling; Synergistic interaction; Tendons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979500646

The combustion of fossil fuels for the satisfaction of energy and transportation needs has enhanced greenhouse (GHG) emissions which harm environment. The Kyoto Protocol of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) obligated industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the member countries like the USA and Japan, which took this initiative failed to achieve their emissions targets. Thus, there is a need to highlight the associated revenue charm for reducing GHG emissions. Objective: This paper has therefore focused the identification and calculation of rates for various associated sources of revenue which might help reduce GHG emission in a developing country like Malaysia which having no mandatory emission obligation. The results: This paper has identified different sources of revenue and its feasible rates, if Malaysia starts carbon capturing storing and utilization process.

Currently no complete overview exists of all SB methods, this paper can be seen as an extension to earlier work by introducing more static balancing categories and methods. The goal is to have a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art to aid designers in selecting the appropriate static balancer technology for mechanical systems. Existing designs are categorized based on the energy storage mechanism, e.g. elastic energy storage mechanisms. Critical design parameters are extracted from published literature to form the basis of comparison of the different categories. A performance criterium is defined to illustrate balancing capabilities as a function of system size. The three comparison parameters are: CompensatedForce Volume ; SBStroke Volume ; Energy Volume The comparison results show that compliant flexure balancers are the best selection for balancing systems while keeping minimal size.

Nevertheless, the realization of this vision requires the use of advanced intelligent approaches to manage the micro grids elements, such as distributed renewable energy production units, loads and storage devices. Multi-agent systems provide a suitable framework to design and implement such systems, where autonomous agents are endowed with predictive data analytics capabilities, e.g., for the prediction of renewable energy production and consumption, taking advantage of the large amount of data produced in these environments. In this context, this paper presents an agent-based system for the management of micro grids, where predictive capabilities were embedded in agents to provide real-time data analytics. The proposed approach was applied to an experimental case study where a set of predictive models was tested for short and long term forecasting of the energy produced by photovoltaic units. © 2015 IEEE.","electrical micro grid; multi-agent systems; photovoltaic power generation forecast; predictive data analytics","Autonomous agents; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Industrial electronics; Information management; Intelligent agents; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Virtual storage; Agent-based systems; Data analytics; Design and implements; Distributed energies; Electrical micro-grids; Long-term forecasting; Photovoltaic power generation; Predictive capabilities; Multi agent systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973154775

Usually, the peak demand charge can contribute up to 30% to their electricity bills due to the use of open-cycle gas power plants that deliver expensive electricity to the customers. Therefore, alternative means are sought after in order to reduce the peak demand for the customers. Distributed small-scaled energy storage can offer a good option to reduce the peak. This paper aims to identify the financial benefits of the energy storage system for utility companies and customers. An energy dispatch model is developed in HOMER to determine the cost of electricity. The model considers the heat rates of power plants in calculating the costs of electricity under different regulatory frameworks of natural gas with various prices of battery components. Apart from that, the cost-benefit for the customers under various electric tariff structures is evaluated. Four battery storage technologies, namely lead acid, vanadium redox flow, zinc-bromine, and lithium-ion are considered. The simulation results show that the storage system with lead acid batteries is more cost-effective than other battery technologies. The customers can reduce their electricity bills with the payback period of 2.8 years. The generation cost for the power system with energy storage is lower than that without energy storage. Besides, the system with energy storage has lower greenhouse gas emissions than that without energy storage. The deferral of the reinforcement of transmission and distribution infrastructure can be achieved with the installation of energy storage at distribution network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery; Energy storage; HOMER; Open-cycle gas turbine; Peak demand; Transmission and distribution","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Lead acid batteries; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Sales; Battery; HOMER; Open cycle gas turbines; Peak demand; Transmission and distribution; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969822456

The nanoparticle composites were examined as electrochemical supercapacitor materials for energy storage application. We found that the shape of the nanoparticles is dominantly droplet-shape, with shape complementary to graphene support, which ensures good contact between them. The height of the nanoparticles increases linearly with the diameter with a coefficient of 0.44 from the fitting results, and the average height/diameter ratio of those nanoparticles is about 0.6, evidence that the nanoparticles have strong interaction with the graphene template, partially because of graphene?nickel ion interaction which ensures good surface wetting. Such a composite of droplet-shape hollow Ni3S2 nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1022.8 F g-1 at scanning rate of 2 mV s-1, with a value of 1015.6 F g-1 obtained at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1. Improvement of the rate capability can be further obtained by partially filling the hollow core with nickel metal, as 93.6% of the specific capacitance is retained with this structure by increasing the discharge density from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1. Our method provides a new approach for controlling the structure of graphenebased nanocomposites, with the potential for use in high performance supercapacitor applications.

With the challenges of ammonia storage, its costs and emissions, the ZeroFlow process reduces ammonia gas consumption and still offers the same capability to affect the nitrided layer, resulting in lower emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases. Prior analysis has shown that ZeroFlow control allows control of not only the nitriding potential, but also phase composition of the nitrided layer, its thickness and the constituents of the atmosphere used for nitriding.

However, once energy storage devices are considered in the system configurations, the existing methods have their shortcomings. It is the experience of Damen that good understanding of the link between energy storage device (ESD) characteristics, charge and discharge strategy and the operational profile (route plus timetable) is crucial. To the knowledge of Damen, no proven method exists that helps to reach a sensible system solution including ESDs, in an early stage of the design process, nor one to optimize such a system for maximum efficiency. Within the EU JOULES project, Damen is looking into possibilities for future design of urban ferries. This paper describes the effort to find a holistic approach to the integration and optimization challenge Damen faces as a shipbuilder. As will be shown, it is a complex puzzle involving domain (ship) knowledge, component knowledge (suppliers), integration knowledge and a good view of the operational profile in consultation with the end-user. This paper describes how time domain simulation is used as a powerful tool to support the integration of components and how it supports the optimization of such a system. The paper mainly focuses on the process of selecting and integrating the appropriate energy storage device given a specific operational profile.

The (111) textured polycrystalline films are shown to have nonconductive PZT grain boundaries. The short-circuited photocurrents measured under illumination of the films by light with the quantum energy of 2.7 eV indicate the polarization inside the film directed from the top to the bottom electrode. Using the modified method of depolarization hysteresis loops, we found a non-switchable part of polarization which was measured to be -16 μC/cm2 and directed from the top to the bottom electrode. We consider this result to be a giant self-polarization and explain it in terms of flexoelectricity caused by lattice mismatch between the PZT and bottom Pt layers. The strain gradient across the PZT film thickness is estimated from the in-plane lattice constants measured in Pt and PZT films to be ∼103cm-1, which can produce the downward flexoelectric polarization of∼14 μC/cm2, coinciding well with the measured one. Nonsymmetrical depolarization loops are found in the films when the polarization switching itself becomes more difficult under the negative or positive driving voltage.

Because of lesser environmental impact and lower production costs, renewable energy sources don't pose a significant threat to the environment and human health. One of the most important renewable energy source is hydrogen energy; which is a synthetic fuel and can be produced from various raw materials such as water, fossil fuels and biomass. Hydrogen is a storable energy carrier. When produced by methods like electrolysis of natural water sources on earth, hydrogen can be converted into energy with high efficiency without causing any negative impact on the environment and just emerging water or water vapour as a by-product. Hydrogen energy has the ability to be used as energy in automotive industry, air transport and all industries. While it can be used by burning directly, it can also be used as an energy source in vehicles using fuel cells. Other uses are in the chemical industry, petrochemical industry, mobile applications (cell phones, computers, etc.) and built applications (backup power units, power requirement at remote locations, etc.). During production in mines, quarries are filled with groundwater and ponds are formed. This leads to problems such as low productivity, low production, additional storage costs, high maintenance costs of construction machinery, road building and maintenance costs, the costs caused by the wet material and the decrease in equipment efficiency. The resulting excess water is often stored in the tailings ponds by the help of various drainage methods and pumps or disposed. The spread or release of the waste water emerging during the mining and mineral processing to the nature irresponsibly, create a major problem for that area and the environment. In this study, utilization by converting the excess underground water coming up during the mining operations and the wastewater from mineral processing to hydrogen energy is being investigated. © 2015 IEEE.","environment; Hydrogen energy; mining; renewable energy; waste water","Automotive industry; Chemical industry; Construction equipment; Costs; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Groundwater; Health risks; Lakes; Machinery; Maintenance; Mining; Mobile phones; Natural resources; Proven reserves; Quarries; Renewable energy resources; Synthetic fuels; Wastewater; Construction machinery; environment; Equipment efficiency; Hydrogen Energy; Impact on the environment; Petrochemical industry; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Produced Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964584609

The energy storage technologies can help in balancing the generation and demand by storing unused electricity and then supplying it back to grid when required. In future grids, energy storage technologies are expected to become a major source of electricity; a collaborator to those distributed generations (DG) resources. The objective of this research was to review different energy storage systems (ESS) and their sizing techniques, used in power system. Study focused on Mechanical Energy Storage (MES), Electric and Magnetic Energy Storage (EMES) and Electro-Chemical Energy Storage (ECES) systems. Through this review, it is known that most of the research regarding energy storage sizing for large PV plants follow similar techniques as used for standalone PV systems. Additionally some authors have proposed energy models which considered only daily or yearly energy demand without considering certain network constraints. Estimating energy storage capacity without considering the electrical networks constraints may pose a threat to future energy balance predictions leading to a huge loss of investment due to unplanned storage sizing. Therefore it is recommended that current energy models used for sizing of energy storage should be reconsidered and re-designed. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy storage systems; Renewable energy; Storage sizing techniques; Utility scale PV plants","Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Magnetic storage; Renewable energy resources; Superconducting magnets; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Energy storage technologies; Magnetic energy storage; Mechanical energy storages; PV plants; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964397432

The proposed voltage control scheme is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem to minimize voltage deviations and power losses. A hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Gravitational Search Algorithm (PSOGSA) is used to solve the resulting optimization problem.

Successful implementation of knowledge-based approaches and innovative solutions in this field is a guarantee of sustainable development of food and processing industry. Simulation is a key tool in solving this problem. The construction of adequate mathematical models of technological processes based on fundamental principles for developing a set of qualitative and functional characteristics of plant origin raw materials allows you to create differentiated technologies of processing and storage to ensure consistent quality, storage capacity and minimize losses of the target product. Using mathematical models we defined the next task as to organize the production of food grain-based target quality when using grain raw materials with predictable consumer characteristics at a certain level. We have investigated the processing of barley grain brewing by electrophysical effects and optimum parameters of this impact: the heating rate of 0.4 °C/s and the exposure processing 90 C; the heating rate from 0.4 to 0.8 °C/s and the exposure processing from 30 to 60 C; heating rate of 0.6 to 0.8 °C/s and the exposure processing from 30 to 45 s; heating rate of 0.6 to 0.8 °C/s and the exposure processing from 60 to 90 s. The values of these parameters allowed us to obtain stable disinfecting effect of saving, and for some indicators - improving malting grain quality of barley. Overall, it can be noted that electrical effects can reduce energy consumption, along with efficient contributes to the destruction of the grain pathogenic microflora of various etiologies, to ensure the safety of the protein complex, the quantity and quality of starch in barley, as well as improve the whole complex of physical and chemical parameters that determine malting quality of barley, and, most importantly, allows obtaining environmentally safe products. © 2015 The Authors.

Likewise other European territories, renewable sources already are being explored for power production. Currently a large amount of wind energy on Crete is curtailed during certain daily periods as a result of reduced demand and minimum operating levels on thermal generators. Reducing wind power curtailment magnitude requires additional sources of flexibility in the grid, and electric energy storage is one of them. This paper address wind generation curtailment minimization through the storage of wind energy surplus. NaS (sodium sulfura) battery modelling is used in this study in order to shift wind generation from off-peak to onpeak through a technical-economic analysis, considering the total annualized cost of the storage system and the wind power curtailment based on an annual basis.

To this end, a sequence of measurements of the ion emission from discharge plasma was made. The laser radiation was focused on the anode surface in the focal spot with diameter D≤250 μm and with intensity on the target q≈5 ×109 W/cm2. The laser energy El = 50 ÷ 60 mJ. The choice of given geometry in this experiment has allowed us to successfully detect the ions emitted at a small angle (α≈210with respect to the discharge axis. We have already established earlier that the ion yield, in the case of focusing laser radiation on the cathode of discharge system, is significantly less. The use of the storage capacitor of C=0.22 μF enabled us to vary the amount of discharge energy in the range of Edr =5÷24 J. Depending on the discharge energy the intensity of ion emission and the spectrum of charge states changed. Our measurement results allowed us to make an assumption that the work in the range of discharge energies Edr = 10÷14 J is the most effective from the point of view of the quantity of emitted multiple-charged ions.

The study discusses the possibility of the application of ultrathin insulating layers of Al2O3 formed by means of ALD method. Deposition of ultrathin oxide layers was carried out by means of successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods from a gas phase. The authors developed and studied the features of methodologies of conformal deposition of ultrathin layers of metal oxides on complex surface of CNT (carbon nanotubes) based electrode. The study revealed the relationship of the specific capacity of an electrode materials and the thickness of formed layers of metal oxides on its surface. In order to do that the authors prepared experimental specimens, which consisted of two current collectors, made from stainless steel; on the specimen of those collectors composite electrodes, which comprised a separator, made from porous polypropylene, and electrolyte, were synthesized. The specific capacity of a capacitor structure was calculated in the course of the analysis of experimental charge-discharge characteristics. The analysis of the results showed that presence of an ultrathin layer of a metal oxide on a surface of an electrode material based on CNT significantly increases the specific capacity of a structure; however, an optimal thickness of the layer must be specified depending on a material and a method of deposition case-by-case. Presence of an optimum value of thickness of an oxide layer is related to the fact that, from one point of view, the increase of the thickness of a deposited layer increases the influence of pseudocapacity; from another point of view, it can lead to the decrease of the effective area of an electrode surface due to filling of mezapores' space between CNT. It was observed that the optimal method for application of ultrathin oxide layers in mass-production condition is ALD method with implementation of equipment with group loading of slices.","(transition) metal oxides; Atomic layer deposition; Carbon nanotubes; Electrode material; Energy accumulation (storage); Nanocomposite; SILAR; Supercapacitor","aluminum oxide; carbon nanotube; electrolyte; nitric oxide; polypropylene; stainless steel; titanium dioxide; Article; composite material; electrode; process development; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958970824

This pushed the designers of marine machinery to search for unconventional fuels for these plants. During the previous years, diesel oil has been extensively used on-board ships. Due to the high price of light diesel oil and the environmental problems resulting from the use of heavy fuel oil, it has become necessary to search for an alternative to traditional fuels. As a result, natural gas fuel has been used on-board some types of ships, especially short-voyage cruise ships. Unfortunately, there are still some technical and logistic problems related to the use of natural gas as a fuel, especially as it is considered a non-renewable energy source. The use of hydrogen fuel on-board ships, particularly in modern power plants may contribute to overcoming the above problems. The present paper considers the possibility of the use of hydrogen fuel for marine applications and discusses different stages of hydrogen gas cycle beginning with hydrogen generation process from clean energy until using it as fuel for internal combustion engines on-board one RO/RO ship, named Taba, operating in the Mediterranean Sea. Compared to the diesel engine, the hydrogen fuelled engine is found to be lower in thermal efficiency and fuel consumption, however, some adjustments are needed. © 2015 Brodarski Institute.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to separate CO2from the rest of the flue gas. The main disadvantage of these techniques is the large amount of energy that is required for the separation, which means a relative reduction of the overall efficiency of a power plant. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a new developing clean-combustion technology that has the advantage of inherent CO2separation ability. Thus, storage-ready, concentrated CO2can be obtained without the use of above-mentioned energy-intensive separation operations. This process involves two separate reactors, i.e., an air and a fuel reactor, and an oxygen carrier material which circulates between the reactors in order to extract and transport oxygen from air to fuel for many cycles. It is essential for oxygen carrier to be reactive, cheap to prepare, and durable over many cycles of reduction and oxidation at high reaction temperatures. Because of its good thermodynamical properties, physical strength, low cost, and low toxicity, iron oxide is a good candidate to be an oxygen carrier in CLC. This study will present a brief summary of developments obtained via CLC processes utilizing iron oxides as oxygen carrier. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Chemical looping combustion; CO2capture; CO2emission; Oxygen carrier","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fuels; Iron; Oxygen; Separation; Chemical looping combustion; Chemical-looping combustion process; Fossil fuel combustion; High reaction temperatures; Overall efficiency; Oxygen Carrier; Relative reduction; Thermodynamical properties; Iron oxides",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957054376

The head of the spermatozoon is spherical and contains the genomic material. Mitochondria and proximal and distal centrioles are located in the midpiece of the spermatozoon. The fl agellum consists of an axoneme with a “9 + 2” microtubule structure surrounded by a plasma membrane. The length of spermatozoa fl agella is between 30 and 35 ìm. The volume of sperm and spermatozoa concentration highly differs among species and individuals. Seminal plasma is composed of both mineral and organic compounds and has osmolality about 300 mOsmol kg 1 to maintain the spermatozoa in the quiescent state. A hypo-osmotic shock is required to trigger initiation of spermatozoa motility after discharge into an aquatic environment. The duration of sperm motility lasts from several seconds to a few minutes, however sperm motility kinetics (percentage of motile spermatozoa, spermatozoa velocity and beating frequency of fl agella) rapidly decrease after initiation of sperm motility due to rapid depletion of energy source required for the axonemal beating. The environmental osmolality, pH and ionic concentrations affect sperm motility kinetics. The highest percentage of spermatozoa motility and spermatozoa velocity are observed in an activation medium with osmolality of 100 mOSmol kg-1. There are various factors that affect semen quality in male broodfi sh including photoperiod and seasonal regimes, nutrition and antinutritional factors, rearing condition and age and size of broodfi sh. For short-term storage, it is essential to dilute semen in an ionic extender (300 mOsmol kg -1) with or without antibiotics.

While determining the installation power of the hybrid wind-solar power generation system, the regional wind-solar energy potential and the magnitude of demanded power were the most important factors. It was decided to supply 400 W of the total 500 W of electric power required by the lamp group used for illumination of the electric laboratory from solar panels and 100 W from a wind turbine according to the wind-solar energy potential of the region and the cost analysis. For the hybrid energy-generation system that was designed and installed, by considering the data for the annual mean sunshine period and wind speed, the most suitable system components and thus the installation cost were determined. The electric power generated by the hybrid wind-solar power generation system and the electric power consumed by the laboratory illumination elements supplied with this system during one year were compared. According to the 12-month measurement results for power generation and consumption in the installed system, it was observed that the generated electric power was higher than the consumed electric power. Consequently, by not paying the total electric bill for electric power consumed by the general illumination elements, use of it for other education expenses was made possible. Besides, the installation costs in Turkey were compared with those in the countries of Denmark, Germany, Spain, and Portugal, where two important components of the dimensioned and installed hybrid wind-solar power generation system-wind and solar energy-are used effectively.","Financial analysis; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Photovoltaic; Wind turbine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956626093

Hydrogen is nontoxic, not easily flammable and the products of oxygen water released during energy production are harmless to the natural environment. For pressurized tanks, the higher the pressure of the gas is, the smaller the tank volume needed, and the higher the operating cost. Safety regulations on high-pressure gas storage (including the compression process), utility, and transportation are strict, and complying with the regulations costs more than the hydrogen generators and storage equipment. Cryogenically cooling hydrogen into a liquid state is a well-established technology and considered the comparative benchmark for storing hydrogen. But the technology requires substantial energy to liquify the hydrogen, including continual “boil off”� of hydrogen during storage and it requires very costly storage tanks and handling. Chemical or physically combined storage of hydrogen in other materials has potential advantages over other storage methods. Intensive research has been done on metal hydrides recently for improvement of hydrogenation properties. Metal-hydride-based chemical hydride and rechargeable hydride technologies offer storage efficiency and storage safety while providing the cost-saving advantage of being able to use the existing fossil fuel infrastructure to deliver and store a pumpable and nonexplosive hydride slurry as future hydrogen fuels.

Losses of gasoline when moving from producer to consumer are 1.5–2%. Up to 40% of the hydrocarbons emitted by road transport evaporate from the fuel systems of cars with gasoline engines. In the context of the global problem of depleting energy resources and the associated degradation of the environment the reduction of gasoline losses from evaporation remains an important environmental and economic issue. The aim of this work is to validate a method of reducing evaporation loss by modifying the quality of the fuel being used. An approach to assessing the toxicity of gasoline vapor has been proposed which may point to the effect that the individual components of gasoline have on this. A method has been developed to reduce evaporation loss and also improve the mixture in the engine by introducing a fuel additive which is a surface-active agent. The additive reduces the vapor pressure of gasoline while also reducing the surface tension of the fuel droplets at the interface with air. The results from studies on the additive’s effect on the saturated vapor pressure, surface tension, and gasoline evaporation losses are given. © 2015 WIT Press.","Evaporation losses; Gasoline additive; Relative toxicity index; Saturated vapor pressure; Surface-active agent","Energy resources; Engines; Evaporation; Exhaust gases; Fuel systems; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Hydrostatic pressure; Surface active agents; Surface tension; Urban transportation; Vapor pressure; Economic issues; Evaporation loss; Gasoline engines; Gasoline hydrocarbon; Gasoline vapors; Global problems; Individual components; Saturated vapor pressure; Fuel additives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954558787

Measures to enhance the heat storage capacity of the water tank will thus be beneficial to the overall performance of SEHRAC. But virtually none has been done to date. For achieving this objective, the use of PCM (phase change material) in the water tank was proposed in this study. A prototype SEHRAC integrated with an expanded graphite/paraffin composite PCM was designed and setup in a test facility for laboratory experiments. Two identical sets of experiments with and without the use of PCM (wPCM and woPCM scenarios) under a range of outdoor temperature conditions were conducted.

The application includes molecular separation, sensing, energy storage and template synthesis for various nanostructures. The reason AAO is preferred was because of the ability to control the nanopore structure by manipulating some factors during the anodisation process. This study will investigate the exploitation of voltage and anodisation time during the anodisation process and the effect it has on the nanopore structure of the AAO by examining the structure under Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). The experiment was carried out by anodizing aluminum foil in 0.3 M oxalic acid as electrolyte under the constant temperature of 5 oC. The applied voltage was varied from 40, 60 and 100 V with different anodisation time. The outcome of this study demonstrates that applied voltage has a proportional relationship with the developed pore size. Increasing the applied voltage from 40 to 100 V had increased the pore size of the AAO from 38 nm to 186 nm, respectively. Aluminium oxide anodized at 60 V demonstrates pore size in the range of 76 nm. Prolong anodisation time had improved the pore morphology of anodized aluminium oxide in the case of 40 V, however, the pore wall starts to collapse when anodisation time is more than 4 minutes at 100 V. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Anodisation; Anodized aluminum oxide (AAO); Nanopore","Alumina; Electrolytes; Functional materials; Metallurgy; Nanopores; Oxalic acid; Pore size; Scanning electron microscopy; Anodisation; Anodisation process; Anodized aluminium oxides; Anodized aluminum oxide; Constant temperature; Field emission scanning electron microscopes; Molecular separation; Proportional relationships; Aluminum oxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954449404

This is quite useful in transmitting data over a noisy channel or when retrieving data from a storage with possible physical defects. The idea is to use a set of code words that are maximally distant from each other, hence reducing the chance of changing a valid codeword to another valid codeword by flipping bits. The problem can be viewed as picking m codes out of 2n available nbit combinations, such that the aggregate hamming distance among those codewords is maximized. Due to the large solution spaces of such problems, greedy algorithms are sometimes used to generate quick and dirty solutions. However, modern evolutionary search algorithms like genetic algorithms, swarm particles, gravitational search and others, offer good alternatives, yielding near optimal solutions in exchange for some time. Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) has emerged as a new evolutionary algorithm to solve complex optimization problems. This algorithm mimics the molecular interactions towards finding a minimal energy state, which corresponds to an optimal solution for the problem in hand. In this research, we proposed a solution for the maximally distant codes allocation problem, through a binary knapsack mapping and compared the performance with the well established Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, which is inspired by the ant's capability to find the shortest path between the nest and source of food. The binary knapsack mapping was used in the two algorithms. Test results showed that the CRO outperformed the ACO in every metric given any time budget. © 2015 Taisir Eldos, Waleed Nazih and Aws Kanan.","Ant colony optimization; Chemical reaction optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Maximally distant codes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954202208

One prominent CCS technology, the amine-based post-combustion process, may generate nitrosamines and their related nitramines as by-products, the former well known for their potential mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. In order to efficiently assess the carcinogenic potency of any of these by-products this paper reviews and discusses novel prediction approaches consuming less time, money and animals than the traditionally applied 2-year rodent assay. For this, available animal carcinogenicity studies with N-nitroso compounds and nitramines have been used to derive carcinogenic potency values, that were subsequently used to assess the predictive performance of alternative prediction approaches for these chemicals. Promising cancer prediction models are the QSARs developed by the Helguera group, in vitro transformation assays, and the in vivo initiation-promotion, and transgenic animal assays. All these models, however, have not been adequately explored for this purpose, as the number of N-nitroso compounds investigated is yet too limited, and therefore further testing with relevant N-nitroso compounds is needed. © 2015.

This paper reviewed major point sources of CO2 emissions at all stages of cement manufacturing, including (1) raw material preparation (grinding and transportation), (2) clinker production and the combustion of fuels in the kiln and (3) the production of cement final product (milling, blending, mixing, packaging and transportation. Various CO2 mitigation strategies are subsequently discussed, including (1) energy efficiency improvements; (2) waste heat recovery; (3) the substitution of fossil fuel with renewable energy; (4) the production of low carbon cement by replacing ordinary Portland cement with alternative materials, i.e., geo-polymers, blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, and natural pozzolanic materials; and (5) carbon capture and storage.

In order to lower the energy threshold of the electron detection the authors applied radiators with the highest values of the refractive index. Different radiator materials, such as aluminium nitride and CVD diamond were applied. Several versions of measuring heads and different manipulators, e.g., a movable vacuum-tight shaft or a fast-moving reciprocating probe, were manufactured and used. The practical application of the Cherenkov probes required also a consideration of spectral characteristics of optical fibres and photomultipliers. The Cherenkov radiation, as generated inside the radiators, is lead out through separate fibres (optical cables) to the atmospheric pressure side. The emitted radiation in the blue (near ultraviolet) spectrum range should be collected and delivered through appropriate optical cables to a control room, amplified within photomultipliers and recorded in a digital form. In order to investigate an electron energy distribution the multi-channel probes have also been designed and applied. © 2015 SPIE.","Cherenkov effect; Electron beams; Plasma diagnostics; Tokamak plasma","Atmospheric pressure; Cables; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electron beams; Electron energy levels; Electrons; Magnetoplasma; Optical cables; Optical data storage; Optical fibers; Photomultipliers; Plasma diagnostics; Probes; Radiators; Refractive index; Signal processing; Tokamak devices; Cherenkov effect; Cherenkov radiations; Data storage systems; Electron energy distributions; Reciprocating probes; Signal acquisitions; Spectral characteristics; Tokamak plasmas; High energy physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951326074

The greenhouse needs to be maintained at a constant temperature of 20°C at all time. The goal of this study is to select a suitable TES system that can save the annual cost of electricity usage to meet the cooling load requirement of the greenhouse, based on a 24 hours operating duration and local electricity tariff. Comparison is made with the annual cost for running a conventional air-conditioning (AC) system to meet the cooling requirement. The cooling load requirement of the greenhouse dictates the capacity and size of the potential TES systems, which was estimated based on the highest total annual cooling load. Three TES system operating arrangements were considered in this study: TES full storage combined with AC systems, TES full storage and TES partial storage. Among these three arrangements, the TES full storage was found to have the highest an annual cost saving of about RM 58,990 compared to the cost of using the conventional AC system alone. This represents about 68 % of annual operating cost saving, which is considered very significant. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Many farmers rely on diesel engines to power their milk chillers. A sustainable approach is to replace the environmentally harmful diesel generators with solar powered chillers. Solar energy is attractive in such application because the peak cooling demand occurs at the peak solar irradiance. Solar energy can be converted to cooling through PV powered chiller or through thermally driven chillers. This concept was applied to a Modular Solar Bulk Milk Chiller (MilkPod™) which uses the solar energy to generate electricity in 6 kWp PV panels. The system cools 600 liters of milk per day as well as produces hot water for cleaning the milk tank. A detailed model was used in the design process and the system equipment were selected such that the system uses about 98% of its energy from the sun throughout the year. The effect of the solar energy utilization ratio, equipment supplied current as well as milk loading were investigated on the system performance.

The aim of this review is to describe the role of PPARs in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and obesity and evaluate the zebrafish as an emerging vertebrate model to study the function of PPARs. Zebrafish are an appropriate model to study human diseases, including obesity and related metabolic diseases, as pathways important for adipogenesis and lipid metabolism which are conserved between mammals and fish. This review synthesizes knowledge on the role of PPARs in zebrafish and focuses on the putative function of PPARs in zebrafish adipogenesis. Using in silico analysis, we confirm the presence of five PPARs (pparaa, pparab, pparda, ppardb, and pparg) in the zebrafish genome with 67-74% identity to human and mouse PPARs. During development, pparda/b paralogs and pparg show mRNA expression around the swim bladder and pancreas, the region where adipocytes first develop, whereas pparg is detectable in adipocytes at 15 days post fertilization (dpf).

For a standard flat-plate design, energy gain can be increased by expanding the thermal absorber area along the collector plane, subject to area limitation. This paper focuses on the staging effect of a metal hollow square rod absorber of aluminium, stainless steel, and a combination of the two with a cross design, for the heat gain and temperature characteristics of a solar air collector. Experiments were carried out with three cross design set-ups, with 30 minutes of heating and cooling, phase, respectively, under 485 W/m2 solar irradiance value, and at a constant air speed at 0.38 m/s. One-set aluminium set-up delivered the highest output temperature of 41.8 °C, followed by two-sets aluminium and one aluminium set + one stainless steel set at 39.3 °C and 38.2°C, respectively. The lowest peak temperature is recorded on three sets of the aluminium absorber at 35 °C. The bi-metallic set-up performed better than the two aluminium set-up where each set-up obtained a temperature drop against heat gain gradient value of -0.4186 °C/W and -0.4917 °C/W, respectively. Results concluded that by increasing the number of sets, the volume and surface areas of the absorber material are also increased, and lead to a decrease in peak temperature output for each increase of sets. © 2015, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences.

An ESU directly coupled to the cold source acts as a thermal buffer temporarily increasing its cooling capacity and providing a better thermal stability of the cold finger (""Power Booster mode""). The energy storage units presented here use an enthalpy reservoir based on the high latent heat of the liquid-vapour transition of neon in the temperature range 38 - 44 K to store up to 900 J, and that uses a 6 liters expansion volume at room temperature in order to work as a closed system. Experimental results in the power booster mode are described: in this case, the liquid neon cell was directly coupled to the cold finger of the working cryocooler, its volume (≈12 cm3) allowing it to store 450 J at around 40 K. 10 W heat bursts were applied, leading to liquid evaporation, with quite reduced temperature changes. The liquid neon reservoir can also work as a temporary cold source to be used after stopping the cryocooler, allowing for a vibration-free environment. In this case the enthalpy reservoir implemented (≈24 cm3) was linked to the cryocooler cold finger through a gas-gap heat switch for thermal coupling/decoupling of the cold finger. We show that, by controlling the enthalpy reservoir's pressure, 900 Jcan be stored at a constant temperature of 40 K as in a triple-point ESU. © 2015 The Authors.","Heat Switch; Liquid Neon; Temperature Stabilization; Thermal Storage","Cold working; Cooling; Cryogenic equipment; Energy storage; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Liquids; Storage (materials); Thermodynamic stability; Constant temperature; Energy storage unit; Heat switches; Liquid neon; Temperature changes; Temperature fluctuation; Temperature stabilization; Thermal storage; Cryogenics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948442840

The gaseous helium is stored in steel tanks under a pressure of about 20 bar and at environment temperature. Accidental rupture of any of the tanks filled with the gaseous helium will create a rapid energy release in form of physical blast. An estimation of pressure wave distribution following the tank rupture and potential consequences to the adjacent research infrastructure and buildings is a very important task, critical in the safety aspect of the whole cryogenic system. According to the present regulations the TNT equivalent approach is to be applied to evaluate the pressure wave following a potential gas storage tank rupture. A special test stand was designed and built in order to verify experimentally the blast effects in controlled conditions. In order to obtain such a shock wave a pressurized plastic tank was used. The tank was ruptured and the resulting pressure wave was recorded using a spatially-distributed array of pressure sensors connected to a high-speed data acquisition device. The results of the experiments and the comparison with theoretical values obtained from thermodynamic model of the blast are presented. A good agreement between the simulated and measured data was obtained. Recommendations regarding the applicability of thermodynamic model of physical blast versus TNT approach, to estimate consequences of gas storage tank rupture are formulated.

Moreover, the development and extension of fracture process zone (FPZ) ahead of the initial crack tip, is analysed by means of digital image correlation (DIC) and embedded fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. From FBG spectral response, the spectrum geometric mean is determined and the strain induced by wavelength variation employed to identify the initial and final stages of the FPZ. These stages are used to consistently define the cohesive laws in both modes I and II. Resistance-curves are determined from the compliance-based beam method (CBBM). Besides, the crack tip opening displacements (CTOD) are determined by post-processing displacement field provided by DIC around the initial crack tip. The strain energy release rate as a function of the CTOD are then determined for both mode I and mode II. The respective cohesive laws are reconstructed by numerical approximation and differentiation. It is concluded that the proposed data reduction scheme is effective to determine both the FPZ development phase and the corresponding cohesive laws of wood bonded joints in both mode I and mode II. © 2015 Sociedade Portuguesa de Materiais (SPM).

Their primary function is to facilitate the bidirectional transfer of water and small solutes across biological membranes in response to osmotic gradients. Aquaglyceroporins, a subset of the AQP family, are the only mammalian proteins with the ability to permeate glycerol. For a long time, AQP7 has been the only aquaglyceroporin associated with the adipose tissue, which is the major source of circulating glycerol in response to the energy demand. AQP7 dysregulation was positively correlated with obesity onset and adipocyte glycerol permeation through AQP7 was appointed as a novel regulator of adipocyte metabolism and whole-body fat mass. Recently, AQP3, AQP9, AQP10 and AQP11 were additionally identified in human adipocytes and proposed as additional glycerol pathways in these cells. This review contextualizes the importance of aquaglyceroporins in adipose tissue biology and highlights aquaglyceroporins' unique structural features which are relevant for the design of effective therapeutic compounds. We also refer to the latest advances in the identification and characterization of novel aquaporin isoforms in adipose tissue. Finally, considerations on the actual progress of aquaporin research and its implications on obesity therapy are suggested. © 2014 Springer Basel.","Adipocyte; Aquaporin; Diabetes; Membrane permeability; Obesity","aquaglyceroporin; aquaporin; aquaporin; aquaporin 10; aquaporin 11; aquaporin 3; aquaporin 7; aquaporin 9; glycerol; isoprotein; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adipose tissue; Aqp7 gene; cell membrane permeability; chemistry; gene expression regulation; human; human; lipid storage; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; obesity; pathology; protein determination; Review; structure analysis; tissue metabolism; upregulation; Adipose Tissue; Aquaporins; Cell Membrane Permeability; chemistry; chemistry; Humans; metabolism; metabolism; metabolism; metabolism; Obesity; pathology; Protein Isoforms; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946893844

These conclusions are supported by conductivity and dispersion stability data. Moreover, since zinc is an earth abundant metal, these complexes can be used as components in sustainable energy storage materials. Binding kinetics and binding equilibrium data are presented. Modeling of the adsorption isotherm is best fit with the BET model. Kinetics data support an independent binding model.

Rice culture also produces big amounts of polyethylene (PE) bags used in rice packs and for seeds and fertilizer storage that usually end up in landfills, due to their degree of contamination. The energetic valorisation of these wastes may be accomplished by different processes, co-gasification is one of the most viable, as it leads to the production of a synthetic gaseous mixture (bio-syngas) that can be used for energy production to be used during rice milling processes. Gasification of rice husks has some challenges, due to these wastes high content of silica and alkali metals that lead to the formation of solids with lower melting point, thus, leading to bed agglomeration that causes reactor erosion and serious damage. PE has lower ash content and much higher energetic content than rice husks. However, PE polymeric structure may lead to the formation of higher tar contents, which compromise most gasification gas utilisations. Co-gasification of PE and rice husks allows taking advantages of each waste favourable characteristic, diluting the unsuitable features. Co-gasification of these wastes was done in presence of steam blended with air or oxygen. Steam promoted the gasification reactions and favoured H2 production. Air or oxygen promoted the partial oxidation of the feedstocks to be co-gasified and supplied the energy necessary for the endothermic gasification reactions. The use of air has a low cost, but has the great disadvantage of diluting the bio-syngas produced, thus lowering its energetic content. On the other hand, the use of oxygen solves the problems related to gas dilution with nitrogen, but increases the operating cost. Bio-syngas composition obtained by co-gasification trials done with air enriched with different oxygen contents was compared with those obtained with air or pure oxygen to determine the best approach considering both the technical and economical sustainability.

With this motivation, here we report on the fabrication and characterization of all-organic multichromatic electrodes for supercapacitors. A new conducting polymer (CP) has emergedas a promising active material both for its electrochromic and electrochemical properties combined in a single device, where single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) thin films are used as the current collectors. CP experiences reversible and rapid multiple color changes with respect to its charged state. The specific capacitance of the SWNT/CP nanocomposite electrodes was found to be 112.4 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The power density can reach 16.6 kW/kg and electrodes show good capacity retention (82%) upon cycling for 12500 times. Fabricated all-organic supercapacitor electrodes simply integrate electrochromism and energy storage in one device and this structure holds high potential for the development of smart supercapacitors. © 2015 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Capacitors; Carbon; Carbon films; Carbon nanotubes; Conducting polymers; Conductive films; Electric batteries; Electrochromism; Electrodes; End effectors; Energy storage; Heat resistance; Polymer films; Presses (machine tools); Secondary batteries; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Yarn; Current collector; Electrochromic supercapacitors; Electrochromics; Fabrication and characterizations; Good capacity retentions; Nanocomposite electrodes; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946025601

Smart Grid is an efficient, user-friendly solution to today’s energy management and generation problem. However, Smart Grid introduces many privacy issues that do not exist in traditional grids. For example, with Smart Grid it is possible to obtain consumers’ daily life patterns from their energy usage data. In this paper, we tackle with this problem and propose a novel privacy-preserving communication protocol. The proposed protocol is based on time perturbation and Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) scheme. In the proposed protocol, consumption reports are generated by smart meters and sent to a data collection center using Laplace Distribution based time perturbation. In addition, SSS is employed to prevent attacks during multi-hop data transmission. The time perturbation prevents malicious users to see the actual data while it is stored in the data center.

One of the methods for recovering methane from gas hydrates involves injection of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), causing the dissociation of methane and storing CO2. The occurrence of gas hydrates offshore Portugal is well known associated to mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. This article presents a determination of the areas with conditions for the formation of biogenic gas hydrates in Portugal's mainland geological continental margin and assesses their overlap with CO2 hydrates stability zones defined in previous studies. The gas hydrates stability areas are defined using a transfer function recently published by other authors and takes into account the sedimentation rate, the particulate organic carbon content and the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone. An equilibrium equation for gas hydrates, function of temperature and pressure, was adjusted using non-linear regression and the maximum stability zone thickness was found to be 798 m. The gas hydrates inventory was conducted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and a full compaction scenario was adopted, with localized vertical flow assumed in the accrecionary wedge where mud volcanoes occur. Four areas where temperature and pressure conditions may exist for formation of gas hydrates were defined at an average of 60 km from Portugal's mainland coastline. Two of those areas coincide with CO2 hydrates stability areas previously defined and should be the subject of further research to evaluate the occurrence of gas hydrate and the possibility of its recovery coupled with CO2 storage in sub-seabed sediments. © 2015 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; CO2 storage; Gas hydrates; Portugal; Seabed sediments","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gases; Hydration; Methane; Offshore gas wells; Offshore oil wells; Organic carbon; Proven reserves; Recovery; Sediments; Stability; Volcanoes; Climate change mitigation; CO2 storage; Gas hydrate stability zones; Non-linear regression; Particulate organic carbon; Portugal; Seabed sediments; Temperature and pressures; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945246766

These fluids can be processed to recover valuable metals such as gold, silver, zinc, and lithium. Interest and demand in lithium (Li) sources have increased in recent years. This is, in part, due to the wide applications of Li and its compounds in high-energy storage Li batteries, and in other technological fields, e.g., nuclear energy systems. Moreover, the costs associated with resource extraction from geothermal fluids are believed to be relatively low, and therefore many possible recovery techniques have been suggested. Lithium is one of the metals that dominate Na-Cl type of geothermal fluids in Turkey with its potential value. This article presents lithium concentrations of selected geothermal waters in Turkey and compares different methods that can be used to recover Li from them. Specifically, three methods will be discussed including direct precipitation as Li salts, separation by membrane filter and captured form through ion exchange resins.

Difficulties in hydrogen storage and production limit its use in internal combustion engines. This paper investigates the performance of a spark ignition engine with the addition of a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) into the intake manifold. Hydrogen is produced by an alkaline electrolyser and consumed simultaneously to eliminate the need for a storage device. Flow rates of 0 and 10 L/min H2-O2mixture were introduced into the manifold. No flow, or 0 L/min, refers to the case without hydrogen, and 10 L/min represents the case with hydrogen. Brake torque, fuel consumption, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and total unburned hydrocarbons were measured. The results show that brake power, brake torque, and nitrogen oxide emissions increased with the addition of H2-O2, while total unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide emissions, and brake-specific energy consumption decreased. © 2015, Gh.

It is widely used despite its relatively high cost because it performs better in certain critical applications than its alternatives. The beryllium industry produces three primary forms of beryllium: copper-beryllium alloy is the largest, followed by pure beryllium metal and beryllium oxide ceramics.As a result of the increasing industrial use of beryllium, occupational exposure to the metal may be an important issue. Prior to 1950 when exposure levels of ≤2μg/m3 were mandated by the Atomic Energy Commission, beryllium levels were very high. The estimated daily weighted average beryllium exposure levels for some workers in a plant that extracted and produced beryllium metal were 1000μg/m3 in the 1940s and 1950s, &gt;50μg/m3 during the mid-1960s, and &gt;30μg/m3 during the mid-1970s. At present, the time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations are in the range of 0.01-1μg/m3.Exposures to beryllium are much more hazardous by the inhalation route than by the ingestion route. Beryllium and its compounds are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In general, inhalation exposure to beryllium compounds results in the long-term storage of appreciable amounts of beryllium in lung tissue, particularly in pulmonary lymph nodes, and in the skeleton, which is the ultimate site of beryllium storage. Urinary beryllium concentrations are below the detection limits of 0.03-0.06. μg/L.Exposure to beryllium compounds has caused dermatitis, acute pneumoconiosis, and chronic beryllium disease (CBD, chronic pulmonary granulomatosis, berylliosis). Exposure to soluble beryllium salts may cause skin reactions such as edematous, erythematous, and papulovesicular dermatitis. These changes usually disappear after the cessation of exposure. Granulomatous necrotic changes and ulcerations due to skin penetration by insoluble beryllium salts were also observed. These pathological changes are based on delayed allergic hypersensitivity. Acute toxicity of beryllium at concentrations usually above 25μg/m3 is manifested by skin, eye, nose, and throat irritation, followed by upper and lower airway inflammation, pulmonary edema, and (above 100μg/m3) chemical pneumonitis.CBD is the best-known negative health effect caused by exposure to beryllium. CBD is a T cell-mediated disorder. Beryllium, acting as a hapten, interacts with antigen-presenting cells in the lungs. The beryllium blood lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) is used as a medical surveillance tool for the assessment of persons at risk of developing clinical and subclinical CBD. It is generally accepted that sensitization occurs among a subset of workers. Several reports suggest that sensitization and CBD were associated with beryllium air TWA levels exceeding 0.2μg/m3. A threshold limit value (TLV)-TWA of 0.05μg/m3 recommended in 2008 by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists is expected to be protective for the beryllium-sensitive population.An excess incidence of lung cancer was found in populations occupationally exposed to beryllium, and was higher for individuals with acute beryllium disease than those with CBD. In their carcinogenicity rating, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 1993, 2012) classified beryllium as a group 1 substance (i.e. sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in humans). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inhalation unit risk is 2.4×10×3 per μg/m3. In general, it seems that the lung cancer risk related to occupational exposure to beryllium is linked to the higher exposure levels that were associated with acute beryllium pneumonitis and predominated prior to the 1950s. The risk of additional lung cancer caused by 40 years of occupational exposure to beryllium or its compounds at the present TLV-TWA of 0.05μg/m3 amounts to 1.5×10-5. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For this reason, methyl methacrylate was copolymerized with acrylic acid at three different ratios.

In both parts to respond to the extreme hot water demanding conditions, the heating is always on. The subsequent exergy analysis of this domestic hot water production system compares the irreversibility and the exergy efficiency of the water storage and the tankless situation. To carry out such analysis, some basic assumptions were made: a constant temperature heat source, a short duration operating cycle and a constant thermal energy supply. Under these circumstances it is shown that the hot water storage system leads to lower exergy losses while the tankless system is more exergy efficient, but requiring a higher instantaneous thermal power input. The use of the joule effect electricity, as the system heat source, be it a water storage one or a tankless one, maximizes the system irreversibility losses and minimizes the system exergy efficiency. The tankless system, with the joule effect electricity heat source is the worst situation. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Domestic hot water; Energy; Exergy; Tankless system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943522917

Since DCs are infrastructures that have large energy consumption, there is a need to change their design approach to make them more efficient and more environment friendly. This research was motivated by the planning of a new DC in Portugal. It proposes a multi-criteria framework to assess the sustainability of a DC, which includes a newmetric to evaluate the DC efficiency taking into account the environmental conditions of the DC location. ELECTRE TRI was chosen for aggregating different metrics concerning the environmental sustainability of a DC into sustainability categories. The evaluation methodology allows some freedom for each DC to place more weight on the aspects in which it is stronger, an analysis facilitated by the IRIS decision support system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943397725

Microsupercapacitors in particular have gained much attention in recent years owing to their ability to provide high pulse power while maintaining long cycle lives. Carbon microelectromechanical systems (C-MEMS) is a powerful approach to fabricate high aspect ratio carbon microelectrode arrays, which has been proved to hold great promise as a platform for energy storage. C-MEMS is a versatile technique to create carbon structures by pyrolyzing a patterned photoresist. Furthermore, different active materials can be loaded onto these microelectrode platforms for further enhancement of the electrochemical performance of the C-MEMS platform. In this article, different techniques and methods in order to enhance C-MEMS based various electrochemical capacitor systems have been discussed, including electrochemical activation of C-MEMS structures for miniaturized supercapacitor applications, integration of carbon nanostructures like carbon nanotubes onto C-MEMS structures and also integration of pseudocapacitive materials such as polypyrrole onto C-MEMS structures. © 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The OLT buoy was contracted for the Cravo, Lirio, Orquidea, Violeta (CLOV) Field Development Project, located offshore Block 17 in Angola, about one nautical mile from the Floating Production Storage & Offloading (FPSO) unit. The preferred way for offloading will be through the Oil Loading System (OLS), comprising of two Oil Offloading Lines (OOLs), two Fibre Optic Cables (FOCs) and one OLT. Bluewater Energy Services BV entered into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for the OLT buoy including mooring lines, mooring hawser system, floating hose system and suction piles. During the execution of the work, the key technical challenges may be summarized as follows: Theimpact of the deep water environment (ranging from 1,100 to 1,400 meters) on specific mechanical equipment. The design of the double pivoting chain stoppers, extensively tested at full scale. The interface with the Oil Offloading Lines (OOL) resulting in two large steel structures (the OOL receptacles) underneath the bottom plate of the buoy body. This in combination with the available lifting capacity at the fabrication yard in Angola, imposed limitations on the way the OLT buoy could be placed into the water.

The experimental procedure involves two complementary techniques: i.e. infrared thermography (IRT) and visible light imaging. The results of experiments have shown that during the evolution of plastic strain localization the energy storage rate in some areas of the deformed specimen drops to zero. To interpret the decrease of the energy storage rate in terms of micro-mechanisms, microstructural observations using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSC) were performed.

Moreover, the chemical bonding structures of these eutectic PCMs show no degradation and the thermal performance of those PCMs shows a good stability after 3600 thermal cycles.

The TiO2 nanotube array overgrown by boron-doped diamond immersed in 0.1 M NaNO3 can deliver high specific capacitance of 7.46 mF cm-2. The composite electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The depth-resolved investigations reveal that the primary anatase structure of TiO2 NTs was partially transformed into Ti2O3 and non-stoichiometric TiC fractions. The explanation for this effect is the decomposing of TiO2 NTs in the presence of activated hydrogen and carbon in the plasma leading to enhanced dehydration of NTs and carbon bonding originating from dissociated methane. This phenomena description fits also to processes demonstrated at hydrogenated TiO2 (H-TiO2) nanotube arrays used as electrode material for supercapacitors.

Signal of charging and discharging from the battery is translated into time-frequency representation (TFR) to estimate the signal parameters. The signal parameters are such as instantaneous of voltage root mean square, voltage direct current and voltage alternating current. Then, characteristics of the Ni-MH battery is calculated based on the signal parameters. This analysis focuses on Ni-MH battery with nominal voltage of 6 and 12V and their storage capacities from 5 to 50Ah, respectively.

Energy properties of fine-grained coal waste result from the contents and quality of the occurring coal maceral as well as water and mineral components' contents. The simplest way to increase the calorific value of coal sludge and floatation tailings is to lower their water and ash contents. The humidity of fine coal waste from current production is largely in uenced by the applied dewatering installations, where the filtration presses proved the most effective. The degree of hydration of coal sludge and floatation tailings from settling ponds depends on the time of their deposition and the construction of settling ponds as well as the way of their breaking and storing of the broken material. The fine-grained coal waste delivered to power stations can be characterized by the humidity of 14 to 45%. A significant quality improvement of fine coal waste materials was achieved through their granulation. The obtained granulated product can be characterized by its resistance to transport and storage conditions, it does not degrade in changing weather conditions and has better energy properties. By substituting sludge water pulp with sludge granulated product there can be obtained a unitary increase of combusted fuel net calorific value by about 2000 kJ/kg. The essential quality improvement of fine coal waste can be achieved by lowering their mineral components' contents. The easiest solution is a selective separation of water-sludge flows that are richest in coal from water-sludge circuit, and in the case of waste from storage yards, it is a selective deposit mining. The richest coal concentrates from coal sludge are obtained by separating a grain fraction over 30-50 μm. In the cases of application of dewatering vibration sieves with fabric diaphragms as well as arch sieves and centrifugal dewatering sieves, there were obtained coal concentrates of net calorific values in the range of 15 to 22 MJ/kg. In the deposition methods of water-sludge suspensions in settling ponds applied so far, the possibility of gravitational enrichment of water-sludge suspensions with coal grains has not been used. Through water-sludge suspensions' flow channeling in settling ponds, there can be obtained rich and very rich-in-coal grains deposit areas, not to mention more effective supernatant water cleaning. Floatation tailings' cleaning calls for different methods of separation, most of en based on specific gravity differences and/or surface properties of coal grains and mineral components. Most frequently constructed cleaning installations are based on technologies using hydrocyclones, heavy water, and floatation processes. These technologies make it possible to obtain the richest coal concentrates. The analysis of fine coal waste utilization leads to a conclusion that through cooperation of mining and power industries there can be created favorable conditions and possibilities for the improvement of both quantitative waste utilization and economic and ecological effects for the parties concerned.","Coal sludge; Coal sludge and floatation tailings' combustion; Fine (fine-grained) coal waste; Floatation tailings; Granulated coal sludge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940041802

Composites were prepared using the solution technique. The effects of filler addition and of filler-matrix interactions were investigated using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Only one relaxation was observed by DRS, which was associated with the relaxation of the main polymer chain. Both DRS and DMA demonstrated that the addition of the filler does not cause a significant change in either the temperature of the relaxation or its activation energy, which suggests the presence of weak interactions between the filler and matrix. The storage modulus of the composites increased with increasing filler content. The composite containing 8% filler exhibited a storage modulus increase of approximately 394% in the rubber area.

The heat flux and temperature distribution on individual component layers were recorded while changing the temperature conditions of the surrounding air.

Three distinct adipose depots have been identified: white, brown, and beige adipocytes. The process by which BAT can become beige is still unclear and is an area of intensive research.

To meet these requirements, without exceeding the tank materials safety limits, hydrogen precooling is needed. Filling experiments with different inlet gas temperatures and mass flow rates have been executed using two different types of on-board tanks (type 3 and 4). State of charge has a strong dependency on the inlet gas temperature. This dependency is more visible for type 4 tanks. Lowest precooling temperature (-40 °C) is not always required in order to meet user's requirements, so energy savings can be achieved if the initial conditions of the tank are correctly identified. The results of the experiments performed have been compared with the SAE J2601 look-up tables for non-communication fillings. A big safety margin has been observed in these tables. Refueling could be performed faster and with less demanding precooling requirements if the initial conditions and the configuration of the hydrogen storage system are well known.

Kinetic models of TBARS changes with respect to the temperature during storage were developed based on Arrhenius equation. The regression coefficients (R2 > 0.86) indicated the acceptability of the zero-order reaction and Arrhenius model for predicting TBARS changes. The activation energy (Ea) of TBARS was 109 kJ/mol and the corresponding rate constant (k0) was 2.6979 × 1018. External model validation was performed for the sausage stored at 12° C. A high correlation between the observed and modelled TBARS values as well as low RMSE level were obtained. The Baranyi model was fitted to the growth curves.

Therefore, the established models could effectively predict TBARS content and TVC growth in the emulsified pork sausages.","Arrhenius equation; Lipid oxidation; Microbiological quality; Square root model; TBARS","Activation energy; Emulsification; Food storage; Forecasting; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Rate constants; Arrhenius equation; Lipid oxidation; Microbiological quality; Square roots; TBARS; Meats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937898003

However, the formation mechanism of the nanopores and the subsequent pore growth process towards self-ordered pore arrangements have been under investigation for several decades without clear conclusions. The present models may be divided into two main groups in terms of the driving force for pore initialization, as well as the subsequent pore growth process. One group considers that the driving force is the high electric field across the oxide barrier layer at the bottom of the pore channels, which assists metal oxidation at the metal/oxide interface, and oxide dissolution at the oxide/electrolyte interface. The other group of models assumes that the driving force is mechanical stress originating from the volume expansion of the metal oxidation process. This chapter reviews the development of these models for nanoporous alumina formation, and discusses their advantages and shortcomings.

Comparisons between different materials and coatings were conducted in order to determine their impact in solar thermal absorber applications. Experiments were conducted on both materials with flat-black coated and non-coated surfaces of aluminum (6063) and stainless steel sets respectively. Both sets were exposed under 585 W/m2 radiation and the temperature response was recorded. A significant improvement was shown to result from the application of flat-black coating against non-coated material, with maximum temperatures of 67.2°C and 48.3°C respectively. It was observed that for the hollow square metal absorber the heating and cooling characteristics can be established by means of the relation between the surface and inner air temperatures of the absorber.

The method depends on the harvest cycle of the plants, availability of necessary machines and the expected use of harvested raw material. Methods of harvesting influence on biomass quality during its acquisition and further in the storage period. Therefore, the aim of the research was to characterize the harvest of willow plantation with the use of a biobaler WB 55 and to assess the quality of the obtained biomass during the 9-month period of its storage. Willow was harvested with biobaler WB 55 in January 2010 on a commercial plantation. The 3.5 ha plantation was situated in the north-east of Poland, in the village of Dorotowo (53°42′9.88″ N 20°25′11.02″ E). An analysis of the biomass quality in terms of its thermophysical and chemical properties was carried out at the laboratory of the Department of Plant Breeding and Seed Production of the UWM in Olsztyn. Willow harvesting with a unit consisting of a 129 kW tractor and biobaler WB 55 was conducted efficiently. The average harvesting efficiency was about 18 bales per hour of the unit operation (8.75 Mg h-1 FM). The fresh matter density in the bales averaged 358.10 kg m-3 FM, whereas in dry matter it was 166.16 kg m-3 DM. With extended duration of storage, the quality of willow biomass as an energy raw material improved. The biomass in the bales steadily lost its moisture, from 53.06% in January to 17.48% in September. On the other hand, the lower heating value increased during that same period from 7.75 MJ kg-1 to 15.65 MJ kg-1. It has been found based on the observations made during the study period that the advantages of a biobaler WB 55 are the easy and efficient harvesting of plants on a plantation and bales can be used for energy production as needed. © 2015, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

The identified IMC phases are mainly CuAl2, CuAl and Cu9Al4, whereas the other three phases which are less reported are Cu4Al3, Cu3Al2 and Cu3Al. The reliability risk of Cu-Al IMC is commonly known, with the degradation of voids or crack propagation from ball periphery to internal ball bond direction after long duration of annealing. However, the cause of the degradation is not well established. This paper will focus on the study of the degradation of Cu-Al IMC layers with and without the presence of a mold compound by using ex-situ post annealing and in-situ annealing method on the same assembled sample. The ex-situ post annealing sample is studied using focus ion beam (FIB) after the molded sample had underwent a standard High Temperature Storage (HTS) at 150 °C for 1000 h. The in-situ annealing sample is studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on a lamella with Cu-Al interface but without the presence of a mold compound. The result shows that the IMC formed are identified as CuAl2, CuAl and Cu9Al4 via Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDX). These IMC are seen to grow increasingly with the duration of annealing process for both methods. The native Al oxide lines are seen for both methods and were embedded in between the IMC. The degradation starts at the ball periphery with cracks and voids at IMC are seen for the ex-situ postannealing sample but it is not observed under in-situ annealing sample. It is found that the degradation of the IMC is not caused by propagation of microcrack; instead it is assumed to be the influence of additive within the mold compound itself. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, because of time-critical tasks of applications, one of the new challenges faced in WSNs is to handle real-time data storage and query. Since in such networks energy is the crucial resource, it is challenging to design a query processing mechanism that meets both time constraints and energy. This paper addresses this challenge and proposes a new architecture that combines statistical modelling techniques with the distributed approach and a query processing algorithm to optimise the real-time user query processing. Such statistical model provides good approximate answers of queries with a given probabilistic confidence. This combination allows performing a query processing algorithm based on admission control that uses the error tolerance and the probabilistic confidence interval as admission parameters. The experiments based on real world as well as synthetic data sets demonstrate that the proposed solution optimises the real-time query processing to save more energy while meeting time constraints.

At microbiological level, storage at 25 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C, showed no effect on microbial growth at 25 MPa reaching levels similar to atmospheric pressure storage, around 5 log CFU/g for both total aerobic mesophiles (TAM) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Nevertheless, the storage at 50 MPa and 30 °C resulted in microbial growth inhibition, resulting in TAM and LAB counts similar to refrigeration, of about 3.8 log CFU/g for both the microorganisms. Additionally, the increase of the storage pressure to 100-150 MPa resulted in microbial inactivation, leading to microbial loads of almost 1 log CFU/g lower than refrigeration. In general, hyperbaric stored sliced cooked ham showed physicochemical parameters similar to the refrigerated samples. In conclusion, these results show that HS at uncontrolled (naturally variable room temperature conditions at 25-37 °C) is a promising alternative to refrigeration for cooked ham preservation. To this new preservation technology, no energetic costs are associated throughout storage, compared to refrigeration, needing only energy to generate the pressure and decompress, since no energy is required to maintain the pressure. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Cooked ham; Hyperbaric storage; Microbial growth inhibition; preservation; Refrigeration","Aerobic bacteria; Atmospheric pressure; Lactic acid; Meats; Refrigeration; Wood preservation; Cooked ham; Lactic acid bacteria; Microbial growth; Microbial inactivation; Physicochemical parameters; Preservation technologies; Refrigerated storages; Room-temperature conditions; Food storage; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931270863

Pipeline transport is the most economical solution when it comes to transporting large quantities of CO2 over moderate distances. CO2 compression differs from most fuid compression tasks due to the high molecular weight, highly compressible behavior and the presence of the so called critical point. At the critical point, the difference between the liquid and the gaseous fuid phase disappears. Technically, CO2 can be transported by pipelines in the form of gas, a supercritical fuid or in the subcooled liquid state. In this work, the CO2 working area was assumed to be either in the liquid or in the supercritical state and results for these two states were compared. It is most cost-effective if CO2 is in the dense phase i.e. under the liquid or supercritical regime (Fig. 2.1). This is due to the lower friction drop along the pipeline per unit mass of CO2 compared to transmitting CO2 as a gas or as a two-phase gas/liquid combination. The commercially available ASPEN PLUS simulation tool with a pipe model was used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distances to subsequent booster stations as a function of carbon dioxide inlet pressure, ambient temperature and the ground level heat fux parameters under three conditions: isothermal, adiabatic and with heat transfer. In the following discussion, the same power station data will be used as reported in Chap. 3: a 900 MW pulverized coal-fred power plant with 90% CO2 captured (156.43 kg/s) and the monoethanolamine absorption (MEA) method of CO2 separation from fue gases. The results show that transporting a subcooled liquid maximizes energy effciency and minimizes the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under isothermal, adiabatic and heat transfer conditions. After CO2 is compressed and boosted to above 9 MPa, its temperature is usually higher than ambient but the thermal insulation layer slows down the CO2 temperature decrease process, increasing the pressure drop in the pipeline. Therefore in Poland, considering the atmospheric conditions, the thermal insulation layer should not be laid on the external surface of the pipeline. © The Author(s) 2015.",,"Coal; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Drops; Ethanolamines; Heat transfer; High pressure effects; Isotherms; Liquids; Pipelines; Power plants; Pulverized fuel; Thermal insulation; Two phase flow; Atmospheric conditions; Cost-effective methods; Heat transfer conditions; High molecular weight; Subcooled liquid state; Temperature decrease; Thermal insulation layer; Transportation system; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930206750

While vibration is based on the vibrate sources like motor that is able to generate an AC voltage. Having two sources overcome the issue of limitation caused by single source harvester but will result in impedance mismatching among the desired sources. The proposed of HMEH architecture consists of a control manager with Asynchronous Finite State Machine (AFSM) to grab the proper input value, a rectification to convert vibration input from AC to DC, a start-up to initialize the desired input, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to achieve maximum power extraction, a boost converter to boost up the input voltage, energy storage to keep the energy and voltage regulator to fix or produce the desired output voltage. A single power management circuit is used to reduce the number of components used and power losses. The HMEH will be modeled, designed and simulated using PSPICE software and then implement in 0.13 μm CMOS technology. Next, the developed HMEH will be coding using Verilog Hardware Description Language (VHDL) under mentor graphics and then download to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for real time implementation.

While much focus has been given to sedentary lifestyle as a cause of chronic inflammation, it is less often appreciated that chronic inflammation may also promote a sedentary lifestyle, which in turn causes chronic inflammation. Given that even minor increases in chronic inflammation reduce brain volume in otherwise healthy individuals, the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and sedentary behaviour may explain why humans have lost brain volume in the last 30,000 years and also intelligence in the last 30 years. We review evidence that lack of physical activity induces chronic low-grade inflammation and, consequently, an energy conflict between the selfish immune system and the selfish brain. Although the notion that increased physical activity would improve health in the modern world is widespread, here we provide a novel perspective on this truism by providing evidence that recovery of normal human behaviour, such as spontaneous physical activity, would calm proinflammatory activity, thereby allocating more energy to the brain and other organs, and by doing so would improve human health.

Affected by natural conditions, the uncontrollable distributed generations within VPP, such as wind and photovoltaic generations, are extremely random and relative. Considering the randomness and its correlation of uncontrollable distributed generations, this paper constructs the chance constraints stochastic optimal dispatch of VPP including stochastic variables and its random correlation. The probability distributions of independent wind and photovoltaic generations are described by empirical distribution functions, and their joint probability density model is established by Frank-copula function. And then, sample average approximation (SAA) is applied to convert the chance constrained stochastic optimization model into a deterministic optimization model. Simulation cases are calculated based on the AIMMS. Simulation results of this paper mathematic model are compared with the results of deterministic optimization model without stochastic variables and stochastic optimization considering stochastic variables but not random correlation. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how SAA sampling frequency and the confidence level influence the results of stochastic optimization.

Functionally GC presented high water and oil holding capacities with considerable foaming stability. The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of freeze dried GC on functional properties of dough and its possible application as an alternative hydrocolloid in controlling bread staling by replacing 0, 3, 5 and 10% wheat flour. Significantly, higher farinographic water absorption (%) and mixing tolerance index were recorded with subsequent higher gum concentrations. Conversely, dough stability and time to breakdown were negatively affected by GC addition. Similarly, with increased GC levels a declining trend in dough extensibility (mm) and energy (cm2) were determined through Brabender Extensograph, but interestingly 3% GC presented the highest resistance to extension and maximum resistance. A significant (P≤0.05) reduction in bread loaf volume, specific volume, and darker crumb colour was measured for each increasing GC replacement level. In sensorial evaluation, control bread was liked the most, however 3% bread was also found acceptable. Bread firmness was tested under various storage conditions: time (2, 5 and 7 days) and temperature (4, 25 and -20 °C). At a given storage temperature bread crumb hardness was significantly increased with higher GC percentages and longer storage. However, the least staled bread observed was with 0% GC stored at -20°C. Overall, addition of GC demonstrated direct or indirect effect on physical and functional properties of dough and bread. © 2014 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Bread firmness; Extensograph; Farinograph; Soluble fibre",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929245603

A new nonplanar device architecture called FinFET was invented to overcome the problem by allowing transistors to be scaled down into sub-20 nm region. In this work, the FinFET structure is implemented in 1-bit full adder transistors to investigate its performance and energy efficiency in the subthreshold region for cell designs of Complementary MOS (CMOS), Complementary Pass-Transistor Logic (CPL), Transmission Gate (TG), and Hybrid CMOS (HCMOS). The performance of 1-bit FinFET-based full adder in 16-nm technology is benchmarked against conventional MOSFET-based full adder. The Predictive Technology Model (PTM) and Berkeley Shortchannel IGFET Model- CommonMulti-Gate (BSIM-CMG) 16 nmlowpower libraries are used. Propagation delay, average power dissipation, power-delayproduct (PDP), and energy-delay-product (EDP) are analysed based on all four types of full adder cell designs of both FETs.The 1-bit FinFET-based full adder shows a great reduction in all four metric performances. A reduction in propagation delay, PDP, and EDP is evident in the 1-bit FinFET-based full adder of CPL, giving the best overall performance due to its high-speed performance and good current driving capabilities. ©2015 Aqilah binti Abdul Tahrim et al.",,"Adders; Electron beam lithography; Energy efficiency; Field effect transistors; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuits; MOS devices; Static random access storage; Transistors; Berkeley short-channel igfet models; Complementary pass-transistor logic; Energy delay product; Full-adder cell design; High-speed performance; Performance analysis; Process Technologies; Sub-threshold regions; MOSFET devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929179322

By combining both ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography, PPO was partially purified up to 5.26-fold with 11.23% yield. The enzyme activity was 5120 EU/mL using 4-methylcatechol as substrate. Maximal PPO activity was found at 30°C, pH 5.0 for 4-methylcatechol and 40°C, pH 6.0 for catechol. The PPO showed a higher affinity towards 4-methylcatechol but higher thermal stability when reacting with catechol. The Km and Vmax values were 5.00 mM, 2000 EU/ml for 4-methylcatechol and 10.79 mM, 526.32 EU/ml for catechol. Energy for inactivation (Ea) obtained using 4-methylcatechol and catechol were 12.57 kJ/mol and 14.23 kJ/mol from respective substrates.

It was found that the MgH2+10wt.% LaCl3 sample started to decompose at around 300°C, which was 50°C lower than in as-milled MgH2. For desorption kinetics, the LaCl3-doped MgH2 composite sample released about 4.2wt.% hydrogen at 320°C after 5min dehydrogenation, while the as-milled MgH2 only released about 0.2wt.% hydrogen for the same temperature and time. Meanwhile, a hydrogen absorption capacity of 5.1wt.% was reached at 300°C in 2min for the LaCl3-doped MgH2 sample. In contrast, the ball-milled MgH2 only absorbed 3.8wt.% hydrogen at 300°C in 2min. The activation energy of dehydrogenation was 166.0kJ/mol for the as-milled MgH2 and 143.0kJ/mol for the 10wt.% LaCl3-added MgH2, indicating that the LaCl3 additive decreased the activation energy for the hydrogen desorption of the MgH2. The improved hydrogen storage properties of the MgH2 in the presence of LaCl3 is believed to be due to the catalytic effects of the La-Mg alloy and MgCl2 that were formed in situ during the heating process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Catalytic effect; Hydrogen storage; Lanthanum chloride; Magnesium hydride","Activation energy; Ball milling; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Hydrogen; Lanthanum alloys; Catalytic effects; Composite samples; Desorption kinetics; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage properties; Lanthanum chlorides; Magnesium hydride; Hydrogen storage; activation energy; alloy; catalysis; composite; desorption; gas storage; heating; hydrogen; magnesium; temperature effect; thermal decomposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927664653

In this paper a two-stage filtering method is presented to deal with this problem. The first stage is based on autoregressive (AR) modeling. It is incorporated to suppress high-energy components that mask an informative signal. High-energy amplitudes of mesh harmonics modulated by other damage or load variation can affect selectors of optimal frequency band as well, so they have to be suppressed. The second stage relies on filtering the ARresidual signal using a linear filter based on an informative frequency band selector.

The efficiency of energy storage systems based on electric vehicles with traditional energy-saving technologies is compared in the article by means of performing computations. The comparison is performed by the minimum-cost criterion for the peak energy supply to the system. Computations show that the distributed storage systems based on fleets of electric cars are efficient economically with their usage regime to 1 h/day.

One of the factors affecting the prolongation of inflammation is changes in cell metabolism, occurring at the center of the inflammatory process. In chronic inflammation there is an imbalance between the processes of storage and consumption of energy reserves. Hypoxia that is a consequence of edema results in transition of white blood cells to anaerobic metabolism. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages produce active oxygen metabolites which on one hand facilitate the elimination of pathogens, and on the other hand, can cause damage to healthy cells located in the inflamed tissue.

Although, IoT technologies, solutions, systems have to be proven/tested before deployment in the real settings. These decentralized systems normally use low power devices with small processing and storage capabilities, with roles mainly of sensing and data transmission. Until now, tests and energy simulation focus on wireless communications, since it has been identified as the main energy consuming module. This paper presents the acquisition and simulation of energy consumption by a single device, focused on all hardware components and not only in the communication, due to the new adopted solutions that do not rely so much in the communication (e.g. subscription). In this sense, a methodology capable of retrieving real and simulated energy consumption results from/for a single device is presented, relying on a model based approach (software, hardware, energy and simulation models) and on a precise energy consumption assessment system.

The melting temperatures of the oleogel emulsions ranged from 52.29 to 57.52°C, while it was 40.36°C for the BM sample. Similarly, the solid fat content (SFC) of the oleogel emulsions was between 3.57 and 3.68% at 20°C, and that of BM was 7.70%. Except the EM3 sample, all oleogel emulsions exhibited mechanical stability. The firmness and stickiness values of the oleogel emulsion samples were lower than those of the BM sample, but they remained almost constant through 90 days of storage. Furthermore, the fine water droplets and needle-like beeswax crystals within the continuous oil phase were stable during the storage. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples revealed that the oleogel emulsions contain crystals similar to β′ polymorphs, characterized by a homogenous, smooth and fine texture. The presence of inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonds was proved by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements.

Virtualization empowered by virtual machine (VM) migration meets the ever increasing demands of dynamic workload by relocating VMs within Cloud Data Centers. VM migration helps successfully achieve various resource management objectives such as load balancing, power management, fault tolerance, and system maintenance. However, being resource-intensive, the VM migration process rigorously affects application performance unless attended by smart optimization methods. Furthermore, a Cloud Data Centre exploits server consolidation and DVFS methods to optimize energy consumption. This paper reviews state-of-the-art bandwidth optimization schemes, server consolidation frameworks, DVFS-enabled power optimization, and storage optimization methods over WAN links. Through a meticulous literature review of state-of-the-art live VM migration schemes, thematic taxonomies are proposed to categorize the reported literature. The critical aspects of virtual machine migration schemes are investigated through a comprehensive analysis of the existing schemes. The commonalties and differences among existing VM migration schemes are highlighted through a set of parameters derived from the literature. Finally, open research issues and trends in the VM migration domain that necessitate further consideration to develop optimal VM migration schemes are highlighted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the air-conditioning systems used in Saudi Arabia are of the vapor-compression type. Using solar energy to power such systems will save a large amount of electrical or mechanical energy that can be utilized in industry. Alternative designs for 24-hour-operating solar-powered lithium bromide (LiBr)-water absorption air-conditioning systems are analyzed in this study. Three alterative designs (heat storage, cold storage, and refrigerant storage) are studied. The study includes system description, features, and selection analysis.

The uncontrolled electricity generation in a distribution network may have a negative impact on power system operation. The operation of DG, particularly RES, should be optimized to ensure technical standards of energy delivery. The optimization can be carried out using the concept of local energy balancing and ancillary services (ASs) provided by the DG and RES. As shown, they are able to ensure the development of local energy resources preserving the technical standards of network operation. The technical novelty of this paper presented refers to the implementation of the local energy balancing system in the low-voltage distribution system using competitive electricity market rules and application of nonlinear programming for overall optimization.

Tropical peat soil was used as a carbon precursor. The effects of activating agent concentrations on the microstructure and chemical properties of activated carbon were studied. Activated carbon with a high BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface area (SBET) and a high total pore volume (Vpore) was produced using a 30% H3PO4 chemical activation method. The SBET and Vpore of the activated carbon at this condition were 1974 m2/g and 1.41 cm3/g, respectively. However, the activated carbon prepared using ZnCl2 activation only had a SBET of 794 m2/g and a Vpore of 0.11 cm3/g. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of both activated carbons exhibited a combination of Type I and Type II isotherms, due to the simultaneous presence of micro- and mesopores structures. The microcrystallinity of the activated carbons was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer and a Raman Spectroscopy, respectively. The activated carbon produced using H3PO4 activation had higher crystalline properties than the activated carbon prepared using ZnCl2 activation. Thus, this article demonstrates the potential of tropical peat soil as a precursor of AC production.","Activated carbon; Chemical activation method; Phosphoric acid; Surface chemistry; Thermal energy storage; Tropical peat soil; Zinc chloride","Activated carbon; Carbon; Chemical properties; Chlorine compounds; Gas adsorption; Heat storage; Isotherms; Peat; Phosphoric acid; Reactor cores; Soils; Surface chemistry; Thermal energy; Tropics; Zinc; Zinc chloride; Microcrystals; Activating agents; Brunauer emmett tellers; Crystalline properties; Microcrystallinity; Nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms; Total pore volume; Tropical peat soils; X ray diffractometers; Chemical activation; Activated Carbon; Chemical Properties; Chlorine Compounds; Isotherms; Peat; Phosphoric Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923668857

The island has good wind and solar energy potentials while connecting to the grid. So, it is considered a grid connected and standalone system in the study. The system consists of a photovoltaic (PV) array, a wind turbine, an electrolyzer, hydrogen storage, a fuel cell (FC) and a converter as the main equipment. Six scenarios, grid, grid/wind, grid/PV, grid/wind/PV, wind/FC, and wind/PV/FC, are simulated using the hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) tool to define the optimum systems. The HOMER examines the systems according to their net present costs (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). The results show that the most suitable grid connected system is the grid/wind as $0.103/kW h although the electricity price of the grid is $0.17/kW h. The optimum system in the standalone scenarios is the wind/PV/FC with a cost of $0.836/kW h. Also, the effects of some parameters, such as wind speed, solar radiation and cost of the equipment, on the system type and COE are examined by using sensitivity analyses.

The studies were performed using a TEMP-4M accelerator, which consists of a capacitive storage—a pulse-voltage generator (PVG), a double forming line (DFL), and a vacuum ion diode with self-magnetic insulation of electrons (or a resistive load). The accelerator forms double pulses of opposite polarities: the first pulse is negative (300–600 ns, 150–200 kV), and the second is positive (120 ns, 250–300 kV). The energy losses in the forming line caused by the leakage current in water during the line charging and generation of an ion beam were determined, as well as the energy loss in gas-filled gaps. The performed studies showed that the total energy transferred from the PVG to the DFL is equal to the sum of the energy stored in the DFL and the energy loss in the load. The loss due to the leakage in water and in the gas-filled gap was within 4%. The efficiency of the energy transfer from the DFL to the load (a resistive load or a diode) and in the short-circuiting mode was analyzed. It was obtained that 90% of the energy that was stored in the DFL is transferred to the diode, and 90% of this energy is fed to the diode during the beam generation. The main energy loss (9–10%) occurs in gas-filled gaps. In this case, the efficiency of the energy transfer from the DFL to the load is independent of the energy stored in the DFL. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Diodes; Energy balance; Energy dissipation; Energy transfer; Ion beams; Ions; Magnetic storage; Pulse generators; Beam generation; Bipolar pulse; Capacitive storage; Double forming lines (DFL); Magnetic insulation; Pulse voltage; Resistive loads; Short circuiting; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923007912

The results are compared to a sensible heat storage unit using water. Thermo-physical properties such as the specific heat, enthalpy variation, thermal conductivity and density are also experimentally determined. The non-Newtonian shear-thickening behavior of the phase change material slurry is quantified. Thermal energy performance is experimentally determined for a 100 l horizontal tank. The heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid and the phase change material was provided by a tube-bundle heat exchanger inside the tank. The results show that the amount of energy stored using the phase change material is 53% higher than for water after 10 h of charging, for the same storage tank volume. It was found that the heat transfer coefficient between the phase change material and the tube wall increases during the phase change temperature range, however it remains smaller than the values obtained for water. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ripe FC peppers were also more sensitive to O2 reductions below 5kPa. Marked benefits were obtained at both ripening stages with 5kPa O2+5kPa CO2. CA-stored strips showed lower spoilage and dehydration and ion leakage. Storage under 5kPa O2+5kPa CO2 was highly effective to maintain the firmness and resistance to bending of the strips.

ATP synthase undergoes several changes during its functioning.The generally accepted model for ATP synthesis is the well-known rotatory model (see e.g., Junge et al., Nature 459:364-370, 2009; Junge and Müller, Science 333:704-705, 2011). Here, we present an alternative modified model for the coupling of electron and proton transfer to ATP synthesis, which was initially developed by Albert Lester Lehninger (1917-1986). Details of the molecular mechanism of ATP synthesis are described here that involves cyclic low-amplitude shrinkage and swelling of mitochondria. A comparison of the well-known current model and the mechano-chemiosmotic model is also presented. Based on structural, and other data, we suggest that ATP synthase is a Ca2+/H+-K+ Cl--pump-pore-enzyme complex, in which γ-subunit rotates 360° in steps of 30°, and 90° due to the binding of phosphate ions to positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal γ-subunit, while in the electric field. The coiled coil b2-subunits are suggested to act as ropes that are shortened by binding of phosphate ions to positively charged lysines or arginines; this process is suggested to pull the α3β3-hexamer to the membrane during the energization process. ATP is then synthesized during the reverse rotation of the γ-subunit by destabilizing the phosphated N-terminal γ-subunit and b2-subunits under the influence of Ca2+ ions, which are pumped over from storage - intermembrane space into the matrix, during swelling of intermembrane space. In the process of ATP synthesis, energy is first, predominantly, used in the delivery of phosphate ions and protons to the α3β3-hexamer against the energy barrier with the help of C-terminal alpha-helix of γ-subunit that acts as a lift; then, in the formation of phosphoryl group; and lastly, in the release of ATP molecules from the active center of the enzyme and the loading of ADP. We are aware that our model is not an accepted model for ATP synthesis, but it is presented here for further examination and test. © The Author(s) 2014.","Electron transfer; F0f1-aTPase; Mechanochemiosmotic model; Shrinkage-swelling; γ-Subunit rotation","adenosine triphosphate; ion channel; protein subunit; proton; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; cell membrane; chemical structure; electron transport; energy metabolism; metabolism; physiology; protein conformation; protein subunit; Adenosine Triphosphate; Cell Membrane; Chloroplast Proton-Translocating ATPases; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Ion Channels; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation; Protein Subunits; Protons",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921937039

Among these technologies, PEVs pose both a risk by increasing the peak load as well as an opportunity for the existing energy management systems by discharging electricity with the help of Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. These complications, together with the PEV battery degradation, compound the challenge in the management of existing energy systems. In this context, microgrids are proposed as an aggregation unit to smartly manage the energy exchange of these different state-of-the-art technologies. In this chapter, we consider a microgrid with a high level of PEV penetration into the transportation system, widespread utilization of smart appliances at homes, distributed energy generation and community-level electricity storage units. We propose a mixed integer linear programming energy management optimization model to schedule the charging and discharging times of PEVs, electricity storage units, and running times of smart appliances.

Hydro power is not only a renewable and sustainable energy source, but its flexibility and storage capacity also make it possible to improve grid stability and to support the deployment of other intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. As a result, a renewed interest in PHES and a demand for the rehabilitation of old small hydro power plants are emerging globally. With regard to PHES, advances in turbine design are required to enhance plant performance and flexibility and new strategies for optimizing storage capacity and for maximizing plant profitability in the deregulated energy market. In the early 2000s, this technology has again emerged as an economically and technologically acceptable option for peak load shaving and wind and solar energy storage for power quality assurance. Furthermore, renewable energy sources due to their fluctuating nature cannot maintain or regulate continuous supply of power and hence require bulk electricity storage. The present study aims at reviewing the existing global PHES capacities, technological development, and hybrid systems (wind-hydro, solar pv-hydro, and wind-pv-hydro) and recommending the best possible options. The review explores that PHES is the most suitable technology for small autonomous island grids and massive energy storage, where the energy efficiency of PHES varies in practice between 70% and 80% with some claiming up to 87%. Around the world, PHES size mostly nestles in the range of 1000-1500 MW, being as large as 2000-3000 MW. On the other hand, photovoltaic based pumped storage systems have been used for very small scale (load of few houses) only. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Economics; Photovoltaic-hydro energy storage; Pumped hydroelectric systems; Renewable energy; Seawater pumped storage; Wind-hydro energy storage","Deregulation; Economics; Energy efficiency; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Natural resources; Quality assurance; Small power plants; Solar energy; Deregulated energy market; Hydroelectric systems; Photovoltaic; Pumped Storage; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable energies; Sustainable energy sources; Technological development; Electric energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921487903

In the chapter, the application of the strip-method for noise-immune storage and transmission of images is analyzed. At the same time, before transmitting the matrix transformation of an original image has to be done, when the image fragments are mixed up and superimposed each other. The transformed image is transmitted over a communication channel, where it is distorted with a pulse noise, the latter being, for example, a possible reason for a complete loss of separate image fragments. After the signal transmission to the receiving end, an inverse transformation is performed. During this transformation, the reconstruction of the image takes place. If it is possible to provide a uniform distribution of the pulse noise over the whole area, which the image occupies without any changes of its energy, then a noticeable decrease of noise amplitude will take place and an acceptable quality of all fragments of the image are reconstructed. The tasks of the chapter are the consideration the versions of the two-sided strip-transformation of images and the choice of optimal transformation matrices.

A power management strategy based on fuzzy logic has been introduced for battery-ultracapacitor (UC) energy storage. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the design and construction of on-board hybrid source. The proposed energy storage system consists of battery, UCs and two DC/DC interleaved converters interfacing both storages. A fuzzy-logic controller (FLC) for the hybrid energy source is developed and discussed. Control structure has been tested using a non-mobile experimental setup. Findings - The hybrid energy storage ensures high-power ability.

Although nuclear power will help solve the energy-related issues of the country, however, the high-level radioactive waste has to be stored securely. In this regard, an evaluation of the available geological data has been conducted to determine where the most suitable sites could serve as permanent disposal of radioactive wastes from future nuclear power activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Also, the volume of high-level wastes expected to be generated have been estimated, so as to access the cost (and size) of such a disposal site. Conclusions are presented, indicating that by the year 2060, the construction of such a disposal site would be economically feasible, based upon a surcharge of 1 mill/kWh for the disposal activities.

Incorporating the finite difference approach, one and two dimensional heat balances were written for inner zones and insulation side walls. Through, careful determination of the dimensions, insulation parameter and incoming solar radiation reaching the storage zone increased the efficiency of the solar pond.

To develop noninvasive means to measure droplet microstructure in vivo, we investigated the molecular diffusion behavior of IMCL with diffusion magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Methods: Using extremely large diffusion weighting, we measured the IMCL apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in hindlimb muscle of rodents from normal feeding, 60-h fasting, streptozotocin-induced diabetic, and high-fat-diet-induced obese groups.Results: IMCL ADCs decreased markedly with diffusion time, confirming the restricted diffusion of lipid molecules within IMCL droplets. IMCL droplet size, determined by transmission electron microscopy, was closely correlated with ADC. IMCL ADC was sensitive to metabolic alterations, decreasing in the 60-h fasting and diabetic groups while increasing in the obese group. These findings indicated that the IMCL droplet size decreased following 60-h fasting and in STZinduced diabetes but increased in high-fat-diet-induced obesity.Conclusion: MR diffusion characterization of IMCL droplet size provides a unique means to examine the intracellular lipid dynamics and metabolic abnormalities in vivo. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Diffusion magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Fasting; Intracellular lipid; Intramyocellular lipid; Obesity; Streptozotocininduced diabetes","Analog to digital conversion; Drops; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Magnetism; Mammals; Metabolism; Morphology; Muscle; Nutrition; Surface diffusion; Apparent diffusion coefficient; Diffusion weighting; Energy metabolism; Fasting; Lipid synthesis; Molecular diffusion; Obesity; Restricted diffusion; Magnetic resonance; creatine; fat droplet; intramyocellular lipid; lipid; streptozocin; taurine; trimethylammonium salt derivative; unclassified drug; fat droplet; lipid; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; diet induced obesity; diffusion coefficient; diffusion magnetic resonance spectroscopy; ex vivo study; hindlimb; in vivo study; lipid diet; male; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; plantaris muscle; rat; soleus muscle; Sprague Dawley rat; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; swine; time; transmission electron microscopy; algorithm; animal; cell culture; cell tracking; chemistry; computer assisted diagnosis; cytology; diffusion weighted imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; skeletal muscle cell; ultrastructure; Algorithms; Animals; Cell Tracking; Cells, Cultured; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lipid Droplets; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919871669

Earlier studies have shown that hepatic lipid accumulation can occur after 4 d of a high-fat diet in humans, and this fat accumulation can be blunted by the ingestion of additional proteins. Objectives: In this study, we explored whether a single high-fat meal increased the lipid content in liver and skeletal muscle as measured by using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and whether the addition of protein can modulate the postprandial ectopic lipid storage. Design: Intrahepatic lipid (IHL) and intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) concentrations were determined by using 1H-MRS before and 3 and 5 h after a high-fat with added protein meal (61.5% of energy from fat) or a high-fat without added protein meal (mean ± SEM: 51.1 ± 7.9 g of protein; 191.9 ± 9.9 kcal added) in a randomized crossover study. IHL and IMCL concentrations were converted to absolute concentrations (g/kg wet weight) by using water as an internal reference. Results: Nine lean, healthy subjects [± men and 3 women; mean (±SD) age: 22.7 ± 3.0 y; mean body mass index (in kg/m2): 21.8 ± 1.8] were included in this study. IHL concentrations increased ∼20% (P &lt; 0.01) at 3 h after the meal and did not further increase after 5 h. In contrast, IMCL concentrations were not altered during the postprandial period (P = 0.74). The addition of protein to a single high-fat meal did not change the postprandial accumulation of fat in the liver (P = 0.93) or skeletal muscle ( P = 0.84). Conclusions: In this study, we showed that a single energy-dense, highfat meal induced net lipid accumulation in the liver, which was detected by using in vivo 1H-MRS. This noninvasive approach might bring new opportunities to study postprandial hepatic lipid dynamics. The addition of protein did not change the ectopic lipid retention after a single highfat meal.

This system can replace the function of battery for small Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) electronic devices. The slag of batteries is harmful to the environment as well as hazardous to human health. Recent research trends in energy harvesting systems are extracting maximum energy from wind energy using piezoelectric cantilever. This study presents the development of a Power Conditioning Circuit (PCC) for maximum harvested energy by using piezoelectric transducers. To achieve this, a self-PCC consisting of voltage doubler, charge pump, DC-DC converter and bypass path was designed. The output from the piezoelectric transducer is an AC voltage. To rectify the piezoelectric output, the voltage doubler was performed. Initially, the capacitor was charged via a bypass path. Once, the storage charge of the capacitor is sufficient to run the Microcontroller unit, this unit will stop the bypass path and on the active path. A low power Microcontroller was used for coding Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The system modeling, design and analysis of the proposed PCC energy harvesting was simulated in active components using PSPICE software and later on the MPPT algorithm was coded in MATLAB. Then the PSPICE simulation and MPPT code was integrated for evaluating the system performance.Finally, a self-powered and fully autonomous energy harvesting power conditioning circuit layout was designed in 0.13 μm. CMOS technology under Mentor Graphics. This PCC will ensure sufficient power to drive electronic devices such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), hearing aid, electronic watchand calculator, etc. This battery less ULP energy harvester capable to harvest maximum24 mW power with an expected efficiency of 90% and output voltage of 3 V from low ambient sources of 500 mV at start up.

This work demonstrates a very facile and low-cost approach to fabricate stretchable supercapacitors with high performance and excellent cycling stability by electrochemical deposition of polypyrrole (PPy) on smartly-tailored stretchable stainless steel meshes. The fabricated solid-state supercapacitors possess a capacitance up to 170. F/g at a specific current of 0.5. A/g and it can be effectively enhanced to 214. F/g with a 20% strain. Moreover, they can be operated at a very high scan rate up to 10. V/s, which are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than most rates for the PPy electrodes measured even in aqueous electrolytes. Even significantly, the fabricated solid-state supercapacitors under 0% and 20% strains achieve remarkable capacitance retentions of 98% and 87% at a very high specific current of 10.

The policy of time-sensitive electricity pricing provides a possibility to improve the energy efficiency of the building energy systems. A model predictive control (MPC)-based strategy using nonlinear programming (NLP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the energy systems under day-ahead electricity pricing. Evaluations are conducted using a reference building based on the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. A stratified chilled water storage tank is introduced as the thermal energy storage, which makes possible to optimize the scheduling of the building energy systems. The distributed power generation in the building consists of a combined cooling and power system and a photovoltaic (PV) system. Two types of grid-connections (i.e., selling electricity to grid is allowed/forbidden) are considered.

Various macro-parameters in a NZEB have different impacts on system design and very few studies have investigated such impacts in a NZEB. Therefore, a systematic sensitivity analysis of macro-parameters in a NZEB has been conducted in this study. Differential sensitivity analysis, a local sensitivity analysis method, is performed on a constructed dynamic simulation platform to study the impacts of each macro-parameter on the sizes of key NZEB systems. The systems include heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, renewable energy system and energy storage system. The influence coefficient of each parameter is calculated to quantify its sensitivity impacts. Meanwhile, an exhaustive search approach is proposed to minimize the overall initial investment cost of the renewable energy system and storage system. The study results are valuable to help designers improve NZEB system design through carefully selecting more accurate design parameters especially those identified with heavy sensitivity impacts.

Furthermore, thermal energy storage strongly reduces energy consumption. Storage devices of thermal energy from phase change material (PCM) are essential in solar thermal and waste heat energy technologies that match energy supply to demand and enhance their thermal performance. The storage of PCM thermal energy is more beneficial than sensible energy storage because of its high density of storage energy per unit volume/mass. This review presents previous works on thermal energy storage as applied to DHW and heating systems. PCM has been used in different parts of heating networks and DHW systems, including solar collectors, storage tanks, packed beds, and duct networks. Researchers have also investigated the application of PCM in heating and DHW systems to reduce greenhouse gas emission and electrical power consumption. Hence, PCM thermal energy storage is expected to lower cost and the volumes of heating and DHW systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy balance combination method for estimating evaporation requires the heat storage changes (Qt) to be known. The lack of data on water temperature profiles and water depth fluctuations hinders routine computations of Qt. Following successful estimation of the soil heat flux density of land surfaces (G) and heat storage change of urban areas and wetlands from net all wave radiation (Rn), we investigated in this paper whether a similar generic Qt(Rn) empirical relationship can be developed for lakes and reservoirs. A comprehensive literature survey was conducted and experimental datasets for 22 lakes with different characteristics were collected. A linear Qt(Rn) model with a hysteresis function to describe seasonal warming and cooling effects was developed (Qt=a*Rn+b+c*dRn/dt) that fits the 22 independently gathered datasets satisfactory (R2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 22Wm-2) for bi-weekly and monthly time scales. Predictive models for the coefficients a, b and c were also developed, using Rn and water surface temperature measurements that can be retrieved from routine earth observation measurements. The average R2 between measured and modeled Qt was 0.84 and the RMSE was 37Wm-2 if predictive models were used for the assessment of lake specific Qt(Rn) functions. Two independent satellite-derived products were explored: the ARC-Lake (ATSR Reprocessing for Climate) product for water surface temperature using the ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) series data, and the CM SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) product for solar radiation Rs based on the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. The proposed procedure using purely satellite-derived data as inputs resulted in comparably good Qt estimates as those using in-situ measurements. The new Qt hysteresis model can thus be applied together with satellite measurements for supporting the computation of evaporation from open water bodies based on energy balance equations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Energy balance; Evaporation; Radiation; Satellite thermal data; Water surface temperature","Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Energy balance; Evaporation; Heat flux; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Hysteresis; Lakes; Predictive analytics; Satellites; Surface properties; Temperature measurement; Along track scanning radiometers; Empirical relationships; Energy balance equations; Lake sand reservoirs; Satellite application facilities; Satellite measurements; Thermal data; Water surface temperature; Reservoirs (water); Along Track Scanning Radiometer; data set; empirical analysis; energy balance; evaporation; heat flux; lake; reservoir; satellite data; temperature profile; urban area; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908072572

The zones contain frequent Fe-Mn(III) oxyhydroxides (FeOH-MnOH) that resulted from oxidation of pyrite and Mn-bearing silicates. In the bleached part, the groundmass is represented by Fe-bearing interstratified illite-smectite with up to 4.02wt% FeOt. FeOH-MnOH are pre-weathering phases formed by hydrothermal alteration in a submarine environment prior to uplifting. Five varieties of FeOH are distinguished, four of them are exclusively hydrothermal with ~20wt% H2O whereas the fifth contains ~31-33wt% H2O and might represent reworking of earlier hydrothermal FeOH phases by weathering. FeOH fills thin fractures in the form of veinlets and crenulated laminae or as a pseudomorph for pyrite, goethite and finally ferrihydrite, and this oxyhydroxide is characterized by positive correlation of Fe2O3 with SiO2 and Al2O3. On the other hand, MOH shows positive correlation between MnO2 and Al2O3 whereas it is negative between Fe2O3 and SiO2. Paratacamite is the most common secondary copper mineral that fills fractures and post-dates FeOH and MnOH. It is believed that Cl- in the structure of paratacamite represents inherited marine storage rather than from surfacial evaporates or meteoric water. The mineralogy of slags suggests a complicated mineral assemblage that includes native Cu prills, synthetic spinifixed Mn-rich amphiboles with 16.73. wt% MnO, brown glass and Ca-Mn-Fe phase close to the olivine structure. EMPA indicate that the some Cu prills have either grey discontinuous boarder zone of S-rich Mn-Cu alloy (with up to 21.95. wt% S and 19.45. wt% Mn) or grey Cu-Mn-Fe alloy (with up to 15.9. wt% Cu, 39. 12. wt% Mn and 61.64. wt% Fe). Mn in the Cu prills is expelled inward as Cu-Mn-Fe alloy inclusions whereas S is expelled outward as S-rich Mn-Cu alloy crust. Remains in the Samran smelter sites suggest the use of charcoal as a source of energy, quartzite as a flux and an air-cooling technique was used. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cu prills; Fe-Mn(III) oxyhydroxide; Slags; Synthetic Mn-rich amphiboles","alloy; amphibole; copper; geochemistry; hydrothermal alteration; iron; manganese; mineralization; oxidation; shear zone; slag; iron hydroxide; pyrite; silicate; secondary mineral; Jabal Samran; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907841920

Unlike conventional approaches, the CSI active power filter energy storage is inductor based. The approach to control the CSI is established using two controllers: one to control the AC three phase currents sourced by the electric grid, and the other to control the current on the Lind inductor of the DC side of the CSI. The DC current controller will produce the reference values that will be further used in αβ space vector modulation, to control the AC currents. Simulation results are presented, and discussed. © 2015 Springer International Publishing.","active pulsed power filter compensation; Current source inverter; SVPWM control","Automation; Electric current control; Electric load forecasting; Modulation; Process control; Pulse width modulation; Vector spaces; Active power Filter; Conventional approach; Current source inverter; Pulsed-power; Reference values; Space Vector Modulation; SVPWM control; Three-phase currents; Active filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907366198
