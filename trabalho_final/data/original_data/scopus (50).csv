By means of calculations based on the density-functional theory, we quantify the tunability of the hydrogen-graphene binding energies by changing the sheet out-of-plane deformation up to ±0.2 Å. We show that the binding energy can be varied by more than 2 eV, with the convex regions allocating the energetically favored hydrogen binding sites. We simulate the process of hydrogen chemisorption on corrugated graphene and release under the application of time-dependent mechanical deformations. Our results show that the corrugation of the graphene sheet and the controlled inversion of its curvature yield fast storage and release of hydrogen. Our corrugated graphene multilayer system can potentially reach gravimetric capacities up to 8 wt % and reversibly store and release hydrogen by external control of the local curvature at room conditions and with fast kinetics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"External control; Fast kinetics; Graphene layers; Graphene multilayers; Graphene sheets; Gravimetric capacity; Hydrogen binding; Hydrogen chemisorption; Local curvature; Mechanical deformation; Out-of-plane; Time-dependent; Tunabilities; Binding energy; Binding sites; Chemisorption; Deformation; Density functional theory; Graphene; Hydrogen; Multilayers; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255204862

The Co 3O 4 sample synthesized by the conventional reflux method consists of randomly distributed thin nanowires while the microwave reflux method generates higher-dimensional and arranged Co 3O 4 nanowires. The surface area and pore structural analysis of the Co 3O 4 samples show significant difference in their meso- and macroporosity as well as specific surface area, due to differently crystallized products. The UV-Vis-DRS study shows crystallite size dependent optical transitions and band gaps. The magnetic study illustrates finite size effect and low temperature ferromagnetism in both samples; the lower-dimensional nanowires being more ferromagnetic than the higher-dimensional Co 3O 4 nanowires. Due to smaller crystallite size and more accessible surface sites, the Co 3O 4 sample synthesized by the conventional reflux method shows better charge storage, high Coulombic efficiency, and enhanced rate response during the pseudocapacitance studies. However the Co 3O 4 sample synthesized using the microwave-assisted method shows better high rate cyclic stability due to its more rigid orientated nanowire structure. Further, the Ragone plot exhibits considerably higher energy and power densities of lower-dimensional Co 3O 4 nanowires. Broadly, this study reveals that, under nonhydrothermal homogeneous precipitation conditions, the conventional reflux synthesized lower-dimensional Co 3O 4 nanowires bear superior surface properties than the microwave synthesized higher-dimensional Co 3O 4 nanowires, for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Band gaps; Charge storage; Coulombic efficiency; Cyclic stability; Electrochemical supercapacitor; Finite size effect; Functional characteristics; High rate; Higher-dimensional; Homogeneous Precipitation; Low temperatures; Macro-porosity; Magnetic studies; Microwave-assisted; Nanowire structures; Power densities; Pseudocapacitance; Ragone plot; Randomly distributed; Rate response; Surface area; Surface sites; Synthesis method; UV-vis-DRS; Crystallite size; Electrochemical properties; Ferromagnetism; Microwaves; Morphology; Surface properties; Surfaces; Nanowires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255204828

We exploit the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential function and the continuous approximation to model the surface binding energies and the molecular forces between these gases and carbon nanocones of varying vertex angle and length. Our results show that for a hydrogen or methane molecule, or neon atom, interacting with a carbon nanocone the binding energies of the respective systems are minimized when the gas is encapsulated inside the cone. However, we find that for the shorter carbon nanocones, there is a higher energy barrier preventing methane encapsulation in the nanocone. The present modeling indicates that for the particular apex angle of 112.9° the optimal minimum energy storage for the gases occurs in a nanocone of radius 7.1052 Å and of length 4.7126 Å. Our results agree with recent results suggesting that gas adsorption in carbon nanocones is more favorable at lower temperatures. Overall, our results are in very good agreement with other theoretical studies and molecular dynamics simulations and show that carbon nanocones might be good candidates for gas storage.

Chemical structure, surface morphology, and the nature of the adsorbed species on BaO x/Pt(111) surfaces were studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). For θ BaOx &lt; 1 MLE, (2 × 2) or (1 × 2) ordered overlayer structures were observed on Pt(111), whereas BaO(110) surface termination was detected for θ BaOx = 1.5 MLE. Thicker films (θ BaOx ≥ 2.5 MLE) were found to be amorphous. Extensive NO 2 adsorption on BaO x(10 MLE)/Pt(111) yields predominantly nitrate species that decompose at higher temperatures through the formation of nitrites. Nitrate decomposition occurs on BaO x(10 MLE)/Pt(111) in two successive steps: (1) NO(g) evolution and BaO 2 formation at 650 K and (2) NO(g) + O 2(g) evolution at 700 K. O 2(g) treatment of the BaO x(10 MLE)/Pt(111) surface at 873 K facilitates the BaO 2 formation and results in the agglomeration of BaO x domains leading to the generation of exposed Pt(111) surface sites. BaO 2 formed on BaO x(10 MLE)/Pt(111) is stable even after annealing at 1073 K, whereas on thinner films (θ BaOx = 2.5 MLE), BaO 2 partially decomposes into BaO, indicating that small BaO 2 clusters in close proximity of the exposed Pt(111) sites are prone to decomposition. Nitrate decomposition temperature decreases monotonically from 550 to 375 K with decreasing BaO x coverage within θ BaOx = 0.5 to 1.0 MLE. Nitrate decomposition occurs at a rather constant temperature range of 650-700 K for thicker BaO x overlayers (2.5 MLE &lt; θ BaOx &lt; 10 MLE). These two distinctly characteristic BaO x-coverage-dependent nitrate decomposition regimes are in very good agreement with the observation of the so-called ""surface"" and ""bulk"" barium nitrates previously reported for realistic NSR catalysts, clearly demonstrating the strong dependence of the nitrate thermal stability on the NO x storage domain size. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Active site; Adsorbed species; Barium nitrates; Close proximity; Constant temperature; Domain size; Higher temperatures; Model catalysts; Monolayer equivalents; Nitrate decomposition; Nitrate species; NSR catalyst; Ordered overlayer; Overlayers; Pt(111); Reduction systems; Surface sites; Surface termination; Adsorption; Barium; Catalysts; Monolayers; Nitrates; Platinum; Reduction; Surface morphology; Temperature programmed desorption; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455168997

An evaporative system coupled with a desiccant wheel can operate effectively in broader climatic conditions. These cooling systems can substitute traditional vapor compression air conditioning systems as they involve environmentally friendly cooling processes with reduced electricity demand (which is commonly generated from fossil fuels) along with no harmful CFC based refrigerant usage. Furthermore, direct utilization of low grade energy sources such as solar thermal energy or flue gas heat can drive the desiccant regeneration process, thus providing economic benefits. This study presents the results of simulations of desiccant cooling system performance for different climate zones of the United States. Solar assisted desiccant air conditioning is particularly useful where there are abundant solar resources with high temperature and humidity levels. Building energy simulations determined cooling energy requirements for the building. Simulation of an evacuated solar hot water collector model provided the heat energy available for regeneration of the desiccant. Solid desiccant of common material such as silica gel used in a rotary wheel is simulated using established validated computer models; this is coupled with evaporative cooling. Transients of the overall system for different cooling loads and solar radiation levels are presented. Finally, feasibility studies of the desiccant cooling systems are presented in comparison with traditional cooling system. Further analysis of the data presents optimization opportunities.

This paper describes a new course at the University of Detroit Mercy intended to teach students about battery systems engineering. The course is offered as part of a newly-established Advanced Electric Vehicle graduate-level certificate program. The design of a battery system is highly interdisciplinary in nature. Engineers must address mechanical concerns such as packaging, vibration, torsional loads, impact resistance and thermal management; electrical aspects such as those associated with battery monitoring and control; and the electrochemical phenomena that governs capacity, power delivery and absorption, degradation and operating temperatures. A key challenge in the course design was tailoring the material to students with diverse backgrounds which include undergraduate degrees in mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering.

One of the primary issues with this type system is the exchange of thermal energy coming off the power field. In a heat exchanger, the effective heat transfer coefficient between the exchange mediums plays a crucial factor in determining the sizing of the heat exchange unit. A concept utilizing sand as a cheap particulate thermal medium was recently proposed for an alternative thermal energy storage system. The overall system will be described in some detail; however, the primary focus of this research report will be to present the experimental results measuring the heat transfer coefficient between flowing sand and a representative heat exchanger surface. To measure the heat transfer coefficient a horizontal rotating drum is used to continuously deposit sand over a centrally positioned test article. The heat transfer coefficient in this case was calculated by taking the power input divided by the known area of the test article covered by the sand as well as the measured temperature difference between the article surface and sand temperature. Calibrated thin film thermocouples attached to the test article surface as well as thin film thermocouples suspended into the sand pooling in drum satisfy the needed temperature measurements. Then, by electrically heating a known area of the test article, a heat transfer coefficient between the sand and surface can be determined. Insulation of key end surfaces and errors such as heat leak due to air as well as measurement inaccuracies were also accounted for in the experimental setup and are included in the report's error propagation analysis. The overall results compare heat transfer coefficients measurements for a range of different sands and sizes, as well as model comparisons with known literature on the subject.

Most projected pathways toward meeting those targets include a large contribution from carbon capture and storage. Many capture technologies impose a large energy penalty to separate and compress carbon dioxide (CO2). Also, injected neat CO2 in a deep saline aquifer is buoyant compared to the aquifer brine and requires an impermeable seal to prevent it from escaping the aquifer. An alternative technology was recently proposed by Heberle and Edwards. [1] that burns coal in supercritical water pumped from a saline aquifer. The entire effluent stream is sequestered, capturing all carbon and non-mineral coal combustion products in the process. This stream is denser than the aquifer brine and therefore offers a higher level of storage security, and can utilize aquifers without suitable structural trapping. This technology also increases energy security in the U.S., allowing for the use of its coal resources while avoiding atmospheric pollution. In this paper, a complete architecture employing supercritical water oxidation is proposed, including a liquid-oxygen-pumped air separation unit and regenerator system that heats and desalinates the incoming brine. A thermodynamic model calculates the overall thermal efficiency of the plant, including all separation and storage energy penalties. In addition, an exergy analysis gives insights into the least efficient parts of the proposed system. The details and assumptions of the model are discussed.

Developing and deploying practical energy storage at this level is a major challenge and no single technology appears to have a dominant position. Storing electrical energy by way of thermal storage at moderate-to-low temperatures has not received much attention in the past. In fact, the conventional thinking is that heat pump/heat engine mediated energy storage is too inefficient (round trip efficiency of 30% or lower) to be practical. However, an innovative and efficient storage approach is proposed in this paper by incorporating sensible heat storage in a Rankine-type heat pump/heat engine cycle to increase the round trip efficiency. Furthermore, by using a source of waste (or otherwise low-grade) heat, round trip efficiencies can be enhanced further. Currently, there appears to be no significant linkage between waste heat recovery and grid-level energy storage, although the market opportunity for each is considerable. Using the thermal approach described here, a system can be created that uses very low-grade heat in the range between 50 to 70 °C. Furthermore, conventional technology can be used to implement the system where no extreme conditions are present anywhere in the cycle. Hence, it is thought to have advantages over other energy storage concepts being developed.

The study has been conducted to determine the best hybrid system to generate electrical energy needed for a small community of 500 residential buildings. A series of a simulation analyses have been carried out to evaluate and optimize different distribution technologies including photovolatics, wind and diesel for electrical generation in combination with storage batteries. It was found that the cost of energy could be reduced by as much as 48% compared to the cost for the baseline generation system currently used in the Masirah Island (i.e. diesel-driven generators). In particular, it was found that wind turbines in combination with storage batteries have a great impact in reducing the cost of generating electrical energy for the residential community. Moreover, solar PV panels were found unattractive under the current diesel price rates but could potentially become viable if the diesel prices increase. The paper outlines an optimal design for generating electricity for the community at lowest cost while minimizing carbon emissions.

To improve their cost-effectiveness, one focus of industry and research is the development of processes with other heat transfer fluids than the currently used synthetic oil. One option is the utilization of water/steam in the solar field, the so-called direct steam generation (DSG). Several previous studies promoted the economic potential of DSG technology [1-3]. Analyses' results showed that live steam parameters of up to 500°C and 120 bars are most promising and could lead to a reduction of the levelized electricity cost (LEC) of about 11% [4]. However, all of these studies only considered plants without thermal energy storage (TES). Therefore, a system analysis including integrated TES was performed by Flagsol GmbH and DLR together with Solar Millennium AG, Schott CSP GmbH and Senior Berghöfer GmbH, all Germany. Two types of plants are analyzed and compared in detail: a power plant with synthetic oil and a DSG power plant. The design of the synthetic oil plant is very similar to the Spanish Andasol plants [5] and includes a molten salt two-tank storage system. The DSG plant has main steam parameters of 500 °C and 112 bars and uses phase change material (PCM) for the latent and molten salt for the sensible part of the TES system. To enable comparability, both plants share the same gross electric turbine capacity of 100 MWel, the same TES capacity of nine hours of full load equivalent and the same solar multiple of the collector field of about two. This paper describes and compares both plants' design, performance and investment. Based on these results, the LEC are calculated and the DSG plant's potential is evaluated. One key finding is that with currently proposed DSG storage costs, the LEC of a DSG plant could be higher than those of a synthetic oil plant. When considering a plant without TES on the other hand, the DSG system could reduce the LEC. This underlines the large influence of TES and the still needed effort in the development of a commercial storage system for DSG.

Molten salt is an effective and affordable method of storing thermal energy. Current salt storage systems charge at temperatures between 390°C and 585°C (oil filled parabolic trough systems to molten salt towers). It is highly desirable to increase the operating temperature of salt storage systems in order to increase the efficiency of the power cycle and to permit the use of alternative, high-temperature cycles. However, higher salt temperatures cause increased reactivity and thus increased corrosion rates in many materials. In order to utilize molten salt at higher temperature, it is necessary to test and understand these corrosion interactions at elevated temperature. A corrosion test system has been designed and built for evaluating molten salt/material interactions to 700°C. The primary components of this system are several salt containment vessels that are constructed of 6″ dia. × 24″ long stainless steel, aluminum diffusion treated pipes with flat plate welded to one end and a flanged lid on the other. The vessels are designed to operate with a charge of 10 kg of molten salt and accommodate a ""sample tree"" on which corrosion test coupons may be suspended. The salt vessels are heated and insulated on the bottom half, roughly to the salt fill level, and cooled on the top half to protect the flange gasket and feedthrough ports. The samples trees have a stainless plate that reduces radiative heat transfer from the molten salt to the lid. Finite element analysis was performed to determine the pipe length and heating and cooling requirements to maintain molten salt at 700°C while limiting the lid gasket to 300°C or less. The vessels are designed to have an oxygen atmosphere in the ullage region to mitigate nitrate decomposition. Oxygen systems for operation at 700°C require careful design including the sizing, routing, cleanliness, and material selection of components in order to reduce risk of fire. Additionally, the system is designed to run at 1-2 psig which requires specialized low pressure / high temperature components. In this paper we present the design of the molten salt corrosion test system including details related to the containment vessels, oxygen handling system, and control software along with a discussion of the safety considerations necessary for these high temperature, high oxygen partial pressure tests.

Raising the steam process temperature and pressure can lead to a cost reduction due to increased overall plant efficiency. Thus, for new receiver configurations a supercritical steam cycle operated at 300 bar / 600°C / 610°C live steam conditions was assumed. The considered systems include innovative direct absorption receivers, either with conventional or beam down heliostat field layouts. For the beam down option the receiver is assumed to be a cylindrical vessel with a flow-through porous absorber structure at the internal lateral area of the cylinder. The direct absorption receiver option consists of a cylindrical barrel with downwards oriented aperture, whose absorber structure at the internal lateral area is cooled by a molten salt film. For the assessment, CFD based methods were developed to be able to examine the receiver efficiency characteristics. Based on the receiver thermal efficiency characteristics and the solar field characteristics the annual performance is evaluated using hourly time series. The assessment methodology is based on the European Concentrated Solar Thermal Roadmap (ECOSTAR) study and enables the prediction of the annual performance and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Applying appropriate cost assumptions from literature the LCOE were estimated for each considered SPT concept and compared to tubular receiver concepts with molten salt and liquid metal cooling. The power level of the compared concepts and the reference case is 200 MW el. The sensitivity of the specific cost assumptions was analyzed. No detailed evaluation was done for the thermal storage, but comparable storage utilization and costs were assumed for all cases. At optimized plant parameters the results indicate a LCOE reduction potential of up to 0.5% for beam down and of up to 7.2% for the direct absorption receiver compared to today's state of the art molten salt solar tower technology.

One way of addressing this is through the use of supplemental energy storage. While the technology for the latter has not been proven on a large scale or to be economical at the present time, some assessments of what magnitude is required can be made. In performing this work we have used NREL's Solar Advisor Model (SAM 2010) with TMY3 solar data to estimate the photovoltaic system power generation. Climatic conditions close to load centers were chosen for the simulations. Then the PV output for varying sizes of arrays were examined and the impact of varying amounts of storage investigated. The storage was characterized by maximum limiting energy and power capacities based on annual hourly peak load, as well as its charging and discharging efficiencies. The simulations were performed using hourly time steps with energy withdrawn from, or input to, storage only after considering base generation and the PV system output in serving the grid load. In this work, we examined the load matching capability of solar PV generation (orientated for maximum summer output) for a sample Southwestern US utility grid load of 2008. Specifically we evaluated the daily and seasonal peak load shifting with employing varying storage capacities.

Theoretical heat transfer modeling of a 100 kWht storage system was performed, candidate phase change materials were tested, and mechanical material removal experiments were conducted.

Storing sun's energy in the form of latent thermal energy of a phase change material (PCM) is desirable for use on demand including times when solar energy is unavailable. Considering a latent thermal energy storage (LTES) system incorporating heat pipes to enhance heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and the PCM, this paper explores the dynamic response of the LTES system subjected to repeated cycles of charging and discharging. A transient computational analysis of a shell-and-tube LTES embedded with two horizontal heat pipes (HHP) is performed for repeated charging and discharging of the PCM to analyze the dynamic performance of the LTES and the augmentation in the cyclic performance of the LTES embedded with heat pipes is investigated. A model low temperature phase change material system is considered in the present study, with the physical results being scalable to high temperature systems used in CSP plants.

However, at temperatures of 500°C and beyond the thermo-mechanical properties of ordinary concrete change significantly. This paper presents seven concrete mixtures of various material components and proportions that were developed and tested for resistance to temperatures up to 500°C. After exposure to 10 thermal cycles from ambient temperature to 500°C, six of the seven mixtures maintained in excess of 50% of their mechanical properties. This result is favorable for concrete to be used as a thermal energy storage medium. With concrete exhibiting acceptable mechanical and thermal properties at very high temperatures, the amount of energy stored per unit volume is increased, higher steam temperatures are available to facilitate power generation and the concrete can last for the design lifetime of the power generating system into which it is integrated.

Extraction and injection of heat from/into the water-saturated sand with a single thermosiphon unit representing a cell in an array of thermosiphons is modeled.

Historical electricity and non-spinning reserve prices were used to calculate the economic feasibility of CAES in each of the zones in ERCOT. The analysis found that with perfect knowledge of future prices a CAES facility would be economically attractive over the period of years considered, and the non-spinning reserve ancillary service market provided a substantial contribution to the overall revenue of the facility. Optimal input power capacity for the entire period of 2002 through 2010 was found to be about one-quarter of the output capacity in the Houston, South, and North zones in ERCOT and one-half the output power capacity in the West zone in ERCOT. Optimal storage capacity was found to be about 17 hours in the Houston, South, and North zones and 31 hours in the West zone. Optimal values for individual years varied significantly, as did revenues. The negative electricity prices that have occurred historically in the West zone are the consequence of wind generators and lack of transmission capacity to export electricity; this effect gives CAES greater opportunity to perform price arbitrage and improves the economics of such a facility.

Solar energy is an ideal solution because it does not have the environmental impact of the fossil fuels. One key to the transition to solar energy is improved energy storage for when collection is prohibited by weather variation and during nighttime hours. Concrete has a low material cost and is reported to be $1/kWhthermal[1]. Concrete as a sensible heat thermal energy storage material has been tested to temperatures of 390°C with an embedded steel heat exchanger using synthetic oil as a heat transfer fluid [2]. The energy storage efficiency of concrete can be improved by raising the maximum charging temperature. This paper reports the testing to further the peak temperature to 450-500°C by using high performance concrete developed by the University of Arkansas. A molten nitrate salt was selected along with stainless steel heat exchanger. The testing is of a laboratory scale with a single 3/4 inch pipe imbedded in a 4 inch by 4 inch concrete cross section. During testing, the differences in the materials' thermal expansion produce stress at the pipe/concrete interaction zone. After testing with no interface material, the high tensile stress in the concrete caused large radial and longitudinal tension cracks that would hinder adequate heat transfer. Three interface materials between the concrete and stainless steel pipe were tested: Teflon© tape, Deacon 8875, and aluminum foil. For Teflon tape and Deacon 8875, the concrete stress was minimized and produced only small micro-cracks. To improve the heat transfer in the concrete, testing of a pipe with radial fins was conducted. The pipe consisted of a continuous helicoidal, auger style. During testing, large cracks occurred at each of the fin locations which demonstrated the need for a stress reducing material. Yet, only Deacon 8875 and aluminum foil were able to be applied to the unique radial fins. The results of the testing are reported and compared in the article. The Teflon® tape had the fastest heat transfer of all the interface materials. Testing was considered a success on a single tube laboratory scale. Future multiple tube testing is a viable option.

The first generation of trough collectors (LS1) used in SEGS I showed an aperture area of about 120 m2 (1'292 ft2), having an aperture width of 2.5 m (8.2 ft). With the second generation collector (LS2), used in SEGS II to VI, the aperture width was doubled to 5 m (16.4 ft). The third generation (LS3) has been increased regarding width (5.76 m or 18.9 ft) and length (96 m or 315 ft) to about 550 m2 (5'920 ft2) aperture. It was used in the last SEGS plants VIII and IX, those plants having a capacity of 80 MW each. After more than 10 years stagnancy, several commercial plants in the US (the 64 MW Nevada Solar One project) and Spain (the ANDASOL projects, 50 MW each with 8 h thermal storage) started operation in 2007/2008. New collectors have been developed, but all are showing similar dimensions as either the LS2 or the LS3 collector. One reason for this is the limited availability of key components, mainly the parabolic shaped mirrors and heat collection elements. However, in order to reduce cost, solar power projects are getting larger and larger. Several projects in the range of 250 MW, with and without thermal storage system, are going to start construction in 2011, requiring solar field sizes of 1 to 2.5 Million m2. FLABEG, market leader of parabolic shaped mirrors and e.g. mirror supplier for all SEGS plants and most of the Spanish plants, has started the development of a new collector generation to serve the urgent market needs: lower cost and improved suitability for large solar fields. The new generation will utilize accordingly larger reflector panels and heat collection elements attended by advanced design, installation methods and control systems at the same time. The so-called 'Ultimate Trough' collector is showing an aperture area of 1'667 m2 (17'944 ft2), with an aperture width of 7.5 m (24.6 ft). Some design features are presented in this paper, showing how the new and huge dimensions could be realized without compromising stiffness, and bending of the support structure and improving the optical performance at the same time. Solar field layouts for large power plants are presented, and solar field cost savings in the range of 25% are disclosed.

The sizing model is described in an earlier paper. The transient model, written in TRNSYS, was developed to predict the performance of each storage system when coupled with a realistic solar field and powerblock. This effort includes the creation of a time and space discretized numerical, adaptive grid model and a suite of controllers. The model in TRNSYS was implemented to provide hourly or sub-hourly performance data for an entire CSP plant with passive storage. During the course of the work passive phase change material storage was the focus; although purely sensible passive storage systems, such as concrete and ceramic, were also considered. It was found that previous sizing model methodology developed in both industry and academia is insufficiently robust and does not produce trust-worthy sizing information when used to cost passive storage systems. Furthermore, it was found that, especially for passive TES systems, transient coupled system modeling is a requirement for correct size and cost calculations. Finally, it was found that the current figures of merit, namely cost per kWh LSC, are ineffective means of capturing the real comparative cost of a storage system. In the course of the work a new storage control paradigm for passive systems has been developed. Additionally, new modeling methodology, figures of merit, and performance sizing criteria are presented.

These new solar thermal power plants require innovative storage concepts, where the two phase heat transfer fluid poses a major challenge. A three-part storage system is proposed for the two phase fluid water/steam. Concrete storage is used for the process steps involving transfer of sensible heat - i.e. preheating of water and superheating of steam - while for the two-phase evaporation a phase change material (PCM) storage will be deployed. This technology is currently developed by DLR and Ed. Züblin AG within the project ITES, funded partly by the German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. A combined storage solution with a 22 m3 concrete storage test module for superheating of steam and a 8.5 m3 PCM-storage for evaporation of water was build in 2009 in a direct steam test loop, set up at the power plant Litoral of Endesa in Carboneras, Spain. This high temperature storage system has a total capacity of approx. 1000 kWh and it will be the first demonstration of such a combined storage system for the two phase heat transfer fluid water/steam. Commissioning was completed in 2010, implying first heating-up of the concrete storage to expel the excess water in the concrete, first heating-up of the PCM storage including final filling of the storage with salt. Cycling tests for each storage unit separately are in progress. Combined testing will start in 2011. Results on the commissioning and testing will be reported in the paper.

Typical HVAC systems use a combination of high quality energy from combustion and electricity to overcome relatively small temperature differences between the building and the environment. It is possible to achieve the heating/cooling necessary to maintain comfort in a building without these high quality energy sources and their high potential-energy destruction. A low-exergy heating and cooling system seeks to better match the quality of energy to the loads of the building and thus to minimize exergy destruction and increase the exergetic efficiency of the building's heating and cooling system. The method described here for low exergy building system design begins by minimizing overall heating and cooling loads using a tight, highly-insulated envelope and passive solar design strategies. Next a low-exergy heating and cooling system is designed that uses hydronic radiant heating and cooling in floors, along with high thermal mass. The large surface area of the floors enable low fluid flow rates and relatively small temperature differences to achieve heat transfer rates that would traditionally be driven by high temperature differentials and flows. The building uses a solar wall to passively drive ventilation requirements and earth tubes to condition the ventilation air.

The goal of this research is to analyze an integrated energy system (named DSWiSS for dispatchable solar wind storage system) that includes a novel configuration of wind and solar together with compressed air energy storage (CAES) that is driven from excess nighttime wind energy and thermal storage energized by concentrated solar power in order to make these sources dispatchable during peak demand. Notably, existing CAES facilities use natural gas for heating the compressed air before its expansion through a turbine; the system described in this paper replaces the use of natural gas with solar energy and thermal storage, thereby obviating the need for fossil fuels and yielding a dispatchable system powered completely by renewable sources. This paper builds off prior published work for the DSWiSS configuration with an analysis of temporally-resolved parameters, including wind and solar resources, which are important to the operation of DSWiSS. This analysis uses actual historical meteorological data for West Texas solar insolation, telemetry data for wind power in West Texas, and recorded electricity demand data of the ERCOT grid to assess system performance. We examined how the daily variation of these parameters could affect the operation of an energy storage facility such as DSWiSS. We found that the daily fluctuations were most pronounced in the summer when demand is highest and wind velocity is lowest. However, because all seasons show a time-of-day phase mismatch between demand and wind velocity, we expect that a load leveling energy storage technology would be useful to the electric grid. Research to be completed soon will attempt to use control strategies along with the existing thermodynamic model of the DSWiSS power system to determine how DSWiSS would be operated differently under the different seasonal situations.

The major disadvantage of phase change materials (PCMs) is their low thermal conductivities, which drastically slows the phase change process and causes wide temperature variations within PCMs, while requiring heat transfer area. Metal foams are one class of porous media that possess thermal conductivities that are an order of magnitude higher than PCMs. When embedded in PCMs, the random internal structure and high porosity of metal foam enhance and accelerate the phase change process without significantly reducing PCMs' heat storage capacity. Unlike traditional PCM systems, the distribution of the foam ligaments in PCMs makes the melting and solidification processes uniform and less dependent on location inside PCMs. This also leads to shorter charging and discharging times. The design, fabrication and characterization of a small PCM-metal-foam thermal storage system are described in this paper. The core of the system is a cylindrical shell composed of 90%-porous open-cell aluminum foam filled with Paraffin-based PCM. The foam occupies only 10% of the total volume. The shell walls were fabricated from copper. The system was tested in an open loop wind tunnel. Results for the convection heat transfer coefficient and the effect of volumetric flow rate on the system's performance were obtained. The heat transfer rate from the system was computed and discussed.

This work examines the impacts of variable generation, including uncertainty, ramp rate, ramp range, and potentially excess generation. Time-series simulations were performed in the Texas (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power provide up to 80% of the electric demand. Different enabling technologies were examined, including conventional generator flexibility, demand response, load shifting, and energy storage. A variety of combinations of these technologies enabled low levels of surplus or curtailed wind and solar generation depending on the desired penetration of renewable sources. At lower levels of penetration (up to about 30% on an energy basis) increasing flexible generation, combined with demand response may be sufficient to accommodate variability and uncertainty. Introduction of load-shifting through real-time pricing or other market mechanisms further increases the penetration of variable generation. The limited time coincidence of wind and solar generation presents increasing challenges as these sources provide greater than 50% of total demand. System flexibility must be increased to the point of virtually eliminating must-run baseload generators during periods of high wind and solar generation. Energy storage also becomes increasingly important as lower cost flexibility options are exhausted. The study examines three classes of energy storage - electricity storage, including batteries and pumped hydro, hybrid storage (compressed-air energy storage), and thermal energy storage. Ignoring long-distance transmission options, a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about 12 hours of average demand may keep renewable energy curtailment below 10% in the simulated system.

The combination of renewable power generation and energy storage can overcome the variability of renewable power generation alone and create the opportunity for renewable generation to provide base-load electricity. For peak power usage, the integration of renewable power and storage of excess electricity has several significant and positive impacts: expanding the renewable energy portion of total electricity generation, improving the peak-load response, and coordinating the electricity supply and demand over the grid. Several energy storage approaches exist, with mechanical, chemical, and electrical methods either in use now or being developed. Comparing their efficiencies as well as their economic uses for different scales and applications helps determine the right technology for the right purpose.

These ambient resources include ambient air at dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, ground temperature at locations where the soil is cooler than the indoor comfort temperature, and night-sky radiant temperature, which is substantially lower than ambient air in most climates. The focus of this study was on comparing these sources to cooling loads across climates in the US. Using a degree-day approach, annual cooling potentials were calculated for over 800 TMY3 locations. Color-themed maps for each ambient source at several indoor comfort temperature ranges were constructed as visual references for design purposes. In addition, eight US cities (Denver, CO, Los Angeles, CA, Louisville, KY, Madison, WI, Miami, FL, New Orleans, LA, Phoenix, AZ and Washington DC) were selected to represent a range of climate characteristics, including seasonal ambient temperature, diurnal temperature swings, humidity and sky clearness. For each city, an ambient potential to cooling load ratio (ALR) was calculated, with the potential based on an indoor comfort temperature range of 68°F - 72°F and the load calculated with a base temperature of 65°F. ALR, which neglects phase lags between source and load and the associated need for thermal storage, exceeded one for dry-bulb air and for ground temperature for all locations except Miami, New Orleans and Phoenix. Wet-bulb ALR exceeded one for all locations except Miami, and sky ALR exceeded one for all locations. Finally, the effect of limited thermal storage was estimated by calculating daily ambient source fraction, fas, which is the daily ambient cooling potential divided by the daily cooling load. f as thus approximates the cooling potential of systems with one day's worth of thermal storage, and has an upper limit of one. Fas, the annual sum of fas, equaled one for ground temperature for Los Angeles and Madison and for sky temperature for Denver and Los Angeles. Fas for ground temperature was above 0.9 for all locations except Miami, New Orleans and Phoenix. Fas for sky temperature exceeded 0.6 for all locations. By utilizing all possible combinations of ambient sources, half of the selected locations attained Fas equal to one and the minimum for all locations still exceeded 0.65.

Modifying velocity field is the most direct approach to enhance convective heat transfer. However, in most cases the optimal velocity field is unknown and difficult to find even for an experienced researcher. In this paper, a predictive optimization methodology in convective heat transfer enhancement based on minimum entropy generation (MEG) principle was developed. A set of Euler's equations were derived by the variation calculus to the Lagrange function established by governing equations, specific constraints and objective functional - total entropy generation rate. The solution of these equations resulted in the optimal velocity fields, leading to the minimum entropy generation. To validate and demonstrate the future application of this methodology to solar absorbers used to convert concentrated solar energy, the steady laminar convection heat transfer process in a two-dimensional channel with fixed heat flux boundaries was optimized for given total viscous dissipations. The numerical simulation results showed that lower value of maximum wall temperature was obtained by MEG optimization, which means cheaper and safer materials. The present work indicated that the new methodology could be a good guide in convective heat transfer enhancement design work, especially in CSP receivers.

A smarter grid is one that utilizes communications and information systems to achieve more flexible grid operations. Energy storage and more broadly, load shifting, is one mechanism for achieving flexible grid operations. Unlike demand response, permanent load shifting moves energy on a regular basis, from peak to off-peak. Technologies that can deliver load shifting include thermal storage, electrical and mechanical storage and process shifting. This paper highlights findings from a recent study, mandated by a California Public Utilities Commission order, of permanent load shifting (PLS) opportunities located at customer sites in California. We developed a cost-effectiveness framework to estimate the costs and benefits of PLS technologies, demonstrated the framework with an analysis of PLS systems, and evaluated the market for PLS, including an assessment of challenges to expanding PLS. The cost-effectiveness analysis included a technology-neutral scenario analysis and an evaluation of technology-specific cases. Grid-level benefits of load shifting range from approximately $500-$2500/peak kW. Among the case studies, some approaches, such as refrigerated warehouse precooling, are cost-effective for both the utility and the consumer, while others, such as flow batteries, are not yet cost-effective and can be viewed as emerging technologies. Due to the wide range of technology costs and performance, these results are unsurprising. Still, PLS technologies can be one tool that can help set the stage for integrating large amounts of renewables in the future, a road California is paving.

In a thermocline storage system, heat transfer fluid (HTF) from the collection field is simultaneously stored at both excited and dead thermal states inside a single tank. A granulated porous medium included in the tank provides thermal mass for storage and reduces the amount of HTF volume required. While the thermocline offers a low-cost storage option, thermal ratcheting of the tank wall (generated by filler material reorientation from continuous thermal cycling) poses a significant design concern. A comprehensive simulation of the 170 MWh t thermocline tank used in conjunction with the Solar One pilot plant is performed with a multi-dimensional two-temperature computational fluid dynamics model. In operation from 1982 to 1986, this tank was subject to extensive instrumentation, including multiple strain gages along the tank wall to monitor hoop stress. Temperature profiles along the wall material are extracted from the simulation results to compute hoop stress via finite element models and compared with the original gage data. While the strain gages experienced large uncertainty, the stresses computed from the simulation agree reasonably well with the experimental measurements.

Solar thermal and photovoltaic systems with short term storage are used in this study. A small commercial site in Southern Europe is investigated. The HLRP method is based on using the ratio of the thermal load to the required power as the scaling parameter to analyze a hybrid fuel cell based tri-generation system in terms of performance parameters. The performance parameters, energy utilization factor, carbon dioxide and exergy destruction per total energy load, are reported in a series of graphs. The HLRP analysis is based on ideal performance of the power producing devices and practical performance parameters of all heat transfer devices. The alternative energy systems included in this analysis include state-of-the art performance measures. The previous publications on the HLRP method have focused on its development with short examples that illustrate how it operates as an effective, initial screening tool and limited cost factors. In this paper the application of the HLRP method as an early screening tool to determine the general outline of an efficient, total energy solution is detailed. The tool will be used to compare different solutions based on the fuel consumption (energy utilization factor), carbon dioxide production, exergy destruction and costs. The tradeoffs of reducing costs or increasing carbon dioxide production are illustrated. The solutions are based on a process using regression curves of the generalized graphs. The correlation coefficient for these regression relationships is greater than 0.996. In addition, refinement of the HLRP technique that reports carbon dioxide production and exergy destruction in terms of total energy rather than thermal loads has been adopted. Combining the generalized performance of the fuel consuming components with renewable energy sources leads to a solution based on balancing cost, minimizing fuel consumption or carbon dioxide production.

Concentrated sunlight penetrates and is absorbed within a passive molten salt pool, also acting as a single-tank assisted thermocline storage system. The receiver has a relatively small aperture, open to the environment without requiring a transparent window to isolate the system, exhibiting low losses while achieving high temperatures needed for efficient power generation. The use of an insulated divider plate provides a physical and thermal barrier to separate the hot and cold salt layers within the receiver. The position of the divider plate is controlled throughout the day to enhance the natural thermocline which forms within the salt. As a result, continuous, high temperature heat extraction is possible even as the average temperature of the salt is declining. Experimental results are presented for an optically heated 5 L capacity sodium-potassium nitrate salt volumetric receiver equipped with a movable divider plate.

Increased operating temperatures are necessary to lower the cost of solar-generated electricity by improving efficiencies and reducing thermal energy storage costs. Durable new materials are needed to cope with operating temperatures > 600°C. The current coating technology (Pyromark High Temperature paint) has a solar absorptance in excess of 0.95 but a thermal emittance greater than 0.8, which results in large thermal losses at high temperatures. In addition, because solar receivers operate in air, these coatings have long term stability issues that add to the operating costs of CSP facilities. Ideal absorbers must have high solar absorptance (>0.95) and low thermal emittance (<0.3 at receiver surface operating temperatures), be stable in air, and be low-cost and readily manufacturable. Recent efforts at Sandia National Laboratories have begun to address the issue of more efficient solar selective coatings for tower applications. This paper will present an overview of these efforts which address the development of new coatings on several fronts.

During a rapid heating of reactive ceramics in RRC-reactor by irradiation of a high flux concentrated solar beam to around 1800K, the beam energy is directly absorbed by formation of an excess amount of the Frenkel defect in nonequilibrium state of the reactive ceramics without releasing the O2 gas (Step 1; beam energy absorption step). When the temperature reaches around 1800K, the O 2 releasing reaction takes place and the reactive ceramics is reduced (Step 2; O2 releasing step). By rotating the RRC-reactor, the surface of reduced reactive ceramics comes to closely face to the surface of the top of GTS-tank. By introducing O2 gas into the space between the two surfaces, the reduced ceramics can be oxidized. The calorification energy produced by the oxidation can be transferred to GTS-tank through its surface. (Step 3; calorification and heat transfer step). The heat is successively transferred and stored in GTS-tank by continuous rotation of RRC-reactor (Sep 4; storage step). The high flux of the concentrated solar beam in the Beam-down concentration system can be averaged in the range of 800-1500kW/m2 in Step 3 by the present process.

For most of this time these inorganic fluids have been restricted to use in central receiver platforms due to the useful working temperature range of the most widely researched formulation, a near eutectic mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate, which melts at 220°C and is stable in air to nearly 580°C. Recent research efforts have led to the development of nitrate salt mixtures that melt at lower temperatures and are suitable for use in parabolic trough systems. These mixtures include three or more components and generally have melting points in the range of 100°C, with stability in air up to 500°C. The design of parabolic trough systems that utilize molten salt heat transfer fluids is complicated by the fact that the properties of these fluids are considerably different from the organic heat transfer fluids that they may replace. In this paper we present measured thermophysical property data for several commercial and noncommercial molten salt mixtures that can be used in the system level design of parabolic trough and central receiver power plants. The data presented include heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, viscosity, all as a function of temperature, along with melting point and thermal stability limits. Some properties, such as density, can be predicted by simple mixing rules. The dependence of viscosity was strongly influenced by the composition of the molten salts and, particularly, the proportion of calcium nitrate.

The evolved O2 gas (3.48ml/g) and H2 gas (7.00ml/g) for Ce0.97Sc 0.03O1.985 are higher than those of Ce 0.9Zr0.1O2, indicating that Sc-doping enhances the two step water splitting reactivity compared to the Zr-doping. The molar ratio of the H2 and O2 gases is nearly two, which suggests nearly completion of each step reaction for the H2O decomposition. The O2-releasing reactivity of Sc-doped ceria (Ce 0.97Sc0.03O1.985) is nearly the same as that of Zr-doped one (Ce0.9Zr0.1O2), whereas the H2-generation reactivity is much different due to improvement of the H2-generation reactivity by Sc-doping. To examine the reason for the improvement, the ionic conductivity of Sc-doped and Zr-doped ceria has been measured with AC impedance spectroscopy. The activation energies of bulk conduction estimated from the impedance measurement are 1.09eV (Sc-doped) and 1.48eV (Zr-doped), respectively, in the temperature range of 400-800°C. This indicates that the oxygen deficient site movement of the Sc-doped ceria is more active than Zr-doped ceria. It could be said that the anion site can move more readily toward the surface of the ceramics by Sc-doping. This would facilitate the oxygen storage process (the H2-generation reaction).

While thermal storage may be appropriate for solar trough and tower plants, additional approaches for storage might prove to be beneficial for other types of generation schemes. One approach to storage that has been examined to varying degrees over the years is Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). Compressed air can be supplied to large size tanks or underground caverns, and later this stored air can be used to generate power to shave the peak demand of electricity or maintain nearly uniform levels of power generation. The tank discharge process is time dependent on the temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate of the air leaving. Of course, this time dependency also affects the power output of the system. In the following analysis an attempt was given to determine: 1-an analysis of the charging and discharging processes; 2- a power-time relation during the discharge process; 3- an approximation for the size required for a certain energy generated (m3/MW h) as a function of the initial air pressure; 4- a relation between the discharge area and the time to stabilize the mass flow; and 5- a supplemental heat input is examined in the discharge process to maintain nearly constant discharge power. Using a thermodynamic analysis for the system the power-time history is found.

The paper presented work on the effective combined thermal energy storage concept to overcome this limitation. The combined thermal energy storage system is composed of a latent heat storage unit using sodium nitrate as a PCM and a sensible heat storage unit using concrete as a solid storage medium. The paper gave an overview of the principle and previous work on both individual storage concepts as well as the combined operation. Commissioning and testing of a combined storage demonstration system with a total storage capacity of approximately 1000 kWh was described. It is the first demonstration of such a combined storage system for the two-phase heat transfer fluid water/steam. The system operates under pressure and temperature conditions as they occur in a DSG power plant with the main steam parameters of 110 bar and 400°C. The combined operation of a PCM storage module for evaporating water and a concrete storage module for superheating steam in sliding pressure mode was successfully demonstrated. Good system operability of the single systems and the combined mode was achieved. For large scale implementation of such a storage system, the single storage modules will be increased to a feasible module size. Then, the required storage capacity for the evaporation section will be built by connecting PCM modules in parallel. For the superheating section, the required number of concrete modules can be designed in series and in parallel. This modular setup makes it easy to deliver a specified storage capacity. As the next step, a scale-up to pre-commercial scale of 10-20 MWh capacity is planned.",,"Combined operations; Current limitation; Direct steam generation; Module size; Pressure and temperature; Scale-up; Sensible heat storages; Sliding pressure; Sodium nitrates; Solar thermal power plants; Steam parameters; Storage capacity; Storage medium; Storage modules; Storage systems; Thermal energy storage systems; Two-phase heat transfer; Heat transfer; Ion selective electrodes; Sodium; Steam generators; Steam power plants; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873882047

The control of the auxiliary energy input both in time and power is important to utilize as much as possible of the solar energy available from the collectors and also to use low backup energy prices during the day if electricity is used. The storage function and both stratified charging and extraction of heat, are very important, to separate different temperature zones in the storage. This paper describes a step towards forecast control for electricity based auxiliary energy sources. It can be either direct electric heating elements or a heat pump upgrading ambient energy in the air, ground, solar collector or waste heat from the house. The paper describes system modeling and simulation results. Advanced laboratory experiments are also starting now with three different combisystems, operating in parallel. These systems will be briefly described too.",,"Auxiliary energy; Energy prices; Forecast control; Heat pumps; Laboratory experiments; Seasonal storage; Small systems; Solar combisystems; Solar fraction; Storage function; Stratified charging; System modeling and simulation; Temperature zone; Computer simulation; Heating; Ion selective electrodes; Solar equipment; Waste heat; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873881217

The thermal processes that constitute the cycle are carried out in devices designed for maximum individual efficiency. In order to achieve this, it is necessary for the evaporative process (in which an air current is humidified) to happen at the highest temperature attainable without boiling. This maximizes the amount of vapor that can be carried by the air current. This process is performed in a vertical packed tower, where a stream of hot water falls as a current of hot air ascends in countercurrent and directly contacts the water. The air at the exit of the tower is saturated with vapor at the same temperature as the entering water, thus maximizing the amount of moisture carried. The hot and humid air then passes through a condenser that releases heat to the atmosphere, bringing air nearly to ambient temperature and maximizing distillate condensation. In order to achieve the previous, it is necessary for the thermal capture and storage system to work with thermal oil, an insulated storage tank, and evacuated-tube solar collectors. The system must maintain a steady oil temperature of 110°C. We propose a condenser based on heat pipes and with excess surface area for dumping heat to the atmosphere, in order for the condensation temperature to be as close as possible to atmospheric. The efficiency of the distiller is substantially increased by forcing the process to occur between the described temperature limits, not unlike what happens in the power cycles of heat engines. The thermal oil transfers energy to the air and water currents through two heat exchangers, and the insulated storage tank makes it possible to operate the system at night as long as sufficiently hot oil is still available. A flow control system regulates the temperature reached by the water that flows to the evaporation tower. The described system was modeled in the simulation platform TRNSYS, which incorporated modeling of the evaporation tower and condenser. Using the climatic conditions of the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, we performed a parametric study of the system and determined the effect of varying the number of solar collectors, volume of the thermal tank, and flow rate of water. We simulated the behavior of the system over a year of continued operation, measuring the amount of condensate produced during that period. The objective of this analysis was to determine the variation of distillate production, in kilograms of water distilled per year per square meter of solar collector, and per cubic meter of thermal tank. This was used to determine the optimal characteristics of the proposed distillation system.",,"Air currents; Climatic conditions; Condensation temperature; Counter current; Distillation systems; Evaporative process; Highest temperature; Hot air; Hot oil; Hot water; Humid air; Humidification-dehumidification; Me-xico; Oil temperature; Packed tower; Parametric analysis; Parametric study; Power cycle; Simulation platform; Solar water distillation system; Storage systems; Storage tank; Surface area; Temperature limits; Thermal process; Water currents; Condensation; Distillation equipment; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Humidity control; Ion selective electrodes; Optimization; Solar collectors; Tanks (containers); Water vapor; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873880467

However due to the intermittent nature of this energy source, it has not been used for baseload power. This problem can be solved by implementing an efficient, economical and reliable latent heat (LH) energy storage strategy. An accurate heat transfer analysis will play an important role to make this strategy successful. This work presents a 2D numerical model of the diffusion-natural convective controlled heat transfer during an unconstrained (solid-liquid density difference) melting process of an encapsulated spherical thermal energy storage (TES) capsule filled with an inorganic salt as the phase change material (PCM). The melting of the PCM was modeled using the finite volume numerical procedure with a single-domain enthalpy formulation. Transient numerical simulations were performed using the CFD software Ansys-Fluent V 12.1. A detailed parametric analysis was carried out in order to analyze the geometrical and operational effects of the system and their influence on the charging times. The study focused on PCMs with melting point between 300°C to 400°C and metal coating materials subjected to a uniform wall temperature from 73°C to 93°C above the mean melting temperature of the PCM. The temperature profiles and interface positions for different Rayleigh, Stefan and Fourier numbers are determined. Computational results of this study show that for a fixed Stefan number (Ste=0.694) there is a significant difference in the flow fields for cases with Rayleigh number from 9.17×106 to 7.33×107.","Energy storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Renewable energy","Base-load power; CFD softwares; Coating material; Computational results; Concentrated solar power; Density difference; Energy source; Finite volume; Fourier numbers; Future energies; Heat transfer analysis; Inorganic salts; Interface position; Melting process; Numerical procedures; Parametric analysis; Parametric study; Phase Change Material (PCM); Phase-change thermal storages; Rayleigh; Rayleigh number; Renewable energies; Single domains; Solid-liquid; Stefan numbers; Temperature profiles; Transient numerical simulation; Wall temperatures; Energy management; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Ion selective electrodes; Latent heat; Melting point; Phase change materials; Solar power generation; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873876320

This technology using a Stirling engine fed with solar energy means a promising development regarding power generation. The value of efficiency of this technology, around 30% of normal direct solar radiation, is the highest when compared with other solar energy generation systems. However, the dish-Stirling technology has not achieved enough advancement to be really competitive with other renewable energy technologies. The competitiveness must take into account technical, economic and environmental issues. A state-of-the art review has been carried out in order to identify the developments needed to guarantee the feasibility of using the dish-Stirling technology for energy production, further than demonstration facilities that have been operated so far. The economic feasibility of dish-Stirling depends highly on equipment amortization, so the continuous operation of the system is a key factor. It would also improve the environmental impact since it means to decrease the environmental load of facility construction, due to the fact that this facility would be used for more time than exclusively operating from sun energy. The developments enabling this use are, on one hand the system hybridization, in such a way that guarantees the operation of the system with other energy sources when solar is lower than nominal operation value or is not available. On the other hand the thermal storage, providing system operation with stored energy during some periods such as transients. The stored energy would be obtained from excess of sun radiation in relation to nominal operation value.

Africa has the world's best solar resources. Several countries have exploited solar energy for water heating, crop drying, medical applications, and telecommunications, among other things (Davidson et al., 2007). Solar energy can contribute to supply heat energy in households of Sub-Saharan African countries. A small scale dish concentrating solar energy system is being developed at the Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. The system comprises of the collector, the heat storage and the oven. The main structure of the system has been constructed, consisting of the dish reflector, the sun tracker and the piping mechanism. An infrared camera was used to scan the temperature of the concentrated heat. The maximum temperature reached so far is 350°C. The experimental focal area was found by mapping the reflections of the whole reflective surface. The shape of the receiver/absorber obtained by the scanning process is semi-spherical. 3D hemispherical absorbers with 110 mm < d < 220 m need to be used and investigated.

In several publications the effect on the system performance is discussed based on simulations and/or test sequences which are representing constricted operating conditions (Han, 2009; Logie, 2010; Lohse, 2010). To achieve a more compelling assessment based on experiments, a combisystem with four different storage and storage integration concepts were tested under realistic load conditions, using the Concise Cycle Test (CCT) method. The common features of all tested systems are the auxiliary heater and the solar collectors as well as the storage volume. Different hydraulic schemes were used for the systems tested to connect these components with the storage. Both immersed and external heat exchangers were used for charging (by the solar collectors) and discharging (domestic hot water preparation) the storage. The experiments revealed a considerable range of annual fuel consumption (+/- 5 %) to cover an identical load, although only the charging and discharging strategies at the storage has been changed whereas the components for heat supply and the energy demand were identical. In the system configurations tested, the integration of the condensing heating oil fired boiler turned out to be particularly important because the utilisation of latent heat (condensation) is strongly dependent to the resulting return temperatures of the boiler. Furthermore it was shown that the integration of a stratification device for volume flows entering the store leads to a fuel reduction, even in a system whose hydraulic scheme and control strategy were optimised to charge and discharge the thermal energy store according to the storage temperatures. The system that uses an immersed coil heat exchanger for domestic hot water preparation had to keep a particularly large part of the thermal energy store at high temperatures to be able to cover the comfort requirements. In the case investigated, in combination with a store that has considerable heat losses this led to a less efficient system (- 5 %) compared to tests with a buffer store and external domestic hot water heat exchanger.",,"Auxiliary heater; Charge and discharge; Control strategies; Cycle tests; Domestic hot water; Domestic hot water preparation; Efficient systems; Energy demands; Experimental investigations; Fired boiler; Fuel reduction; Heat supply; High temperature; Identical load; Large parts; Load condition; Operating condition; Solar thermal; Storage temperatures; Storage volumes; System configurations; System efficiency; Test sequence; Volume flow; Energy management; Experiments; Heat exchangers; Hot water distribution systems; Integration; Ion selective electrodes; Solar collectors; Thermal energy; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873861479

Many different solar cooking technologies, particularly on a household level, have been developed and distributed around the world. Solar cooker promoters advertise the use of solar cookers due to their several benefits for its users and the environment. However, a widespread implementation of these technologies could not be reached so far. The reasons for this are several, such as cultural, economic and technical dimensions. In order to make solar cooking more acceptable among its users, more research has to be undertaken regarding the social aspects of solar cooking. In academic circles solar cooking has been widely viewed from a ""technological-driven approach"" (Wentzel & Pouris, 2007) without focusing on the economic, social and cultural factors which vary between the contexts where solar cooking projects are implemented and which thus play an important role for the adoption of solar cooking. Particularly, there has been a lack of solar cooking on an institutional level. Much focus has been given among solar cooking developers and producers related to household applications while solar cooking technologies for institutional applications have been very limited developed. Solar cooking on an institutional level could be an option particularly for health centers which rely heavily on biomass in their energy supply or which suffer from an unreliable and unaffordable electricity grid. The most distributed institutional solar cooker presents the Scheffler community kitchen called after its inventor Wolfgang Scheffler. However, a wide range of these solar cooking systems have been implemented in India while in an African context the system is only limited applied. The question remains why solar cooking is so much more successful in India than in an African context. This paper aims to contribute to this debate with a case study of Mozambique. Mozambique is a country with a high amount of solar radiation and high use of firewood which should make it to an ideal country for solar cooking. However, despite all this, solar cooking has been only undertaken on a very small level within the country and is mainly based on small household applications. In this way I want to examine more of the reasons for why Mozambique has so limited solar cooking activities. The aim is to investigate the possibilities and limitations of institutional solar cooking in Mozambique with focus on health care centers in the closer surroundings of Maputo and Beira. The data of this paper is based on an extensive fieldwork including interviews with governmental officials, different health care centers and solar cooking promoters in Maputo and the region of Beira. The study provides a first angle of thought of why solar cooking has been limited undertaken in these regions and what are the opportunities for institutional solar cooking in Mozambique.",,"Cultural factors; Development agencies; Electricity grids; Energy supplies; Health centers; Household applications; Household level; Mozambique; Solar cookers; Solar cooking; Digital storage; Health care; Ion selective electrodes; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Solar equipment; Sun; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873846400

As the world grapples with the energy and environmental crisis, there is an urgent need to develop and promote environmentally benign sustainable cooling technologies. Solar cooling is one such promising technology, given the fact that solar energy is the cheapest and widely available renewable energy that matches the cooling load requirements. However thermal storage systems are essential to overcome the disadvantage of the intermittent nature of solar energy and variation in cooling demand. The enhanced utilization of solar energy and other consequences of thermal storage integrated systems have gained the attention of researchers in the recent years. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a 1kW vapour absorption refrigeration system (VARS) that uses R134a-DMAC as the working fluid operated by the heat generated from solar flatplate collector integrated with Phase Change Material(PCM) based thermal storage system. The performance of the solar collector, storage tank and the VARS are obtained from the experimental investigation. The capacity of the storage tank is capable of operating the VARS unit continuously for a period of 8 hours at full load condition. It is observed from the results that the COP increases with increase in generator temperature and decrease in sink temperature. An actual COP of 0.32 to 0.38 is achieved for the designed system under the tested conditions.","Absorption cooling; Latent heat storage; Phase change material; R134a-DMAC; Solar collectors; Solar cooling; Thermal energy storage","Absorption refrigeration system; Cooling load; Cooling technology; Environmental crisis; Environmentally benign; Experimental investigations; Flat-plate collector; Full-load; Generator temperature; Integrated systems; Peak load; Phase Change Material (PCM); R134a-DMAC; Renewable energies; Sink temperature; Solar cooling; Storage tank; Thermal storage; Thermal storage system; Working fluid; Absorption cooling; Cooling systems; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Ion selective electrodes; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Refrigerants; Solar collectors; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873844672

However, there are two large mountain ranges running nearly parallel to the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. These mountains contain significant woodland which provides forest resources for the rest of the country. This industry also produces significant waste, in the form of sawdust, bark, scrap wood, and foliage, which in most cases can't be used. This residue is usually merely discarded near the sawmills that produce it, generating a pollution problem and a fire hazard. Mexico is considered an oil-producing country, and only lately has production diminished and existing oil supplies become scarce. Thus, only lately has there been an effort to characterize and quantify the country's other available energy resources, such as forest and agricultural waste. No local industry has yet tried to develop the technology to turn this waste into a more compact, homogenous, and manageable product, such as wood pellets. The wood pellet industry is highly developed in many countries, but does not yet exist in Mexico even though 72% of the total area of the country is dedicated to forestry. There are no local manufacturers of the devices and systems needed for the collection, storage, packaging, transport, and final use of the wood pellets as fuel for heating or industrial processes. As an initial step towards solving this national problem, we present an estimate of the potential for generating solid biofuels from forest waste in northern Mexico. We specifically analyze the waste generated by milling the most common tree species in this area, which include the Mexican weeping pine (Pinus patula) and the northern red oak (Quercus rubra). In order to characterize the product, we built a prototype manual pelletizer and used it to create three different pellet varieties (pine, oak, and a 50/50 mixture of both) that were subjected to calorimetric analyses. Our results show that Mexican wood pellets can easily replace fossil fuels in any kind of furnace. We performed a field study in order to quantify the available volume of forest waste, sampling the forest exploitation facilities in Ciudad Madera, Chihuahua. This city is located in northern Mexico, near one of the country's largest mountain ranges (the Sierra Madre Occidental), and is representative of other woodlands in the country. The results of our work show that it is technically feasible to turn Mexican forest waste to wood pellets, and it is thus justified to develop the industry necessary to do so.",,"Available energy; Calorimetric analysis; Devices and systems; Field studies; Forest residue; Forest resources; Gulf of Mexico; Industrial processs; Me-xico; Mountain ranges; Oil supplies; Pacific ocean; Pelletizer; Pollution problems; Quercus rubra; Red oak; Solid bio-fuels; Tree species; Wood pellet; Agricultural wastes; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Industry; Ion selective electrodes; Landforms; Pelletizing; Wood; Forestry; Electrodes; Forestry; Fossil Fuels; Pelleting; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873842836

The method is suited for online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is applied to predict hourly values of power from a standard single glazed large area flat plate collector. The method is applied for horizons of up to 42 hours. Solar heating systems naturally come with a hot water tank, which can be utilized for energy storage also for other energy sources. Thereby such systems can become an important part of energy systems with a large share of uncontrollable energy sources, such as wind power. In such a scenario online forecasting is a vital tool for optimal control and utilization of solar heating systems. The method is a two-step scheme, where first a non-linear model is applied to transform the solar power into a stationary process, which then is forecasted with robust time-adaptive linear models. The approach is similar to the one by Bacher et al. (2009), but contains additional effects due to differences between solar thermal collectors and photovoltaics. Numerical weather predictions provided by Danish Meteorological Institute are used as input. The applied models adapt over time enabling tracking of changes in the system and in the surrounding conditions, such as decreasing performance due to wear and dirt, and seasonal changes such as leaves on trees. This furthermore facilitates remote monitoring and check of the system.",,"Energy source; Energy systems; Flat-plate collector; Hot water tanks; Non-linear model; Numerical weather prediction; Optimal controls; Photovoltaics; Power out put; Remote monitoring; Seasonal changes; Solar heating system; Solar thermal collector; Stationary process; Ion selective electrodes; Optimal control systems; Photovoltaic effects; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Wind power; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873833642

For example, in France, the energy consumption of buildings has increased by 30% over the last 30 years. Housing and tertiary buildings are responsible for the consumption of approximately 46% of all energy produced and approximately 23% of the total CO2 emissions. Nowadays, thermal energy storage systems are essential for reducing dependency on fossil fuels and then contributing to a more efficient environmentally benign energy use. In buildings, thermal energy storage can contribute to: - rationalize the use of renewable energy by phasing energy demand and solar energy production, - rationalize the use of electricity by shaving the peak loads. Thermal energy storage can be accomplished either by using sensible heat storage, latent heat storage or sorption of chemical reaction. Of course, these physical phenomena lead to different energy densities that can be stored in the materials involved (kWh/m3). The objective of the paper is to present, for the case of France, the results concerning the volume of storage required in low energy buildings depending on the following parameters: - the storage criteria (inter-seasonal, 40 coldest days, load peak shaving only,...), - the physical phenomena involved in the storage/release process, - the location of the building. The software TRNSYS is used to model and to calculate the energy storage system requirements for the different parameters in a low-energy house, which has been tested. Then, sensible, latent, sorption and chemical heat storage volumes are evaluated. The conclusions concern the potential for using different technologies of thermal energy storage in France.",,"Chemical heat storage; Energy demands; Energy density; Energy productions; Energy storage systems; Energy use; Environmentally benign; In-buildings; Low energy buildings; Low-energy house; Peak load; Peak shaving; Physical phenomena; Renewable energies; Sensible heat storages; Tertiary building; Thermal energy storage systems; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Heating; Ion selective electrodes; Software testing; Sorption; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873833350

The use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) and rock particles for heat storage has been a main topic in research for the past decades. However, little is known on the use of the combination of PCM and rock particles for high temperature heat storage with air as the medium of heat transfer. The aim of this paper is to show experimentally by means of comparison, the thermal behaviours of thermal energy storage with only rocks and rocks plus copper cylinders containing PCM. A heat storage consisting of both rock particles and phase change material has been designed and built. The PCM material used is a mixture of NaNO3 and KNO 3 in the ratio of 60:40 percent (mol %). The charging and thermal de-stratifications profiles were determined for both cases. The results shows that the introduction of PCM cylinders in rock bed heat storage does not only increase the heat content of the bed but it also act as fins that can be use for heat extraction.","PCM cylinders; Rock particles; Thermal energy storage","Copper cylinders; Energy storage systems; Experimental investigations; Heat extraction; High temperature; Phase Change Material (PCM); Thermal behaviours; Cylinders (shapes); Heat storage; Ion selective electrodes; Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Rocks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873831055

Different operational modes of the ventilation channel are analyzed in order to improve the thermal performance of the buildings with glazed façades. The existing numerical platform for the prediction of the thermal performance of buildings and solar systems is used to implement a numerical model to address the multi-functional ventilated façade with integrated collector-storage element. The model uses the measured outdoor data as boundary conditions to obtain predictions by means of a general energy balance in the test room and the façade component. The model permits different levels of simulation depending on the desired precision in each element, applying a modular methodology.

Figure 1 is a photograph showing the community on a summer day. Several systems of similar size and configuration have been constructed in Europe, however, this is the first system of this type designed to supply more than 90% of the space heating requirements with solar energy and the first operating in such a cold climate (5200 degree C-days). Solar heat captured in 2293 m2 (gross area) of flat-plate collectors, mounted on the roofs of detached garages, is stored in soil underground and later is extracted and distributed through a district system to each home in the subdivision, when needed for space heating. Independent solar domestic hot water systems installed on every house are designed to supply more than 50% of the water heating load. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from energy efficiency improvements and solar energy supply exceed 5 tonnes for each house. The seasonal storage utilizes approximately 34,000 m3 of earth and a grid of 144 boreholes with single u-tube heat exchangers. The borehole storage system is configured to maintain the centre of the field at the highest temperature and the outer edges at the lowest temperature to minimize losses and maximize delivery temperature. A short-term thermal storage consisting of 240 m3 of water is used to interconnect the collection, distribution and seasonal heat storage subsystems. The system has undergone detailed monitoring since it was brought into service in July 2007 to characterize its performance and to improve the TRNSYS model employed in the system design. In its fourth year of operation the solar fraction was 86%, indicating that the system should achieve the design target of more than 90% in year five.

One possible realization of solar cooling plants is the combination of solar thermal collectors and thermally driven absorption chillers. The system availability depends on insolation and these plants cannot be driven only related to the cold demand. Thermal storages are needed in the system to balance between the required demand of cold and available solar energy to generate cold. Due to the fact, that the temperature difference in cooling systems normally is very small, the energy density of water is quite poor. Phase change slurries (PCS), which are using paraffin as phase change material (PCM) can extend the energy density through the latent heat of the melting/crystallizing of paraffin. For example, in the common temperature range from 6°C to 12°C the usable heat capacity of the PCS with paraffin as PCM is about two times higher than that of water. A further extension of the energy density seems possible in the combination of the paraffin/water dispersion and CO2 gas hydrates.",,"Absorption chillers; Energy density; High energy densities; Phase Change Material (PCM); Phase change slurry; Solar cooling; Solar cooling systems; Solar thermal collector; Storage medium; System availability; Temperature differences; Temperature range; Thermal storage; Thermally driven; Carbon dioxide; Cold storage; Gas hydrates; Ion selective electrodes; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Thermoelectric equipment; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873823158

A symptom is detected in case a characteristic like energy yield or a temperature difference does not match a reference value or interval. Additionally the data can be visualized in a simple way to analyze a found fault more in detail, e. g. via a web browser.

An essential part of the thermo-chemical energy store is the reactor where the heat and mass transfer take place. In this paper several external reactor designs for a thermo-chemical energy store are presented. A characteristic feature of external reactor designs is the transport of the material from and to the reactor as the external reactor is seperated from the material reservoir. To analzye the processes inside the reactor, detailed numerical investigations with the finite element simulation software ""COMSOL Multiphysics"" have been performed for a fixed bed reactor and a cross flow reactor. Focus of the simulation study is to understand the processes in the reactor during the exothermic reaction of a composite (salt impregnated zeolite) with humid air. An important criterium, which has to be fulfilled by the reactor, is that a high fraction of the energy density of the material can be used for further processes. This implies a minimum temperature lift of the airflow to be ensured during reaction. Strenghts and weaknesses of the different reactor concepts have been demonstrated through results from numerical simulation studies. At optimal operation conditions of the reactor - meaning an optimal mass flow ratio of the water vapor transported into the reactor via the air to the material massflow - the cross flow reactor design is superior to the fixed bed reactor design in terms of the specific thermal energy density released during the reaction. However, the cross flow reactor design has high demands on the reaction control due to the sensitivity of the reaction to a variation in the air inflow conditions. In addition, a uniform mass flow inside the reactor at very low bulk velocities has to be guaranteed but is technically difficult to realize. Based on these considerations a quasi-continuous cross-flow reactor design has been developed. Instead of a continuous material mass flow through the reactor, as in the cross flow reactor design, the material is removed discontinously from the reactor. In the lower part of the reactor, near the material outlet, a faster conversion of the material is achieved compared to the materials in the upper part, by reducing the width of the reactor and hence increasing the amount of air passing this part of the reactor. When full conversion is achieved in the area near the material outlet, the material outlet opens and part of the material is removed. At the same time the reactor is refilled with unreacted material from the top. First simulation studies show that a high fractional conversion of the material can be achieved and, at the same time, the temperature lift of the airflow leaving the reactor is only slightly decreasing with increasing reaction time. This indicates a very efficient process design where a high fraction of the specific energy density of the material can be utilized. Further experimental and numerical investigations are in progress to analyze the reactor design under varying operating conditions in more detail. Experimentel investigation on materials for thermo-chemical energy storages have been conducted. Composite materials of salt impregnated zeolites exhibit very good properties in terms of thermal performance (reaction kinetic, specific thermal energy storage density) and mechanical and thermal stability (transportable, low thermal degradation). Both criteria are crucial for the use in a thermo-chemical energy store. Further investigation are on-going and it is expected that a huge increase in the specific thermal energy density can be achieved by improving the material structure and the material production process.",,"Air inflow; Bulk velocity; Continuous materials; Cross-flow reactors; Efficient process; Energy density; Finite element simulations; Fixed bed reactor; Fractional conversion; Heat and mass transfer; High demand; Humid air; Mass flow; Mass flow ratios; Material structure; Multi-physics; Numerical investigations; Numerical simulation studies; Operating condition; Optimal operation conditions; Production process; Reaction control; Reactor concepts; Reactor designs; Simulation studies; Solar thermal systems; Specific energy density; Thermal energy density; Thermal Performance; Thermo-chemical; Chemical reactors; Computer simulation; Degradation; Design; Heat storage; Ion selective electrodes; Mass transfer; Process design; Reaction kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; Materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873817946

From originally being a one-year course, it has now developed into a 90-credit, three-term MSc degree course. Fields of study are wind energy, solar electric and solar thermal, energy meteorology, hydropower, storage technology, biomass and economics of Renewable Energy. The Programme aims at engineers and natural scientists. Apart from lecturing, emphasis is put on an eight-week internship in research institutes or companies and intensive hands-on lab courses. Furthermore, we establish contacts to companies, research institutes, consultants and organisations for international development for students within excursions and master thesis. A case study on a real-life project visited by the students allows the comparison of students' research results with the experience of the system's operator. Long-time and close cooperation with the DAAD provides scholarships for up to 10 students per intake. The Programme is also eligible for other scholarship organisations, e.g. E 8. Various challenges had to be overcome in the past and up to present such as the inclusion of a multidisciplinary course into an institute of physics; the continuous adaptation of the curriculum to a dramatically developing and differentiating technology; balancing lectures on fundamentals and applied learning contents; adapting lectures to a team of students of multidisciplinary origin; keeping up to date with the requirements of the Bologna process of international education; development of international partnerships with universities and institutes for the sake of improvements on both sides with students' and lecturers' exchange and mobility; supervision of master thesis elaborated abroad and last but not least the day-to-day intercultural communication in the lecture rooms. The Postgraduate Programme Renewable Energy at Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg has successfully educated and qualified international engineers and scientists who develop a career in Renewable Energy research, consultancy, industry, politics, and international development co-operation.

Besides changes in social and other environmental aspects, the company has set itself the goal to be carbon neutral by 2017. To this end, Spier is considering the on-site generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. This study was initiated to explore the technical and economic feasibility of a concentrating solar power plant for this purpose on the estate. The investigation was carried out to identify the most appropriate solar thermal energy technology and the dimensions of a system that fulfils the carbon-offset requirements of the estate. In particular, potential to offset the annual electricity consumption of the currently 5 570 MWh needed at Spier was investigated using a concentrating solar power (CSP) system. Due to rising utility-provided electricity prices and the expected initial higher cost of the generated power, it was assumed that implemented efficiency measures would lead to a reduction in demand of 50% by 2017. Sufficient suitable land was identified to allow electricity production exceeding today's demand. The outcome of this study was the recommendation of a linear Fresnel collector field without additional heat storage and a saturated steam Rankine cycle power block with evaporative wet cooling. This decision was based on the combination of the system's minimal impact on the sensitive environment and the high potential for local development. A simulation model was written to evaluate the plant performance, dimension and cost. The analysis followed a literature review of prototype system behaviour and system simulations. The direct normal irradiation (DNI) data that was used was based on calibrated satellite data. The result of the study was a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of R2.741 per kWh, which is cost competitive to the power provided by diesel generators but more expensive than current and predicted near-future utility rates. The system contains a 1.8 ha aperture area and a 2.0 MWe power block. Operating the plant as a research facility would provide significant potential for LCOE reduction with R2.01 per kWh or less (favourable funding conditions would allow for LCOE of R1.49 per kWh) appearing feasible. These results are cost competitive in comparison to a photovoltaic (PV) solution. Depending on tariff development, Eskom rates are predicted to reach a similar level between 2017 (the time of commissioning) and the year 2025. The downside of this plan is that the plant would not solely serve the purpose of electricity offsetting for Spier which may result in a reduced amount of generated electricity. Further studies are proposed to refine the full potential of cost reduction by local development and manufacturing as well as external funding.

A mandatory quota system requires that 5% of the electricity generated in the country must come from renewable energy sources, gradually increasing to 10% by 2024. As of 2010, only wind and biomass power plants have been installed in the country, while solar energy has received attention only for small-scale future demonstration projects. Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are an interesting option for the country, especially when considering the high levels of solar radiation coupled with high values of the local clearness index and availability of flat terrain that are available in northern Chile. In this work, the modeling and simulation of a 20 MW CSP plant of the parabolic trough type, without thermal energy storage is carried out. In order to maintain the power block performance at nominal conditions during long non-insolation periods, most of these plants have a thermal storage system or contain a heat support (such as fuel). Because of that, a proper solar field size, with respect to the electric nominal power, is a fundamental choice. A too large field will be partially useless under high solar irradiance values whereas a small field will mainly make the power block to work at part-load conditions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the influence of solar field area and radiation levels, and the optimal plant configuration and solar field area are obtained as a result. The CSP plant is simulated using the TRNSYS computational tool and monthly and annual electricity yields are obtained from hourly simulations that consider radiation levels, solar field, and power plant characteristics. Therefore, it was found that Chile has an outstanding potential for CSP plants, especially in the northern locations of the country such as Antofagasta.",,"Biomass power plants; Clearness indices; Computational tools; Concentrated solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Demonstration project; Flat terrains; Hourly simulation; Modeling and simulation; Northern Chile; Northern regions; Parabolic trough; Part load; Quota systems; Radiation levels; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar fields; Solar irradiances; Thermal storage system; Biomass; Computer simulation; Heat storage; Ion selective electrodes; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Sun; Solar radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873806977

In previous studies it has been shown that DHWM provide a potential for energy savings due to the large capacity of flat plate heat exchangers and thus the possibility of a good stratification in the storage tank. These results have been obtained numerically by modeling the parts and the control strategy of the investigated DHWM. In detailed measurements at SPF it has been shown that some modules have difficulties with the regulation of small flow rates, which result in temperature fluctuations and/or an increased DHW temperature. These effects lead to an increased primary return flow temperature, which has a negative influence on the system performance. A series of commercially available DHWM from six different manufacturers were tested extensively. Thereby three different influences on the yearly energy consumption were investigated separately; the electrical energy consumption, the additional heat losses of the module and additional system losses caused by high back flow temperatures. This paper focuses on the influence of the backflow temperature on the annual system performance based on measured values provided by a lookup table. The performance of the control mechanism was found to be most important for the energy saving potential of the tested modules. Based on simulated parameter variations a simplified method for the judgment of real DHWM was elaborated. This method allows predicting the influence of a DHWM to a reference solar combisystem by measuring the backflow temperature at only a few characteristic operation points.",,"Backflow; Control mechanism; Control strategies; Domestic hot water; Electrical energy consumption; Energy saving potential; Flat-plate heat exchangers; Negative influence; Operation point; Performance based; Return flow; Simplified method; Small flow-rate; Solar combisystems; Storage tank; System loss; Temperature fluctuation; Energy conservation; Flow rate; Ion selective electrodes; Solar equipment; Tanks (containers); Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873801317

The poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polythiophene (PTh) have attracted much attention because of their excellent environmental stability, optical, electrical and electrochemical properties. We present here the synthesis, characterization and application of graphene (G)-PEDOT and G-PTh nanocomposites as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. These nanocomposites were synthesized using chemical oxidative polymerization technique, and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray-diffraction, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) techniques. The electrochemical charge/discharge characteristics of G-PEDOT and G-PTh nanocomposites were investigated in 2M HCl electrolytic medium, and the specific discharge capacitance values were estimated to be varying from 160 to 400 Farad (F)/gram.

Electrochemical properties in terms of lithium reversible insertion depend on the deposited microstructure. For thick films deposited on silicon wafer electrochemical activity of the anatase type of TiO 2 is registered in the potential range 1.8-2.1 V vs. Li. For thinner films the intercalation reaction takes place in two potential ranges: 1.8-2.1 V vs. Li and below 1.4 V vs. Li. The second electroactivity range is attributed to lithium insertion into rutile. We found that the decrease of the lower potential limit (0.5 V instead of commonly used 1 V) leads to an increase of the recovered capacity.

However, multiple heaters were used to maintain system temperature, and recent tests of a Delphi Corporation SOFC stack and fuel processor has uncovered thermal management issues regarding steam reformer operation in an anode-recycle loop. An experiment was attempted in which the fuel reformer was placed downstream of the SOFC stack and was to be driven (heated) by the anode exhaust from the stack. However, the maximum temperature achievable was only 400 °C, much lower than the 600 °C minimum for steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. In order to provide more heat to the steam reformer, the combustor channel of Delphi's reformer was employed, and suitable conversion of JP-10 and S-8 liquid fuels was demonstrated. However, in a UUV application, continual operation of a burner (or CPOX reformer) will consume the limited supply of oxygen that is available. This extra consumption of oxygen for combustion detracts from the intended benefits of using energy-dense logistics fuels and highly efficient SOFCs. In a departure from NUWCDIVNPT's original focus on diesel-type (logistics) fuels, methane is looking more attractive for UUV applications, at least for first generation SOFC-powered UUVs. Even though the energy density for methane is roughly half that of diesel-type fuel, the savings in oxygen and carbon dioxide sorbent storage result in system energy metrics similar to those for S-8-based systems. In addition, the fuel processor control and system start-up can be greatly facilitated by using methane instead of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. Switching to a methane fuel feed has the following advantages: high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (this lowers O 2 and CO 2 sorbent storage requirements); facilitates steam reforming versus diesel-type fuels; greater ease of start-up and system power transient control; risk mitigation for potential SOFC coking; and low boiling point, thus avoiding logistics of vaporizing diesel-type fuels and producing carbon residue. ©The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbon dioxide sorbent; Carbon residue; Energy density; Fuel option; Fuel processors; Fuel reformer; Hydrogen-to-carbon ratio; Liquid hydrocarbon fuel; Maximum temperature; Methane fuel; Power transient; Risk mitigation; SOFC stack; Start-ups; Steam reformer; Storage requirements; System energy; System temperature; Unmanned undersea vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Combustors; Fuel storage; Fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Methane; Oxygen supply; Sorption; Steam reforming; Submersibles; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856904736

In the present study, we describe quantitatively the aging process in terms of the successive phase formation, distribution and iron local environments. Formation and growth of a disordered ferric phosphate phase are directly observed for the first time from the surface of particles toward the core, preceding the crystallization of tavorite LiFePO4(OH) as observed through the combination of amorphous phase quantification by XRD, and by Mössbauer and Electron Energy Loss spectroscopies. Structural and electrochemical characterization prove that the amorphous ferric phosphate formed in the early aging stage exhibits already tavorite composition and structure at the local scale and shed light on a crucial step of the aging mechanism. Based on the correlation we establish here between the amounts of Fe(iii) and hydroxyls groups present in aged samples and specific capacity of the corresponding electrodes, we show that the degradation of active material upon storage and the electrochemical performance can be predicted easily through simple TGA measurements. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy dissipation; Iron compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Active material; Aging mechanism; Amorphous phase; Electrochemical characterizations; Electrochemical performance; Local environments; Phase formations; Specific capacities; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81255138568

The non-Ohmic behavior is due to their low capacitance that allows (local) storage of charge at the single electron level to pose a substantial barrier to the passage of current at bias, V, below a threshold voltage, VT. The VT is inversely proportional to the size of the particle. For a typical &lt;10 nm particle, the electrostatic barrier energy of the particle due to charging by a single electron is significantly larger compared to the thermal energy, affecting a substantial Coulomb blockade. The signature of the single electron effect is a highly non-linear current-bias behavior characterized by a critical point at VT with a subsequent rise in current that scales as (V/VT - 1)ζ, where ζ ≥ 1 is the critical exponent. We review the fabrication chemistry, device physics, and engineering applications of nanoparticle-based Single Electron Devices with architectures ranging from a single nanoparticle to arrays in one and two dimensions.

This study presents the photocatalytic reduction of GO in water with mercury-lamp irradiation. The specific capacitance of the reduced GO in an H2SO4 aqueous solution reached levels as high as 220 F g-1. This is because of the double layer formation and the reversible pseudocapacitive processes caused by oxygen functionalities at the sheet periphery. The rate capability for charge storage increases with irradiation time due to the continued reduction of oxygenated sites on the graphene basal plane.

Microstress imbalance originated from the relative rotation of the growing nanoparticle inside the aqueous droplet leads to a whirlpool-like microreactor and thus results in the formation of brims of the solid nanobowls.

Its phase transformation, structure, absorption and photoluminescence properties were studied. The Nd:LuAG polycrystalline phase is formed above 900 °C and its particle sizes are in the range of 18-36 nm. The structure of Nd:LuAG was refined by Rietveld method. The lattice parameters and the distortion of Lu3+-O2- polyhedron in Nd:LuAG are larger than that of in pure LuAG. Because the distortion of Lu3+-O2- polyhedron is larger than that of Y3+-O2- polyhedron in YAG and the distance of Lu 3+-O2- is smaller than that of Y3+-O 2- in YAG, Nd3+ in LuAG experiences a stronger crystal field effect, which is proved by the crystal field strength and the chemical environment parameter. The absorption spectrum shows that Nd:LuAG has a broad absorption band at 808 nm with FWHM above 6 nm, which is favorable for improving laser efficiency. The fluorescence lifetime from 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition is 320 μs and longer than that of Nd:YAG. The longer lifetime is propitious to energy storage. The emission cross section at 1064 nm is 2.89 × 10-19 cm2, taking into account the Boltzmann distribution of the excited state. The emission cross section in Nd:LuAG is also larger than that of Nd:YAG, which is useful for laser operation.

Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and phase analysis by X-ray diffraction patterns provided both direct and indirect evidence for the infiltration of the LiBH4-Ca(BH4)2 composite into the mesoporous channels of the carbon.

To unravel the complex mechanisms leading to the removal of oxygen in reduced GO, we have performed in situ transmission infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements of GO films upon thermal annealing at 60-850°C in vacuum (10-3-10-4 Torr). Using cluster-based first-principles calculations, epoxides, ethers (pyrans and furans), hydroxyls, carboxyls, lactols, and various types of ketones and their possible derivatives have been identified from the spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the interactions between randomly arranged nearby oxygen species are found to affect the spectral response (red and blue shifts) and the overall chemistry during annealing. For instance, the initial composition of oxygen species (relative amounts and types of species, such as hydroxyls, carboxyls, and carbonyls) and reduction times determine the final oxygen concentration (% of initial concentrations), varying from ∼46-92% in multilayer GO to ∼3-5% in single-layer GO. In the multilayer case, there is no dependence on the layer thickness. An important indicator of the reduction efficiency is the relative concentration of carbonyls at intermediate annealing temperatures (∼200°C). These observations suggest that thermal annealing can foster the formation of free radicals containing oxygen in the presence of trapped water in GO, which further attack carboxyls, hydroxyls, and carbonyls, preferentially at edges rather than on basal plane defects. These findings impact the fabrication of electronics and energy storage devices. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Basal planes; Cluster-based; Complex mechanisms; Evolution of oxygen; First-principles calculation; In-situ transmission; In-vacuum; Initial composition; Initial concentration; Intermediate annealings; Lactols; Layer thickness; Morphological modification; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen species; Red and blue shifts; Reduction efficiency; Relative concentration; Single layer; Spectral response; Spectroscopic data; Thermal reduction; Thermal-annealing; Annealing; Calculations; Chemical modification; Ethers; Free radicals; Graphene; In situ processing; Infrared absorption; Ketones; Multilayers; Organic compounds; Virtual storage; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053900341

The XRD studies revealed that the electrodeposited MnO2 films are amorphous and addition of Triton X-100 does not change its amorphous nature. The electrodeposited films of MnO2 in the presence of the Triton X-100 possess greater porosity and hence greater surface area in relation to the films prepared in the absence of the surfactant.

The distribution grid, once designed to deliver electric power, has to deal with a problem of overvoltage during high irradiation levels. This paper presents the first results of a research project that was funded by the Flemish government to investigate the influence of renewables on the power quality and vice versa. The first aim of the project was to come up with practical solutions for the overvoltage in distribution grids. The presented solution is the introduction of a limited battery pack at residentual PV production sites to buffer energy at overvoltage. Today's household PV-inverters switch off at overvoltage resulting in the loss of green energy. The discussed all-in-one inverter avoids these losses. Firstly, a model of the distribution grid is given to quantify this green energy loss on a typical Belgian distribution feeder. Simulations on this model show that the local installation of a buffer size of only one third of the average daily PV yield of the PV-installation can already eliminate the overvoltage along the feeder. Secondly, a possible power electronic solution for limiting the active power injection by buffering is presented. This all-in-one power electronic solution offers battery charging, grid coupling possibilities as well as single phase solar energy inverting with MPP tracking from a single inverter platform. The platform is real-time controlled from Matlab/Simulink via a target PC. The paper concludes with a control algorithm for this all-in-one inverter. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.","Energy storage; Photovoltaic; Smart grids","Active power; Battery pack; Buffer sizes; Distribution feeders; Distribution grid; Electric power; Green energy; Irradiation levels; MATLAB /simulink; Over-voltages; Photovoltaic; Practical solutions; Production sites; Renewables; Single phase; Smart grid; Algorithms; Alternative fuels; Charging (batteries); Computer simulation; Electrolysis; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Photovoltaic effects; Power electronics; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053554558

It consists of double layer capacitors and a dc-dc converter. In case of regenerative braking operation the capacitors have to be able to accept energy, in case of acceleration they have to deliver energy. To ensure availability of the system anytime, the ultracapacitors state of charge has to be kept in a predefined range. Therefore a powermanagement has to be set up. The goal of the powermanagement is the intelligent power distribution between battery and super capacitors to reduce as well the maximum as the average battery power. In this paper, the design of a powermanagement is presented. Here, the design is exemplarily presented for an electric lift truck, but it can also be adapted for road vehicles. First, a common fuzzy controller to be applied in the powermanagement is derived. Accordingly, the fuzzy parameters are tuned by means of a genetic algorithm. This paper shows that a powermanagement by means of a fuzzy controller can be used to define a reasonable energy flow in a dual source electric vehicle autonomously. Furthermore it is shown that the success of the system can be strictly dependent on the genetic algorithm optimization method. Methods by means of predefined-base- and a stand-alone-genetic optimization are analyzed as well as the success for membership function tuning, fuzzy rule tuning and for a combined tuning in each case.

Different configurations in terms of storage capacity and braking resistance power are presented and compared. The proposed control algorithm evaluates analytically the supercapacitor reference current on the basis of the actual train kinetic energy, taking properly into account the efficiencies of the different subsystems. Therefore, on the basis of the size selected for the storage device, the control is capable of recovering the electrical energy during the braking of the train for recharging completely the supercapacitor units and dissipating the extra energy on the braking resistor. Realistic railway vehicle operations are presented by means of numerical simulations referring to different configurations of storage device and braking resistors. The results obtained show that the control is very effective in all the cases considered and that the final choice of the storage size is a trade-off between energy saving and equipment cost. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.","Energy system management; State of Charge Control; Supercapacitor","Braking resistor; Electrical energy; Energy system management; Equipment costs; Light railway; Railway vehicles; Reference currents; State of charge; Storage capacity; Super capacitor; Train speed; Algorithms; Brakes; Capacitors; Lead acid batteries; Locomotives; Power electronics; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Resistors; Virtual storage; Braking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053545256

A standard thermoelectric module will generate a small amount of electrical power, typically in the milli-watt range, if a temperature difference is maintained between two sides of the device. With the addition of relatively simple electronic signal-conditioning techniques - for example low power step-up DC to DC conversion, coupled with electrical energy storage in supercapacitors, the electrical power output from a thermoelectric power generation system can be increased to a useful and stable level. The electrical power generated by a thermoelectric energy harvesting system, designed in this way, can be used to provide electrical power to other low power electronic systems - for example electronic sensors, low power microcontrollers, and replace or recharge batteries in many applications. The 3D TCAD simulation model of a thermoelectric couple successfully demonstrates the basic principle of thermoelectric power generation, and how the application of a temperature gradient to a thermoelectric couple results in a small amount of electrical power being generated at a load resistor. The 3D TCAD simulation model will enable further investigation in the future into different material structures, thermoelectric couple and module designs, and the improvement in thermoelectric performance and efficiency. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.","Device Modeling; Device Simulation; Generation of Electrical Energy; Renewable Energy Systems; Thermoelectric Energy","Device modeling; Device simulations; Generation of electrical energy; Renewable energy systems; Thermoelectric energy; DC power transmission; Electric generators; Energy harvesting; Equivalent circuits; Power electronics; Thermocouples; Thermoelectric power; Thermoelectricity; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Thermoelectric energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053530533

The scheme is based on the use of the active positive sequence current component, to maintain balance between the AC-side and DC-side powers, and the active and reactive negative sequence components, to exchange energy from the capacitors of one phase to those of another phase. The latter equalizes the stored energy amongst the valves and it is useful during asymmetrical AC system faults, or during fast system disturbances, which generally charge/discharge capacitors of each valve in a very different way. Performance of the proposed controller is tested on an example HVDC system which comprises an MMC inverter and an MMC rectifier station connected via a DC-link cable. The MMC topology considered is a standard three-phase bridge and uses H-bridge modules to implement converter valves. Compared to the standard MMC, which uses half-bridge modules, the H-bridge MMC offers the capability to ride-through DC system faults. Proposals are verified through detailed simulations of the example system under fault conditions. This includes: a three-phase to ground fault, a single-phase to ground fault and a pole-to-pole fault on the DC-link. Results confirm the converter capability to ride-though not only AC system faults but also DC system faults. However, system functionality is limited by the capacity of cell capacitors to store/deliver energy during the fault. Nevertheless, an H-bridge MMC HVDC terminal, even with a small storage capacity (20 ms at rated power), is still able to manage severe AC and DC system outages without assistance of auxiliary elements (e.g. break resistor, fault current limiter). © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.","Converter control; HDVC; High Voltage Power Converters; Multilevel converter; Voltage Source Converter","Converter controls; HDVC; High voltage power converters; Multilevel converter; Voltage Source Converter; Capacitors; Electric fault currents; Electric grounding; Electric power transmission; HVDC power transmission; Limiters; Poles; Power converters; Power electronics; Topology; Underground cables; Outages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053528667

Additionally, it allows PV inverter to dispatch power similar to the conventional power generations.

The analysis postulates nonlinear relation between the total power loss and the battery charging.

One of the most popular multilevel converter topologies is the cascaded H-bridge converter. Besides its simplicity this topology requires separate DC sources. In electric drive applications these DC sources are normally performed by multi-winding transformers with diode rectifiers. In STATCOM or PWM rectifiers there is no need to utilize multi-winding transformers but the DC-link is distributed. This feature can be exploited in the power conditioning system (PCS) with distributed energy storage e.g. supercapacitors. The paper focuses on the DC-link voltage balancing method in the multilevel cascaded H-bridge converter. This method is based on additional voltage components generated at the output of the cascaded H-bridge converter. It is assumed that the proposed method does not affect the AC-side currents of the PCS. Inserting the voltage components of fundamental frequency, together with AC-side currents, allows exchanging active power between the H-bridge converters and results in balancing the DC-link voltages. In the paper, balancing voltage components are distinguished into two types. The first components can balance DC-link voltages in each phase of the cascaded H-bridge converter separately and the second components allow exchanging the energy between the phases. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.","Converter control; DC-link voltage balancing; Multilevel converters; Power conditioning","AC-side; Active power; Cascaded H-bridge; Cascaded H-bridge converter; Converter controls; DC sources; Dc-link; DC-link voltages; Diode rectifier; Distributed energies; Fundamental frequencies; H-bridges; High power applications; High voltage; Multi-winding transformer; Multilevel converter; Power conditioning; Power conditioning systems; PWM rectifier; Statcom; Super capacitor; DC power transmission; DC transformers; Electric drives; Electric inverters; Electric windings; Power electronics; Topology; Winding; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053513601

This paper shows how to design a modular battery energy storage system (BESS) for medium voltage grids. Typically, this system is scalable in power rated from 5 MW up to 100 MW with a storage capacity of several hours. Using power electronic building blocks (PEBBs) a converter for dc grids and ac grids can be built. In this paper, the chosen topology for the ac solution is the cascaded cell converter. The focus is to determine the optimum number of levels, the modulation technique to avoid microcycles of the batteries and to present the efficiency. A formula to calculate the parasitic capacitance of lead-acid batteries is shown and verified by measurements, which is important for the design of such a converter system. Moreover, a new charging strategy for LiFePO4 - the chosen battery technology for the proposed storage system - is introduced, which prolongs the battery's life, reduces the charging time and decreases the life cycle cost.

If the energy storage capability of the capacitors is relatively small compared to the energy variations, this will give large variations in the capacitor voltages. These voltage variations will distort the ac-side voltage waveform and induce harmonic components in the current that is circulating between the dc terminals. The adverse effects on the ac-side voltage can be compensated for by identifying the factors that cause the distortion. It is shown that the compensation can be done by means of feed forward control while maintaining stable operating conditions and thus eliminating the need of additional stabilizing controllers. It is also shown that the voltage controller can be combined with a circulating current controller that removes the harmonics in the current that is circulating between the dc terminals. The functionality of the proposed controller is verified by both simulations and experimental results from a 10 kVA laboratory prototype.

For such, it is very important to understand if these IL cations tend to aggregate like surfactants because this would affect the ion mobility and thus the ionic conductivity. The aggregation behavior of these ILs was extensively studied with NMR and Raman methods also in the presence of Li+ cations and compared with that of corresponding ILs having no ether group on the cation side chain. 2H NMR spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rates were analyzed by applying the ""two step"" model of surfactant dynamics.

Superhydrophobic CuO/Cu(OH) 2 surfaces were prepared by a simple solution-immersion process at room temperature, without using a low surface energy material. The structure and composition of as-prepared CuO/Cu(OH)2 hierarchical structure were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The growth stage was carefully examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and it was observed that initially Cu(OH)2 nanoneedle arrays were formed on the copper surface and subsequently the CuO microflowers formed on the nanoneedle arrays. The contact angle as a function of immersion time was studied using a contact angle goniometer. The correlation between the microstructure of the immersed copper surface and the contact angle was examined carefully using FESEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results based on FESEM and AFM studies show that the CuO/Cu(OH)2 coatings demonstrate superhydrophobicity only for an optimal combination of the solid region (i.e., microflowers and nanoneedles) and air pockets (i.e., voids). The maximum static water contact angle on the prepared surface was 159°. The wettability transition of the CuO/Cu(OH) 2 surface from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity was studied by the alteration of oxygen plasma treatment and dark storage. The FESEM, AFM, and XPS studies showed that this transformation was mainly due to the morphological changes that occur in addition to the chemical changes taking place on the CuO/Cu(OH)2 surface under the influence of oxygen plasma.

A.; Terzyk, A. P.; Furmaniak, Sylwester, J. Chem. Theory Comput.2009, 5, 1990-1996), we study the mobility of 4He atoms adsorbed in zeolite rho at 40 K. At studied temperature, the self-diffusive motion of 4He atoms in zeolite rho is strongly concentration-dependent. At low pore concentrations, 4He atoms are adsorbed in high-energetic adsorption centers of the zeolite. Due to strong localization in the solid-fluid potential well, an average kinetic energy of 4He atoms at infinite dilution reaches ∼120 K (i.e., twice of the classical kinetic energy at 40 K, Eclass = 60 K), whereas the self-diffusion constant drops up to ∼0.001 Å2 ps -1. Increasing pore concentration of 4He leads to the rapid increase in mobility of adsorbed 4He atoms. We show that ∼8 mmol cm-3, self-diffusive motion of confined 4He atoms increases up to ∼1 Å2 ps-1. Variation of the kinetic energy, potential energy, and enthalpy of 4He adsorption with pore concentration indicates that high-energetic adsorption sites in studied zeolite sample are saturated at low pore densities. The remaining adsorption sites are characterized by weaker solid-fluid potential, which allows higher delocalization of adsorbed 4He atoms. The reported novel phenomenon of localization controlled self-diffusion of confined 4He seems to be promising for smart designing of nanoporous quantum molecular sieves and storage nanovessels.

Alkyl chains on a glass plate separated from the photocatalyst by 7.5 μm thick air were removed in 40 min under visible light (≥420 nm, ∼100 mW cm-2). Among the photocatalysts examined, Pt-WO3 exhibits the highest remote oxidation activity. Its activity is higher than that of TiO2 modified with Pt nanoparticles in the wavelength range 360-460 nm. It is likely that Pt-WO 3 emits ·OH under visible light, which diffuses in air and attacks alkyl chains, whereas the major path of the remote oxidation induced by UV light involves emission of H2O2 and its photocleavage into ·OH. Remote storage of oxidative energy in Ni(OH)2 is also possible by using visible light-irradiated Pt-WO 3. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkyl chain; Glass plate; Photo-catalytic; Photocleavages; Pt nanoparticles; Remote oxidation; Remote storage; TiO; Visible light; Wavelength ranges; Nanoparticles; Oxidation; Photocatalysts; Platinum; Titanium dioxide; Light",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052788459

Transforming these materials into foamed structures through energy efficient approaches can be dramatically significant for various applications in which weight is critical. Due to the rigid aromatic structures, foaming them is normally extremely difficult via blowing agent assisted foaming techniques. In this study, homogeneous sulfonated PEKK (SPEKK) foam was fabricated through a facile and energy efficient hydration reaction induced self-foaming approach, in which, water acted as the blowing agent. The resulting SPEKK foam has a uniform pore size of ca. 5 μm and a cell density of 9.77 × 109 cell per cm3, as well as a very low mass density of 0.42 g cm -3, suggesting a superiority to other foam structures reported, such as poly(aryl ether ketone) microcellular foams fabricated by conventional blowing agent assisted foaming techniques. The dielectric study demonstrated that the microcellular SPEKK foam possesses great potential for use in energy storage applications. The as prepared SPEKK foam showed a dramatically high permittivity (109 at 0.01 Hz and ca. 106 at 1000 Hz). At the same time, the SPEKK foam has a rather low dielectric loss, between 2 and 10 over the whole frequency range.

The Ca(BH 4)2-2Mg(NH2)2 and Ca(BH 4)2-2Ca(NH2)2 composites are thereby synthesized in the present work. It is found that the binary combined systems exhibit an onset dehydrogenation temperature of ∼220 °C, which is ∼100 °C lower than that of pristine Ca(BH4)2. The hydrogen release measurements for Ca(BH4)2-2Mg(NH 2)2 and Ca(BH4)2-2Ca(NH 2)2 samples below 480 °C show desorption amounts of 8.3 and 6.8 wt % hydrogen, respectively.

Besides the charging of the double-layer characteristic of carbon materials, galvanostatic cycling experiments performed on each electrode revealed a battery-type behavior in the anode and a pseudocapacitive hydrogen electrosorption process in the cathode as a consequence of an asymmetric split of voltage between the electrodes after the incorporation of HQ. Both the hydrogen electrosorption and Q/HQ redox reactions were studied in depth from the cyclic voltammograms obtained for both electrolytes in a three-electrode cell.

This catalytic effect is evaluated quantitatively using the atomization energy concept. The measured hydrogen desorption rate increases monotonously with increasing y × ΔE O values of metal oxides, MxOy. Here, ΔEO, is the atomization energy for the oxide ion in M xOy. This indicates that the oxide ion interacts mainly with hydrogen atom in MgH2, in agreement with the observation of the O-H stretching mode in the FT-IR spectra during the dehydrogenation of the Nb2O5-catalyzed MgH2.

The phase structure and morphology were investigated by XRD and SEM. The hydrogen desorption characteristics of obtained composites were measured by a volumetric method using Sievert's apparatus. It is demonstrated that the hydrogen desorption kinetics in the magnesium-intermetallic hydride composites is affected not only by the phase composition but also by the milling parameters. The particle size of composite constituents is slightly related to the amount of additive and strongly to milling time. The exponential factor in Johnson-Mehl-Avrami's equation decreases for composite powders in comparison to reference MgH2 from ∼2 to ∼1.

During ball milling for 15 min the LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% MnCl2 nanocomposite releases a miniscule amount of ∼0.25 wt.% H2. However, no products of the possible reaction between LiAlH4 and MnCl2 (e.g. LiCl) are observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In a DSC test most of LiAlH4 decomposes exothermically to Li3AlH6 in a solid state while a small fraction of retained LiAlH4 melts and decomposes in a liquid state. During dehydrogenation at 100 °C under 0.1 MPa H2 the ball milled LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% MnCl2 nanocomposite is able to desorb ∼4.6 wt.% H2 within ∼30,000 s in a solid state but only in Stage I (reaction: LiAlH4 (solid) → 1/3Li3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H2). The apparent activation energy of dehydrogenation for this solid state reaction is equal to ∼80 kJ/mol as compared to ∼70 kJ/mol obtained for LiAlH4+5 wt.% n-Ni [7]. However, during decomposition at 100 °C a chemical reaction occurs between LiAlH4 and MnCl2 producing LiCl and most likely an amorphous Mn metal catalyzing the reaction in Stage I.

The catalytic enhancement arising upon doping the ball-milled CeAl4 alloy is quite similar to that achieved in the CeCl 3-doped sodium alanate.

The most stable site for H adsorption to Al13 was the hollow HCP site. The H binding energy suggests that the top and the bridge configurations are transition states. Results for Al13H were compared with those obtained for two surface models simulating f.c.c. and icosahedral (1 1 1) surfaces. Results show that the H atom interacts weakly with surface of clusters when the cluster size is increased. The migration energy of H atom between neighboring T and O sites becomes smaller for icosahedral subsurface than for either bulk material or the f.c.c. subsurface. A similar relation between the two surface models was found for the migration energy between surface and subsurface sites.

To mimic the linking group (C6H4(COO) 22-) in MOF-5, we have considered the simple benzene ring. Because the binding energy of light metals (Li, Na, and Mg) to benzene is poor, we have modified the carbon ring by substituting two carbon atoms with two boron atoms. The metal ion (atom) interaction with C4B 2H62- (C4B2H6) is found to be very strong, and the interaction energies are extremely high as compared with the metal cohesive energies. Metal sites in these complexes are found to have partial ionic (positive) character and are shown to adsorb molecular hydrogen with reasonably good adsorption enthalpies. We have also studied the extended periodic system of lithium as well as sodium-decorated modified MOF-5 and their hydrogenated counterparts. In the case of lithium-decorated MOF-5, each formula unit is found to adsorb 18 hydrogen molecules with three H2 per lithium atom at zero temperature, which corresponds to a gravimetric density of ∼4.3 wt %.

It also aims to assess the validity of existing models and to identify the dominant physical phenomena that must be accounted for. The electric double layer capacitance was numerically predicted for spherical ultramicroelectrodes of various radii in aqueous electrolyte. The model accounted for the Stern and diffuse layers, the finite size of ions, and the dependency of the electrolyte dielectric permittivity on the local electric field. This study reveals that models reported in the literature suffer from severe limitations. First, it demonstrates that the electrolyte field-dependent dielectric permittivity significantly affects the predicted Stern layer and total specific capacitances and must be accounted for. The finite ion size and the Stern layer also need to be considered in simulating electric double layers under high concentrations and surface potential. This study also establishes that the Helmholtz model predicts the Stern layer capacitance for all electrode radii if the electrolyte permittivity is assumed to be constant. However, it underestimates the Stern layer capacitance for sphere radii less than 40 nm when accounting for field-dependent permittivity. The electrode curvature was found to have negligible effect on the predicted specific capacitance for sphere radii larger than 40 nm. Then, the latter is equal to that of planar electrodes.

Bimetallic clusters showed higher stability and reactivity than the corresponding magnesium ones. Titanium induces a change in the magnesium atoms in their electronic configuration reflected in an increase of the population of their orbitals. At the same time titanium electronic populations is modified. These changes cause variations in some reactivity parameters such as the Fukui indexes which modify the hydrogenation of the magnesium clusters and bimetallic clusters. For example, there is a reduction in the energy barrier for dissociation of the H2 molecule in the bimetallic clusters. In the hydrogenated cluster the hydrogen atoms form bridges between all of the magnesium or magnesium-titanium atoms.

Using MD simulations, for both anatase and amorphous TiO2, diffusion characteristics are first studied for an isolated Li ion, followed by simulations of Li concentrations ranging from 10% to 100% in order to explore the concentration effect on the diffusivity. The isolated Li diffusion mechanism, revealed from the MD simulations, occurs via zigzag hops between the octahedral sites in anatase. The corresponding barrier for this process obtained from DFT-NEB calculations is 480 meV. MD simulations also show that isolated Li ion diffusivity is much slower in the amorphous TiO2 than in anatase TiO2. DFT-NEB results for the diffusion in amorphous titania indicate that Li encounters deep energy wells within the amorphous network that are in the electronvolt range, confirming our MD observation of low Li diffusivity. A monotonic decrease in diffusion barriers with increasing Li concentration is observed in the case of amorphous titania whereas a non-monotonic variation is seen in anatase, with the lowest barrier observed at 50% Li concentration. At low Li concentrations (&lt;50%), we find that the barriers in anatase are lower than in amorphous titania. However, at the maximum Li intercalation ratios, which are experimentally known to be 50% for anatase and &gt;75% for amorphous titania, the Li diffusivity in amorphous is found to be much higher than in anatase. Our MD simulations suggest that the underlying reason for these differences is related to changes in diffusion mechanism.

The simulations show that graphene sheets can fully self-scroll onto Si NWs when the Si NW radius is larger than a threshold of about 5 Å, forming a stable core/shell structure. It is the van der Waals force that plays a primary role in the self-scrolling process. The configuration of the graphene-Si heterojunction depends significantly on the diameter of the Si NWs. The final NS becomes multiwalled with increasing graphene length when the diameter of the Si NWs is larger than a threshold of about 6 Å. The zigzag NS is proved to be the most stable, while the chiral NSs are unstable and tend to evolve into zigzag NS and a model is set up to interpret the tendency from the standpoint of bond. It is demonstrated that the graphene width has no influence on the self-scrolling process at all. Compared with the conventional fabricating method, the new self-assembling one occurs at room temperature and the thickness of the NSs can be controlled accurately. Besides, the unique structure of the graphene/Si core/shell heterojunctions will significantly enhance their applications in nanoelectronic devices, hydrogen storage, solar cells, chemical or biological sensors, and energy storage in supercapacitors or batteries. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Biological sensors; Core/shell; Core/shell structure; Graphene sheets; MD simulation; Molecular dynamics simulations; Multi-walled; Nanoelectronic devices; Nanoscrolls; Room temperature; Self-assembling; Silicon Nanowires; Super capacitor; Biosensors; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Monolayers; Nanoelectronics; Nanowires; Phosphorus; Silicon; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Van der Waals forces; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961212425

Research in materials science is approaching a possible solution to these problems by the combination of abundant Fe as a redox center and covalent (PO4)3- oxyanion units with fixed oxygen, leading to the use of LiFePO4 with olivine-type structure as a cathode material. A high level of stability, safety, significant cost reduction, and huge power generation are now on the verge of being guaranteed.

Onde a terra termina e o mar já não comea - A poetic definition of a binary liquid/solid interface by Luís de Camões (1572). Since its birth in early 1990s, Li ion battery technology has been powering the rapid digitization of our daily life and finally made its debut in 2010 into the large format application for electrified vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf and GM Chevrolet Volt; however, much of the chemistry and processes underneath this amazing energy storage device still remain to be understood, among which is the interphase between electrolyte and electrodes. Interphases are formed in situ on electrode surfaces from sacrificial decomposition of electrolytes. Their ad hoc chemistry supports the reversible Li +-intercalation in both anode and cathode materials at extreme potentials, while preventing parasitic reductions/oxidations on the reactive surfaces of those electrodes; but their existence places restrictions on energy and power densities of the device by impeding Li+-transport and setting operating voltage limits, respectively. It has been the dream of battery engineers to maximize the former and minimize the latter. This review summarizes the most recent knowledge about the chemistry and formation mechanism of this elusive battery component on both anode and cathode surfaces.

SHG resonance enhancement at 290 nm was observed at a NaCl concentration of 10 mM, whereas it was necessary to collect the adsorption isotherm using the nonresonant ?(3) technique at 1 mMNaCl concentration. Both methods resulted in the same (within one kT) adsorption free energy of -33 kJ/mol. This value is 10 kJ/mol less favorable than the free energy that was previously reported for the same system at pH 7, indicating that uranyl-surface interactions depend on pH.

Three ternary Al-Cu-Fe alloys with different compositions were chosen as the precursors to carry out the dealloying process in a 20 wt% NaOH solution under free corrosion conditions. The microstructure of these NPC/(Fe,Cu)3O4 composites have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with nanobeam-EDX (NB-EDX). These NPC/(Fe,Cu)3O4 composites are composed of a NPC matrix with ligament/channel sizes of 20-40 nm and octahedral (Fe,Cu)3O4 embedded particles of 600-800 nm. The formation of these composites has been discussed based upon the surface diffusion of Cu adatoms and oxidation of Fe/Cu adatoms during dealloying. The N2 absorption/desorption results show that the NPC/(Fe,Cu) 3O4 composites have a high surface area of up to 25.24 m2 g-1. The maximum values of the magnetic parameters of these NPC/(Fe,Cu)3O4 composites can reach 27.3 emu g -1, 7.7 emu g-1 and 218.5 Oe for the saturation magnetization, remanence and coercivity, respectively. The magnetic properties and the ratio of NPC:(Fe,Cu)3O4 in the NPC/(Fe,Cu) 3O4 composites can be tuned by simply changing the Cu/Fe ratio in the Al-Cu-Fe precursor alloys, while keeping their excellent electrical conductivity.

One strategy for developing improved energy storage materials and devices is to take advantage of capacitive and pseudocapacitive electrodes such as activated carbons or conducting polymers. However, these materials generally suffer from low energy densities. Functionalization of these materials with pendant redox units has been proposed as a method to improve the energy densities while maintaining the high rate capability. In this report, we present the synthesis and thorough characterization of one such candidate pendant molecule, 2,5-bis(methylthio) thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, and assess its potential use as a cathode material. Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and computational data suggest that bis(methylthio)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene is a lightweight molecule, capable of undergoing multiple reversible redox processes, and a good candidate for improving the energy density of cathode materials while still offering high rate (power) capability. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathode materials; Computational data; Electrical energy; Energy density; Energy landscape; Energy storage materials; Functionalizations; High rate; High rate capability; Low energies; Pseudocapacitive; Redox process; Renewable sources; Spectroelectrochemical; Sustainable energy; Activated carbon; Cathodes; Characterization; Conducting polymers; Energy storage; Flywheels; Organic conductors; Spectroelectrochemistry; Synthesis (chemical); Thiophene; Virtual storage; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959397919

Major efforts have focused on overcoming these two obstacles. Alloying, nanostructuring and/or catalysts, particularly at low temperatures, have considerably improved the hydrogenation kinetics of Mg powders. Further investigation is still desirable to reach the same properties for bulk materials because hydrogen desorption in bulk Mg-based systems still remains at a critical high temperature, and this, represents a major obstacle to their practical application. The aim of this work was to evaluate the reduction in desorption temperature and the increase in hydrogenation kinetics of bulk Mg-based composites in response to the following variables: particle/grain size, density of defects, the use of iron as catalyst, volume modifications, and the presence of carbon as a pore-confining element. We compared the behavior of 2Mg-Fe powder mixtures produced by high-energy ball milling processed as follows to produce bulk samples: (i) hot extrusion of 2Mg-Fe with extrusion ratio of 5/1 (S-1), (ii) hot compaction of 2Mg-Fe (S-2), and (iii) hot compaction of ball-milled 2Mg-Fe + 5%C, all processed at 300 °C (S-3). The samples were activated and subsequently hydrogenated at 15 bar, sample S-1 for 24 h and sample S-2 and S-3 for 5 h. After the hydrogenation treatments, the complex hydride Mg2FeH6 was formed in all the conditions. Desorption temperatures varied according to the processing conditions and the results indicated that porosity was an important factor, as it was the addition of carbon, which accelerated the desorption kinetics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The alloys were hydrogenated for 24 h under hydrogen pressures of 24 bar (to produce the Mg2FeH6 phase) and 15 bar (to produce a mixture of MgH2 + Mg2FeH6 phases), respectively. After the hydrogenation treatments, the complex hydride Mg 2FeH6 was identified in both conditions, while the MgH2 and MgO phases were observed only after extrusion at 200 °C. Desorption temperatures varied with the extrusion conditions; extrusion at 300 °C resulted in a desorption onset temperature about 68 °C lower than that of samples extruded at 200 °C, and about 200 °C lower than that of commercial MgH2. Extrusion at the lower temperature did not change the number of stored defects (point defects, dislocations, voids, stacking faults, vacancies and others) produced in the milling process and increased the preferential sites for hydride nucleation, increasing the hydrogen storage capacity. The presence of MgO produced the beneficial effect of grain boundary pinning, but delayed the onset temperature of desorption. The combined presence of MgH2 and Fe after hydrogenation at 15 bar seems to play a catalytic role that considerably hastened the Mg-H reactions and increased the desorption kinetics. However, the desorption kinetics in both conditions was still low. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

MgH2 was milled with the bare oxides for 12 h under a high purity Ar atmosphere. Absorption and desorption reactions in the ball-milled samples were studied by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) in isothermal conditions with Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber. XRD patterns for absorption were recorded at 573 K under hydrogen pressure of 0.9 MPa and for desorption at 623 K in vacuum. Experimental data were analysed according to the Rietveld method. Ball-milled samples showed the presence of a mixture of β and γ allotropes of MgH2, with significantly broadened diffraction peaks due to reduced crystallite size and strain, together with bare additives. The presence of Mg-Nb oxides significantly accelerates the hydrogen absorption and desorption processes. The amount of hydrogen absorbed in the presence of Mg-Nb-O phases is lower than the maximum stoichiometric capacity, because of the presence of a non-reactive MgO layer on the surface of the powders or at the grain boundaries.

Fast H-sorption kinetics at around 300 °C can be achieved after processing Mg-based mixtures by high energy ball milling (HEBM), which produces nanostructured composite powders. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to HEBM in order to obtain more air-resistant materials and to reduce the time and energy required for processing. In this paper, MgH2 and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by extensive cold forging (CF) and cold rolling (CR). A very significant grain refinement (up to 10 nm) was achieved, which is comparable to the values typically obtained after processing by HEBM. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for these mechanically processed MgH 2-based nanocomposites in comparison with commercial magnesium hydride. The obtained compacts after CR and CF presents a much lower specific surface area than the ball-milled powders and therefore show higher air-resistance. These results are promising from the point of view of applications since it reveals the potential of the use of low cost mechanical processing routes to produce Mg-based nanomaterials for hydrogen storage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such hybrid structures reported thus far are mostly in random organizations of nanosheets anchored with NPs and macroscopically exist in powder aggregates. In this work, a sandwich structure of GNSs and oxide NPs that are macroscopically a free-standing membrane is reported, and a multi-step strategy conducted under ""homogenous"" and ""mild"" conditions is developed to ensure the successful fabrication of the membrane-like structure. Both components, tightly fixed NPs and planar GNSs as the skeleton of such sandwich structures, can avoid aggregation or stacking during electrochemical charge-discharge cycling, which effectively maintains the active surface and leaves stable and open channels for ion transport. Such a layered sandwich structure also acts as an ideal strain buffer to accommodate volume changes of the NPs in a fixed direction, and thus has a better resilience and structural stability in the electrochemical charge/discharge process. Hence, such a GNS/NP sandwich structure represents an ideal structure for electrochemical energy storage and a solution for easy manipulation for various applications due to the membrane morphology. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Active surfaces; Charge discharge cycling; Electrochemical charge; Electrochemical energy storage; Free standing membranes; Hybrid structure; Ion transports; Membrane morphology; Metal oxide nanoparticles; Multi-step; Open channels; Potential applications; Powder aggregates; Structural stabilities; Volume change; Agglomeration; Electric discharges; Energy storage; Flywheels; Graphene; Metallic compounds; Nanosheets; Nickel oxide; Stability; Sandwich structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959993452

In the present work, the influence of the catalytic activity of Nb2O5 and Cr2O3 nanoparticles on the hydrogen sorption properties of LiAlH4 was investigated. It was shown that Nb2O5 was superior to Cr2O 3 in improving the dehydriding property. For instance, samples of LiAlH4 doped with 1 and 2 mol % Nb2O5 showed improvement in the onset desorption temperature with little decrease in hydrogen capacity, where approximately 6.9 wt % was released by 193 °C. Isothermal desorption results at 120 °C revealed that enhancements arising upon adding Nb2O5 were almost 6-7 times that of pristine LiAlH 4. Moreover, LiAlH4-2 mol % Nb2O5 displayed a substantially reduced activation energy and enthalpy change for LiAlH4 dehydrogenation. The results of the first rehydrogenation indicated that the amount of restored hydrogen for Nb2O 5-doped samples was lower than that of samples with Cr 2O3.

The composite hydride system was processed by ball milling for 25 h. Thermal behavior in DSC up to 500 °C and isothermal desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus were carried out. XRD was used to obtain information about phase changes. It is found that after ball milling graphite becomes amorphous. DSC analysis shows that for the mixture ((LiNH2 + 1.2LiH) + 5 wt.% graphite) graphite can prevent or at least substantially reduce the oxidation/hydrolysis of LiH since no melting peak of retained LiNH2 is observed. Both the DSC and Sieverts-type tests show that the addition of graphite increases the apparent activation energy of desorption from the ∼57-58 to ∼85-90 kJ/mol range. On the other hand, the graphite additive increases measurably the desorbed/absorbed capacity of hydrogen at 275, 300 and 325 °C. The ((LiNH2 + 1.2LiH) + 5 wt.% graphite) system is fully reversible desorbing/absorbing ∼5 wt.% H2 at 325 °C in the following reaction: (LiNH2 + LiH ↔ Li2NH + H 2). Step-wise pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) tests show that the enthalpy and entropy change of this reversible reaction is -62.4 and -61.0 kJ/mol H2 and 117.8 and 115.8 J/mol K for undoped and 5 wt.% G doped (LiNH2 + 1.2LiH) system, respectively. It shows that within an experimental error there is no measurable effect of graphite additive on the thermodynamic properties. The Van't Hoff analysis of the obtained thermodynamic data shows that the equilibrium temperature at atmospheric pressure of hydrogen (1 bar H2) is 256.8 and 253.9 °C for the undoped and 5 wt.% G doped (LiNH2 + 1.2 LiH) system ball milled for 25 h, respectively.

Solid State 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy studies suggested the formation of exfoliated structure for OPBI/OMMT, whereas and intercalated structure was obtained for OPBI/OKao. Both the nanocomposites displayed significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities compared to the pristine OPBI, and the higher thermal stability of OPBI/OMMT than that of OPBI/OKao was attributed to the higher degree of dispersion of the nanoclay into the OPBI matrix owing to the exfoliated structure of the former. Both the nanocomposites membranes exhibited large mechanical reinforcement by the clays and the superior mechanical property was obtained in the rubbery state compared to the glassy state. The storage moduli (E') for the OPBI/OKao membranes were found to be higher than that of OPBI/OMMT and recognized to the different dispersion patterns of both the organoclays along the polymer matrixes. The dispersed clay particles in the OPBI matrix shielded the polymer chains from the attack of oxidative radicals and resulted in huge enhancement of oxidative stability of the nanocomposites membranes compared to the pure OPBI membrane.

Furthermore, an initial discharge capacity of 1280 mA h g-1 and a reversible capacity over 392 mA h g-1 at the 50 cycles are achieved for the Au-ZnO hybrid nanostructure, which is found to be much better than that of any previously reported ZnO anodes. The improved lithium storage capacity and cycle life of the Au-ZnO electrode result from the Li activity of Au-ZnO phase. The photocatalytic and electrochemical activity of Au-ZnO hybrid nanostructures provide a new platform for energy storage, environmental remediation and photocatalysis applications. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Au nanoparticle; Catalytic activity; Controlled morphology; Cycle lives; Electrochemical activities; Environmental remediation; Flower-like; Functionalizations; Functionalized; Hybrid nanostructures; Initial discharge capacities; Li-ion batteries; Lithium storage capacity; Novel applications; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic activities; Pure ZnO; Reversible capacity; Solution phase; ZnO; ZnO nanostructures; Anodes; Catalyst activity; Electric discharges; Lithium; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Zinc oxide; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956266433

For spherical silver and gold particles, Mie theory is used to identify multipole plasmon resonances up to hexadecupole order as a function of particle radius. With increasing particle dimensions, higher-order multipole modes become more important. Moreover, the similarity in dielectric functions of silver and gold gives rise to almost identical optical properties at wavelengths exceeding 700 nm. For oblate and prolate nanoparticles, the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole plasmon resonances for aspect ratios up to 8 are considered. As with the nanospheres, extinction spectra for small nanodisks and nanorods are in agreement with the quasi-static approximation, whereas for larger dimensions, a red shift is observed. The plasmon peak positions are analyzed in terms of a material-independent factor that only depends on the geometry. We attempt to obtain a generalized description of the plasmon energies as a function of particle geometry and size. Finally, the size-dependent red shift is compared to surface plasmon dispersion relations and discussed in terms of surface curvature of the nanoparticle edge. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"At-wavelength; Dielectric functions; Extinction spectra; Gold particles; Higher order; Mie theory; Multipole plasmon resonances; Multipoles; Nano-spheroids; Nanodisks; Noble metal nanoparticles; Noble metals; Particle dimensions; Particle geometries; Particle radii; Plasmon energy; Plasmon peaks; Plasmon resonances; Quadrupoles; Quasistatic approximations; Red shift; Surface curvatures; Surface plasmons; Aspect ratio; Doppler effect; Geometry; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Numerical methods; Optical data storage; Optical properties; Plasmons; Surface plasmon resonance; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957841581

Our calculations find that the planar ZnO monolayer preferably adsorbs hydrogen molecules, where a hydrogen molecule attaches to one oxygen atom with binding energy of ∼0.13 eV. This implies that the interaction between a hydrogen molecule and the ZnO sheet is stronger than that between a hydrogen molecule and graphene. We predict that each oxygen atom in a ZnO sheet can adsorb two hydrogen molecules on opposite sides of the sheet, and thus the gravimetric density for hydrogen storage on ZnO sheet is evaluated to be about 4.7 wt % at zero temperature. Furthermore, our calculations show that the gravimetric density for hydrogen storage on ZnO sheet reaches 1.5-2.1 wt % at 298 K and 5 MPa.

One interesting use of PCMs is long-term energy storage, in which a phase transition is triggered externally. In addition, PCMs are a potential method of administering heat for therapeutic purposes (therapeutic hyperthermia). This exciting therapeutic intervention provides an adjunct to chemotherapy and the potential to improve drug absorption. The purpose of this study was to characterize and control the heat generation process from supercooled salt PCMs. Salts were selected on the basis of their lack of toxicity and previous use in medicine. The crystallization of sodium formate, acetate (SA), and thiosulfate (ST) was characterized and monitored for heat generation. Only SA and ST had the wide metastable limits and exothermic crystallization appropriate for safe dermal hyperthermia (32-50 °C). The crystallization rate, heating profile, and heat capacities (Cp) of the PCM and dry crystals at different supersaturation levels (high (H) and low (L)) were determined. A low degree of supersaturation produced lower maximum temperatures (e.g., SAHT max = 55.7 ± 0.3 °C, SALTmax = 39.1 ± 0.3 °C), whereas low crystallization rates provide prolonged hyperthermia (e.g., STH DUR 1125 s). The heat release profiles can be optimized for therapeutic applications by controlling the following variables: (1) mass of salt which crystallizes (enthalpy released), (2) rate of crystallization, and (3) relative heat capacities of the supercooled solution and crystalline material. As an example, therapeutically relevant hyperthermia increased lidocaine flux across a model skin membrane from 7.18 ± 1.8 to 33.7 ± 2.6 μg cm-2. The current study has characterized the thermogenesis from pharmaceutically acceptable materials and provides for the development of PCMs as reliable, effective, and therapy-specific heat administration systems. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Administration system; Crystallization rates; Drug absorption; Exothermic crystallization; Generation process; Heat capacities; Heat release; Low degree; Maximum temperature; Metastable limits; Potential methods; Rate of crystallization; Storage solutions; Therapeutic Application; Therapeutic intervention; Buoyancy; Chemotherapy; Crystalline materials; Crystallization; Heat storage; Linear transformations; Polymer blends; Specific heat; Supercooling; Supersaturation; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955412994

To fill this gap, we employed the G4(MP2) method to determine heats of formation, entropies, and Gibbs free energies of formation for 38 alane complexes with NH 3-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-3), pyridine, pyrazine, triethylenediamine (TEDA), quinuclidine, OH2-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-2), dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Monomer, bis, and selected dimer complex geometries were considered. Using these data, we computed the thermodynamics of the key formation and dehydrogenation reactions that would occur during hydrogen delivery and alane regeneration, from which trends in complex stability were identified. These predictions were tested by synthesizing six amine-alane complexes involving trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, TEDA, quinuclidine, and hexamine and obtaining upper limits of δG° for their formation from metallic aluminum. Combining these computational and experimental results, we establish a criterion for complex stability relevant to hydrogen storage that can be used to assess potential ligands prior to attempting synthesis of the alane complex. On the basis of this, we conclude that only a subset of the tertiary amine complexes considered and none of the ether complexes can be successfully formed by direct reaction with aluminum and regenerated in an alane-based hydrogen storage system. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Complex stability; Dehydrogenation reactions; Dimer complexes; Direct reactions; Electron donors; Energies of formation; Experimental investigations; Heats of formation; Hexamines; Hydrogen delivery; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen storage system; Metallic aluminum; Potential ligand; Pyrazines; Quinuclidines; Relative stabilities; Tertiary amine; Tetrahydrofurans; Thermodynamic data; Triethylamines; Triethylenediamine; Trimethylamine; Upper limits; Vehicular applications; Aluminum; Chelation; Dehydrogenation; Dimers; Ethers; Hydrogen; Organic solvents; Storage (materials); Synthesis (chemical); Thermochemistry; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954579968

The prepared random copolymers are denoted as P(VPKxOXDy) or P(VPKxBOXDy) with three different electron donor/acceptor (x/y) ratios of 8/2, 5/5, and 2/8. The electrical switching behavior based on the ITO/polymer/Al device configuration could be tuned through the donor/acceptor ratio or acceptor trapping ability. Both experimental and theoretical results indicated that the charge transfer between the pendant donor and acceptor was relatively weak without significant orbital hybridization. In addition, the low-lying HOMO energy level of OXD or BOXD units as compared to VPK units created the trapping environment. Therefore, distinct electrical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics changed between the diode, the volatile memory, and the insulator depending on the relative donor/acceptor ratios of 10/0, 8/2, and (5/5, 2/8 and 0/10), respectively.

The unstable ON state in the device was due to the shallow trapped holes with spontaneously back transferring of charge carriers when the electric field was removed and thus exhibited a volatile nature. The slightly lower HOMO level of OXD moieties than that of BOXD led to the P(VPK8OXD2) device storing the charge for a longer period of time.

Here, in this work, we present a facile method for the fabrication of self-organized titania nanotubes grown by anodic oxidation of titanium foil with different subsequent heat-treatment regimes for use as binder-free working electrodes in supercapacitor applications. The capacitance of these highly ordered titania nanotubes, when exposed to a reductive atmosphere during annealing, was determined to be well above 900 F cm-2, confirming that the capacitance contribution was pseudocapacitive in nature. The behaviour of oxygen depleted titania in the anatase to rutile (A → R) phase transformation and also in electrochemical charge storage has been studied in detail. It was found that upon the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti 3+, with oxygen depletion of the structure, the A → R phase transformation was promoted.

The porosity of the CDCs, which is mainly in the microporous regime, may be modulated by the choice of metal carbide precursor and halogenation temperature. However, although the pore size of CDCs can be fine-tuned by the choice of synthesis process, the maximum surface area achieved is only up to 2500 m 2 g-1, which limits their use in gas storage or in electrochemical capacitor applications that require larger surface areas. The article is focussed on what has and can be done to enhance the textural properties of CDCs via further post-synthesis treatments and the ramifications of such modifications on their gas/energy storage capacity.

Chemical shifts in the hydrogenated milled AC were observed near 0 and 2 ppm. In addition, the peak near 0 ppm was separated into two peaks (α and β) by the deconvolution of the NMR spectra; -0.6 and 0.2 ppm. This indicates that hydrogenated milled AC has three hydrogen components with different molecular mobilities. Measurement of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) revealed that the hydrogen near 0 and 2 ppm consisted of two components (Components 1 and 2) and one component (Component 3), respectively. However, the activation energies (Ea) of each hydrogen component could not be estimated because the plots of inverse temperature (1/T) versus the logarithm of T1 (ln T1) were scattered. We assumed that the components near 0 ppm (Component 1 and/or 2) were thermally unstable because the intensity of the chemical shift near 0 ppm decreased as the measurement temperature increased, and this might have an effect on T1 measurements. The spin-spin relaxation time (T2) indicated high and low molecular mobility at each chemical shift and several temperatures. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The surface coating layers were analyzed by morphology observation using a transmission electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used for element investigation. The surface modification effects on rate capability during cycling and capacity retention for the LiMn2O4 spinel oxide were confirmed. Then Mn dissolution during storage at elevated temperatures of the pristine, coated sample was characterized. The Mn dissolution characterization was based on the idea that Mn dissolution is one of the most significant reasons for capacity loss for LiMn2O 4 spinel oxide, and this phenomenon is especially severe at elevated temperatures. Our experimental results indicate that the surface-modified sample shows much a better initial capacity and rate capability compared with the pristine sample. The [Li,La]TiO3 coating effectively enhances the structural stability of LiMn2O4 at elevated temperatures, most likely because the [Li,La]TiO3-modifying layers play a definitive role in suppressing Mn dissolution in the electrolyte during storage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature and requires extremely high pressures to form the hydride from aluminum and hydrogen gas. Here, we describe an alternate method of synthesizing AlH3 using Ti-catalyzed Al powder, H2, and trimethylamine (TMA) to form an alane adduct. The formation of trimethylamine alane occurs at modest hydrogen pressures (∼100 bar), forming the 2:1 bis complex (2 trimethylamine/AlH3). Along with the hydrogenation product, mono (1:1) and bis (2:1) standards of TMA-AlH3 were prepared and characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the reaction products showed that the Ti catalyst remains with the unreacted Al powder after hydrogenation and is not present in the alane adduct. We also demonstrate that TMA can be transaminated with triethylamine to form triethylamine alane, which can easily be separated to recover AlH 3. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Al powder; Alternate method; Aluminum hydrides; Decomposition temperature; High pressure; Hydrogen densities; Hydrogen gas; Hydrogen pressures; Hydrogenation products; Room temperature; Storage compounds; Ti-catalyzed; Triethylamines; Trimethyl-amine alane; Trimethylamine; Aluminum; Aluminum powder metallurgy; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Raman spectroscopy; Thermoanalysis; X ray diffraction; Absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952283933

Aged and oxidized copper nanoparticles with an average primary particle size of ∼15 nm, when combined with hydrochloric acid solutions in the range of 0.025 to 0.1 M, show interesting behavior yielding both a change in nanoparticle primary size, as measured by an electrospray scanning mobility particle sizer, and in chemical composition to produce a copper chloride hydroxide mineral identified as paratacamite (γ-Cu2(OH)3Cl) by powder X-ray diffraction of the dehydrated solid sample. Taken together, these data suggest that paratacamite nanoparticles in solution can aggregate to yield microporous paratacamite materials. Microporous paratacamite was characterized by several techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface area measurements. Oxidation of these copper-based nanoparticles with molecular oxygen and the role of the oxidized layer in the formation of paratacamite have been investigated. Comparison to microscale copper particles showed there is unique oxidation behavior of nanoscale copper particles that results in unique reaction chemistry of oxidized nanoscale copper particles with hydrochloric acid solutions to form paratacamite. This study provides a new route for the formation of paratacamite nanomaterials that can be used in a wide range of chemically interesting applications including hydrogen storage materials and as a heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of green solvents such as dimethyl and diethyl carbonates.

For example, at 298 K and 100 bar, Li-ZIF-70 totally binds to 3.08 wt % H2, Na-ZIF-70 to 2.19 wt % H2, and K-ZIF-70 to 1.62 wt % H2, much higher than 0.74 wt % H2 for pristine ZIF-70. Thus, the dopant effect follows the order of Li-ZIF &gt; Na-ZIF &gt; K-ZIF, which correlates with the H2 binding energies to the dopants. Moreover, the total H2 uptake is higher at lower temperatures: 243 K &gt; 273 K &gt; 298 K. On the other hand, delivery H2 uptake, which is the difference between the total adsorption at the charging pressure (say 100 bar) and the discharging pressure (say 5 bar), is the important factor for practical on-board hydrogen storage in vehicles. We show that delivery H2 uptake leads to Na-ZIF-70 (1.37 wt %) &gt; K-ZIF-70 (1.25 wt %) &gt; Li-ZIF-70 (1.07 wt %) &gt; ZIF-70 (0.68 wt %), which is different from the trend from the total and excess uptake. Moreover, the delivery uptake increases with increasing temperatures (i.e., 298 K &gt; 273 K &gt; 243 K)! To achieve high delivery H2 uptake at room temperature, the large free volume of ZIFs is required. We find that higher H2 binding energy needs not always lead to higher delivery H2 uptake. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Dopant effects; First-principles; Force fields; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Imidazolate; In-vehicle; Room temperature; Adsorption; Automobile exhibitions; Computer simulation; Doping (additives); Hydrogen storage; Monte Carlo methods; Nuclear energy; Organic polymers; Potential energy; Sodium; Binding energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952032691

However, the maximum H2 adsorption energies in MOFs are only around 10 Kj·mol-1, leading to small adsorption capacities at ambient temperature. In this work we use ab initio calculations and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to explore metal alkoxide functionalization for improving H2 storage in IRMOF-1, IRMOF-10, IRMOF-16, UiO-68, and UMCM-150. We examine functionalization with lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and copper alkoxides. We show that lithium and magnesium alkoxides physically bind H2 and manganese, nickel, and copper alkoxides chemically bind H2. H2 binding energies calculated with quantum mechanics are -10, -22, -20, -78, and -84 Kj·mol-1, respectively, for the first hydrogen molecule. Of these, lithium and manganese alkoxides bind H2 too weakly to enhance adsorption at ambient temperature, even at 100 bar. Owing to the strong binding energies, Ni and Cu exhibit high uptake at low pressure, but metal alkoxide sites saturate at pressures as low as 1 bar. They thus exhibit poor deliverable capacities [wt % (100 bar) - wt % (2 bar)]. Magnesium alkoxide exhibits low uptake at low pressure and high uptake at high pressure and is a promising functional group for enhanced ambient-temperature hydrogen storage in all MOFs studied. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Ab initio calculations; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption energies; Alkoxides; Ambient temperatures; Functionalizations; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; High pressure; Hydrogen molecule; Hydrogen storage materials; Low pressures; Metal alkoxides; Metal organic framework; Porous solids; Quantum mechanics; Adsorption; Binding energy; Binding sites; Calculations; Functional groups; Hydrogen; Lithium; Magnesium; Manganese; Metals; Nuclear energy; Organic polymers; Potential energy; Quantum theory; Storage (materials); Temperature; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952683326

In the present study, by directly introducing Ce-Al species with a structure of CeAl2 into NaAlH4, a dramatic enhancement in the hydrogen release and uptake kinetics of NaAlH4 was achieved. CeAl2-doped NaAlH4 can be reloaded 4.9 wt % hydrogen at moderate conditions in 20 min, which is among the highest values ever reported for NaAlH4. Besides, the material exhibits an exceptional performance under low pressures. For example, a capacity of more than 4.0 wt % hydrogen can be achieved at a hydrogen pressure as low as 4.0 MPa. The apparent activation energy of NaAlH4 doped with 2 mol % CeAl2 is estimated to be 72.3-90.4 Kj·mol and 93.6-98.9 Kj·mol for the first and the second dehydrogenation step respectively by using Kissinger's approach, much lower than those of pristine NaAlH4.

The crystal structure and thermal and dielectric properties of the sintered ceramics were investigated as a function of composition by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric spectroscopy. The results indicated that the presence of BiAlO3: BAO in the solid solution decreased the structural stability of the overall perovskite phase. Dielectric, thermal and P-E hysteresis results confirmed that no ferroelectric intermediate phase was seen in the PZO-BAO system. An antiferroelectric phase can be stable in a wide temperature range, indicating that BAO enhanced antiferroelectric phase stability in perovskite PZ manifests by ""square"" antiferroelectric behavior.

The sample prepared using a conventional-grade V material contained 0.530 mass% of oxygen, and the other sample prepared from a low-oxygen V material contained 0.051 mass% of oxygen. Both samples showed P-C isotherms with two plateaus corresponding to formation of monohydrides and dihydrides. The sample with the higher oxygen concentration had an equilibrium pressure for dihydride formation 6.7 times higher than that of the sample with the lower oxygen concentration at 0 °C. There was no significant difference between the two samples with regard to the equilibrium pressure for formation of monohydride or the hydrogen capacity. The formation enthalpies were calculated from the van't Hoff plots: -30.2 kJ/molH2 and -35.5 kJ/molH2 for the dihydrides, and -39.7 kJ/molH2 and -39.8 kJ/molH2 for the monohydrides. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the sample with the higher oxygen concentration contained a Ti-rich secondary phase, which caused changes in the composition and in the lattice parameter of the main phase. These results indicated that increasing the oxygen concentration altered the hydrogenation properties as a result of (1) the effect of oxygen solved in the main phase on hydrogen occupation and (2) a composition change resulting from secondary phase formation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

After ball milling for 1 h the resulting grain size of β-MgH2 was equal to ∼30 nm. Subsequently, the nanocomposite was subjected to 150 desorption/absorption cycles at 325 °C. A gradual loss of hydrogen storage capacity upon cycling from ∼5.2 wt.% after 1 cycle to ∼4.6 wt.% after 150 cycles is observed on respective PCT curves obtained at 325 °C after every 25 cycles. The TPD curves temperature maxima are gradually shifted to a higher temperature range with increasing number of cycles which may indicate a lowering of the overall rate of transformation. Thorough microstructural investigations using such techniques as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples after 150 cycles of desorption/absorption show profound microstructural changes such as sintering of individual powder particles into agglomerates, increase in grain/crystallite size (&gt;100 nm), segregation of the Cr2O3 particles to the interfaces between the sintered Mg particles and some reduction of Cr2O3 to Cr and MgO. All these microstructural changes seem to be responsible for the reduction of hydrogen storage capacity upon cycling and lowering the overall rate of transformation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These COFs are designed via the combination of ab initio calculations and force-field calculations. For this goal, we explore the adsorption sites of carbon dioxide on COFs, their porosity, as well as carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms. We identify the binding sites and energies of CO2 on COFs using ab initio calculations and obtain the carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms using grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo calculations. Moreover, the calculated adsorption isotherms are compared with the experimental values in order to build the reference model in describing the interactions between the CO2 and the COFs and in predicting the CO2 adsorption isotherms of COFs. Finally, we design three new COFs, 2D COF-05, 3D COF-05 (ctn), and 3D COF-05 (bor), for the high capacity CO 2 storage. The carbon dioxide adsorption values of the new 3D COFs are about six times larger than that of MOF-177.

This solution processing method employs precursors that only contain the elements of V, W, O and H, which avoids impurity elements such as Na that has been commonly used in other solution methods (e.g. using precursors of sodium metavanadate and sodium tungstate solution). The V2O5-WO3 composite films show enhanced Li-ion intercalation properties compared to pure V2O 5 and WO3 films. For example, at a high current density of 1.33 A/g, V2O5-WO3 film with a V 2O5/WO3 molar ratio of 10/1 exhibits the highest capacities of 200 mA h/g at the first cycle and 132 mA h/g after 50 cycles, while pure V2O5 film delivers discharge capacities of 108 mA h/g at the first cycle and 122 mA h/g after 50 cycles. The enhanced Li-ion intercalation properties of the composite films are ascribed to the reduced crystallinity, the increased porosity and thus the enhanced surface area. Both the cyclic voltammogram and chronopotentiometric curves of the V 2O5-WO3 film with a molar ratio of 10:1 are distinctively different from those of pure oxide films, suggesting a different Li-ion intercalation process in the V2O5-WO3 film with the molar ratio of 10:1. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Four types of structures of alloys and their hydrides including TiAl3, ZrAl3, AuCu3, and segregated types of structures were considered. The stability of the configurations, and the structural and electronic bonding properties were studied. The hydrogenation properties depend highly on the structure of the alloys. The ordered alloys have very similar properties to that of pure Mg. For segregated alloys, the hydrogenation properties can be divided to Ti-like, ordered alloy-like and Mg-like from low to high hydrogen concentration. The formation energies show that for the four structures, segregated Mg0.75Ti0.25 is favored for alloys, whereas TiAl3 type of Mg0.75Ti 0.25H2 are favored for hydrides. Therefore hydrogen induced structural rearrangement of the intermetallic structures of the Mg 0.75Ti0.25 might occur upon hydrogen cycling. For the non-homogenous Mg-Ti-H system, further phase segregation of Ti in Mg might occur.

This effect is well revealed only in ceramics having a character fine-grain microstructure obtained due to injection of small amount of thermally transferred energy, while structural monolithization caused by great value of thermally transferred energy into ceramics bulk reveals an opposite influence.

Island Sn particles were obtained on the copper foil. Cu 6Sn5 was spontaneously generated at the interface between Sn and Cu foil. To further improve the cycling stability, Cu source was introduced to increase the formation of Cu6Sn5 and to serve as a buffer during cycling. Moreover, the phase and elemental ratio of Sn and Cu varied in the synthesized electrode by alternately adjusting sputtering time for Sn and Cu. The cell synthesized by sputtering Sn for 5 min and Cu for 9 s alternately exhibited the best cycling stability. The 1st charge capacity of cell was 635 mA hg-1, and the 1st efficiency was even higher than 97%. The capacity remained higher than 500 mA hg-1 after 15 cycles. The phase transformation of cell was investigated through voltage profile, CV curve and in situ XRD analysis. The in situ XRD analysis confirmed that Cu 6Sn5 could react with lithium directly without the presence of Li2CuSn during cycling. The reaction mechanism of Cu 6Sn5 with lithium during cycling was demonstrated to be an alloying process, and the structure of Cu6Sn5 was thus a low-temperature monoclinic phase. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Following GM's Vehicle Development Process (VDP), HEVT established team goals that meet or exceed the competition requirements for EcoCAR in the design of a plug-in extended-range hybrid electric vehicle. The competition requires participating teams to improve and redesign a stock Vue XE donated by GM. The result of this design process is an Extended-Range Electric Vehicle (E-REV) that uses grid electric energy and E85 fuel for propulsion. The vehicle design is predicted to achieve an SAE J1711 utility factor corrected fuel consumption of 2.9 L(ge)/100 km (82 mpgge) with an estimated all electric range of 69 km (43 miles) [1]. Using E85 fuel (corn-based in North America for the 2015 timeframe), the well-to-wheels petroleum energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 90 % and 30 % respectively when compared to the stock 4-cylinder, gasoline-fueled Vue XE. The powertrain selected by HEVT for the Virginia Tech Range-Extended-Crossover (VTREX) is a split parallel architecture. On the front axle, there is a 2.4 L FlexFuel engine coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission. On the rear axle there is an 80 kW Siemens AC Induction transaxle, liquid cooled, motor. The vehicle uses a 20 kWh (nominal) Lithium Iron Phosphate rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) using battery modules and controllers donated from A123 Systems. Using the grid electricity stored in the RESS, the 80 kW (peak) motor powers the vehicle for an estimated 69 km (43 miles) of all electric driving to a top speed of 160 kph (100 mph) which has only been modeled due to limitations in test facilities. Another smaller electric motor, a 15 kW (peak), AC induction, liquid cooled motor is mounted directly to the engine and belted to the engine crank. This motor allows the vehicle to perform engine idle start/stop and load leveling, which eliminates idle fuel use and increases the average operating efficiency of the FlexFuel engine. This paper will detail how computer aided design (CAD) was used to integrate the above hybrid powertrain into the GM donated vehicle, while briefly touching on powertrain controls and safety. Vehicle test results will be reported from the Year 2 EcoCAR Competition that was held at GM's desert proving grounds in Yuma, AZ at which HEVT placed second overall. At Yuma, the vehicle performance was characterized in several areas - data was gathered for acceleration (0-100 kph and 80-110 kph), braking (100-0 kph), and fuel consumption. Limitations of the vehicle platform and further refinements for the competition vehicle will be discussed as well.

Within foreseeable future, the charging infrastructure will still remain relatively short. The time for battery charging is also significant longer compared to that for filling gasoline tank. It is thus of practical benefit for EV operation to predict the battery energy demand for a specific trip a prior. In this paper, we present a trip specific scheme for estimating the battery SOC change based on the trip information from GIS and ITS traffic data. In particular, this study incorporates the stochastic nature of traffic data. For the EV battery pack, the probabilistic change of battery SOC can thus be estimated throughout the spatial domain by combining the stochastic driving cycle, vehicle propulsion dynamics and battery dynamics. In consequence, for the overall trip, a stochastic evaluation can be provided for the possible SOC change. An approximate constant-acceleration model is assumed, and the relevant model parameters are modelled as Gaussian processes, with the probabilistic model established with test drive data. The stochastic characteristics of the SOC change for a specific trip is then evaluated via the Monte Carlo method. The proposed scheme is validated with an EV model and a typical commute trip in the Greater Milwaukee area. Historical traffic data are used to generate the stochastic model of driving cycles for the individual trip segments. Simulation results have shown that for the example trip, the SOC change is 33.4% ± 6.4% with 95 % confidence.

With an increasing presence of advanced energy generation and storage devices in UAV power architectures such as fuel cells, photovoltaics, super capacitors etc. and an increasing potential to dynamically control a UAV system's load profiles, mission effectiveness can be substantially improved via intelligent power management techniques as well as through traditional efficiency improvements. Load scheduling, power smoothing and dynamic mission planning can all introduce energy saving and optimisation opportunities, particularly when the characteristics of system loads can be matched with the energy storage and generation of the system. Traditionally, the biggest drain on an electric UAV system is the main propulsion system, however initial investigations into a typical mini UAV platform (<20kg) have indicated that a complex communication architecture and payload can present an energy drain of a comparable magnitude. In order to characterise the full impact of the constantly fluctuating system loads, a full simulation environment has been built that will simultaneously calculate the power demands of a UAV's propulsion, avionics, payload and communication systems as individual components in a UAV power profile model. The simulation environment also simulates the energy sources of the system, using typical steady state and dynamic characterisations. The effect of intelligent power management techniques can then be fully quantified via mission simulations. By understanding the changing demands in the system it is possible to introduce significant savings by predicting peak power demand periods, this will allow the potential to introduce some control to minimise the peak demands and optimising the power architecture to be able to efficiently handle the peaks in the most efficient way possible. The simulation environment is supported by an integrated hardware test platform enabling validation of mission simulations before flight test. The paper will present and discuss the concept of the simulation environment and hardware test platform in the context of intelligent power management. A case study, focussing on an improved communications power architecture, is presented.

With this type of architecture, it is becoming a necessity to equip these vehicles with devices that can draw their power from the high voltage (HV) RESS. These HV devices are not only used to support the propulsion of the vehicle but to perform other necessary vehicle functions as well. With demands of high voltage power from multiple systems ranging from RESS thermal conditioning, cabin thermal conditioning, RESS charging, and vehicle propulsion, power demands can exceed the available power of the vehicle. This creates a perplexing problem of how to manage the high voltage power consumption between the different vehicle systems. This document describes how a controls method to manage the HV loads of a vehicle can be implemented to optimize the use of available power and ensure that power consumption remains within the operating bounds of the RESS. This document will also go into detail regarding when these types of vehicles may get into power constraining conditions and how a control system would manage power allocation in each specific condition.

Specifically, the system analyzed is a mini-excavator, wherein the digging functions are powered using four variable displacement pump/motors - these units are also shared by the auxiliary functions. In addition, the on-board hydraulic energy storage device, or accumulator, is charged or discharged using an additional pump/motor, called the storage unit. A parallel architecture is used for the hybrid system wherein the additional pump/motor is on the engine shaft, running at the same speed as the engine (and the other four pumps). An aggressive and fast, digging cycle was used to size the storage unit and accumulator, as well as to compare the performance of the two different strategies. The motivation behind this simulation study was to investigate additional fuel savings over the non-hybrid DC system, while also demonstrating feasibility of engine downsizing. The first PM strategy presented operates the downsized engine at the maximum speed possible while commanding the displacement of the storage pump in such a manner that the engine operates at constant torque. The second strategy operates the engine at the minimum allowable speed at every instant (pre-computed offline), while commanding the displacements of the storage pump so as to keep engine operation along a constant power line, in a high-efficiency area of the engine fuel map, whenever possible. As a result of the minimum-speed strategy, the displacements of the pump/motors supplying the actuator also tend to stay higher than the ones resulting from the maximum-speed strategy.

Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) use a combination of storage types, for example different types of batteries and ultracapacitors, to tailor the characteristics of the storage system to each application. In addition to sizing the system for the intended application, a suitable strategy for the integration of the energy storage system must be adopted. In the present application, a HESS has been designed for the electrification of a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica, through consideration of a combination of high capacity batteries, high power batteries, and capacitors. Hybrid storage systems using batteries alone, batteries and capacitors, and dual batteries have been considered. Each configuration used high capacity batteries as an energy device and a power device such as capacitors or high power batteries. The high power device was sized to accept and deliver the kinetic energy of the vehicle at highway speed. The energy device was used to provide a suitable range.

Traditional systems for trains and buses rely on physical contact to transfer electrical energy to vehicles in motion. Until recently, conventional magnetically coupled systems required a gap of less than a centimeter. This is not practical for vehicles of the future. Power transferred by standing electromagnetic waves induced by the magnetic dipole of a loosely coupled air core transformer1,2,3,4 can theoretically provide the mechanism for this power transfer over a significant fraction of a meter without physical contact, eliminating the need for precision alignment between a vehicle and its power source. The air core is responsible for the loose coupling of this transformer's primary (transmitter) and secondary (receiver) and defines Evanescent Power Transfer (EPT). By comparison the wireless power transfer technology used by most systems on the market today is Inductive Power Transfer (IPT)5,6,7,8,9,10,11, which employs a fair amount of iron to increase the coupling. This paper describes the EPT approach at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). It has demonstrated power transfer greater than 4 kW in a full-scale laboratory apparatus with an efficiency of 95% from transmitting antenna to a battery-like load with an antenna separation of 25.4 cm. Higher power transfer levels will only require components with higher voltage ratings. Since optimum values for any one parameter do not line up with the others, the final set of operating conditions will depend more on economics than on the constraints of physics.

The VSI requires a very high performance dc bus capacitor that is costly and bulky. Other characteristics of the VSI not only negatively impact its own reliability but also that of the motor as well as motor efficiency. These problems could be eliminated or significantly mitigated by the use of the current source inverter (CSI). The CSI doesn't require any dc bus capacitors but uses three small ac filter capacitors and an inductor as the energy storage component, thus avoiding many of the drawbacks of the VSI. The CSI offers several inherent advantages that could translate into a substantial reduction in inverter cost and volume, increased reliability, a much higher constant-power speed range, and improved motor efficiency and lifetime. There are, however, a few barriers that have so far prevented the application of the CSI in hybrid electric vehicles. This paper discusses the barriers and proposed ways to overcome them.

Hybrid electric vehicles meet the high-efficiency of electric motors, with the high reliability of the internal combustion engines, granting optimal results both in terms of emissions and fuel economy. The vehicle and path features highly affect the architecture choice. A parallel architecture, having a more flexible layout and providing a higher drive power, is more suitable for long paths and higher speeds, while the series one better adapts to urban cycles, as can be switched to a pure electric mode. At the same time, a parallel-series architecture is in general a good choice. Another crucial point is the definition of a control strategy suitable for the mission the car is expected to accomplish, that must properly control both the load partitioning, between engine and motors, and the regenerative braking. According to all these considerations, with the present paper the Authors intend to lay the basis of a comprehensive methodology, which can allow to simply define an optimized powertrain layout, i.e. architecture and devices size, and an efficient control strategy. To this aim, our research group has developed an analytical code that simulates the power flows in HEV powertrain and allows to calculate the performances of a specific vehicle upon various and different missions. By knowing the energy required, the model allows to define a range of admissible states for each time step, resulting of the combination of the engine power and the corresponding motor power, considering regenerative braking and constraints imposed by the engine, the motors and the storage system. The best solution between all possible layouts is found with Dijkstra shortest path optimization algorithm electing the configuration allowing the minimum fuel consumption.

(Note: Safety and Abuse testing are outside of the scope of this paper.) The validation plan for the Chevrolet Volt Rechargeable-Energy Storage System (RESS), the first lithium-ion battery pack designed and manufactured by General Motors (GM), was developed using a functional silo approach based on the battery design requirements documentation. While the Chevrolet Volt was the lead program at General Motors to use this validation plan development approach, other GM programs with different battery system mounting locations and cooling techniques are now using this method. Battery system design validation (DV) and product validation (PV) test flows are segmented into three main areas: environmental / durability, electrical performance / characterization, and warranty lifecycle. There are challenging considerations in test flow development. These considerations include testing to life targets for the entire battery pack (i.e. cells, pack thermal system, and enclosure), choosing battery duty cycles that represented the full distribution of projected customer drive cycle profiles, and configuring test hardware based on test method (i.e. battery modules, ""dummy cell"" packs, or cell load simulators for controllers.)

Traditionally there have been two types of hybrid vehicle configurations; the parallel hybrid configuration takes advantage of power regeneration for short periods of zero emissions operation, whilst the series hybrid configuration acts as a continually variable transmission (CVT) so that increased engine efficiency can be obtained. The recent interest in hybrid vehicles has led to a number of non-traditional configurations, most notably the power-splitting hybrid electric vehicle, which uses an epicyclic gear as the power-splitting device, and can operate as either a series or a parallel hybrid. A further improvement to this configuration is proposed with the use of a Milner CVT (MCVT) to replace the epicyclic gear set. This offers greater simplicity, as well as the efficiency advantages of using a mechanical CVT to transmit power from either the internal combustion engine or the energy storage device (or both) to the final drive of the vehicle.

The technology advances in power electronics and energy storage technologies promises to bring plug-in electric vehicles (both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) into the commercial domain. Many vehicle manufacturers have planned to introduce their vehicles in the market within the next 3 years. However, charging of plug-in electric vehicles can potentially increase peak power demand on power distribution network, and may have impact on various grid assets including thermal loading, voltage, unbalance, losses etc. In order to estimate the potential impacts, we must estimate the additional power demands and its temporal variations due to charging of plug-in electric vehicles. A scenario-based analysis of the impact on the electric power grid has been taken, with Delhi as a case example case. It includes an estimation of the projected growth in number of vehicles, share of battery operated and plug-in hybrid vehicles among the various modes of transport. The impact on the electric power demand will depend significantly on the charging pattern of the vehicles. Both the options of charging from normal (household) ac power outlets, and the dedicated fast charging stations have been considered. It is desirable that charging of vehicles happen in such a way that the effects on the peak demand on the electric power grid is minimized. Since the use of off-peak power for charging of electric vehicles helps in minimizing the impact on the grid, management of vehicle charging will assume significance as level of penetration increases.

These characteristics also render them suitable for powering electric vehicles. However, a key gap exists in that batteries are solely used as storage devices with a lack of information flow. Next-generation battery technologies will constitute the enabling tools that would lead to information-rich batteries, thus allowing the transparent assessment of a battery's health as well as the prediction of a battery's remaining-useful-life (RUL) and its subsequent impact on vehicle mobility. Various methods and techniques have been employed to predict battery RUL in order to improve the accuracy of the State of Charge (SoC) estimation. This paper presents a comparative study of emerging prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques that can give an accurate quantification of the State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion battery cells and predict their remaining useful life. Two models, Adaptive Neural Network (AdNN) and Linear Prediction Error Method (L-PEM), will be used for battery capacity estimation and remaining useful life prediction. Their prediction performance (i.e. accuracy, robustness, sensitivity, etc.) is benchmarked using three Li-ion data sets. It can be concluded that both algorithms can successfully estimate battery capacity one-step-ahead and provide a remaining useful life of the rated capacity which is highly correlated to the battery health. It was observed that Adaptive Neural Networks provide a more accurate capacity estimation of one-step ahead while PEMs showed higher performance in remaining useful life prediction. Such prognostic capabilities applied to everyday battery technologies can digest large amounts of raw battery data (ex. voltage, current, impedance, etc.) and convert it to useful battery health and risk information. This can provide further intelligence to existing on-board Battery Management Systems (BMS) to relate battery health condition to vehicle mobility.

This trend has the drawback of inducing various Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) concerns in the drivetrain, since fairly low energy excitation often suffices to excite natural modes of thin walled structures, such as the transmission bell housing. Transmission rattle is one of the many undesired NVH issues, originating from irregularities in engine torque output. The crankshaft speed fluctuations are transferred through the transmission input shaft. Transmission compactness also allows repetitive interaction of conjugate loose gear pairs. The engine fluctuations disturb the otherwise unintended, but orderly meshing of these loose gears. This often leads to radiation of a characteristic air-borne noise from the impact sites. Structure-borne vibrations also occur by travelling structural waves along the retaining shafts to their support bearings and onto the flexible transmission housing. The paper investigates drive/creep rattle, which is a distinct form of rattle at partial engine loading and low engine speeds. The gear teeth impacts induce vibrations, which couple with the elastodynamics of the transmission casing. A multi-body dynamics model developed in ADAMS comprises a full 7 speed manual transmission of a front wheel drive vehicle. The kinematics of the transmission's input shaft (obtained from an experimental rig for low speed, low gear driving conditions) are used as an input to the model. Routines describing the transfer functions in the supporting bearings establish the link between the shafts/gear pairs' assembly and the elastic response of the casing. The modal behavior of the latter is included in the model through use of Craig Bampton mode reduction method. The predictions obtained from the numerical results are validated against experimental data acquired from an experimental rig.

Pure electric vehicles require bulky, heavy, and expensive battery packs to enable an acceptable drive-able range to be achieved. Extended-range electric vehicles (E-REV) partly overcome the limitations of current battery technology by having a 'range extender' unit, which consists of an onboard fuel converter that converts a liquid fuel, such as gasoline, into electrical energy whilst the vehicle is driving. This enables the traction battery storage capacity to be reduced, whilst still maintaining an acceptable vehicle driving range. In a previous paper the power requirement of a range extender for a typical C segment passenger car was investigated using drive-cycle modelling over real world cycles. This paper presents the detailed design of the range extender engine. Key attributes for the engine have been identified, these being minimum package volume, low weight, low cost, and good NVH. The selection of the appropriate engine technology to enable the final design to fulfill these attributes is described. The resulting design is highlights are presented and the final design is presented.

One of the key issues is to promote the incorporation of electric drivetrain in vehicles at all levels and particularly with emphasis on educational activities to prepare the workforce needed for the near future. Purdue University has been conducting a Grand Prix for over 50 years with Gas-powered Karts. In April 2010, an annual event was initiated to hold an EV Grand Prix where 17 EV Karts participated in the competition. Four of the participating teams comprised of Purdue students in a new graduate course for EV design and fabrication. Using the basic framework of the gas-powered Kart, an electric version was developed as a part of this course. Other participants were also provided with the guidelines and design parameters developed for the course and competition. Each EV Kart was powered by an electric motor rated at a nominal power of 11 kW (15 Hp) using Li-Fe batteries for energy storage. The vehicles are achieving racing speeds as high as 60 kph (37 mph) while being able to complete as many as 100 laps on the Purdue Grand Prix track in about 50 minutes. The power management and control systems integrated with the inherent engineering of electrically powered vehicles are the focus of this paper. As a part of this effort, selected vehicles participating in the competition were evaluated in a dynamic fashion during and after the competition. Data was collected using onboard and wireless systems as well as static measurements for the evaluation purposes. Characterization of the battery charging and discharging was conducted to better understand the role of this critical component in the design. It became evident that driver experience and approach was one of the key factors in Kart performance and energy efficiency. To further examine that, data from novice drivers using the same karts and tracks were compared showing significant improvements in energy efficiency and performance with experienced drivers. The performance vs. design basis of the EV Karts used to recognize the value of various options will be discussed in the paper.

KAIST, a globally leading university majoring in science and technology in Korea, has been developing a break-through wireless power transfer technology by applying inductive power transfer technology, as demonstrated in a public park in March, 2010, which is referred to as ""OLEV- On-line Electric Vehicle."" With the technology, it is possible to drive the electric powertrain and charge its battery simultaneously while the vehicle is in operation on the road. In this paper, a couple of specific noise and vibration phenomena are introduced which have been observed during the development phase of the proto-type of test vehicle. This noise issue became noticeable because the customers' expectations on noise and vibration levels of the electric vehicles are much higher than those on conventional Diesel or CNG vehicles. In addition, the noises from other sources, such as power electronic components or auxiliary equipment, became more audible because these noises were masked by the IC-engine operation in conventional vehicles. There were two noise phenomena identified, 'high pitch whine' and 'back buzz.' In order to understand the root-causes of the noise and vibration, a series of test plans was prepared and performed applying the fundamental 'source-path-radiator' model. With the understanding on the issues, it was possible to develop a series of recommended actions, which was very helpful in developing noncontact charging vehicle, especially in deciding how to design and implement the noise path isolation from the motor room of the vehicle or from the power electronics compartments. Thus we present the noise and vibration phenomena, root-cause analysis and possible remedies of those two noises and vibration issues in this paper. For the high pitch whine, the reduction was noticeable by changing the switching frequency of the buck converter as identified from the test results.

This next generation pre-chamber design simply replaces the spark plug in a conventional spark ignition engine. Turbulent Jet Ignition enables very fast burn rates due to the ignition system producing multiple, widely distributed ignition sites, which consume the main charge rapidly. This high energy ignition results from the partially combusted (reacting) pre-chamber products initiating combustion in the main chamber. The distributed ignition sites enable relatively small flame travel distances enabling short combustion durations and high burn rates. Multiple benefits include extending the knock limit and initiating combustion in very dilute mixtures (excess air and or EGR), with dilution levels being comparable to other low temperature combustion technologies (HCCI), without the complex control drawbacks. Previous Turbulent Jet Ignition experimental results have highlighted peak net indicated thermal efficiency values of 42% in a standard contemporary PFI engine platform. Additionally, the pre-chamber combustion system is capable of tolerating up to 54% mass fraction diluent (combination of excess air and EGR) at the world wide mapping point, resulting in near zero engine out NOx emissions. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a more thorough analysis of the technology and highlight the current speed load envelop recently achieved. Mini-map speed load experimental data is presented in this paper and used to generate several simulated drive cycles in a medium class passenger vehicle. Drive cycle fuel economy comparisons are then made across combustion regimes in the same engine platform, including stoichiometric spark ignition, lean burn spark ignition, HCCI and Turbulent Jet Ignition. Analysis highlights that a drive cycle fuel consumption improvement near 25% can be achieved with the Turbulent Jet Ignition combustion system, albeit with the high potential in meeting current day and future legislative emission regulations without the need for expensive lean NOx after-treatment. This would exceed the drive cycle fuel economy improvement achieved with other low temperature combustion technologies (HCCI) in the same engine platform as there is no requirement to switch back to conventional spark ignition combustion at high and low loads, which limits fuel economy improvements and maximum compression ratio for knock avoidance.

The all electric range obtained under real world conditions most often deviates significantly from the nominal value which is measured under idealized conditions. Under extreme conditions - slow traffic and demanding requirements for cabin heating or cooling - the electrical range might become less a question of spatial distance but even more of total operation time. Whereas with conventional powertrain, high flexibility of the total driving range can be obtained without sacrificing cost, with a pure battery vehicle this results in extreme high cost and weight of the energy storage. Therefore the difference between the typical daily driving range (e.g. in Germany 80-90% is below 50 km) and the minimum total range requested by most customers for acceptance of battery vehicles (200- 250 km), becomes essential. Based on the current battery technology, the most attractive approach is a battery capacity designed for the typical daily driving distance (e.g. 50 km) and an ICE powered Range Extender, covering larger energy requirements (higher power demand or longer driving distances). The most effective technical solution for such a Range Extender is largely determined by the ratio between pure battery operation and vehicle operation supported by the ICE. With primarily battery driven vehicles, the priorities for the ICE have to be set completely different compared to the conventional powertrain: NVH, package and weight are the most important items whereas the efficiency of the ICE is less important due to the low share of ICE operation. Hence, even ICE concepts, which are not optimal for pure ICE driven powertrains, proving to be ideal ICE for this kind of Range Extender application. For lowest cost and best fuel economy AVL developed a Range Extender solution with a unique 2-cylinder piston engine based on a cost and friction optimized design originating from 2-wheelers. With focus on best NVH, packaging and weight, an extremely compact and low weight Range Extender unit based on a highly integrated combination of a Rotary engine and an electric generator, was developed which also convinces with an outstanding NVH performance. This makes Range Extender solutions essential enablers for an affordable electric mobility.

Alternative energy storage systems (AESS), in the form of mechanical flywheels or hydraulic accumulators, offer the potential to reduce the vehicle costs, compared to the use of electrochemical batteries. In order to maximize the benefits of mechanical or hydraulic energy storage, the system design must maximize the energy recuperation through regenerative braking and the use of the energy stored with high roundtrip efficiency, while minimizing system volume, weight and cost. This paper presents a design procedure for alternative energy storage systems for mild-hybrid vehicles, considering parallel hybrid architecture. The procedure is applied with focus on the definition of design parameters and attributes for a hydraulic AESS with high pressure accumulator. The design methodology is based on a definition of targets and constraints for the AESS, obtained from a statistical analysis of the energy and power requirements of a variety of drive cycles. The design obtained was then implemented in an energy-based simulator over a selected variety of driving cycles. A comparison of performance (including power, energy and roundtrip efficiency) is conducted to evaluate the benefits provided by the hydraulic ESS for energy recuperation while comparing different design methods.

Testing was conducted on each individual thermal cooling mode to optimize, through control models, the energy efficiency of the system with the goal of maximizing electric vehicle range. While the three modes were intended to be mutually exclusive, optimization of the individual modes led to scenarios where all three modes could possibly be utilized depending on driving habits, ambient conditions, and power available.

For this reason, a greater understanding of the energy consumption of vehicles is needed, both for design and operational decisions. Exergy, a measure of available work in an imbalance of state, allows systems to be compared on an equal basis with losses and waste being equated to fuel costs. Vehicles and especially aircraft do not operate in steady state as do industrial plants, the traditional subject of exergy analysis. While some analysis of aircraft has been performed in the literature, time-variance has not been addressed, leading to a lack of detail and only very broad conclusions. It is proposed that in order to fully understand aircraft energy use, a fully time-variant analysis must be performed. It is the aim of this paper to discuss the first challenges encountered in designing a methodology to permit this and to describe the methods used to address these issues. To perform time-variant exergy analysis, exergy data are gathered at regular time intervals over the course of a mission at the inputs and outputs of system components. Sufficient fidelity is only achieved when time intervals are short enough (e.g. around 1 second), leading to the requirement to store and analyze a large amount of data. A database structure and a graphical front-end have been designed for these tasks. Intrinsic to the change from steady-state to time-variant exergy analysis is the inclusion of a storage term in all control volume exergy balances. This change requires some alteration to the way in which calculations are performed, as well as leading to some proposed amendments to Grassmann diagrams.

A critical factor in vehicle energy efficiency is the vehicle mass. Optimizing mass allows for the possibility of either increasing electric driving range with a constant level of electrochemical energy storage or holding the range constant while reducing the level of energy storage, thus reducing storage cost. In this paper, a methodology is outlined to study the tradeoff between the battery cost savings achieved by vehicle mass reduction for a constant electric driving range and the cost associated with lightweighting a vehicle. This methodology enables informed business decisions about the available engineering options for lightweighting early in the vehicle development process. The methodology was applied to a compact extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) concept. Detailed design and analysis was carried out to develop a vehicle concept which would achieve substantial vehicle mass reduction over the baseline design. This work resulted in the identification of many mass-reduction enablers and incorporated mass reduction potentials as well as cost estimates for implementing the enablers. In addition, a study was conducted to determine the cost of a battery as a function of vehicle mass for different generations of battery technology. Charts of the cost of lightweighting for all the enablers as well as the battery cost savings as a function of mass reduction were developed with and without the influence of mass decompounding. These charts were used to determine how much lightweighting is practical for various generations of battery technology. Results from the study indicate that there is generally a point at which the cumulative cost of mass-reduction enablers exceeds the benefit in battery cost savings. For early generations of battery technology where storage costs are relatively high, it makes more sense to spend money on vehicle lightweighting; however, as new battery technologies emerge (with lower cost and higher performance) the more costly vehicle lightweighting measures become uneconomical.

Generating electrical power, and also maintaining a specific thermal environment, are both critical capabilities for any mission. In the case of exploration, both a wide range of mission types (robotic, human, ISRU etc.) and a variety of environments exist: from interplanetary space, to the shadow of a lunar crater, to the attenuated and red-shifted lighting on the Martian surface, power requirements must be met. This objective could be met with different technologies. The choice is dictated by the operating conditions and the different types of mission. TAS-I is historically mainly involved in missions related to the space exploration with the presence of astronauts. A typical example is the exploration of the Moon with the installation on the Moon surface of a base inclusive of pressurized habitats and rovers. For this kind of application it has been identified as potential candidate the utilization of Regenerative Fuel Cell (RFC) System. The RFC is an electrochemical system that collects and stores solar energy during the day then releases that energy at night, thus making energy available all 24 hours. The process absorbs power from an external source (typically solar panels) and stores energy through the electrolysis process splitting water in Hydrogen and Oxygen. The energy is physically stored inside the reactant tanks, one for Hydrogen and one for Oxygen. When the energy is required the reactants are recombined inside a fuel cell, producing electric power, thermal power and water which is re-used during the next cycle. The research is being carried out by Thales Alenia Space Italy, in the framework of a regional program called STEPS. Thales Alenia Space has been supported in this activity by Politecnico di Torino and Hysytech.TAS-I with the associated team, has developed a 10 kW breadboard of a RFC System and in parallel a preliminary concept of a RFCS for a Pressurized Lunar Rover.

To perform this weighting The Society of Automotive Engineers Hybrid Committee has codified the concept of the utility factor in SAE J2841 - Utility Factor Definitions for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using Travel Survey Data. The J2841 utility factor weights the energy consumption from each energy source according to a model of US driving behavior derived statistics from the 2001 National Highway Transportation Survey, and the assumption that each vehicle begins the day trip fully charged and does not charge over the course of the day. This paper examines the sensitivity of the J2841 utility factor to more detailed models of vehicle charging behavior and proposes a utility factor model and simulation method as an alternative to J2841.

The true magnitude of these reductions is best assessed by comparative testing over relevant drive cycles. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) collected and analyzed real-world school bus drive cycle data, and selected similar standard drive cycles for testing on a chassis dynamometer. NREL tested a first-generation PHEV school bus equipped with a 6.4 L engine and an Enova PHEV drive system comprising a 25-kW/80 kW (continuous/peak) motor and a 370-volt lithium ion battery pack. For a baseline comparison, a Bluebird 7.2 L conventional school bus was also tested. Both vehicles were tested over three different drive cycles to capture a range of driving activity. Relative to the baseline school bus, the PHEV fuel savings in charge-depleting (CD) mode ranged from slightly more than 30% on the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule for Heavy Duty Vehicles and Rowan University Composite School Bus Cycle drive cycles to a little over 50% on the Orange County Bus cycle. However, the larger fuel savings lasted over a shorter driving distance, as the fully charged PHEV school bus would initially operate in CD mode for some distance, then in a transitional mode and finally in a charge-sustaining (CS) mode for continued driving. The test results indicate that a PHEV school bus can achieve significant fuel savings during CD operation relative to a conventional bus. In CS mode, the tested bus showed small fuel savings and somewhat higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions than the baseline comparison bus. Further refinements to realize hybridization fuel savings in CS mode and calibrations focused on reducing NOx could lead to both higher fuel economy and lower NOx emissions in the next generation PHEV bus design.

The pack consists of stiff end plates keeping the pack in tact using bolts, cooling fins to maintain cell temperature and foam padding in between cells. The pack level thermal requirements limit the amount of temperature increase during normal operating conditions. Similarly, the structural requirements state that the stresses and the deflection in the end plates should be minimal. Uncertainties in cell, foam mechanical and thermal properties might add variation to the pack performance.

In addition to the environmental issues the predicted scarcity of oil supplies and the dramatic increase in oil price puts new demands on vehicle design. As a result energy efficiency and reduced emission have become one of main selling point for automobiles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) have therefore become an interesting technology for the automotive industries. HEV are more complicated compared to conventional vehicles due to the fact that these vehicles contain more electrical components such as electric machines, power electronics, electronic continuously variable transmissions (CVT), and embedded powertrain controllers. Advanced energy storage devices and energy converters, such as Li-ion batteries and fuel cells are also considered. Computer simulation is indispensible to facilitate the examination of the vast hybrid electric vehicle design space with the aim to predict the vehicle performance over driving profiles, estimate fuel consumption and the pollution emissions. There are various types of mathematical models and simulators available to perform system simulation of vehicle propulsion. One of the standard methods to model the complete vehicle powertrain is ""backward quasistatic modeling"". In this method vehicle subsystems are defined based on experiential models in the form of look-up tables and efficiency maps. In the present work we have developed a semi-physical battery model that on one side could be simulated fast on the other side include all important physical phenomena in the battery. IEEE standard hardware description language VHDL-AMS has been used to model the battery.

In particular, the framework can be used for (1) benchmarking the fuel economy achievable from alternate hybrid powertrain technologies, (2) investigating sensitivity of fuel savings with respect to design parameters (for example, component sizing), and (3) evaluating the performance of various supervisory control algorithms for energy management. This paper describes such a simulation framework that can be used to predict fuel economy of series hydraulic hybrid vehicle for any specified driver demand schedule (drive cycle), developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The key components of the series hydraulic hybrid vehicle are modeled using a combination of first principles and empirical data. A simplified driver model is included to follow the specified drive cycle. The system-level model of the hybrid vehicle is developed in a bottom-up fashion, developing the key component models first, which are then integrated according to the series hydraulic hybrid vehicle topology, to represent the system behavior. The parameter data is chosen to represent a Class 6 medium-duty parcel delivery truck. The component models are validated using experimental data generated from in-house bench tests (for hydraulic pump/motors accumulator components) or provided by the manufacturer (for the diesel engine). An input-output validation technique was adopted with an upper spec limit of 10% on the error between output from the model output and experimental data. The system level model was validated by comparing experimental and simulated fuel economy for identical drive cycle inputs. The comparison was made for multiple vehicle payloads, with an average error of 7% for estimating fuel consumption for the series hydraulic hybrid vehicle. Further, to demonstrate the capability of the simulation framework, it is used to optimize the maximum system operating pressure for best fuel economy performance on a specified drive cycle.

With this truck it is possible to drive up to 3 kilometers in the pure electric driving mode. In this R&D Project the Engineering Center Steyr, a company of MAGNA Powertain has developed a hybrid truck with an integrated motor generator (IMG) including a clutch system for pure electric driving. Also a Li-Ion power battery, electrified traction voltage auxiliaries (steering pump, air compressor and climate compressor) and a cooling system for the new power electric components. The beginning of the paper shows a detailed layout of the developed hybrid truck. Chapter two shows the developed simulation model which is used for the dimensioning and for detailed simulations of hybrid drivetrains. To simulate thermal effects, a co-simulation environment between a longitudinal dynamics and thermal management software is applied. The longitudinal dynamics software calculates the propulsion power which determines the thermal load of the components. Particular attention was given to the electrical and thermal behavior of the traction battery. The coupling of longitudinal and thermal simulation enables a realistic computation of the energy use, since the effects such as the change of efficiency by temperature and load can be taken into account. This behavior has a high influence in the development and tuning of the vehicle's components and operating strategy. Therefore a special focus is given to the operation strategy of hybrid commercial vehicles. Finally an application shows simulated data of the hybrid commercial vehicle on standardized driving cycles and also cycles with a high proportion of urban driving. These simulations show a meaningful influence on the temperature of the components, especially the battery.

Comparative analysis between a standard passenger vehicle and three different hybrid solutions based on the same vehicle platform is presented. The following parallel hybrid powertrain solutions were investigated: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) solution (three different levels of hybridization are investigated with respect to different Electric Motor Generator size and battery storage/power capacity), High Speed Flywheel (HSF) system described as a fully integrated mechanical (kinetic) hybrid solution based on the quite innovative approach, and hydraulic hybrid system (HHV). In order to perform a fare analysis between different hybrid systems, analysis is also carried out for equal system storage capacities. All hybrid powertrain architectures include state-of-the-art hybrid components and are analyzed from the aspects of fuel economy related to the overall system efficiency, load point moving of the internal combustion engine due to energy flow control strategy operation, and regenerative braking (applying realistic drivability constraints). The simulations were performed within the IAV-VeLoDyn software environment. VeLoDyn (Vehicle Longitudinal Dynamics Simulation) is a modular and highly flexible Simulink-based software tool, which offers a straightforward simulation of longitudinal vehicle dynamics with special considerations on the driveline and model management functionality. In order to provide control and management of the hybrid powertrain system, a cycle-independent control strategy has been implemented into the supervisory hybrid control unit model, based on Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) approach. Due to the modular nature of the simulation tool, the control strategy was effectively implemented in all analyzed hybrid models with marginal modifications. In order to determine energy flows and validate hybrid powertrain behavior, a cycle-based energetic analysis was carried out, and the main results are presented in the paper.

Manufacturers' provided steady turbomachinery maps are usually utilized, although they operate in unsteady conditions as a consequence of pressure pulses propagating into the intake and exhaust systems. This may lead to some inaccuracies in the engine-turbocharger matching calculations, which may be solved through the introduction of proper time-delays (virtual pipe corrections). These drawbacks, however, became more relevant when engine operates under low speed and high load conditions, or during a transient maneuver, because of possibilities of compressor surging. This phenomenon can't be opportunely described employing classical manufacturers' maps: first of all, the flow through the compressor is strongly unsteady in these conditions; moreover, the information about both the unstable and reverse flow regions of compressor map is unavailable, and a somewhat arbitrary map's extrapolation technique must be utilized. In this paper two numerical procedures have been presented to predict automotive turbocharger compressor performance in surging operation. Firstly, a recently proposed approach is utilized to directly compute the stationary map of the compressor for direct and reverse flow conditions. The detailed 3D geometry of the compressor is reconstructed starting from a reduced set of geometrical data measured on the compressor wheel. Then, the 1D meanline evolution of blade angles, cross section and equivalent diameter are deduced from the 3D geometrical model. The steady 1D flow equations are finally solved along the meanline of stationary and rotating channels constituting the compressor device. Proper flow loss correlation holding for direct or reverse flow conditions are included in the model, which is applied to predict the extended steady maps of a turbocharger compressor. With reference to stable operating regions, the theoretically derived maps are compared to available manufacturer data and, after a limited loss coefficients tuning, a good agreement has been obtained. The steady procedure, however, can be utilized under unsteady flow conditions, too. Unsteady terms in flow equations are now accounted for, and mass and energy storages are allowed to occur within each stationary and rotating channel. In this way, compressor operation can be described with a quasi-steady method employing the extended map, or in a fully unsteady approach, as well. In the quasi-steady case, a proper virtual pipe correction is introduced, too. The two methodologies are tested to analyze their potential in characterizing compressor operation under surging conditions. To this aim, a reference compressor is connected to a outlet duct and a plenum. Compressor speed and downstream circuit are managed in order to promote deep surging conditions. Results obtained through the applications of the two methods are discussed in terms of pressure and temperature waves, mass flow rate evolution at compressor inlet and outlet, and Surging loop frequency, as well.

Understanding and controlling these interactions drives the vehicle mobility and energy efficiency. In this paper new issues related to tire slippage control are addressed. The paper analytically demonstrates that two tires on the same axle with the same rotational speeds can have different slippages when the normal reaction and inflation pressure vary due to motion conditions. Hence, a new method is proposed to control the rotational velocity of the wheels in a way that provides the same slippages of the tires by accounting for changes in the normal load and tire inflation pressure. This approach is especially beneficial for vehicles with individual (electric) wheel drives which can be individually controlled by introducing the proposed algorithm for controlling both the vehicle linear velocity and the tire slippages. The developed method is based on continuously monitoring the normal load and tire inflation pressure and using them as the inputs to estimate the theoretical linear velocity of the wheel (zero slippage). The control algorithm, based on an inverse dynamics approach, adjusts the applied wheel torques via closed loop feedback control of both the measured angular velocity and slippage of the wheels. A vehicle model, based on empirical data of terrain and tires, is created in LabVIEW software to simulate the tires of a terrain truck to evaluate the control algorithm.

Indeed, new challenges nowadays concern the reduction of pollutant emissions (EURO regulations) and CO2 emissions. To satisfy these new requirements, powertrains have become very complex systems including a large number of high technology components (high pressure injectors, turbocharger, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) loop, after-treatment devices-). In this context, the engine control plays a major role in the development and the optimization of powertrains. Few years ago, engine control strategies were mainly defined by experiments on engine test benches. This approach is not adapted to the complexity of future engines: on the one hand, tests are too expensive and on the other hand, they do not give many information to understand interactions between components. Today, a promising alternative to tests may be the use of 0D/1D simulation tools. These methods have been widely used in the past ten years and allow to build engine control algorithms. However, they are generally based on empirical models and often suffer from a lack of predictivity. A solution for extending the range of application of the system simulation consists in developing more physical models based on the 3D calculations experience. This way has been recently followed at IFP Energies nouvelles, leading to the development and implementation of several libraries dedicated to powertrains (IFP-Engine, IFP-Exhaust) and drivetrains (IFP-Drive) in the AMESim simulation software. The work we propose here is coherent with the approach chosen at IFP Energies nouvelles and aims at developing a phenomenological model for the pollutants emissions in a combustion chamber of a piston engine. For this purpose, a model able to take into account multiple injections, conventional Diesel mode and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode have been developed modelling physical phenomena like: spray atomisation and the liquid phase penetration - vaporisation deduced from a characteristic timepresumed mixing distribution computed with a β-function where the mixture fraction variance equation is obtained from the integration of turbulence, inlet/outlet spray zone mass and evaporationThe auto-ignition and diffusive combustion regimes determined by Flame Propagation of ILDM (FPI / Intrinsic Low-Dimensional Manifolds) tabulation combined with turbulence regime by a Presumed Conditional Moments (PCM) method In this paper, we propose a modelling of NOx based on tabulations of a characteristic time and NO mass fraction equilibria.

First, key equations relating storage, pressure, and compressed air flow are derived using fundamental thermodynamic relations. Next, these relations are used to calculate the relation between volume of storage and cycle time in load-unload compressors. It is shown that cycle time is minimized when compressed air demand is 50% of compressor capacity. The effect of pressure drop between compressor system and storage on cycle time is discussed. These relations are used to develop guidelines for compressed air storage that minimize energy consumption.

One of the major challenges of the automotive industry and research institutes worldwide currently is to develop and realize alternative fuel concepts for passenger cars. In line with Ford's global hydrogen vehicle program, different onboard hydrogen storage technologies are under investigation. In general, hydrogen storage methods can be categorized as either physical storage of hydrogen (i.e. compressed, liquid, or cryo-compressed) or material based hydrogen storage. Currently, automotive OEMs have only introduced hydrogen fleet vehicles that utilize physical-based hydrogen storage systems but they have recognized that hydrogen storage systems need to advance further to achieve the range associated with today's gasoline vehicle. At Ford Motor Company, compressed gaseous hydrogen storage systems at 35 MPa (350 bar) have been deployed to a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as well as internal combustion engine powered vehicles. The direct customer feedback from these hydrogen fleet vehicles was the need for improved driving range to be comparable with conventional vehicles. Through doubling the working pressure to 70 MPa (700 bar), the volumetric storage density of the fuel storage system significantly improves closing the performance gap of driving range. In this report, next-generation 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems are presented with regard to their overall design, component development, refueling capabilities, and verification testing on component, system as well as vehicle level. Overall, the 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems have demonstrated significant improvement in the compressed hydrogen fuel capacity facilitating the path for achieving greater than 300 miles range on fuel cell vehicles. The Ford 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems have been developed using the internal product development disciplines and have achieved the implementation milestone.

The key requirement for the RESS is to provide energy to drive an electric vehicle with no compromised performance for 40 miles. Extended Range Mode allows for this experience to continue beyond 40 miles. Multiple factors helped refine a requirement of at least 8 kWh usable energy, and 115 kW discharge power over the applied battery state of charge range.

Recent material developments and innovations allow for EPP to be specified in a wide range of densities, and with a variety of surface finishes and textures, as well as surface properties that allow it to be used in applications subject to NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) requirements, and those requiring material compatibility. Technical innovations now allow for material optimization, which enable EPP to conform to the stringent performance requirements and BSR (Buzz, Squeak and Rattle) guidelines for today's automotive interiors.

Recently, researchers have demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, flexible energy storage devices based on nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Due to their low mass, small size, and high energy storage potential, carbon nanomaterial-based energy storage devices are excellent candidates for use in micro vehicle applications. Because the performance of these prototypical devices is still limited, a significant amount of research must first be conducted before these energy storage devices can be incorporated into a micro vehicle platform. This work will examine existing energy storage devices in the context of micro vehicle applications, review recent advances in energy storage technologies, and discuss how these technologies may affect future micro vehicle design and performance.",,"Antennas; Energy storage; Lithium batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Nanostructured materials; Vehicle performance; Yarn; Commercial off the shelves; Energy storage technologies; Energy storage unit; Micro aerial vehicle; On-board energy storage; Vehicle applications; Vehicle structures; Weight constraints; Commercial vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864365326

Furthermore, the atomic-scale thickness control afforded by ALD enables the study of superconductivity and associated phenomena in homogeneous layers in the ultra-thin film limit. Two-dimensional superconductivity in such films is of interest from a fundamental point of view, as a new effect has recently been discovered at ultralow temperature in thin superconducting films made by ALD: the super-insulating transition.

These limitations attempt to prevent problems that might affect the stability and security of the electrical system. Restrictions that may apply to the penetration of wind energy can also be an obstacle when meeting European Union renewable energy objectives. As a partial solution to the problem, this paper proposes the installation of a properly managed, wind-powered, pumped hydro energy storage system (PHES) on the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands). Results from a dynamic model of the island's power system show that the installation of a pumped storage system is fully supported in all circumstances. They also show that the level of wind penetration in the network can be increased. These results have been obtained assuming that two of the largest existing reservoirs on the island (with a difference in altitude of 281 m and a capacity of aprox. 5,000,000 m3 each) are used as storage reservoirs with three 54 MW generators. Likewise, the ability of such facilities to contribute to the stability of the system is shown. This type of installation can reduce fossil fuel consumption, reducing CO2 emissions. Moreover, not only can the PHES improve wind penetration level, but it also allows the number of wind farms installed to be increased. Regions with geographically suitable sites and energy problems similar to those on the Canary Islands are encouraged to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of installing similar power systems to the one in this paper. Such systems have an enormous, unexplored potential within the general guiding framework of policies promoting clean, renewable energy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic analysis; Isolated power systems; PHES; Pumped storage system; Steady-state analysis; Wind energy","Carbon dioxide; Dynamic analysis; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Power transmission; Uninterruptible power systems; Wind power; Canary islands; Economic feasibilities; Electrical power system; Electrical systems; Energy problem; Energy storage systems; European Union; Isolated power system; Penetration level; PHES; Pumped Storage; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Steady-state analysis; Storage reservoirs; Wind farm; Wind penetration; Wind penetration levels; System stability; carbon dioxide; economic analysis; energy policy; energy resource; feasibility study; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; installation; numerical model; power plant; renewable resource; steady-state equilibrium; storage; wind farm; wind power; Canary Islands; Gran Canaria; Las Palmas; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82455191788

The CHP-HP-FG-CS concept is a high-efficiency and widely applicable option in distributed cogeneration better supporting the co-existence between cogenerators and intermittent renewables in the energy system. The concept involves integrating an efficient high-temperature compression heat pump that uses only waste heat recovered from flue gases as low-temperature heat source, and an intermediate cold thermal storage allowing for non-concurrent operation of the cogeneration unit and the heat pump unit. The model is applied for a paradigmatic case study that shows how the integration of a heat pump affects the operational strategy of a cogeneration plant. It is found that CHP-HP-FG-CS offers significant reductions in fuel consumption (-8.9%) and operational production costs (-11.4%). The plant's fuel-to-energy efficiency increases from 88.9 to 95.5%, which is state-of-the-art. The plant's intermittency-friendliness coefficient Rc improves only marginally due to the constrained nature of the low-temperature heat source and the associated small capacity of the heat pump unit.

High efficiency energy storage systems permit energy recovery, peak shaving and power quality functions. Due to their cost and the importance of system integration, there is a need for a correct design based on technical-economical optimization. In this paper, a method to design a centralized storage system for the recovery of the power regenerated by a number of electric drives is presented. It is assumed that the drives follow deterministic power cycles, but shifted by an uncertain amount. Therefore the recoverable energy and, consequently, the storage size requires the optimization of a random cost function, embedding both the plant total cost and the saving due to the reduced energy consumption during the useful life of the storage. The underlying stochastic model for the power profile of the drives as a whole is built from a general Markov chain framework. A numerical example, based on Monte Carlo simulations, concerns the maximization of the recoverable potential energy of multiple bridge cranes, supplied by a unique grid connection point and a centralized supercapacitor storage system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Decisions under uncertainty; Markov chains; Regenerative braking; Storage cost optimization; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Costs; Drives; Electric drives; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Recovery; Stochastic models; Decisions under uncertainty; Markov Chain; Regenerative braking; Storage cost optimization; Super capacitor; Energy efficiency; cost-benefit analysis; crane; decision making; design; electrical power; energy resource; energy use; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; uncertainty analysis; Gruidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80655147022

Within this paper another feasible way to gain arbitrage in storage utilisation is considered: Strategically increasing demand disregarding existing market prices. This means, charging electricity for storage is not only bought in low price periods, but in all periods where storage charging could influence demand so that market prices increase. This idea is expanded by focussing on another frequently discussed topic which could serve utilities for the same purpose: Automated Demand Side Management (DSM). By using data from Ontario's electricity market and applying a particular storage and DSM strategy it is analysed to which extent a non-regulated dominant power generation company could influence hourly demand and corresponding prices. It turns out that both strategies analysed derive additional revenues for the dominant power generation company compared to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) case. The results provide an indicator of potential threats for misuse from particular storage or DSM utilisation.

The storage process utilizes a boiling refrigerant at sub-ambient temperatures to freeze a latent heat storage material using electrically driven compressors. Recovery of the latent heat for electrical generation then uses vapor expansion and condensation which essentially reverses the storage process. Sensible heat storage is incorporated into the cycle to efficiently implement the concept. Both energy storage and generation are carried out under steady flow closed-loop conditions where the T-s diagram is similar to a Rankine cycle. From a thermodynamic perspective, work is supplied to the system while heat is transferred to the surroundings from the latent heat store. The reverse process generates work while using heat supplied by the surroundings. An analysis with expander/compressor isentropic efficiencies and small temperature differentials for the heat transfer processes can give projected round trip efficiencies in the 50-60% range using a common refrigerant. One of the attractive features of this approach is the ability to use different ambient temperatures for storage and generation.

And a novel household refrigerator equipped with the heat storage condensers was setup based on an ordinary double-door three-star compartment refrigerator. The experimental investigation on the characteristics of the novel refrigerator and an ordinary refrigerator was carried out under the ISO standard test conditions. For the novel refrigerator, part of the condensation heat was stored in the shape-stabilized PCM during the on-time and discharged to the environment while the compressor was off. Therefore, the heat dissipation of the novel refrigerator was continuous during a complete cycle (including a successive on-time and off-time period), different from the intermittent heat dissipation of the ordinary setup. Thus, the overall heat-transfer performances of the condensers could be significantly improved, which resulted in a lower condensation temperature, a higher evaporation temperature and a much larger subcooling degree at the condenser outlet. Compared to the ordinary refrigerator, the total cycle time and the ratio of on-time to the total cycle time of the novel refrigerator were much smaller, which led to more frequent starts of the compressor but lower energy consumption. Experiments demonstrated that the novel refrigerator could increase the energy efficiency by about 12% with only little increase of the cost. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy saving; Heat dissipation; Heat storage condenser; Household refrigerator; Shape-stabilized phase change material","Compressors; Condensation; Condensers (liquefiers); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Passive solar buildings; Phase change materials; Refrigerators; Storage (materials); Condensation temperature; Cycle time; Evaporation temperature; Experimental investigations; Household refrigerator; ISO standards; Lower energies; PCM (phase change material); Shape stabilized phase change material; Shape-stabilized; Subcoolings; Heating; condensation; dissipation; energy efficiency; environmental technology; evaporation; experimental study; fuel consumption; heat budget; heat transfer; high temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053438637

Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is a very promising method for energy storage because CAES relies on existing technologies, is less expensive, and easier to site and permit, as compared to pumped hydro storage. But, in the case of CAES employing hard rock caverns or man-made air vessels, although the smallest possible cavern volume is desirable in order to minimize the construction cost and optimize utilization of the given space, the operating pressure range in the cavern must be limited in order to reduce the deterioration in efficiency of the CAES system at off-design conditions. In this paper, a new constant-pressure CAES system combined with pumped hydro storage was studied to address the current problem associated with the conventional CAES systems. An energy and exergy analysis of the novel CAES system was performed in order to understand the operation characteristics of the system according to several different compression and expansion processes; we then examined the effects of the height of the storage cavern and heat transfer between two media (air, water) and the cavern on the performance of the novel CAES system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Compressed air energy storage (CAES); Constant-pressure CAES; Exergy; Pumped hydro storage","Caves; Compressed air; Exergy; Pressure vessels; Air vessel; Compressed air energy storage; Constant-pressure CAES; Construction costs; Energy and exergy analysis; Energy storage systems; Expansion process; Hard rocks; Load leveling; Off design condition; Operating characteristics; Operating pressure; Operation characteristic; Renewable energies; Storage caverns; Energy storage; cavern; compressed air; cost-benefit analysis; exergy; hard rock; heat transfer; optimization; performance assessment; pressure field; pumping; renewable resource; storage; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053436906

Liquefaction of natural gas provides a safer and economical alternative for transportation and also increases its storage capabilities. The liquefaction process requires the natural gas to be cooled using various methods of cryogenic processes and also be depressurized to atmospheric conditions for easier and safer storage. LNG transported in cryogenic vessels offers several advantages over pipeline transport of natural gas especially when the gas consuming areas are far away from the gas producing areas.

In the suggested strategy, a Generation Company (GenCo), who owns both wind and pumped-storage plants, self-schedules the integrated operation of them regarding the uncertainty of wind power generation. For presenting an integrated self-schedule and obtaining a real added value of the strategy, participation of the GenCo in energy and ancillary service markets is modeled. The self-scheduling strategy is based on stochastic programming techniques. Outputs of the problem include generation offers in day-ahead energy market and ancillary service markets, including spinning and regulation reserve markets.

Heat recovery from flue gas (1350-1500 °C) is usually in the form of combustion air pre-heating (900-1200 °C) using a regenerator. Dust from flue gas which is carried over from the furnace gets deposited in the regenerator storage matrix path. This leads to a deterioration of regenerator efficiency. A regenerator model is developed to estimate the actual performance of the regenerator and to compare it with the target performance.

The model is illustrated for a 130 TPD (Ton per Day) furnace regenerator of an industrial glass plant at Mumbai, India. Model results for the regenerator studied indicate a blockage of 50% on the doghouse side and 22% on the non-doghouse side of the regenerator. The actual performance of the regenerator is found to be 7% lower than its target performance for the doghouse side regenerator. The model developed can also be used in other industrial sectors like steel, chemical etc. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air leakage; Blockage; Glass furnace; Performance; Regenerator","Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Glass; Glass furnaces; Glass manufacture; Glass plants; Waste heat; Air leakage; Blockage; Combustion air; Glass furnace regenerators; Glass melting; Glass-manufacturing; Heat transfer characteristics; High temperature; Industrial glass; Industrial sector; Mass and energy balance; matrix; Model results; Mumbai , India; Performance; Performance analysis; Regenerators; energy balance; fossil fuel; glass; high temperature; mass balance; performance assessment; India; Maharashtra; Mumbai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052260698

If the targets to reduce climate change are to be met, substantial reductions in emissions are necessary. Compared to other sectors emission reductions in the power sector are relatively easy to achieve because it consists mainly of point-sources. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and the use of low-carbon alternative energy sources are the two categories of options to reduce CO2 emissions. However, for both options additional infrastructure and equipment is needed. This article compares CO2 emissions and metal requirements of different low-carbon power generation technologies on the basis of Life Cycle Assessment. We analyze the most critical output (CO2) and the most critical input (metals) in the same methodological framework. CO2 emissions and metal requirements are compared with annual global emissions and annual production for different metals. It was found that all technologies are very effective in reducing CO2 emissions. However, CCS and especially non-fossil technologies are substantially more metal intensive than existing power generation. A transition to a low-carbon based power generation would require a substantial upscaling of current mining of several metals. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; LCA; Material requirements; Metals","Climate change; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Metals; Alternative energy source; Annual production; Carbon capture and storage; Critical inputs; Critical output; Emission reduction; Global CO; Global emissions; LCA; Life-cycle assessments; Low-carbon; Material requirements; Metal requirements; Methodological frameworks; Point-sources; Power generation technology; Power sector; Substantial reduction; Upscaling; Carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; energy market; equipment; fossil fuel; infrastructural development; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; metal; performance assessment; point source pollution; power generation; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052101512

At the same time, a reasonable charging price has not been established. This article records the views of station operators and EV users and calculates a charging pricing range. The price should not only ensure the profit of operators, but also help reduce EV users' expenditure compared to using internal-combustion-engine vehicles. Based on current energy prices and battery costs, charging stations are unable to make profit, and the pricing shortfall is up to 0.78 RMB yuan(kWh)-1. Only with a 25% increase in energy price or 25% reduction in battery cost can charging stations become profitable. Several suggestions are proposed to improve station profits. First, ensuring a high station load is helpful to increase profits, and it is estimated the reasonable number of chargers in Beijing is approximately 6000, distributed among 672 stations. Second, the use of storage batteries for on/off-peak electricity self-management can also increase the annual profit by 600,000 RMB yuan.

The systems considered are SOFC-trigeneration, biomass-trigeneration, and solar-trigeneration systems. This study compares the performance of the systems considered when there is only electrical power and the efficiency improvement of these systems when there is trigeneration. Different key output parameters are examined: energy efficiency, net electrical power, electrical to heating and cooling ratios, and (GHG) GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. This study shows that the SOFC-trigeneration system has the highest electrical efficiency among the three systems. Alternatively, when trigeneration is used, the efficiencies of all three systems considered increase considerably. The maximum trigeneration efficiency of the SOFC-trigeneration system is around 76% while it is around 90% for the biomass-trigeneration system. On the other hand, the maximum trigeneration efficiencies of the solar-trigeneration system is around 90% for the solar mode, 45% for storage and storage mode, and 41% for the storage mode. In addition, this study shows that the emissions of CO2 in kg per MWh of electrical power are high for the biomass-trigeneration and SOFC-trigeneration systems.

The ground temperature was recorded for a period of one year, from October 2009 to October 2010. According to the results obtained, in several locations in Cyprus the surface zone reaches a depth of 0.5 m. The shallow zone penetrates to 7-8 m and there after the deep zone follows in which the temperature remains constant throughout the year with a range between 18 and 23 °C. For the eight boreholes, additional geothermal data were also recorded like the type of ground and thermal conductivities of the various geologic layers. The data collected clearly indicate that there is a potential for the efficient use of Ground Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHPs) in Cyprus leading to significant savings in heating and cooling energy consumption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Geothermal; Ground heat exchangers; Ground temperatures; Heat pump efficiency","Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Pumps; Thermal conductivity; Cooling energy consumption; Deep zone; Energy sinks; Energy source; Geologic layers; Geothermal; Ground coupled heat pump; Ground heat exchangers; Ground temperature; Heat pump efficiency; Shallow zones; Surface zones; Geothermal heat pumps; altitude; borehole; cooling; data set; energy resource; energy use; geothermal energy; heat transfer; heating; pump; renewable resource; surface area; thermal conductivity; Cyprus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961173502

In most present methods, time is fixed a priori through a known schedule, which leads to suboptimal results. The method presented in this paper treats time as a variable, thereby leading to improved results. Both direct and indirect heat integration are considered together with optimisation of heat storage size and initial temperature of heat storage medium. The resulting model exhibits MINLP structure, which implies that global optimality cannot generally be guaranteed. However, a procedure is presented that seeks to find a globally optimal solution, even for nonlinear problems. Heat losses from the heat storage vessel during idling are also considered. This work is an extension of MILP model of Majozi (2009), which was more suited to multiproduct rather than multipurpose batch facilities. Optimising the size of the heat storage vessel as well as the initial temperature of the heat storage fluid decreased the requirement for external hot utility for an industrial case study by 33% compared to using known parameters. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy optimisation; Heat integration; Heat storage; Multiproduct; Multipurpose","Industrial applications; Integration; Optimization; Energy usage; Global optimality; Heat integration; Industrial case study; MILP model; Multi-products; Multipurpose; Multipurpose batch plants; Nonlinear problems; Optimal solutions; Optimisations; Storage medium; Storage vessel; Heat storage; decadal variation; experimental design; experimental study; literature review; nonlinearity; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961031255

In order to regulate the direct current bus voltage, the SC storage state was controlled by using a buck-boost converter according to load instructions and wind speed fluctuations. Then, a resonant controller was established to avoid any disturbances and to control the alternating line-to-line voltages of the load which may be unbalanced.

With this purpose in mind, a model of the Chinese energy system has been constructed by using EnergyPLAN based on the year 2007, which has then been used for investigating three issues. Firstly, the accuracy of the model itself has been examined and then the maximum feasible wind power penetration in the existing energy system has been identified. Finally, barriers have been discussed and suggestions proposed for the Chinese energy system to integrate large-scale renewable energy in the future. It is concluded that the model constructed by the use of EnergyPLAN can accurately simulate the Chinese energy system. Based on current regulations to secure grid stability, the maximum feasible wind power penetration in the existing Chinese energy system is approximately 26% from both technical and economic points of view. A fuel efficiency decrease occurred when increasing wind power penetration in the system, due to its rigid power supply structure and the task of securing grid stability, was left primarily to large coal-fired power plants. There are at least three possible solutions for the Chinese energy system to integrate large-scale fluctuating renewable energy in the long term: Redesigning the regulations to secure grid stability by means of diversifying the participants, such as including hydropower and CHP plants; integrating large-scale heat pumps combined with heat storage devices to satisfy district heat demands and developing electric vehicles to promote off peak electricity utilisation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Energy system analysis; Modelling; Renewable energy; Wind power","Coal; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuel power plants; Heat storage; Systems analysis; Virtual storage; Wind power; China; CHP plant; Coal-fired power plant; Energy system analysis; Energy systems; Existing energies; Fuel efficiency; Grid stability; Heat demands; Heat pumps; Modelling; On currents; Peak electricity; Possible solutions; Power supply; Renewable energies; Wind power penetration; System stability; coal-fired power plant; economic analysis; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy planning; numerical model; pump; renewable resource; systems analysis; wind power; China; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961024693

We develop a co-optimized Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) dispatch model to characterize the value of providing operating reserves in addition to energy arbitrage in several U.S. markets. We use the model to: (1) quantify the added value of providing operating reserves in addition to energy arbitrage; (2) evaluate the dynamic nature of optimally allocating storage resources into energy and reserve markets; and (3) quantify the sensitivity of CAES net revenues to several design and performance parameters. We find that conventional CAES systems could earn an additional $23 ± 10/kW-yr by providing operating reserves, and adiabatic CAES systems could earn an additional $28 ± 13/kW-yr. We find that arbitrage-only revenues are unlikely to support a CAES investment in most market locations, but the addition of reserve revenues could support a conventional CAES investment in several markets. Adiabatic CAES revenues are not likely to support an investment in most regions studied. Modifying CAES design and performance parameters primarily impacts arbitrage revenues, and optimizing CAES design will be nearly independent of dispatch strategy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Arbitrage; CAES; Energy storage; Investment decisions; Operating reserves","Cold storage; Commerce; Compressed air; Design; Economics; Energy storage; Flywheels; Optimization; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Virtual storage; Added values; Arbitrage; CAES; Compressed air energy storage; Dispatch strategy; Dynamic nature; Grid services; Investment decisions; Net revenue; Operating reserve; Performance parameters; Reserve markets; Storage resources; Investments; adiabatic process; compressed air; decision making; energy market; gas storage; investment; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; renewable resource; resource allocation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961022673

Only losses stemming from irreversibility are considered - heat losses to the surroundings are not included in the analysis. A number of simplifying assumptions have been adopted, but the results nonetheless clearly demonstrate the dependence of the losses on operating temperatures, reservoir geometry and mode of operation, and point the way towards methods of optimisation.

High energy density and high power capacity are desirable properties of the storage. The use of latent heat increases the energy density of the storage tank with high temperature control close to the melting point. Tube in PCM tank is a very promising system that provides high packing factor. This work presents an experimental study of a PCM tank for cold storage applications. Two different configurations and different flow rates of the heat transfer fluid were studied. The effectiveness of the PCM storage system was defined as that of a heat exchanger. The results showed that the heat exchange effectiveness of the system did not vary with time, decreased with increasing flow rate and increased with increasing heat transfer area. The effectiveness was experimentally determined to only be a function of the ratio ṁ/. A. This equation was found to be adequately be used to design a PCM storage system, and a case study is presented. It was shown that the tube in tank design together with a low temperature PCM is suitable as a thermal storage facility for cold storage. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Coil in tank; Cold storage tank; Heat transfer; PCM","Cold storage; Flow rate; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Refrigerators; A-thermal; Coil in tank; Energy density; Experimental studies; Heat exchange; Heat transfer area; Heat transfer fluids; High energy densities; High power capacity; Industrial processs; Low temperatures; Packing factor; Storage systems; Storage tank; Tank design; Thermal energy storage systems; Tanks (containers); design; experimental study; heat transfer; high temperature; low temperature; optimization; storage tank; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959854860

So, in the phase change thermal energy storage (PCTES) unit which is connected to solar collector, the phase change process occurs under the non-steady-state inlet boundary condition. In present paper, regarding the non-steady-state boundary, based on enthalpy method, a two dimensional physical and mathematical model for a shell-and-tube PCTES unit was established and the simulation code was self-developed. The effects of the non-steady-state inlet condition of HTF on the thermal performance of the PCTES unit were numerically analyzed. The results show that when the average HTF inlet temperature in an hour is fixed at a constant value, the melting time (time required for PCM completely melting) decreases with the increase of initial inlet temperature. When the initial inlet temperature increases from 30°C to 90°C, the melting time will decrease from 42.75min to 20.58min. However, the total TES capacity in an hour reduces from 338.9kJ/kg to 211.5kJ/kg. When the average inlet mass flow rate in an hour is fixed at a constant value, with the initial HTF inlet mass flow rate increasing, the melting time of PCM decreases. The initial inlet mass flow rate increasing from 2.0×10-4kg/s to 8.0×10-4kg/s will lead to the melting time decreasing from 37.42min to 23.75min and the TES capacity of PCM increasing from 265.8kJ/kg to 273.8kJ/kg. Under all the studied cases, the heat flux on the tube surface increases at first, until it reaches a maximum then it decreases over time. And the larger the initial inlet temperature or mass flow rate, the earlier the maximum value appearance and the larger the maximum value. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Enthalpy method; Non-steady-state boundary; Phase change thermal energy storage","Computer simulation; Enthalpy; Flow rate; Flywheels; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Melting; Phase change materials; Pipe flow; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Sun; Thermal energy; Wakes; Enthalpy method; Inlet boundary; Inlet conditions; Inlet temperature; Mass flow rate; Maximum values; Melting time; Non-steady-state boundary; Numerical studies; Outlet temperature; Phase Change; Phase change process; Shell-and-tube; Simulation code; Solar radiation intensity; TES capacity; Thermal Performance; Inlet flow; enthalpy; heat flux; heat transfer; high temperature; melting; numerical model; performance assessment; phase transition; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; steady-state equilibrium; storage; thermal power; two-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959851368

Each one attempts to reduce losses coming from two respective sources. The systems are simulated and compared to a reference STPP.They consists on: (a) a double thermal energy storage (DTS) with different functionalities for each storage and (b) the subdivision of the solar collector field (SSF) into specialised sectors, so that each sector is designed to meet a thermal requirement, usually through an intermediate heat exchanger. This subdivision reduces the losses in the solar field by means of a decrease of the temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Double thermal energy storage is intended for keeping the plant working at nominal level for many hours a day, including post-sunset hours. One of the storages gathers a fluid which is heated up to temperatures above the nominal one. In order to make it work, the solar field must be able to overheat the fluid at peak hours. The second storage is the classical one. The combination of both allows the manager of the plant to keep the nominal of the plant for longer periods than in the case of classical thermal energy storage.To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that both configurations are presented and simulated for the case of parabolic through STPP with HTF technology. The results show that, if compared to the reference STPP, both configurations may raise the annual electricity generation (up to 1.7% for the DTS case and 3.9% for the SSF case). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy management; Solar field layout; Solar thermal power plant; Thermal storage","Electric generators; Energy management; Fluids; Flywheels; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Power plants; Solar concentrators; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric power plants; A-thermal; Electricity generation; Heat transfer fluids; Intermediate heat exchanger; Solar field layout; Solar fields; Solar thermal power plants; Thermal storage; Thermal storage system; Solar energy; electricity generation; energy planning; heat transfer; power plant; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; storage; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959834996

At the moment, in the UK, only a few CHP plants have thermal stores. Previous research has shown that thermal stores can improve the economics of CHP plants in the UK under the current market conditions. However, currently, it is only beneficial for CHP plants to sell their electricity to a third party, a Licensed Electricity Supplier, rather than to sell it directly to the power exchange market at prices which are much higher. If CHP plants aggregate, direct access to the power exchange market can become economically viable hence there is the possibility that thermal stores could further improve the economics of CHP plants under an aggregated electricity dispatch. This work firstly explains the conditions under which such plants could aggregate and act as a large power plant in the UK market, and secondly explores the most economic-size of gas engine and thermal store, in the case of aggregation, using energyPRO software and Excel spreadsheets. The work suggests that direct access to the power exchange market can improve the economics of the CHP plants. The highest Net Present Value (NPV), without heat dissipation, for a CHP plant exporting its electricity to the grid for a community heating load of 20GWh, is more than £5m, and is obtained for a 6MW engine with a 28.2MWh (900m3) thermal store. The research suggests that such high electricity prices could make even larger plants more profitable than that; however, this can happen only if some of the produced heat is dissipated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CHP aggregation; Cogeneration; EnergyPRO; Thermal store","Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Economics; Electric utilities; Electricity; Gas engines; Heating; Profitability; Spreadsheets; CHP aggregation; CHP plant; Cogeneration; Combined heat and power plants; Direct access; Electricity market; Electricity prices; EnergyPRO; Excel spreadsheets; Heating load; Large power; Market condition; Net present value; Plant size; Power-exchange market; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy; Thermal store; Third parties; Gas plants; combined heat and power; economic analysis; electrical power; energy dissipation; energy market; energy resource; exploration; market conditions; power plant; profitability; renewable resource; software; storage; sustainability; thermal power; United Kingdom; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959827790

These heat pumps have their evaporators connected to one effluents source and two of them are equipped by storage tanks at the condenser side. Multi-objective optimization permits optimal repartition of mass flow rates of effluents and optimal choice of electrical power of the compressors and volumes of storage tanks. The thermodynamic objective is based on the exergy destruction in the whole system. The economic objective is based on the investment cost and the operating cost obtained with the heat pump system. The environmental impact objective has been defined and expressed in cost terms by considering a CO2 taxation (carbon tax) on the GHG emissions. This objective has been integrated with the economic objective.

An apparent obstacle for considering the use of aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an energy storage compound is the corrosive nature of the nominally required 50wt.% maximum concentration. Here we propose storage of concentrated hydrogen peroxide in a high weight percent solid slurry, namely the equilibrium system of CaO2·2H2O2(s)/H2O2(aq), that mitigates much of the risk associated with the storage of such high concentrations. We have prepared and studied surrogate slurries of calcium hydroxide/water that are assumed to resemble the peroxo compound slurries. These slurries have the consistency of a paste rather than a distinct two-phase (liquid plus solid) system. This paste-like property of the prepared surrogates enable them to be contained within a 200lines-per-inch. (LPI) nickel mesh screen (33.6% open area) with no solids leakage, and only liquid transport driven by an adsorbent material is placed in physical contact on the exterior of the screen. This hydrogen peroxide slurry approach suggests a convenient and safe mechanism of storing hydrogen peroxide for use in, say, vehicle applications. This is because fuel cell design requires only aqueous hydrogen peroxide use, that can be achieved using the separation approach utilizing the screen material here.

Yet the construction of large pipeline infrastructures usually constitutes a major and time-consuming undertaking, because of safety and environmental issues, legal and (geo)political siting arguments, technically un-trivial installation processes, and/or high investment cost requirements. In this article we focus on the latter and present an overview of both the total costs and cost components of the distribution of these three gases via pipelines. Possible intricacies and external factors that strongly influence these costs, like the choice of location and terrain, are also included in our analysis. Our distribution cost breakdown estimates are based on transportation data for CH4, which we adjust for CO2 and H2 in order to account for the specific additional characteristics of these two gases. The overall trend is that pipeline construction is no longer subject to significant cost reductions. For the purpose of designing energy and climate policy we therefore know in principle with reasonable certainty what the minimum distribution cost components of future energy systems are that rely on pipelining these gases. We describe the reasons why we observe limited learning-by-doing and explain why negligible construction cost reductions for future CH4, CO2 and H2 pipeline projects can be expected. Cost data of individual pipeline projects may strongly deviate from the global average because of national or regional effects related to the type of terrain, but also to varying costs of labor and fluctuating market prices of components like steel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Climate control; Hydrogen; Learning curves; Natural gas; Pipeline costs","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate control; Cost reduction; Economics; Electric generators; Energy resources; Environmental regulations; Gases; Investments; Landforms; Pipelines; Taxicabs; Automotive transportation; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Construction costs; Cost components; Cost data; Distribution costs; Electricity generation; Energy carriers; Energy systems; Environmental issues; External factors; Fossil energy resources; Investment costs; Learning curves; Learning-by-doing; Market price; Pipeline construction; Pipeline infrastructure; Pipeline projects; Regional effects; Sustainable energy systems; Total costs; Cost benefit analysis; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy policy; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; hydrogen; installation; investment; labor market; methane; mitigation; natural gas; pipeline; policy development; price dynamics; steel; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959818293

The state of the art of physical modelling and numerical simulation of CO2 dispersion is briefly reviewed in this paper, which calls for more accurate and more efficient modelling approaches. A systematic evaluation of the numerical methods used and a comparison between the streamline based methods and the grid based methods would be valuable.

Heat is often produced by CHP (combined heat and power) plants, usually designed to provide the base thermal load (40-50% of the maximum load) while the rest is provided by boilers. The use of storage tanks would permit to increase the annual operating hours of CHP: heat can be produced when the request is low (for instance during the night), stored and then used when the request is high. The use of boilers results partially reduced and the thermal load diagram is flattered. Depending on the type of CHP plant this may also affect the electricity generation. All these considerations are crucial in the free electricity market.In this paper, a multi-scale model of storage tanks is proposed. This model is particularly suitable to analyze the operation of storage systems during the heating season and to predict their effects on the primary energy consumption and cash flows. The analysis is conducted considering the Turin district heating system as case study.

The heated water from the storage tank of the solar heating system is circulated in a finned tube air heater. Hot air from the air heater is blown through a packing of a honeycomb type for the purpose of regeneration of calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution. An experimental system has been designed and installed for this purpose. The system comprises a solar water heater with a storage tank connected to an air/water heat exchanger. Hot air from the heat exchanger is blown to the air humidifier, which functions in this study as a regenerator. Calcium chloride solution is applied as the working desiccant in this study. Solution concentration is determined at the end of regeneration process and the mass of evaporated water is evaluated. It is observed that the heating temperature varies, at day time, in a range of about 5 °C. This limited variation in hot water temperature demonstrates the importance of the storage tank to attain a nearly steady state operation of the system. Experimental results show that solution with 30% concentration can be regenerated up to 50% using solar energy. In the theoretical part of this study, a multiple-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model has been applied to study the performance of a solar liquid-desiccant dehumidification/regeneration system when calcium chloride solution is applied as the working desiccant. The experimental results of the present study are used to construct and test the ANN model. Then the model has been utilized to describe and analyze the effect of the inlet conditions of air on the regeneration process. Good agreement between the outputs from the ANN model and the corresponding results from the experimental data has been found.

The potential sources of electricity in microgrids are wind farms, solar energy, biomass, tidal energy, among others. However, microgrids that are connected to the national grid are gaining importance, because they can supply electricity to the national grid when they have an excess and buy from it when they are in shortage. Such a symbiotic relationship with the national grid helps reduce investment in storage capacity and minimizes other operational costs. In this work, we develop a mathematical model MILP - (mixed integer linear programming) for scheduling operations in microgrids connected to the national grid. We allow several realistic features such as time constraints for the purchase/sale of power from/to the national grid; round trip efficiency of batteries; hydrogen generation, and limits on storage and retrieval rates from batteries/hydrogen tanks/natural gas tanks.

Hydrogen storage and production methods are being investigated for stationary and portable applications. Up to now, a significant part of H2 production on demand was thought to be fulfilled by using chemical hydrides, but recent studies have proved the limitations of this approach. Conversely, H2 production based in the corrosion of light metals in water solutions is an interesting alternative. Among all of them, Al is probably the most adequate metal for energetic purposes due to its high electron density and oxidation potential. But concerning H2 production from Al corrosion in water, a major issue remains unsolved: metal passivation due to the formation of Al(OH)3 inhibits H2 evolution. In this work we show the last results obtained for the generation of H2 from water using Al powder using diverse alkaline solutions. It is confirmed that corrosion is not affected solely by the solution pH but also by the nature of the ionic species found in the aqueous medium. Moreover, we describe the AlHidrox process, which minimizes Al passivation under mild conditions by the addition of different inorganic salts as corrosion promoters, allowing 100% yields and flow rates up to 2.9 L/min per gram of Al. The feasibility of the process has been regarded in terms of stability (by conducting several successive runs) and self-initiation without an external heating. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","AlHidrox process; Aluminum corrosion; Hydrogen generation; Inorganic salts; Oxometallate solutions","Alkalinity; Aluminum; Aluminum corrosion; Fuels; Hydrogen storage; Passivation; Production; Salts; Al powder; AlHidrox process; Alkaline solutions; Alternative process; Aqueous alkaline solutions; Aqueous medium; Chemical hydride; Clean fuel; Current energy; External heating; High-electron-density; Hydrogen generation; Hydrogen generations; Inorganic salts; Ionic species; Oxidation potentials; Oxometallate solutions; Portable applications; Production methods; Solution pH; Water solutions; Hydrogen production; alkalinity; aluminum; aqueous solution; corrosion; economic analysis; electron; energy efficiency; feasibility study; heating; hydration; hydrogen; inhibition; inorganic compound; inorganic salt; oxidation; pH",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955675764

A 3D Cartesian coordinates radiative heat transfer procedure based on coupling of the FTn finite volume method (FTnFVM) with the bounded high-order resolution CLAM scheme is developed. The narrow-band based weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (NB-WSGG) model is applied to take account of nongray effects by CO2, H2O and soot. To treat irregular boundaries, the present model used the blocked-off-region procedure. This radiation code is implemented in the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-based fire model, where a the combustion is represented by means of the mixture fraction with a single step chemical reaction model and the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to model the dissipative processes. Computational results with and without radiation effects are compared against available experimental data and quasi-steady state law correlations of in-rack storage fire, which consists a complex configuration of double tri-wall corrugated paper cartons placed onto a wood pallet. Sensibility analyses of spatial and angular grids demonstrate the improvements due to the FTnFVM and to the CLAM scheme in the configuration studied. Results show that the simulations of the flame height, the gas temperature and the gas velocity are strongly influenced by thermal radiation. Overall, simulations predicted closer profiles to the experimental results only when the nongray-sooting radiation model was incorporated and an over-prediction of the gas temperature and the flame height is found when radiation is neglected. A sensibility analysis has shown that the flame characteristics are strongly affected by the soot yield. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CLAM scheme; FDS; FTn finite volume method; In-rack storage fire; NB-WSGG spectral model; Nongray-sooting radiation","Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Finite volume method; Fires; Heat radiation; Radiative transfer; Shellfish; Soot; CLAM scheme; FDS; FTn finite volume method; In-rack storage fire; Nongray-sooting radiation; Spectral models; Radiation effects; carbon dioxide; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; coordinate; energy dissipation; experimental study; finite volume method; heat transfer; large eddy simulation; numerical model; performance assessment; radiative transfer; soot; storage; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955667138

With this target predominantly fulfilled with wind generated electricity, the need for increased grid flexibility to facilitate this intermittent energy source is becoming ever more significant. As smart metering becomes available, demand side participation will be one option for achieving this flexibility. Using an immersion heated hot water tank as an example, this paper examines the impact that price optimised load scheduling has on the facilitation of wind generated electricity. To replicate real-world data availability, optimisation is performed using day-ahead predicted prices while the results are calculated using final prices and metered generation data. The results demonstrate a correlation between the day-ahead predicted half-hourly price of electricity and real-time wind availability. This supports the use of price as a means of providing an incentive for load response in order to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be facilitated on the electrical grid. Furthermore, various thermal storage efficiencies were examined for the device to reveal that as the energy loss rate of the device is reduced, the financial savings increase, wind generation increases, and conventional generation decreases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand side management; Real-time pricing; Wind energy","Costs; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Water tanks; Wind power; Appliance controls; Conventional generation; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Electrical grids; Electricity market; Energy-loss rate; Financial savings; Hot water tanks; Hourly prices; Intermittent energy source; Ireland; Load response; Load scheduling; Optimisations; Price-based; Real time pricing; Real world data; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart metering; Thermal storage; Wind energy; Wind generation; Electric generators; data assimilation; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy resource; optimization; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955656217

As an innovation-oriented island country with scarce natural resources, Taiwan announced the Sustainable Energy Policy Principles in 2008 that stated that Taiwan's renewable energy policy should accomplish the 3E goals. Several studies point out that specific renewable energy policy goals lead to specific renewable energy sources and technologies because each type of renewable energy has different features. In order to achieve the renewable energy policy goals, this research aims to examine how different policy goals lead to corresponding renewable energy sources. The relative importance of each goal is evaluated by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weight of each policy goal is adjusted separately to construct policy scenarios by the sensitivity analysis.

Optimality aims at improving sustainability through the minimization of carbon emissions and at reducing production costs and maximizing quality. Input data are the forecasted loads and productions from renewable generation units, output data are a set of control actions for the actuators. The considered electrical distribution system includes storage units that must be considered over a 24 h time interval, to consider an entire charge and discharge cycle. The objectives for the optimal management of distributed (renewables and not) generation are technical, economical and environmental. It is thus required to solve a multi-objective optimization problem over a 24 h time interval considering the uncertainty associated to weather conditions and loads profiles. The novelty of the proposed approach resides in considering the optimal scheduling of generation units an automatic planning process in a dynamic, non-deterministic and not fully observable environment, as it is, getting closer to actual conditions. The system proposed here is a planning and execution scheduler which allows the central controller to monitor the execution of a scheduling plan, interrupt the monitoring to input new information and repair the plan under execution every time interval. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed energy resources management; Microgrids; Multi-objective evolutionary optimization","Electric power distribution; Energy management; Energy resources; Production; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Automatic planning; Carbon emissions; Charge and discharge; Control actions; Distributed Energy Resources; Electrical distribution; Electrical distribution system; Generation units; Input datas; Micro grid; Microgrids; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimization problem; New approaches; Optimal management; Optimal scheduling; Optimality; Output data; Planning and execution; Production cost; Re-planning; Renewable generation; Renewables; Storage units; Time interval; Weather conditions; Multiobjective optimization; carbon emission; data set; energy planning; energy resource; monitoring system; multiobjective programming; optimization; planning method; production cost; renewable resource; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955653368

This work presents BESS controller which is designed for regulating the state of charge of the batteries and also to manage the active power in a distributed power system network. The off peak load energy is used to recover the batteries' state of charge through the BESS controller. In this BESS controller, the constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) mode is used and it helps to keep the batteries' state of charge conditions for improving the reliability of the distributed power system system. This control strategy is incorporated into the main converter. The controller helps in managing the phase, amplitude and waveform of the current and voltage on the distributed power system network.

Two types of cold energy storage system namely: ice storage system and cold water storage system are explained and sized for datacenter with heat output capacity of 8800 kW. Basically, the cold energy storage will help to reduce the chiller running time that will save electricity related cost and decrease greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the electricity generation from non-renewable sources. The proposed cold energy storage system can be retrofit or connected in the existing datacenter facilities without major design changes. Out of the two proposed systems, ice based cold energy storage system is mainly recommended for datacenters which are located in very cold locations and therefore can offer long term seasonal storage of cold energy within reasonable cost. One of the potential application domains for ice based cold energy storage system using heat pipes is the emergency backup system for datacenter. Water based cold energy storage system provides more compact size with short term storage (hours to days) and is potential for datacenters located in areas with yearly average temperature below the permissible cooling water temperature (∼25 °C). The aforesaid cold energy storage systems were sized on the basis of metrological conditions in Poughkeepsie, New York. As an outcome of the thermal and cost analysis, water based cold energy storage system with cooling capability to handle 60% of datacenter yearly heat load will provide an optimum system size with minimum payback period of 3.5 years. Water based cold energy storage system using heat pipes can be essentially used as precooler for chiller.

In contrast, a greater material input, leading to increased energy consumptions and emissions during the production phase, is required to build offshore wind farms. These contrary effects are investigated for the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus in the North Sea. In a life cycle assessment its environmental influence is compared to that of Germany's electricity mix.In comparison to the mix, alpha ventus had better indicators in nearly every investigated impact category. One kilowatt-hour electricity, generated by the wind farm, was burdened with 0.137 kWh Primary Energy-Equivalent and 32 g CO2-Equivalent, which represented only a small proportion of the accordant values for the mix. Furthermore, the offshore foundations as well as the submarine cable were the main energy intensive components. The energetic and greenhouse gas payback period was less than one year.Therefore, offshore wind power, even in deep water, is compatible with the switch to sustainable electricity production relying on renewable energies.

The suitability of 1400 high-rise public housing blocks in Hong Kong for rooftop greening was assessed by remote sensing images. Weather and microclimatic-soil monitoring data of an experimental green roof provided the basis for computations. Roof greening prevented a huge amount of solar energy at 43.9 TJ in one summer from penetrating the buildings to bring significant energy saving. Thermal performance of humid-tropical green roofs, with greater latent heat dissipation, is twice more effective than the temperate ones. The energy balance model shows that solar energy absorption by bare and green roofs depends on shortwave rather than longwave radiation. Heat flux into a building indicates a one-day time lag after a sunshine day. With restricted evapotranspiration, bare roofs have more sensible heat and heat storage than green roofs. The bare roof albedo of 0.15, comparing with 0.30 of green roof, renders 75% higher heat storage. Small increase in convection coefficient from 12 to 16 could amplify 24% and 45% of latent heat dissipation respectively for bare and green roofs.

A computer model is developed which simulates the operation of several energy storage systems when used with the 190-MW Portland Wind Farm (PWF) located in Portland, Victoria, Australia. A variety of operating strategies are compared with the results of a dynamic programming model which finds the maximum possible revenue which a given system can generate for a set of input conditions. Three energy storage systems are modelled and costed: Pumped Seawater Hydro Storage (PSHS), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), and Thermal Energy Storage (TES). It is found that CAES is the most profitable storage medium, requiring a capital expenditure of A$140. M and generating a rate of return (ROR) of 15.4%. The ROR for PSHS was 9.6%, and for TES was 8.0%. Therefore, a significant investment opportunity exists for the installation of an energy storage system in this wind farm. It is therefore highly recommended that CAES is investigated further with the aim of introducing large-scale energy storage to PWF and other similar wind turbine installations. © 2010.","Economic feasibility; Energy storage; Spot price analysis; Wind power","Cold storage; Compressed air; Dynamic programming; Earnings; Economic analysis; Electric utilities; Farms; Flywheels; Heat storage; Installation; Profitability; Seawater; Wind power; Capital expenditures; Compressed air energy storage; Computer models; Dynamic programming model; Economic advantages; Economic feasibilities; Electricity grids; Energy storage systems; Operating strategy; Optimisations; Rate of return; Spot price; Storage medium; Theoretical study; Turbine installation; Victoria , Australia; Wind farm; Investments; capital market; compressed air; computer; cost-benefit analysis; energy resource; installation; investment location; numerical model; optimization; power generation; seawater; theoretical study; wind farm; wind power; wind turbine; Australia; Portland [Victoria]; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953037628

This paper analyzes a 2D time-dependent single-phase isothermal model for the operation of a single cell in a VRB. Unlike in all previous work, asymptotic methods are used to determine the characteristic current density scale in terms of operating conditions and cell component properties. Also, the analysis reveals that the fluid mechanics decouples from the electrochemistry, at leading order; an asymptotically reduced model is then proposed which preserves the original geometrical resolution. This approach is recommended for accurate and computationally efficient VRB stack models, as has been achieved for polymer electrolyte fuel cells; this will be a prerequisite for the use of modelling in stack design and thence large-scale commercialization of the VRB. Finite-element methods are used to compute results for the 1D steady state high-stoichiometry limit; although an idealized case, it is recommended for the in-situ experimental acquisition of VRB electrokinetic data that can then be used for the model when applied under more general operating conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Analysis; Flow cells; Vanadium redox battery","Contacts (fluid mechanics); Fluid mechanics; Fuel cells; Stoichiometry; Vanadium; Vanadium alloys; Analysis; Asymptotic method; Component properties; Computationally efficient; Electrokinetic; Flow cells; Geometrical resolution; In-situ; Isothermal models; Leading orders; Operating condition; Polymer electrolyte fuel cells; Reduced model; Single cells; Stack model; Steady state; Storage technology; System complexity; Time-dependent; Vanadium redox batteries; Vanadium redox battery; Volume ratio; Finite element method; commercialization; computer simulation; electrochemistry; finite element method; geometry; isotherm; numerical model; optimization; redox potential; resolution; stochasticity; two-dimensional modeling; volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952819125

The PV system generates electricity that either may be consumed by the building or may be fed-in the electricity grid. The electricity grid is used as electricity storage. Three residential buildings are investigated. The first residential building has PVs that yearly produce smaller amount of electricity than the heating system requires. This is a negative-net energy building (NNEB). The second building has the PVs that produce the exact amount of electricity that the entire building annually needs. This is a zero-net energy building (ZNEB). The third building has PVs that entirely cover the south-facing roof of the building. This is a positive-net energy building (PNEB). These buildings are presented by a mathematical model, partially in an EnergyPlus environment. For all buildings, simulations by using EnergyPlus software would give the generated, consumed, and purchased energy with time step, and monthly and yearly values. For sure, these buildings would decrease demand for electricity during summer, however they will increase this demand during winter when there is no sun and start of space heating is required. Depending on the size of PV array this building will be either NNEB, or ZNEB, or PNEB. However it is crucial for such a building to be connected to the electricity grid. The smaller payback for investment in the PV array is obtained for buildings with larger size of PV array. The feed-in tariff for the generation of electricity in Serbia should be under the constant watch to be corrected accordingly for larger penetration of this technology in the Serbian market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy consumption; Heat pump; Photovoltaic system; PNEB; ZNEB","Apartment houses; Domestic appliances; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electricity; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Mathematical models; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pumps; Space heating; Energy consumption; Heat pumps; Photovoltaic system; PNEB; ZNEB; Buildings; building; electricity generation; energy balance; energy use; heat transfer; photovoltaic system; pump; seasonality; software; solar power; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952450047

Treating wind power as non-dispatchable by subtracting its output from the original load profile, results in a net load profile, which must be covered by conventional power generation. The screening curve methodology is a first approximation to find the optimal generation technology mix, based on relative cost levels. However, increased variability of the net load profile, due to wind power generation, strongly influences system operation. Therefore a static linear programming investment model is developed to determine the optimal technology mix. This alternative methodology shows a reduced capacity of inflexible generation after including operational constraints to properly account for net load variability. In order to illustrate this methodology, an example is set up, showing the sensitivity with respect to ramp rates of conventional generation, transmission interconnection and energy storage. The comparison of those different sources of system flexibility suggests that energy storage facilities better facilitate the integration of wind power generation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Screening curve; Technology mix; Variability; Wind power; Wind power curtailment","Electric generators; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Flywheels; Investments; Linear programming; Optimization; Technology; Conventional generation; Conventional power; Electricity generation; Investment models; Load profiles; Operational constraints; Optimal generation; Optimal technology; Ramp rates; Renewable energy source; Storage facilities; System flexibility; System operation; Transmission interconnections; Variability; Wind power penetration; Wind power; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; investment; optimization; renewable resource; technological development; theoretical study; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951518184

This presents particular issues in investigating electricity generation, capacity and storage, whilst retaining broader trade-offs sectors, technology pathways and timing of investments. This paper reports on a methodology for temporal disaggregation in the widely applied energy service driven, technology rich, cost optimizing, linear programming MARKAL energy system model. A flexible time slicing feature is developed to enhance representation of diurnal and seasonal electricity demand curves through disaggregation of resource availability and energy service demands. In a first application of a temporal UK MARKAL model, a range of runs investigate the role of electricity storage at supply and demand sides. The results display considerably enhanced insights, notably on the role and preference of demand-side electricity storage over supply-side storage. On average, the system chooses about 7-10% of electricity demand as storage. On the supply side, hydrogen-based electricity storage is greatly preferred but stored-hydrogen is used in the transport sector rather than for power system balancing mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity storage; Energy system model; Load curve; MARKAL flexible timeslice","Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electricity; Hydrogen; Investments; Linear programming; Optimization; Balancing mechanisms; Demand-side; Disaggregation; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Energy services; Energy system model; Energy systems; Load curves; MARKAL flexible timeslice; Power systems; Resource availability; Supply and demand; Time horizons; Time slicing; Transport sectors; Hydrogen storage; demand analysis; electricity generation; linear programing; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951514631

Time lag decrement factor (f) and phase transition keeping time (ψ) of inner surface were applied to analyze the effects of PCM thermo-physical properties, inner surface convective heat transfer coefficient and thickness of SSPCM wallboard. The results showed that for SSPCM, there exist two flat segments within one wave length period of inner surface heat flux lines and it has larger time lag and lower decrement factor than those three ordinary building materials. It was found that melting temperature and thermal conductivity of SSPCM have little effects on , f and ψ, which is different from the case of temperature waves; for a certain outside heat flux wave, there exist critical values of latent heat of fusion and thickness of SSPCM above which the heat flux wave amplitude can be diminished to zero; inner surface convective heat transfer coefficient is one important factor which significantly influences the decrement factor; and the phase transition zone leads to small fluctuations of the original flat segments of inner surface heat flux line. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Decrement factor; Energy storage; Phase transition keeping time; Shape-stabilized phase change material; Thermal performance; Time lag","Building materials; Construction equipment; Energy storage; Flywheels; Heat flux; Heat transfer coefficients; Mixed convection; Passive solar buildings; Phase transitions; Polystyrenes; Surfaces; Walls (structural partitions); Control volumes; Convective heat transfer Coefficient; Critical value; Decrement factor; Enthalpy equation; Expanded polystyrene; Finite-difference scheme; Foam concretes; Inner surfaces; Latent heat of fusion; Melting temperatures; Numerical simulation; Outer surface; Shape-stabilized phase change material; Sinusoidal heat fluxes; Small fluctuation; Temperature wave; Thermal performance; Thermo-physical property; Time lag; Traditional buildings; Wave amplitudes; Phase change materials; concrete; heat flux; heat transfer; melting; performance assessment; temperature effect; volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951513591

Although thermal ratcheting poses a serious impediment to thermocline operation, this failure mode in dual-medium thermocline tanks is not yet well understood. To study the potential for the occurrence of ratcheting, a comprehensive model of a thermocline tank that includes both the heterogeneous filler region as well as the composite tank wall is formulated. The filler region consists of a rock bed with interstitial molten salt, while the tank wall is composed of a steel shell with two layers of insulation (firebrick and ceramic). The model accounts separately for the rock and molten-salt regions in view of their different thermal properties. Various heat loss conditions are applied at the external tank surface to evaluate the effect of energy losses to the surroundings. Hoop stresses, which are governed by the magnitude of temperature fluctuations, are determined through both a detailed finite-element analysis and simple strain relations. The two methods are found to yield almost identical results. Temperature fluctuations are damped by heat losses to the surroundings, leading to a reduction in hoop stresses with increased heat losses. Failure is prevented when the peak hoop stress is less than the material yield strength of the steel shell. To avoid ratcheting without incurring excessive energy loss, insulation between the steel shell and the filler region should be maximized. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Molten-salt thermocline; Solar thermal energy; Thermal energy storage; Thermal ratcheting","Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Fillers; Finite element method; Flywheels; Fused salts; Heat losses; Heat storage; Residual stresses; Solar heating; Storage (materials); Stream flow; Tanks (containers); Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Composite tank; Comprehensive model; Critical phenomenon; Cyclic operation; Energy loss; Excessive energy; External tanks; Finite element analysis; Hoop stress; Material yield; Molten salt; Molten-salt thermocline; Solar energy applications; Solar thermal energy; Steel shells; Tank walls; Temperature fluctuation; Thermal properties; Thermal ratcheting; Two layers; Solar energy; composite; finite element method; insulation; salt; solar power; thermal power; thermocline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951512615

It presents an economically attractive solution for the continuously increasing energy demand of the Marmara region located in Turkey. However, the stochastic behavior of wind speed in the Marmara region can lead to significant disharmony between wind energy production and electricity demand. Therefore, to overcome wind's variable nature, a more reliable solution would be to integrate hydropower with wind energy. In this study, a methodology to estimate an optimal wind-hydro solution is developed and it is subsequently applied to six typical different site cases in the Marmara region in order to define the most beneficial configuration of the wind-hydro system.

This process involves three basic stages: capture and compression of CO2 from power stations, transport of CO2, and storage away from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. Potential routes for the capture, transport and storage of CO2 from United Kingdom (UK) power plants are examined. Six indicative options are evaluated, based on 'Pulverised Coal', 'Natural Gas Combined Cycle', and 'Integrated (coal) Gasification Combined Cycle' power stations. Chemical and physical CO2 absorption capture techniques are employed with realistic transport possibilities to 'Enhanced Oil Recovery' sites or depleted gas fields in the North Sea. The selected options are quantitatively assessed against well-established economic and energy-related criteria. Results show that CO2 capture can reduce emissions by over 90%. However, this will reduce the efficiency of the power plants concerned, incurring energy penalties between 14 and 30% compared to reference plants without capture. Costs of capture, transport and storage are concatenated to show that the whole CCS chain 'cost of electricity' (COE) rises by 27-142% depending on the option adopted. This is a significant cost increase, although calculations show that the average 'cost of CO2 captured' is £15/tCO2 in 2005 prices [the current base year for official UK producer price indices]. If potential governmental carbon penalties were introduced at this level, then the COE would equate to the same as the reference plant, and make CCS a viable option to help mitigate large-scale climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Economics; Electricity generation; Environmental impacts; Fossil fuels; Power plants","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electricity; Enhanced recovery; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas industry; Transportation routes; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Climate change mitigation; Combined cycle; Continued use; Cost of electricity; Cost-increases; Electricity generation; Enhanced oil recovery; Gas fields; Natural gas combined cycles; North Sea; Power generation systems; Power station; Producer price indices; Pulverised coals; Techno-economics; United kingdom; Climate change; absorption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; enhanced oil recovery; environmental impact; fossil fuel; gas field; mitigation; physicochemical property; power plant; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551552681

The energy source is a combination of the solar thermal energy and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) that is in common use in kitchens. The solar thermal energy is transferred to the kitchen by means of a circulating fluid. The transfer of solar heat is a twofold process wherein the energy from the collector is transferred first to an intermediate energy storage buffer and the energy is subsequently transferred from the buffer to the cooking load. There are three parameters that are controlled in order to maximize the energy transfer from the collector to the load viz. the fluid flow rate from collector to buffer, fluid flow rate from buffer to load and the diameter of the pipes. This is a complex multi energy domain system comprising energy flow across several domains such as thermal, electrical and hydraulic. The entire system is modeled using the bond graph approach with seamless integration of the power flow in these domains. A method to estimate different parameters of the practical cooking system is also explained. Design and life cycle costing of the system is also discussed.

Only five current technologies meet these criteria: coal (both pulverised fuel and integrated gasification combined cycle) with carbon capture and storage (CCS); combined cycle gas turbine with CCS; Generation III nuclear fission; and solar thermal backed by heat storage and gas turbines. To compare costs and performance, we undertook a meta-review of authoritative peer-reviewed studies of levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and life-cycle GHG emissions for these technologies. Future baseload electricity technology selection will be influenced by the total cost of technology substitution, including carbon pricing, which is synergistically related to both LCOE and emissions. Nuclear energy is the cheapest option and best able to meet the IPCC timetable for GHG abatement. Solar thermal is the most expensive, while CCS will require rapid major advances in technology to meet that timetable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Baseload electricity; Carbon Price; Levelized cost of electricity; Life-cycle analysis; Nuclear; Solar thermal","Coal storage; Competition; Costs; Electricity; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Life cycle; Scheduling; Solar heating; Technology; Turbomachinery; Baseload electricity; Carbon Price; Levelized cost of electricity; Life cycle analysis; Nuclear; Solar thermal; Cost benefit analysis; advanced technology; carbon sequestration; coal; competitiveness; electricity generation; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life cycle analysis; meta-analysis; nuclear power; price dynamics; pricing policy; solar power; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650738253

To reduce the adverse effects of the power system introducing WTGs, there are several published reports on output power control of WTGs detailing various researches based on pitch angle control, variable speed wind turbines, energy storage systems, and so on. In this context, this paper presents an integrated control method for a WF to reduce frequency deviations in a small power system. In this study, the WF achieves the frequency control with two control schemes: load estimation and short-term ahead wind speed prediction. For load estimation in the small power system, a minimal-order observer is used as disturbance observer. The estimated load is utilized to determine the output power command of the WF. To regulate the output power command of the WF according to wind speed changing, short-term ahead wind speed is predicted by using least-squares method. The predicted wind speed adjusts the output power command of the WF as a multiplying factor with fuzzy reasoning. By means of the proposed method, the WF can operate according to the wind and load conditions. In the WF system, each output power of the WTGs is controlled by regulating each pitch angle. For increasing acquisition power of the WF, a dispatch control method also is proposed. In the pitch angle control system of each WTG, generalized predictive control (GPC) is applied to enhance the control performance. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerical simulations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Frequency control; Load estimation; Pitch angle control; Wind farm; Wind speed prediction","Electric frequency control; Electric power system control; Electric utilities; Frequency estimation; Integrated control; Least squares approximations; Numerical methods; Predictive control systems; Speed; Turbogenerators; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Generalized predictive control; Load estimation; Minimal-order observers; Pitch-angle control; Variable speed wind turbines; Wind farm; Wind speed prediction; Power control; control system; fuzzy mathematics; least squares method; numerical model; power generation; wind farm; wind turbine; wind velocity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650577402

At utility scale, energy generated during periods of low energy demand can be released to meet higher demand periods. Also compressed air is a commonly used utility across most manufacturing and processing industries as its production and handling are safe and easy. Compressed air systems are critical and play a pivotal role in the proper operation of many processing facilities since most of the instruments and controls depend on pressurized instrumentation air for operation. In this work, a simple predictive tool, which is easier than current available models involving a large number of parameters, requiring more complicated and longer computations, is presented here for the prediction of transport properties (namely thermal conductivity and viscosity) of compressed air at elevated pressures as a function of temperature and pressure using a simple Arrhenius-type function. The proposed correlation predicts the transport properties of air for temperature range between 260 and 1000. K, and pressures up to 1000. bar (100. MPa). Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 1.28% and 0.68% for thermal conductivity and viscosity respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Arrhenius function; Compressed air; Thermal conductivity; Transport properties; Viscosity","Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Digital storage; Electron transport properties; Pressure vessels; Safe handling; Transport properties; Viscosity; Arrhenius-function; Average absolute deviation; Compressed air system; Elevated pressure; Processing facilities; Processing industry; Temperature and pressures; Temperature range; Thermal conductivity; atmospheric transport; compressed air; data set; high pressure; high temperature; instrumentation; numerical model; prediction; thermal conductivity; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650560109

In this paper we analyze the performance of archives with regard to paper and document storage conditions, also given in terms of the Time Weighted Preservation Index (TWPI), against overall comfort conditions, according to ISO 7730 and to the Building Bioclimatic Chart.

The complexity of the mathematical solution of this stiff set of differential equations that use boundary conditions that move with the solid-liquid interface was simplified by using an apparent heat capacity (cpap) dependent on temperature and obtained by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC). The performance of this model was confirmed by using a home-made experimental installation for the thermal characterization of solid materials. Theoretical curves obtained for gypsum blocks with three different contents of phase change materials (PCMs) were in agreement with experimental ones, indicating that this thermal process can be reproduced theoretically by using the cpap of each block and a unique thermal conductivity of the pure gypsum. The other physical and thermal properties were taken from literature or supplied by the manufacturers. Results also indicated that the higher the PCM content, the higher the energy storage capacity of the wallboard and the lower the wall temperature variation. Furthermore, it was found that a block containing a 5. wt.% of microcapsule allows the reduction of gypsum thickness by 8.5%, maintaining the same insulating effect. Thus, these kind of material can be used to improve comfort, save energy in buildings and even reduce the weight of wallboards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Gypsum; Heat capacity; PCM; Thermal conductivity","Boundary conditions; Building materials; Characterization; Differential equations; Differential scanning calorimetry; Gypsum; Heat conduction; Phase change materials; Phase interfaces; Pulse code modulation; Specific heat; Walls (structural partitions); Apparent heat capacity; Energy storage capacity; Experimental installations; Fourier heat conduction; Mathematical solutions; Modulated differential scanning calorimetry; Solid-liquid interfaces; Thermal characterization; Thermal conductivity; boundary condition; calorimetry; Fourier transform; gypsum; heat capacity; insulation; literature review; mathematical analysis; numerical model; performance assessment; temperature effect; theoretical study; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149357420

Imports of oil and gas accounted for 85% of the country's requirements in 2005 and 86% in 2006. Meanwhile, the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the total primary energy consumption was only 14% in 2006. When focusing only on electricity production, the situation is somewhat better. The share of RES in gross electricity production varies between 20% and 35% and is dependent on the hydropower production in wet and dry years. This paper presents, on a national scale, Portugal's energy system planning and technical solutions for achieving 100% RES electricity production. Planning was based on hourly energy balance and use of H2RES software. The H2RES model provides the ability to integrate various types of storages into energy systems in order to increase penetration of the intermittent renewable energy sources or to achieve a 100% renewable island, region or country. The paper also represents a stepping-stone for studies offering wider possibilities in matching and satisfying electricity supply in Portugal with potential renewable energy sources. Special attention has been given to intermittent sources such as wind, solar and ocean waves that can be coupled to appropriate energy storage systems charged with surplus amounts of produced electricity. The storage systems also decrease installed power requirements for generating units. Consequently, these storages will assist in avoiding unnecessary rejection of renewable potential and reaching a sufficient security of energy supply. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","100% Renewable systems; Energy storage; Portugal; Renewable energy; Sustainable energy planning","Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Water waves; Electricity production; Energy storage systems; Hydro power production; Portugal; Primary energy consumption; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy planning; Electric power generation; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy planning; energy resource; gas trade; hydroelectric power; import; oil trade; renewable resource; solar power; sustainability; wind power; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049364695

Having already developed an integrated design method and various control concepts in the past, in the present paper the impact of different aspects of TABS regarding the energetic performance of such systems is analyzed. Based on a simulation case study for a typical Central European office building, the following conclusions can be drawn. The energy efficiency of TABS is significantly influenced by the hydronic circuit topology used. With separate zone return pipes energy savings of approximately 15-25kWh/m2a, or 20-30% of heating as well as cooling demand, can be achieved, compared to common zone return pipes, where energy losses occur due to mixing of return water. A strong impact on energy efficiency can also be observed for the control strategy. Thus, by intermittent operation of the system using pulse width modulation control (PWM), the electricity demand for the water circulation pumps can be reduced by more than 50% compared to continuous operation. Concerning cold generation for TABS, it is shown that free cooling with a wet cooling tower is most efficient, if the cold source is the outside air. Variants with mechanical chillers exhibit 30-50% higher electricity demands for cold generation and distribution, even though their runtimes are much shorter compared to the cooling tower runtimes. In conclusion, the results show that significant energy savings can be achieved using adapted system topologies and applying appropriate control solutions for TABS. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Concrete core conditioning; Energy efficiency of cold generation; HVAC control; Hydronic circuit topology; Pulse width modulation control, PWM; Thermally activated building systems, TABS","Buildings; Climate control; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cooling towers; Electric energy storage; Electric network topology; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Modulation; Office buildings; Pulse width modulation; Timing circuits; Topology; Voltage control; Building systems; Cold generation; Concrete core conditioning; HVAC control; Pulse width modulation control; Energy efficiency; air conditioning; building; control system; cooling; demand analysis; energy efficiency; heating; pipe; power generation; pump; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957325203

Most of the biodiesel is currently made from soybean, rapeseed, and palm oils. However, there are large amounts of low-cost oils and fats (e.g., restaurant waste, beef tallow, pork lard, and yellow grease) that could be converted to biodiesel. The crop types, agricultural practices, land and labor costs, plant sizes, processing technologies and government policies in different regions considerably vary ethanol production costs and prices by region. The cost of producing bioethanol in a dry mill plant currently totals US$1.65/galon. The largest ethanol cost component is the plant feedstock. It has been showed that plant size has a major effect on cost. The plant size can reduce operating costs by 15-20%, saving another $0.02-$0.03 per liter. Thus, a large plant with production costs of $0.29 per liter may be saving $0.05-$0.06 per liter over a smaller plant. Viscosity of biofuel and biocrude varies greatly with the liquefaction conditions. The high and increasing viscosity indicates a poor flow characteristic and stability. The increase in the viscosity can be attributed to the continuing polymerization and oxidative coupling reactions in the biocrude upon storage. Although stability of biocrude is typically better than that of bio-oil, the viscosity of biocrude is much higher. The bio-oil produced by flash pyrolysis is a highly oxygenated mixture of carbonyls, carboxyls, phenolics and water. It is acidic and potentially corrosive. Bio-oil can also be potentially upgraded by hydrodeoxygenation. The liquid, termed biocrude, contains 60% carbon, 10-20. wt.% oxygen and 30-36. MJ/kg heating value as opposed to <1. wt.% and 42-46. MJ/kg for petroleum. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-oil; Biocrude; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biomass; Liquid biofuel","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon; Compensation (personnel); Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Liquids; Operating costs; Palm oil; Produced Water; Pyrolysis; Soybean oil; Viscosity; Wages; Agricultural practices; Bio oil; Biocrude; Flow charac-teristics; Increasing viscosity; Liquid biofuels; Oxidative coupling reactions; Processing technologies; Oils and fats; biochemical composition; biofuel; biomass; competition (economics); cost-benefit analysis; crop production; energy crop; energy policy; oxygenation; pyrolysis; seasonal variation; viscosity; Brassica napus; Glycine max",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957298631

The energy available in the exit stream of many energy conversion devices goes as waste, if not utilized properly. The major technical constraint that prevents successful implementation of waste heat recovery is due to its intermittent and time mismatched demand and availability of energy. In the present work, a shell and finned tube heat exchanger integrated with an IC engine setup to extract heat from the exhaust gas and a thermal energy storage tank used to store the excess energy available is investigated in detail. A combined sensible and latent heat storage system is designed, fabricated and tested for thermal energy storage using cylindrical phase change material (PCM) capsules. The performance of the engine with and without heat exchanger is evaluated. It is found that nearly 10-15% of fuel power is stored as heat in the combined storage system, which is available at reasonably higher temperature for suitable application. The performance parameters pertaining to the heat exchanger and the storage tank such as amount of heat recovered, heat lost, charging rate, charging efficiency and percentage energy saved are evaluated and reported in this paper. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Diesel engine exhaust; Heat recovery heat exchanger; Latent heat thermal storage; Phase change material; Thermal storage; Waste heat recovery","Combustion; Diesel engines; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel storage; Gases; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Internal combustion engines; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Experimental investigations; Finned tube heat exchangers; Heat recovery heat exchangers; Latent heat storage system; Latent heat thermal storage; Shell and tube heat exchangers; Thermal energy storage tanks; Thermal storage; Waste heat utilization; diesel engine; energy efficiency; experimental study; latent heat flux; performance assessment; phase transition; sensible heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957293244
