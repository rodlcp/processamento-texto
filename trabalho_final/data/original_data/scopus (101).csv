Leptin stimulates the oxidation of fatty acids and the uptake of glucose3, 4, and prevents the accumulation of lipids in nonadipose tissues, which can lead to functional impairments known as ""lipotoxicity""5. The signalling pathways that mediate the metabolic effects of leptin remain undefined. The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) potently stimulates fatty-acid oxidation in muscle by inhibiting the activity of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)6, 7. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme that is conserved from yeast to humans and functions as a 'fuel gauge' to monitor the status of cellular energy6. Here we show that leptin selectively stimulates phosphorylation and activation of the α2 catalytic subunit of AMPK (α2 AMPK) in skeletal muscle, thus establishing a previously unknown signalling pathway for leptin. Early activation of AMPK occurs by leptin acting directly on muscle, whereas later activation depends on leptin functioning through the hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system axis. In parallel with its activation of AMPK, leptin suppresses the activity of ACC, thereby stimulating the oxidation of fatty acids in muscle. Blocking AMPK activation inhibits the phosphorylation of ACC stimulated by leptin. Our data identify AMPK as a principal mediator of the effects of leptin on fatty-acid metabolism in muscle.",,"Enzyme inhibition; Enzymes; Fatty acids; Glucose; Metabolism; Muscle; Oxidation; Nonadipose tissues; Hormones; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; fatty acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin; protein kinase; unclassified drug; fatty acid; metabolism; oxidation; adipocyte; adrenergic system; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell energy; controlled study; energy expenditure; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hypothalamus; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; male; mouse; muscle metabolism; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; priority journal; soleus muscle; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Animals; Catalytic Domain; Enzyme Activation; Fatty Acids; Isoproterenol; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Multienzyme Complexes; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Phentolamine; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Signal Transduction; Sympathetic Nervous System; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037122766

Performance and cost models of an amine (MEA)-based CO2 absorption system for postcombustion flue gas applications have been developed and integrated with an existing power plant modeling framework that includes multipollutant control technologies for other regulated emissions. The integrated model has been applied to study the feasibility and cost of carbon capture and sequestration at both new and existing coal-burning power plants. The cost of carbon avoidance was shown to depend strongly on assumptions about the reference plant design, details of the CO2 capture system design, interactions with other pollution control systems, and method of CO2 storage. The CO2 avoidance cost for retrofit systems was found to be generally higher than for new plants, mainly because of the higher energy penalty resulting from less efficient heat integration as well as site-specific difficulties typically encountered in retrofit applications. For all cases, a small reduction in CO2 capture cost was afforded by the SO2 emission trading credits generated by amine-based capture systems. Efforts are underway to model a broader suite of carbon capture and sequestration technologies for more comprehensive assessments in the context of multipollutant environmental management.",,"Greenhouse gases; Adsorption; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Air pollution control; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; amine; carbon dioxide; emission control; greenhouse gas; power plant; article; electric power plant; environmental management; environmental monitoring; fossil; greenhouse; pollution control; Absorption; Air Pollution; Amines; Carbon Dioxide; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037108565

Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, United States","Over the past decade, mobile computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers of many new computing applications. The field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research. The ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global positioning system (GPS), Flash memory wireless transceivers, and a small CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high 'data homing' success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for ZebraNet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.",,"Biology; Computer networks; Computer simulation; Flash memory; Global positioning system; Mobile computing; Network protocols; Remote sensing; Tracking (position); Transceivers; Animals; Computer operating systems; Distributed computer systems; Linguistics; Research; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Central processing unit; E burchelli; Equus grevyi; Peer to peer networking; Software Package ZNetSim; Wildlife tracking; Computer operating systems; Peer to peer networks; Ad hoc protocols; Broadcast communication; Cellular services; Computing applications; Design tradeoff; Energy efficient; Energy tradeoff; Fixed base; Least energy; Mobile sensor networks; Peer-to-peer networking; Peer-to-peer routing; Reliable systems; Research centres; Sensor applications; Wireless communication devices; Wireless communications; Wireless computing devices; Wireless transceiver; Zebranet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036949534

For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized ""shaping"" only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL-PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Hamiltonian systems; Nonlinear control; Passivity; Stabilization of nonlinear systems","Electromechanical devices; Equations of motion; Hamiltonians; Lagrange multipliers; Mathematical models; Nonlinear control systems; Potential energy; Robustness (control systems); Passivity-based control (PBC); Closed loop control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036533002

We describe and validate an end-to-end model that enables us to compute the soft error rates (SER) for existing and future microprocessor-style designs. The model captures the effects of two important masking phenomena, electrical masking and latching-window masking, which inhibit soft errors in combinational logic. We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600nm to 50nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the SER per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements.

Here we survey possible future energy sources, evaluated for their capability to supply massive amounts of carbon emission-free energy and for their potential for large-scale commercialization. Possible candidates for primary energy sources include terrestrial solar and wind energy, solar power satellites, biomass, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, fission-fusion hybrids, and fossil fuels from which carbon has been sequestered. Non-primary power technologies that could contribute to climate stabilization include efficiency improvements, hydrogen production, storage and transport, superconducting global electric grids, and geoengineering. All of these approaches currently have severe deficiencies that limit their ability to stabilize global climate. We conclude that a broad range of intensive research and development is urgently needed to produce technological options that can allow both climate stabilization and economic development.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Fission reactions; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Planets; Solar energy; Wind power; Climate stabilization; Climate change; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; hydrogen; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; climate change; global climate; stabilization; sustainability; carbon dioxide measurement; climate; commercial phenomena; conductor; economic aspect; energy; energy resource; global change; greenhouse effect; molecular stability; priority journal; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18644385222

Of all cavity geometries, micrometresized dielectric spherical resonators are the best in terms of their ability to store energy for long periods of time within small volumes. In the sphere, light orbits near the surface, where long confinement times (high Q) effectively wrap a large interaction distance into a tiny volume. This characteristic makes such resonators uniquely suited for studies of nonlinear coupling of light with matter. Early work recognized these attributes through Raman excitation in microdroplets - but microdroplets have not been used in practical applications. Here we demonstrate a micrometre-scale, nonlinear Raman source that has a highly efficient pump - signal conversion (higher than 35%) and pump thresholds nearly 1,000 times lower than shown before. This represents a route to compact, ultralow-threshold sources for numerous wavelength bands that are usually difficult to access. Equally important, this system can provide a compact and simple building block for studying nonlinear optical effects and the quantum aspects of light.",,"Cavity resonators; Electrodynamics; Energy storage; Nonlinear optics; Quantum optics; Raman scattering; Dielectric microcavities; Semiconductor lasers; optical method; article; dielectric constant; geometry; light scattering; molecular interaction; priority journal; quantum mechanics; Raman spectrometry; signal processing; spectral sensitivity; Fiber Optics; Lasers; Microspheres; Silicon Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037034014

Several SCD isoforms (SCD1-3) exist in the mouse. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform have reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and are resistant to diet-induced weight gain. The protection from obesity involves increased energy expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with the wild-type mice the SCD1-/- mice have increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In the SCD1-/- mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation are up-regulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes are down-regulated.

It is primarily used to quantify the fuel economy, the performance, and the emissions of vehicles that use alternative technologies including fuel cells, batteries, electric motors, and internal combustion engines in hybrid (i.e. multiple power sources) configurations. It excels at quantifying the relative change that can be expected due to the implementation of technology compared to a baseline scenario. ADVISOR's capabilities and limitations are presented and the power source models that are included in ADVISOR are discussed.

Fuel cells seem to be best suited to applications where significantly more energy storage is required than at present in portable devices (>20 Wh). Energy requirements (Wh) are likely to increase with the introduction of broadband mobile computing, and fuel cells with lightweight fuel supplies could dramatically increase the amount of energy available in the same volume. However, in contrast to batteries, since the energy source and the energy converter are separated, a fuel cell system adds complexity and associated safety and reliability issues will need to be carefully assessed for portable applications.

Previous work has identified data-centric routing as one such method. In an associated position paper, we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (DCS), is also a useful approach. Under DCS, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. In this paper, we describe GHT a Geographic Hash Table system for DCS on sensornets. GHT hashes keys into geographic coordinates, and stores a key-value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. The system replicates stored data locally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. It uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key-value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. And it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. We evaluate the performance of GHT as a DCS system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. Our results demonstrate that GHT is the preferable approach for the application workloads predicted in [23], offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.","Algorithms; Design; Performance","Computer simulation; Distributed computer systems; Network protocols; Sensor data fusion; Geographic hash table; Data communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036983290

Strategically located in the midst of the mammalian neuraxis, the hypothalamus receives at least three distinct types of relevant information via direct or indirect neural connections as well as hormone receptors and substrate sensors bestowed on hypothalamic neurons. First, the medial and to a lesser extent the lateral hypothalamus receive a rich mix of information pertaining to the internal state of relative energy repletion/depletion. Second, specific hypothalamic nuclei receive information about the behavioral state, such as diurnal clock, physical activity-level, reproductive cycle, developmental stage, as well as imminent (e.g. fight and flight) and chronic (e.g. infection) stressors, that can potentially impact on short-term availability of fuels and long-term energy balance. Third, the hypothalamus, particularly its lateral aspects, receives information from areas in the forebrain involved in the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of sensory representations of the external food space and internal food experience, as well as from the executive forebrain involved in behavior selection and initiation. In addition, rich intrahypothalamic connections facilitate further distribution of incoming information to various hypothalamic nuclei. On the other hand, the hypothalamus has widespread neural projections to the same cortical areas it receives inputs, and many hypothalamic neurons are one synapse away from most endocrine systems and from both sympathetic and parasympathetic effector organs involved in the flux, storage, mobilization, and utilization of fuels. It is argued that processing within cortico-limbic areas and communication with hypothalamic areas are particularly important in human food intake control that is more and more guided by cognitive rather than metabolic aspects in the obesigenic environment of affluent societies. A distributed neural network for the control of food intake and energy balance consisting of a central processor and several parallel processing loops is hypothesized. Detailed neurochemical, anatomical, and functional analysis of reciprocal connections of the numerous peptidergic neuron populations in the hypothalamus with extrahypothalamic brain areas will be necessary to better understand what hypothalamus, forebrain, and brainstem tell each other and who is in charge under specific conditions of internal and external nutrient availability. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The underlying theme of the fuzzy rules is to optimize the operational efficiency of all components, considered as one system. Simulation results have been used to assess the performance of the controller. A forward-looking hybrid vehicle model was used for implementation and simulation of the controller.

The paper begins with a review of the concept of irreversibility, entropy generation, or exergy destruction. Examples illustrate the accounting for exergy flows and accumulation in closed systems, open systems, heat transfer processes, and power and refrigeration plants. The proportionality between exergy destruction and entropy generation sends the designer in search of improved thermodynamic performance subject to finite-size constraints and specified environmental conditions. Examples are drawn from energy storage systems for sensible heat and latent heat, solar energy, and the generation of maximum power in a power plant model with finite heat transfer surface inventory. It is shown that the physical structure (geometric configuration, topology) of the system springs out of the process of global thermodynamic optimization subject to global constraints. This principle generates structure not only in engineering but also in physics and biology (constructal theory).

The thermal gradient separates the two temperature potentials. A low-cost filler material provides the bulk of the thermal capacitance of the thermal storage, prevents conective mixing, and reduces the amount of fluid required.

The predominant paradigm used to explain this link is the portal/visceral hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that increased adiposity, particularly in the visceral depots, leads to increased free fatty acid flux and inhibition of insulin action via Randle's effect in insulin-sensitive tissues. Recent data do not entirely support this hypothesis. As such, two new paradigms have emerged that may explain the established links between adiposity and disease. (A) Three lines of evidence support the ectopic fat storage syndrome. First, failure to develop adequate adipose tissue mass in either mice or humans, also known as lipodystrophy, results in severe insulin resistance and diabetes. This is thought to be the result of ectopic storage of lipid into liver, skeletal muscle, and the pancreatic insulin-secreting beta cell. Second, most obese patients also shunt lipid into the skeletal muscle, the liver, and probably the beta cell. The importance of this finding is exemplified by several studies demonstrating that the degree of lipid infiltration into skeletal muscle and liver correlates highly with insulin resistance. Third, increased fat cell size is highly associated with insulin resistance and the development of diabetes. Increased fat cell size may represent the failure of the adipose tissue mass to expand and thus to accommodate an increased energy influx. Taken together, these three observations support the acquired lipodystrophy hypothesis as a link between adiposity and insulin resistance. (B) The endocrine paradigm developed in parallel with the ectopic fat storage syndrome hypothesis. Adipose tissue secretes a variety of endocrine hormones, such as leptin, interleukin-6, angiotensin II, adiponectin (also called ACRP30 and adipoQ), and resistin. From this viewpoint, adipose tissue plays a critical role as an endocrine gland, secreting numerous factors with potent effects on the metabolism of distant tissues. These two new paradigms provide a framework to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of the insulin-resistance syndrome.","Acquired lipodystrophy; Adiponectin; Ectopic fat storage syndrome; Endocrine paradigm; Resistin","adiponectin; angiotensin; fat; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; adipocyte; cell proliferation; conference paper; diabetic obesity; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; hormonal regulation; human; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036299262

This view changed when it was shown that a two-photon absorption process could, because of a quadratic dependence of excitation on intensity, produce a spatially confined excitation useful for three-dimensional data storage and imaging. Two-photon absorption has received considerable attention recently because of the development of highly efficient two-photon-sensitive materials, leading to numerous technological applications. These successes have created interest in exploring applications based on three-photon excitations. For a three-photon process, a longer excitation wavelength such as those common in optical communications can be used. Also, the cubic dependence of the threephoton process on the input light intensity provides a stronger spatial confinement, so that a higher contrast in imaging can be obtained. Here we report the observation of a highly directional and up-converted stimulated emission as an amplified spontaneous emission, produced in an organic chromophore solution by a strong simultaneous three-photon absorption at 1.3 μm. This achievement suggests opportunities for a three-photon process in frequency-upconversion lasing, short-pulse optical communications, and the emerging field of biophotonics.",,"Chromophores; Electron energy levels; Imaging techniques; Light absorption; Multiphoton processes; Optical communication; Biophotonics; Photon absorption; Stimulated emission; absorption; emission; article; chromatophore; contrast; information processing; light; light absorption; light intensity; photon; prediction; priority journal; spectral sensitivity; telecommunication; three dimensional imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037075020

Singlet oxygen oxidation produces undesirable compounds in foods during processing and storage. However, carotenoids and tocopherols in foods can minimize singlet oxygen oxidation. The in-depth scientific knowledge on the formation, reactions, quenching mechanisms, and kinetics of singlet oxygen can greatly improve the quality of foods by minimizing the oxidation during processing and storage.

Environmental problems associated with coal, before mining, during mining, in storage, during combustion, and postcombustion waste products are well known and are being addressed by ongoing research. The connection between potential environmental problems with human health is a fairly new field and requires the cooperation of both the geoscience and medical disciplines. Three research programs that illustrate this collaboration are described and used to present a range of human health problems that are potentially caused by coal. Domestic combustion of coal in China has, in some cases, severely affected human health. Both on a local and regional scale, human health has been adversely affected by coals containing arsenic, fluorine, selenium, and possibly, mercury. Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), an irreversible kidney disease of unknown origin, has been related to the proximity of Pliocene lignite deposits. The working hypothesis is that groundwater is leaching toxic organic compounds as it passes through the lignites and that these organics are then ingested by the local population contributing to this health problem. Human disease associated with coal mining mainly results from inhalation of particulate matter during the mining process. The disease is Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis characterized by coal dust-induced lesions in the gas exchange regions of the lung; the coal worker's ""black lung disease"". © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

So-called Data Grids seek to harness geographically distributed resources for such large-scale data-intensive problems. Yet effective scheduling in such environments is challenging, due to a need to address a variety of metrics and constraints while dealing with multiple, potentially independent sources of jobs and a large number of storage, compute, and network resources. We describe a scheduling framework that addresses these problems. Within this framework, data movement operations may be either tightly bound to job scheduling decisions or, alternatively, performed by a decoupled, asynchronous process on the basis of observed data access patterns and load. We develop a family of algorithms and use simulation studies to evaluate various combinations. Our results suggest that while it is necessary to consider the impact of replication, it is not always necessary to couple data movement and computation scheduling. Instead, these two activities can be addressed separately, thus significantly simplifying the design and implementation. © 2002 IEEE.","Application software; Bioinformatics; Computer science; Distributed computing; Laboratories; Large-scale systems; Physics computing; Processor scheduling; Resource management; Scheduling algorithm","Application programs; Bioinformatics; Computer resource management; Computer science; Digital storage; High energy physics; Laboratories; Large scale systems; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Computation scheduling; Design and implementations; Geographically distributed resources; Independent sources; Processor scheduling; Resource management; Scheduling frameworks; Simulation studies; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849099250

This survey briefly describes the work done before 1990 followed by a more detailed discussion of later efforts. The most advanced system is a 2-tank-storage system where the heat transfer fluid (HTF) also serves as storage medium. This concept was successfully demonstrated in a commercial trough plant (13.8 MWe SEGS I plant; 120 M Wht storage capacity) and a demonstration tower plant (10 MWe Solar Two; 105 MWht storage capacity). However, the HTF used in state-of-the-art parabolic trough power plants (30-80 M We) is expensive, dramatically increasing the cost of larger HTF storage systems. Other promising storage concepts are under development, such as concrete storage, phase change material storage, and chemical storage. These concepts promise a considerable cost reduction compared to the direct 2-tank system, but some additional R&amp;D is required before those systems can be used in commercial solar power plants. An interesting and likely cost-effective near-term option for thermal energy storage for parabolic trough power plants is the use of an indirect 2-tank-storage, where another (less expensive) liquid medium such as molten salt is utilized rather than the HTF itself.

This local-scale urban meteorological parameterization scheme (LUMPS), which has similarities to the hybrid plume dispersion model (HPDM) scheme, requires only standard meteorological observations and basic knowledge of surface cover. LUMPS is driven by net all-wave radiation. Heat storage by the urban fabric is parameterized from net all-wave radiation and surface cover information using the objective hysteresis model (OHM). The turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes are calculated using the available energy and are partitioned using the approach of de Bruin and Holtslag, and Holtslag and van Ulden. A new scheme to define the Holtslag and van Ulden α and β parameters for urban environments is presented: α is empirically related to the plan fraction of the surface that is vegetated or irrigated, and a new urban value of β captures the observed delay in reversal of the sign of the sensible heat flux in the evening. LUMPS is evaluated using field observations collected in seven North American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; Miami, Florida; Tucson, Arizona; Los Angeles and Sacramento, California; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and Chicago, Illinois). Performance is shown to be better than that for the standard HPDM preprocessor scheme. Most improvement derives from the inclusion of the OHM for the storage heat flux and the revised β coefficient. The scheme is expected to have broad utility in models used to calculate air pollution dispersion and the mixing depths of urban areas or to provide surface forcing for mesoscale models of urban regions.",,"Heat flux; Heat radiation; Mathematical models; Turbulence; Objective hysteresis model (OHM); Meteorology; energy balance; heat flux; micrometeorology; parameterization; urban area; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036647840

Intracellular Ca2+ has a key role in regulating adipocyte lipid metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca2+ resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis, suppression of lipolysis, and increased lipid filling and adiposity. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increased calcitriol released in response to low calcium diets stimulates Ca2+ influx in human adipocytes and thereby promotes adiposity. Accordingly, suppressing calcitriol levels by increasing dietary calcium is an attractive target for the prevention and management of obesity. In support of this concept, transgenic mice expressing the agouti gene specifically in adipocytes (a human-like pattern) respond to low calcium diets with accelerated weight gain and fat accretion, while high calcium diets markedly inhibit lipogenesis, accelerate lipolysis, increase thermogenesis and suppress fat accretion and weight gain in animals maintained at identical caloric intakes. Further, low calcium diets impede body fat loss, while high calcium diets markedly accelerate fat loss in transgenic mice subjected to caloric restriction. These findings are further supported by clinical and epidemiological data demonstrating a profound reduction in the odds of being obese associated with increasing dietary calcium intake. Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert a significantly greater anti-obesity effect than supplemental sources in each of these studies, possibly due to the effects of other bioactive compounds, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor found in milk, on adipocyte metabolism, indicating an important role for dairy products in the control of obesity. © 2002 American College of Nutrition.","Adipocyte; Calcium; Dairy; Obesity; Vitamin D","calcitriol; calcium; carrier protein; fatty acid; ion channel; mitochondrial protein; mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2; protein; calcitriol; calcium; calcium ion; adipocyte; adipose tissue; body composition; calcium intake; caloric intake; chemistry; dairy product; drug effect; feces; human; metabolism; obesity; physiology; review; risk factor; weight reduction; body fat; calcium cell level; calcium intake; calcium transport; caloric restriction; clinical trial; conference paper; energy metabolism; epidemiological data; gene expression; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; nonhuman; obesity; risk assessment; thermogenesis; transgenic mouse; weight gain; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Body Composition; Calcitriol; Calcium; Calcium, Dietary; Dairy Products; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids; Feces; Humans; Ion Channels; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; Obesity; Proteins; Risk Factors; Weight Loss; Agouti; Animalia; Mus musculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036548811

Box 308, Princeton, NJ 08542, United States","A simple model of large-scale land (continental) water and energy balances is presented. The model is an extension of an earlier scheme with a record of successful application in climate modeling. The most important changes from the original model include 1) introduction of non-water-stressed stomatal control of transpiration, in order to correct a tendency toward excessive evaporation: 2) conversion from globally constant parameters (with the exception of vegetation-dependent snow-free surface albedo) to more complete vegetation and soil dependence of all parameters, in order to provide more realistic representation of geographic variations in water and energy balances and to enable model-based investigations of land-cover change; 3) introduction of soil sensible heat storage and transport, in order to move toward realistic diurnal-cycle modeling; 4) a groundwater (saturated-zone) storage reservoir, in order to provide more realistic temporal variability of runoff; and 5) a rudimentary runoff-routing scheme for delivery of runoff to the ocean, in order to provide realistic freshwater forcing of the ocean general circulation model component of a global climate model. The new model is tested with forcing from the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Initiative I global dataset and a recently produced observation-based water-balance dataset for major river basins of the world. Model performance is evaluated by comparing computed and observed runoff ratios from many major river basins of the world. Special attention is given to distinguishing between two components of the apparent runoff ratio error: the part due to intrinsic model error and the part due to errors in the assumed precipitation forcing. The pattern of discrepancies between modeled and observed runoff ratios is consistent with results from a companion study of precipitation estimation errors. The new model is tuned by adjustment of a globally constant scale factor for non-water-stressed stomatal resistance. After tuning, significant overestimation of runoff is found in environments where an overall arid climate includes a brief but intense wet season. It is shown that this error may be explained by the neglect of upward soil water diffusion from below the root zone during the dry season. With the exception of such basins, and in the absence of precipitation errors. It is estimated that annual runoff ratios simulated by the model would have a root-mean-square error of about 0.05. The new model matches observations better than its predecessor, which has a negative runoff bias and greater scatter.",,"climate modeling; energy balance; error analysis; global perspective; hydrometeorology; water budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035982615

In obesity and type 2 DM, there is an increased content of lipid within and around muscle fibers. Changes in muscle in fuel partitioning of lipid, between oxidation and storage of fat calories, almost certainly contribute to accumulation of imTG and to the pathogenesis of both obesity and type 2 DM. In metabolic health, skeletal muscle physiology is characterized by the capacity to utilize either lipid or carbohydrate fuels, and to effectively transition between these fuels. We will review recent findings that indicate that in type 2 DM and obesity, skeletal muscle manifests inflexibility in the transition between lipid and carbohydrate fuels.

After 2.5 ± 0.1 h of intense cycling to deplete the muscle glycogen stores, subjects (n = 7) received, using a rank-ordered design, a CHO-Pro (80 g CHO, 28 g Pro, 6 g fat), LCHO (80 g CHO, 6 g fat), or HCHO (108 g CHO, 6 g fat) supplement immediately after exercise (10 min) and 2 h postexercise. Before exercise and during 4 h of recovery, muscle glycogen of the vastus lateralis was determined periodically by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Exercise significantly reduced the muscle glycogen stores (final concentrations: 40.9 ± 5.9 mmol/l CHO-Pro, 41.9 ± 5.7 mmol/l HCHO, 40.7 ± 5.0 mmol/l LCHO). After 240 min of recovery, muscle glycogen was significantly greater for the CHO-Pro treatment (88.8 ± 4.4 mmol/l) when compared with the LCHO (70.0 ± 4.0 mmol/l; P = 0.004) and HCHO (75.5 ± 2.8 mmol/l; P = 0.013) treatments. Glycogen storage did not differ significantly between the LCHO and HCHO treatments. There were no significant differences in the plasma insulin responses among treatments, although plasma glucose was significantly lower during the CHO-Pro treatment.

Long-term storage of a gaseous substance is fraught with uncertainty and hazards, but carbonate chemistry offers permanent solutions to the disposal problem. Carbonates can be formed from carbon dioxide and metal oxides in reactions that are thermodynamically favored and exothermic, which result in materials that can be safely and permanently kept out of the active carbon stocks in the environment.

By using DHE loaded on methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we followed this cholesterol analog in pulse-chase studies. At steady state, DHE co-localizes extensively with transferrin (Tf), a marker for the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), and redistributes with Tf in cells with altered ERC morphology. Expression of a dominant-negative mutation of an ERC-associated protein, mRme-1 (G429R), results in the slowing of both DHE and Tf receptor return to the cell surface. [3H]Cholesterol is found in the same fraction as 125I-Tf on sucrose density gradients, and this fraction can be specifically shifted to a higher density based on the presence of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Tf in the same organelle.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Hospital-based research center. Participants: Sixty patients (47 men, 13 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 65±9y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Patients underwent a total body scan by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine percentage of body fat, total lean mass, fat mass, and lean mass of the paretic and nonaffected legs, thighs, and arms. Thirty patients received computed tomography (CT) scans of their midthigh to determine muscle area, subcutaneous fat, and low-density lean tissue, as a measure of fat within the muscle area, of the paretic and nonaffected midthigh. Results: Patients were deconditioned (Vo2Peak: 1.2±0.3L/min) with a percentage of body fat of 31.4%±9.8% and total lean mass of 51.4±9.1 kg. Lean mass of the paretic leg and thigh were 4% and 3% lower than the nonaffected leg (P&lt;.001), but leg fat was not different. Arm lean mass of the paretic side was 7% lower than the nonaffected side, whereas arm fat was not different. CT studies showed that midthigh muscle area was 20% lower in the paretic limb than in the nonaffected leg (P&lt;.001), midthigh subcutaneous fat was similar, and midthigh low-density lean tissue showed a trend to be 3% higher in the paretic leg (P=.06). The ratio of midthigh low-density lean tissue to muscle area was higher in the paretic leg (P&lt;.001), which indicates a greater intramuscular fat relative to muscle area in the affected limb. Conclusions: Our results show hemiparetic skeletal muscle atrophy and more fat within the muscle, factors that may contribute to functional disability and increased cardiovascular disease risk in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients. © 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.","Aging; Body composition; Cerebrovascular disorders; Hemiplegia; Muscles; Rehabilitation","fat; adult; aged; article; body fat; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; health center; hemiparesis; human; lean body weight; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; muscle atrophy; prevalence; skeletal muscle; stroke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036896384

Precipitation is interpolated from gauges; evaporation is taken as the difference between precipitation and runoff, with the latter determined from basin discharge measurements and a simple storage-delay model; and radiation is based on a recent analysis in which 8 years of satellite observations were assimilated into radiative transfer models. Objective estimates of precipitation errors are considered; results suggest that past estimates of ν may have been biased by systematic errors in estimates of precipitation. Under the assumption that the semiempirical relation applies also to annual values, long-term mean observations are sufficient to predict the sensitivity of annual runoff to fluctuations in precipitation or net radiation. Additionally, an apparent sensitivity of runoff to precipitation can be inferred from the observations by linear regression. This apparent sensitivity is generally in good agreement with the predicted sensitivity. In particular, the apparent sensitivity increases with decreasing basin R̄/P̄; however, slightly excessive apparent sensitivity (relative to the prediction) is found in humid basins of the middle latitudes. This finding suggests a negative correlation between precipitation and net radiation: the increase in runoff caused by a positive precipitation anomaly is amplified by an accompanying decrease in surface net radiation, possibly induced by increased cloud cover. The inferred sensitivity of radiation (water flux equivalent) to precipitation is on the order of -0.1. Such a value is supported by independent direct analysis of annual precipitation and radiation data. The fraction of interannual variance in runoff explained by the annual precipitation anomaly (including any correlative influence of net radiation) varies systematically with climatic aridity, approaching unity in humid basins and falling to 40-80% in very arid basins. We conclude that the influence of seasonality of the precipitation anomaly on annual runoff is negligible under humid conditions, though it may be significant under arid conditions.","Interannual variability; Radiation; Runoff; Water balance","Catchments; Evaporation; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiation; Rivers; Runoff; Energy supply; Water resources; energy; river basin; water yield; annual variation; energy balance; flow structure; river basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036822427

It is forced with atmospheric data and radiation recorded above roof level and incorporates detailed representations of the urban surface (canyon geometry) to simulate energy balances for walls, roads, and roofs. Here the authors evaluate TEB using directly measured surface temperatures and local-scale energy balance and radiation fluxes for two ""simple"" urban sites: a downtown area within the historic core of Mexico City, Mexico (stone buildings five to six stories in height), and a light industrial site in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (flat-roofed, single-story warehouse). At both sites, vegetation cover is less than 5%, which permits direct evaluation of TEB in the absence of a coupled vegetation scheme. Following small modifications to TEB, notably to the aerodynamic resistance formulations, the model is shown to perform well overall. In Mexico City, with deep urban canyons and stone walls, almost two-thirds of the net radiation is partitioned into storage heat flux during the day, and this maintains large heat releases and an upward turbulent sensible heat flux at night. TEB simulates all of these features well. At both sites TEB correctly simulates the net radiation, surface temperatures, and the partitioning between the turbulent and storage heat fluxes. The composite wall temperature simulated by TEB is close to the average of the four measured wall temperatures. A sensitivity analysis of model parameters shows TEB is fairly robust: for the conditions considered here, TEB is most sensitive to roof characteristics and incoming solar radiation.",,"Aerodynamics; Atmospheric turbulence; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Heat storage; Meteorology; Roofs; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Vegetation; Atmospheric data; Atmospheric thermodynamics; aerodynamics; energy balance; heat flux; sensible heat flux; street canyon; British Columbia; Canada; Mexico; Mexico City; Vancouver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036820549

The effects of filler type and composition on electrical conductivity, composite morphology and mechanical properties have been examined and correlated to establish structure-property relationships. The threshold loading levels required for G and CF to achieve measurable conductivity in HDPE have been identified. Addition of CF to HDPE/G composites is found to increase the conductivity relative to that of HDPE/G composites at the same filler concentration. This observed increase depends on CF length and becomes more pronounced at and beyond the threshold loading of the HDPE/G composite.

The efficiency of separators depends on the physical and chemical composition of the animal manure. Therefore, the particle size composition was measured for different types of manure before treatment with a decanting centrifuge and a screw press. Storage of pig manure reduces the total dry matter content, and the content of small particles (<0.0016 mm) is reduced more than the content of large particles. In consequence, the proportion of large particles will increase, while the portion of small particles will decrease. The separation efficiency of the screw press was found to be low, as this separator only retains particles > 1 mm. The decanter centrifuge retained all the particles > 0.02 mm and was therefore much more efficient than the screw press. Separation efficiency was also found to be highly dependent on the type of manure used. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The relative energies of adsorption (or C-H bond energies) follow the order: zigzag edge &gt; armchair edge &gt; basal-plane edge, in agreement with previous semi-empirical MO results. However, it is found that adsorption on the basal plane sites is exothermic and stable, in contrast to previous semi-empirical results. On the edge sites, the C-H bond energy decreases by nearly 30 kcal/mol when two H atoms are adsorbed on the same site. On the basal plane, the C-H bond energy decreases from 46 kcal/mol when two H are adsorbed on alternating sites to 27 kcal/mol when they are adsorbed on two adjacent sites. Literature MO results of H adsorption on the exterior wall of SWNT are in fair agreement with that on the basal plane of graphite. The value 27 kcal/mol agrees well with experiment (23 kcal/mol) of TPD of hydrogen from MWNT. Three common features exist in the reported experiments on hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes: slow uptake, irreversibly adsorbed species, and the presence of reduced transition metals (Fe, Co or Ni). Combined with the MO results, a mechanism that involves H 2dissociation (on metal catalyst) followed by H spillover and adsorption (on nanotubes) is proposed for hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting increase in forecast lead time facilitates considerable improvements in system operating performance, especially in years of expected above average flows. In the current reservoir operating system, the so called ""critical"" and ""assured refill"" rule curves that restrict releases for hydropower generation in the period from August to December are based on the critical (most severe low flow) and third lowest flow sequences of record, respectively. These rule curves provide appropriate protection of energy capacity and reservoir refill in extreme low flow conditions, but are restrictive in normal and high flow years until midwinter when operational streamflow forecasts based on observed snowpack become available, and the climatological constraints are relaxed to account for expected summer streamflows. The use of long lead time streamflow forecasts allows current operating constraints to be relaxed in years when there is a high likelihood of ample streamflow. In these years, more spot market energy sales can be made in the late summer and fall/early winter because of increased available water for releases, and spill from reservoirs in wet years is also reduced. Reservoir model simulations using alternative reservoir rule curves based upon retrospective long-lead streamflow forecasts from water years 1931 to 1987 show that the proposed alternative operating system based on climate forecasts can increase nonfirm energy production from the major Columbia River hydropower dams by as much as 5.5 million MW/h/year, resulting in an average increase in annual revenue of approximately $153 million per year in comparison with the status quo. Other uses of the Columbia River are largely unaffected by the proposed changes in the operating system. In particular, firm energy, the reliability of storage reservoir refill, and the frequency of meeting of streamflow targets for salmon protection would be essentially unchanged in comparison with the status quo. The increased hydropower revenue is therefore directly attributed to use of long-lead forecast information and does not represent a trade-off among other management objectives.","Columbia River; Economic factors; Forecasting; Hydroelectric power; Streamflow","Snowpack; Hydroelectric power; Reservoirs (water); Weather forecasting; Stream flow; economic analysis; flow modeling; hydroelectric power; prediction; streamflow; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036497257

Tendons can enhance muscle performance for a wide range of locomotor activities because muscle-tendon units shorten and lengthen at velocities that would be mechanically unfavorable for muscle fibers functioning alone. During activities that require little net mechanical power output, such as steady-speed running, tendons reduce muscular work by storing and recovering cyclic changes in the mechanical energy of the body. Tendon stretch and recoil not only reduces muscular work, but also allows muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically, where, due to the force-velocity relation, skeletal muscle fibers develop high forces. Elastic energy storage and recovery in tendons may also provide a key mechanism to enable individual muscles to alter their mechanical function, from isometric force-producers during steady speed running to actively shortening power-producers during high-power activities like acceleration or uphill running. Evidence from studies of muscle contraction and limb dynamics in turkeys suggests that during running accelerations work is transferred directly from muscle to tendon as tendon stretch early in the step is powered by muscle shortening. The energy stored in the tendon is later released to help power the increase in energy of the body. These tendon length changes redistribute muscle power, enabling contractile elements to shorten at relatively constant velocities and power outputs, independent of the pattern of flexion/extension at a joint. Tendon elastic energy storage and recovery extends the functional range of muscles by uncoupling the pattern of muscle fiber shortening from the pattern of movement of the body. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Produced water is the largest volume waste stream in the exploration and production processes of oil and gas. During onshore oil recovery, the petroleum hydrocarbon/water mixture is processed through various separation units where the water extract is either discharged into above ground storage facilities, or re-injected into a subsurface formation as a permanent disposal/secondary recovery process. In offshore or coastal oil recovery operations, produced water is either discharged through shore side outfalls or coastal rim releases (within 4 miles from shore). In many cases, current disposal practices such as these have caused severe environmental petroleum hydrocarbon contamination to surface, ground and coastal waterways. Therefore, a research project was conducted to evaluate the performance of a field (continuous-flow) activated sludge treatment system for removing petroleum hydrocarbons from Southwestern US oilfield generated produced water. Petroleum hydrocarbon removal efficiencies were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis. The activated sludge treatment unit maintained a TPH removal efficiency of 98-99% at a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 days and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (MLSS) of 730 mg/l.

Recently, combination therapy including HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) has dramatically improved the long-term survival of HIV-infected patients. However, such therapy is associated with a lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by selective loss of sc fat from the face and extremities and, in some patients, accumulation of fat around the neck, dorsocervical region, abdomen, and trunk. Lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients (LDHIV) is associated with insulin resistance and its metabolic complications such as impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PIs appear to be the strongest link to LDHIV; however, fat loss has been reported in some patients taking non-PI antiretroviral drugs. Other factors, such as duration of HIV infection, age, and gender, may also contribute to the risk of development of LDHIV. The molecular basis of LDHIV remains unknown. There is no specific therapy for LDHIV. Avoiding weight gain by reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity may be beneficial in reducing fat accumulation as well as improving metabolic complications. Antihyperglycemic drugs may be used to treat diabetes. Management of dyslipidemia may require lipid-lowering drugs; however, the safety and efficacy of such intervention require further studies. Substitution of PIs with other antiretroviral drugs can mitigate dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance, but whether reversal of lipodystrophy occurs remains unknown. Future research is needed to discover the biochemical and molecular markers of lipodystrophy in HIV patients and develop PIs or other antiretroviral agents that are free of metabolic toxicity.",,"antiretrovirus agent; atorvastatin; bezafibrate; efavirenz; estrogen; fenofibrate; fibric acid derivative; gemfibrozil; human growth hormone; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; hydroxyurea; indinavir; lamivudine; metformin; mevinolin; nandrolone; nelfinavir; nevirapine; nucleoside derivative; pravastatin; proteinase inhibitor; ritonavir; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; rosiglitazone; saquinavir; simvastatin; stavudine; testosterone; troglitazone; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; age; body fat; clinical trial; diabetes mellitus; diet therapy; differential diagnosis; disease duration; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyslipidemia; exercise; gender; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertriglyceridemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lactic acidosis; lipid storage; lipodystrophy; myopathy; nutritional status; prevalence; priority journal; review; risk factor; subcutaneous fat disorder; adipose tissue; body composition; chemically induced disorder; glucose intolerance; highly active antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; insulin resistance; lipodystrophy; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Adipose Tissue; Age Factors; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Body Composition; Diagnosis, Differential; Glucose Intolerance; HIV Infections; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipodystrophy; Nutritional Status; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036833472

The article also evaluates the energetics of human and primate gestation and lactation using data from a variety of different populations living under different environmental circumstances. Energetics refers to energy intake and expenditure, and changes in body fat stores. Human and nonhuman primates have longer periods of gestation and lactation and slower prenatal and postnatal growth than other mammals of similar size. This reduces daily maternal energy costs. The development of sizable fat stores is not unique to humans, but fat stores are typically greater in human females and may play a greater role in reproduction. The strategies used to meet the energy costs of pregnancy vary among populations of humans and nonhuman primates and among humans interindividual variability is high. In pregnancy, some increase energy intake but others apparently do not. Increases in metabolic efficiency are evident in some human populations, whereas decreases in physical activity occur, but are not seen in all human or primate populations. Lactation is more energetically costly on a daily basis among humans and nonhuman primates, but has not been as well studied. It appears that both nonhuman and human primates tend to increase energy intake to meet in part the cost of lactation. They also use other strategies such as relying on body tissue stores, reductions in physical activity, and/or increases in metabolic efficiency to meet the remainder of the cost. It is also clear that human females in different populations and different women in the same population use a different combination of strategies to meet the cost of lactation. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"article; body fat; caloric intake; controlled study; energy cost; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; energy transfer; environment; evaluation; evolution; human; lactation; lipid storage; nonhuman; physical activity; placental mammals; population; postnatal growth; pregnancy; prenatal growth; primate; priority journal; reproduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Constitution; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Female; Hominidae; Humans; Lactation; Mammals; Models, Biological; Pregnancy; Eutheria; Mammalia; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036723679

This review summarizes old and recent data implicating insulin and leptin as key circulating signals to the central nervous system, particularly the ventral hypothalamus, in communicating the size and the distribution of body fat stores. This input ultimately alters food intake and energy expenditure to maintain constancy of the adipose depot. The key primary neurons in the arcuate nucleus containing NPY/AgRP and POMC/CART appear be critical constituents of the CNS regulating system, and are shown to contribute to anabolic and catabolic signaling systems to complete the feedback loop. New data to indicate shared intracellular signaling from leptin and insulin is provided. The satiety system for meals, consisting of neural afferents to the hindbrain from the gastrointestinal tract, is described and its effectiveness is shown to vary with the strength of the insulin and leptin signals.

Summary Background Data: The purpose of this study was to 1) determine whether REE is associated with clinical outcomes and 2) determine whether an optimal caloric delivery rate based on REE exists to offset erosion of lean mass after burn. Methods: From 1995 to 2001, REE was measured by indirect calorimetry in 250 survivors of 10 to 99%TBSA burns. Caloric intake and REE were correlated with muscle protein catabolism, length of stay, ventilator dependence, sepsis, and mortality. From 1998 to 2000, 42 patients (>60%TBSA burns) received continuous enteral nutrition at a spectrum of caloric balance between 1.0x REE kcal/d -1.8x REE kcal/d. Serial body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lean mass, fat mass, morbidity, and mortality were determined. Results: REE/predicted basal metabolic rate correlated directly with burn size, sepsis, ventilator dependence, and muscle protein catabolism (P < .05). Declining REE correlated with mortality (P < .05). 2) Erosion of lean body mass was not attenuated by increased caloric balance, however, fat mass increased with caloric supply (P < .05). Conclusion: In surviving burned patients, caloric delivery beyond 1.2 × REE results in increased fat mass without changes in lean body mass. Declining energy expenditure appears to be a harbinger of mortality in severely burned patients.",,"adolescent; adult; article; assisted ventilation; body mass; burn; caloric intake; calorimetry; child; controlled study; energy expenditure; fat intake; female; human; infant; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; metabolic rate; outcomes research; priority journal; protein degradation; sepsis; survival rate; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Burns; Calorimetry; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Enteral Nutrition; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Models, Theoretical; Muscle Proteins; Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036144122

Whereas the wheel spin rates of the conventional CMGs are constant, the VSCMGs are allowed to have variable speeds. Therefore, VSCMGs have extra degrees of freedom and can be used to achieve additional objectives, such as energy storage, as well as attitude control. We use VSCMGs in conjunction with an IPACS system. The gimbal rates of the VSCMGs are used to provide the reference-tracking torques, whereas the wheel accelerations are used for both attitude and power reference tracking. The latter objective is achieved by storing or releasing the kinetic energy in the wheels. The control algorithms perform both the attitude and power tracking goals simultaneously. A model-based control and an indirect adaptive control for a spacecraft with uncertain inertia properties are developed. Moreover, control laws for equalization of the wheel speeds are also proposed. Wheel speed equalization distributes evenly the kinetic energy among the wheels, minimizing the possibility of wheel speed saturation and the occurrence of zero-speed singularities. Finally, a numerical example for a satellite in a low Earth, near-polar orbit is provided to test the proposed IPACS algorithm.",,"Algorithms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Gyroscopes; Kinetic energy; Orbits; Satellites; Spacecraft; Power tracking; Control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036856834

Since the metal alloy waste packages are a primary engineered barrier. they must retain high corrosion resistance for an unprecedented time period.

Properties measured were cyclic capacity, charging and discharging rates, thermal effects, gaseous impurities, volume changes, low temperature plateau pressures and detailed isothermal desorption kinetics over the temperature range 23-180°C. Two materials were evaluated, one mechanically milled with the liquid alkoxides Ti(OBu n) 4 and Zr(OPr i) 4 and one milled with dry TiCl 3 as catalyst precursors. The alkoxide-catalyzed materials had low reversible capacities and released significant levels of hydrocarbon impurities during H 2 discharge. These problems were virtually eliminated with the inorganic TiCl 3 catalyst precursor. The NaAlH 4 and Na 3AlH 6 decomposition kinetics of TiCl 3-catalyzed Na-alanate conform to Arrhenius behavior with activation energies of 79.5 and 97 kJ/mol H 2, respectively. Measured absorption and desorption kinetics were surprisingly good and it is shown that 3-4.5 wt.% H 2 can be stored and recovered in reasonable times at 100-125°C.

To evaluate metabolic fluxes during embryo development, we have established conditions for stable isotope labeling of cultured embryos under steady-state conditions. Sucrose supplied via the endosperm is considered to be the main carbon and energy source for seed metabolism. However, in addition to 220 to 270 mM carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), analysis of endosperm liquid revealed up to 70 mM amino acids as well as 6 to 15 mM malic acid. Therefore, a labeling approach with multiple carbon sources is a precondition to quantitatively reflect fluxes of central carbon metabolism in developing embryos. Mid-cotyledon stage B. napus embryos were dissected from plants and cultured for 15 d on a complex liquid medium containing 13C-labeled carbohydrates. The 13C enrichment of fatty acids and amino acids (after hydrolysis of the seed proteins) was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Analysis of 13C isotope isomers of labeled fatty acids and plastid-derived amino acids indicated that direct glycolysis provides at least 90% of precursors of plastid acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Unlabeled amino acids, when added to the growth medium, did not reduce incorporation of 13C label into plastid-formed fatty acids, but substantially diluted 13C label in seed protein. Approximately 30% of carbon in seed protein was derived from exogenous amino acids and as a consequence, the use of amino acids as a carbon source may have significant influence on the total carbon and energy balance in seed metabolism. 13C label in the terminal acetate units of C20 and C22 fatty acids that derive from cytosolic acetyl-CoA was also significantly diluted by unlabeled amino acids. We conclude that cytosolic acetyl-CoA has a more complex biogenetic origin than plastidic acetyl-CoA. Malic acid in the growth medium did not dilute 13C label incorporation into fatty acids or proteins and can be ruled out as a source of carbon for the major storage components of B. napus embryos.",,"Fluxes; Gas chromatography; Isotopes; Labeling; Lipids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Proteins; Sugar (sucrose); Biogenetic origin; Plants (botany); Brassica; Brassica napus; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036740911

This occurs through the ability of insulin to markedly stimulate both glucose uptake and lipogenesis. Conventional wisdom held that defects in fuel partitioning into adipocytes either because of increased adipose tissue mass and/or increased lipolysis and circulating free fatty acids resulted in dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance and perhaps diabetes. However, it has become increasingly apparent that loss of adipose tissue (lipodystrophies) in both animal models and humans also leads to metabolic disorders that result in severe states of insulin resistance and potential diabetes. These apparently opposite functions can be resolved by the establishment of adipocytes not only as a fuel storage depot but also as a critical endocrine organ that secretes a variety of signaling molecules into the circulation. Although the molecular function of these adipocyte-derived signals are poorly understood, they play a central role in the maintenance of energy homeostasis by regulating insulin secretion, insulin action, glucose and lipid metabolism, energy balance, host defense and reproduction. The diversity of these secretory factors include enzymes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipsin), growth factors [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6) and several other hormones involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism (leptin, Acrp30, resistin and acylation stimulation protein). Despite the large number of molecules secreted by adipocytes, our understanding of the pathways and mechanisms controlling intracellular trafficking and exocytosis in adipocytes is poorly understood. In this article, we will review the current knowledge of the trafficking and secretion processes that take place in adipocytes, focusing our attention on two of the best characterized adipokine molecules (leptin and adiponectin) and on one of the most intensively studied regulated membrane proteins, the GLUT4 glucose transporter.

Besides playing important roles in energy storage and supply, they often serve as essential biosynthetic precursors or structural elements needed to sustain all forms of life. A number of unusual sugars that have certain hydroxyl groups replaced by a hydrogen, an amino group, or an alkyl side chain play crucial roles in determining the biological activity of the parent natural products in bacterial lipopolysaccharides or secondary metabolite antibiotics. Recent investigation of the biosynthesis of these monosaccharides has led to the identification of the gene clusters whose protein products facilitate the unusual sugar formation from the ubiquitous NDP-glucose precursors. This review summarizes the mechanistic studies of a few enzymes crucial to the biosynthesis of C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 deoxysugars, the characterization and mutagenesis of nucleotidyl transferases that can recognize and couple structural analogs of their natural substrates and the identification of glycosyltransferases with promiscuous substrate specificity.

Overexpression of PTP1B protein has been observed in insulin-resistant states associated with obesity. Mice lacking a functional PTP1B gene exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and are resistant to weight gain. To investigate the role of PTP1B in adipose tissue from obese animals, hyperglycemic obese (ob/ob) mice were treated with PTP1B antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS-113715). A significant reduction in adiposity correlated with a decrease of PTP1B protein levels in fat. Antisense treatment also influenced the triglyceride content in adipocytes, correlating with a downregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in lipogenesis, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and their downstream targets spot14 and fatty acid synthase, as well as other adipogenic genes, lipoprotein lipase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In addition, an increase in insulin receptor substrate-2 protein and a differential regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit (p85α) isoforms expression were found in fat from antisense-treated animals, although increased insulin sensitivity measured by protein kinase B phosphorylation was not observed. These results demonstrate that PTP1B antisense treatment can modulate fat storage and lipogenesis in adipose tissue and might implicate PTP1B in the enlargement of adipocyte energy stores and development of obesity.",,"protein tyrosine phosphatase; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; enzyme regulation; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; insulin response; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; receptor down regulation; signal transduction; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036329620

Leptin receptors are expressed most abundantly in the brain but are also present in several peripheral tissues. The role of leptin in controlling energy homeostasis has thus far focused on brain receptors and neuroendocrine pathways that regulate feeding behaviour and sympathetic nervous system activity. This chapter focuses on mounting evidence that leptin's effects on energy balance are also mediated by direct peripheral actions on key metabolic organs such as skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas and adipose tissue. Strong evidence indicates that peripheral leptin receptors regulate cellular lipid balance, favouring β-oxidation over triacylglycerol storage. There are data to indicate that peripheral leptin also modulates glucose metabolism and insulin action; however, its precise role in controlling gluco-regulatory pathways remains uncertain and requires further investigation.","Adipose tissue; Energy balance; Glucose metabolism; Insulin signalling; Leptin; Lipid metabolism; Liver; Obesity; Pancreas; Skeletal muscle; Triacylglycerol; Type 2 diabetes; β-Oxidation","brain receptor; cholesterol; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; lipid; membrane lipid; triacylglycerol; cholesterol; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; lipid; adipose tissue; adrenergic activity; brain; cholesterol metabolism; disease model; energy; energy balance; energy metabolism; evidence based medicine; fatty acid oxidation; feeding behavior; food intake; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; homeostasis; hormone action; hormone deficiency; human; insulin release; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver; metabolic disorder; morbid obesity; morbidity; neuroendocrine system; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; review; skeletal muscle; transcription regulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036918878

Concurrently, tree care practices release carbon back to the atmosphere based on fossil-fuel emissions from maintenance equipment (e.g., chain saws, trucks, chippers). Management choices such as tree locations for energy conservation and tree disposal methods after removal also affect the net carbon effect of the urban forest. Different species, decomposition, energy conservation, and maintenance scenarios were evaluated to determine how these factors influence the net carbon impact of urban forests and their management. If carbon (via fossil-fuel combustion) is used to maintain vegetation structure and health, urban forest ecosystems eventually will become net emitters of carbon unless secondary carbon reductions (e.g., energy conservation) or limiting decomposition via long-term carbon storage (e.g., wood products, landfills) can be accomplished to offset the maintenance carbon emissions.

These responses may have important consequences for the earth system. In this study, we evaluated how vegetation distribution, carbon stocks and turnover, and water and energy exchange are related to environmental variation spanned by the network of the IGBP high latitude transects. While the most notable feature of the high latitude transects is that they generally span temperature gradients from southern to northern latitudes, there are substantial differences in temperature among the transects. Also, along each transect temperature co-varies with precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation, which are also variable among the transects. Both climate and disturbance interact to influence latitudinal patterns of vegetation and soil carbon storage among the transects, and vegetation distribution appears to interact with climate to determine exchanges of heat and moisture in high latitudes. Despite limitations imposed by the data we assembled, the analyses in this study have taken an important step toward clarifying the complexity of interactions among environmental variables, vegetation distribution, carbon stocks and turnover, and water and energy exchange in high latitude regions. This study reveals the need to conduct coordinated global change studies in high latitudes to further elucidate how interactions among climate, disturbance, and vegetation distribution influence carbon dynamics and water and energy exchange in high latitudes.","Boreal; Climate; Disturbance; Energy; Gradient; Tundra","carbon flux; climate change; energy flux; global change; latitude; phytogeography; water exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18644376212

Materials development to enhance NOx storage capacity and sulfur tolerance will be necessary for performance improvement. Progress in these areas will benefit from a more detailed understanding of the base metal oxide-precious metal surface chemistry involved in the trapping, release, and reduction of NOx. In this work, we have focused on the adsorption of NO and NO2 on in-situ evaporated thin films of barium oxide, the primary storage material in lean NOx traps, to accentuate the details of the trapping stage of NOx conversion using these systems. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to identify the species formed and their relative abundance following room-temperature adsorption. Annealing experiments were performed to follow changes in adsorbed species with temperature. For NO, our results are consistent with nitrites forming as a result of molecular adsorption. In the case of NO2, nitrates are favored at high exposure and appear to form via a nitrite intermediate. We propose that as coverage increases nitrates form via trimer formation involving two surface nitrites and an additional molecularly adsorbed NO2 resulting in a complex in which all nitrogen centers are nitratelike. In light of results presented, an alternative and more detailed interpretation of the mechanism of NOx trapping is offered, that accounts for the NOx storage capacity benefits resulting from NO oxidation over noble-metal sites.",,"Molecular conversion processes; Barium compounds; Binding energy; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Rate constants; Surface chemistry; Thermal effects; Thermodynamic stability; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037171464

One of the key prerequisites for effective and efficient embedded sensor systems is development of low cost, low overhead, high resilient fault-tolerance techniques. Cost sensitivity implies that traditional double and triple redundancies are not adequate solutions for embedded sensor systems due to their high cost and high energy-consumption. We address the problem of embedded sensor network fault-tolerance by proposing heterogeneous back-up scheme, where one type of resources is substituted with another. First we propose a broad spectrum of heterogeneous fault-tolerance techniques for sensor networks including the ones where communication and sensing are mutually backing up each other. Then, we focus our attention on two specific approaches where we back-up one type of sensors with another type of sensor. In the first, we assume faults that manifest through complete malfunctioning and in the second, we assume sensors where fault manifest through high level of error. Specifically, we introduce techniques that enable efficient multimodal sensor fusion in presence of faults and errors. For each technique, we present efficient algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on a set of benchmark examples.","Fault tolerance; Heterogeneous redundancy; Multimodal sensor fusion; Wireless sensor networks","Actuators; Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer networks; Embedded systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Problem solving; Simulated annealing; VLSI circuits; Wireless telecommunication systems; Heterogeneous redundancy; Multimodal sensor fusion; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor data fusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542271016

Up to now, there have been conflicting results on how correlated the levels of these two quantities are. Given that expression and abundance data are significantly more complex and noisy than the underlying genomic sequence information, it is reasonable to simplify and average them in terms of broad proteomic categories and features (e.g. functions or secondary structures), for understanding their relationship. Furthermore, it will be essential to integrate, within a common framework, the results of many varied experiments by different investigators. This will allow one to survey the characteristics of highly expressed genes and proteins. Results: To this end, we outline a formalism for merging and scaling many different gene expression and protein abundance data sets into a comprehensive reference set, and we develop an approach for analyzing this in terms of broad categories, such as composition, function, structure and localization. As the various experiments are not always done using the same set of genes, sampling bias becomes a central issue, and our formalism is designed to explicitly show this and correct for it. We apply our formalism to the currently available gene expression and protein abundance data for yeast. Overall, we found substantial agreement between gene expression and protein abundance, in terms of the enrichment of structural and functional categories. This agreement, which was considerably greater than the simple correlation between these quantities for individual genes, reflects the way broad categories collect many individual measurements into simple, robust averages. In particular, we found that in comparison to the population of genes in the yeast genome, the cellular populations of transcripts and proteins (weighted by their respective abundances, the transcriptome and what we dub the translatome) were both enriched in: (i) the small amino acids Val, Gly, and Ala; (ii) low molecular weight proteins; (iii) helices and sheets relative to coils; (iv) cytoplasmic proteins relative to nuclear ones; and (v) proteins involved in 'protein synthesis,' 'cell structure,' and 'energy production'.",,"alanine; cytoplasm protein; glycine; membrane protein; messenger RNA; nuclear protein; valine; protein; article; averaging; cell population; cell structure; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; energy yield; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genome analysis; information processing; molecular weight; nonhuman; plots and curves; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein localization; protein secondary structure; protein synthesis; protein tertiary structure; proteomics; yeast; algorithm; chemistry; classification; comparative study; data base; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetic transcription; genetics; genome; information retrieval; metabolism; methodology; nucleic acid database; open reading frame; protein database; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Database Management Systems; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Information Storage and Retrieval; Open Reading Frames; Proteins; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Transcription, Genetic; Yeasts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035999672

Developing seeds store minerals in three locations: in the protein storage vacuoles of the embryo, and transiently in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vacuolar compartments of the chalazal endosperm. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and enzyme treatments suggest that the minerals are stored as phytic acid (myoinositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) salts in all three compartments, although they differ in cation composition. Whereas embryo globoids contain Mg, K, and Ca as cations, the chalazal ER deposits show high levels of Mn, and the chalazal vacuolar deposits show high levels of Zn. The appearance of the first Zn-phytate crystals coincides with the formation of network-like extensions of the chalazal vacuoles. The core of these networks consists of a branched network of tubular ER membranes, which are separated from the delineating tonoplast membranes by a layer of cytosolic material. Degradation of the networks starts with the loss of the cytosol and is followed by the retraction of the ER, generating a network of collapsed tonoplast membranes that are resorbed. Studies of fertilized fis2 seeds, which hyperaccumulate Zn-phytate crystals in the chalazal vacuolar compartments, suggest that only the intact network is active in mineral sequestration. Mineral determination analysis and structural observations showed that Zn and Mn are mobilized from the endosperm to the embryo at different developmental stages. Thus, Zn appears to be removed from the endosperm at the late globular stage, and Mn stores appear to be removed at the late bent-cotyledon stage of embryo development. The disappearance of the Mn-phytate from the endosperm coincides with the accumulation of two major Mn binding proteins in the embryo, the 33-kD protein from the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II and the Mn superoxide dismutase. The possible functions of transient heavy metal storage in the chalazal endosperm are discussed. A model showing how phytic acid, a potentially cytotoxic molecule, is transported from its site of synthesis, the ER, to the different mineral storage sites is presented.",,"Biological membranes; Crystals; Enzymes; Minerals; Positive ions; X ray spectroscopy; Vacuoles; Seed; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; metal; phytic acid; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis; article; cell vacuole; electron microscopy; endoplasmic reticulum; freezing; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; ultrastructure; Arabidopsis; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Freezing; Metals; Microscopy, Electron; Phytic Acid; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Vacuoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035983844

Fifth-instars, that had been determined to be the most heat resistant life stage for navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella [Walker]) using a heating block system, were selected as the targeted insect in the protocol development. RF heating to 55°C and holding in hot air for at least 5 min resulted in 100% mortality of the fifth-instar navel orangeworm. Rancidity, sensory qualities and shell characteristics were not affected by the treatments. The process slightly reduced the moisture content of the walnut kernels, which could prove an additional benefit by providing even nut moisture content and reducing the growth of microorganisms. If this method can be economically integrated into the handling process, it should have excellent potential as a disinfestation method for in-shell walnuts. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we apply basic chemical engineering principles to gain insight into the factors that limit performance in each component of a fuel processor. A system consisting of a plate reactor steam reformer, water-gas shift unit, and preferential oxidation reactor is used as a case study. It is found that for a steam reformer based on catalyst-coated foils, mass transfer from the bulk gas to the catalyst surface is the limiting process. The water-gas shift reactor is expected to be the largest component of the fuel processor and is limited by intrinsic catalyst activity, while a successful preferential oxidation unit depends on strict temperature control in order to minimize parasitic hydrogen oxidation. This stepwise approach of sequentially eliminating rate-limiting processes can be used to identify possible means of performance enhancement in a broad range of applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In practice, this process is applied in many different ways depending on the electrical services sought and the specific site conditions. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of hydroelectric projects, each providing different types of services and generating environmental and social impacts of different nature and magnitude. This article illustrates the necessity to evaluate each hydroelectric project in relation to the services it provides and to compare electricity supply projects on the basis of equivalent services provided to society. The impoundment and presence of a reservoir stand out as the most significant sources of impacts. However, a reservoir also provides the highest level of electricity supply services: it is the most efficient means of storing large amounts of energy and a hydroelectric plant has the capacity of releasing this energy in quantities that can be adjusted instantly to electricity demand. Furthermore, a reservoir allows for many other uses besides energy storage such as the cost-effective development of run-of-river plants downstream with little environmental impacts. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study examined the effects of obesity on lipid and CHO oxidation during exercise. Research Methods and Procedures: Seven obese and seven lean [body mass index (BMI), 33 ± 0.8 and 23.7 ± 1.2 kg/m2, respectively] sedentary, middle-aged men matched for aerobic capacity performed 60 minutes of cycle exercise at similar relative (50% Vo2max) and absolute exercise intensities. Results: Obese men derived a greater proportion of their energy from fatty-acid oxidation than lean men (43 ± 5% 31 ± 2%; p = 0.02). Plasma fatty-acid oxidation determined from recovery of infused [0.15 μmol/kg fat-free mass (FFM) per minute] [1-13C]-palmitate in breath CO2 was similar for obese and lean men (8.4 ± 1.1 and 29 ± 15 μmol/kg FFM per minute). Nonplasma fatty-acid oxidation, presumably, from intramuscular sources, was 50% higher in obese men than in lean men (10.0 ± 0.6 versus 6.6 ± 0.8 μmol/kg FFM per minute; p &lt; 0.05). Systemic glucose disposal was similar in lean and obese groups (33 ± 8 and 29 ± 15 μmol/kg FFM per minute). However, the estimated rate of glycogen-oxidation was 50% lower in obese than in lean men (61 ± 12 versus 90 ± 6 μmol/kg FFM per minute; p &lt; 0.05). Discussion: During moderate exercise, obese sedentary men have increased rates of fatty-acid oxidation from nonplasma sources and reduced rates of CHO oxidation, particularly muscle glycogen, compared with lean sedentary men.","Fatty acids; Glycogen; Skeletal muscle; Triglyceride","carbon; diagnostic agent; fatty acid; glycogen; insulin; noradrenalin; palmitic acid; adult; article; blood; body mass; breath analysis; energy metabolism; exercise; glucose blood level; human; kinetics; male; metabolism; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen consumption; skeletal muscle; Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Breath Tests; Carbon Isotopes; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Fatty Acids; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycogen; Humans; Insulin; Kinetics; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Norepinephrine; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen Consumption; Palmitic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036634086

The approach is based in part on an equivalent circuit comprising a resistor element in series with a parallel resistor-capacitor combination. Additional features include self-discharge, current inefficiency, temperature and state-of-charge (SOC) dependencies, and mass-transport limitations. An energy balance is coupled to the electrochemical problem; the energy balance incorporates transient heat-transfer to the battery surroundings as well as reversible and irreversible heat generation. The high-frequency and pseudo-steady-state impedance exhibit an Arrhenius temperature dependence. All the model parameters are constants or are described by continuous functions of temperature and SOC. Calculated results from the coupled electrochemical and thermal model are compared with charge and discharge experiments conducted over the time scales and current magnitudes of interest for electric-vehicle applications.

The mole percents of POSS-1 in these two composites are low (&lt;0.5 and &lt;1%, respectively) due to the high mass of POSS-1 (mwt = 1305). VE composites of two non-functional POSS-3 (octaisobutyl POSS) and POSS-4 (dodecaphenyl POSS) derivatives were also prepared with 95/5 w/w compositions. Additionally, POSS-1 was also incorporated into styrene copolymers at levels of 5 wt% (0.42 mol%) and 10 wt% (0.88 mol%) of POSS-1. The composites and copolymers were characterized by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and mechanical testing. The POSS-1 units incorporated into the vinyl ester network were well dispersed. No phase-separation in the VE/POSS-1 90/10 composite could be detected by TEM from low to 8 × 105 magnification. In VE composites containing 10 wt% POSS-1, silicon-rich phases were observed ranging in size from a few nm to ∼75 nm by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). TEM, EDXS, EELS and extraction studies suggest that some POSS-1-rich nanoparticles in the VE/POSS-1 90/10 composite are present and also a fraction of the POSS-1 is molecularly dispersed within the VE resin. The POSS-1-rich dispersed phase portion is cross-linked, insoluble and contains some VE. VE/POSS-3 and VE/POSS-4 composites exhibited larger-sized POSS phases which do not contain VE. Incorporating low mole percentages of POSS-1 into the VE network by chemical bonds or blending non-functional POSS-3 or 4 into VE resin have almost no influence on Tg or on the width of the tan δ peak in the glass transition range. POSS-1-styrene copolymers exhibit good miscibility at 5 wt% POSS-1 but serious phase-separation occurs in the copolymer with 10 wt% POSS-1 content. POSS-1-styrene copolymers swelled but did not dissolve in tetrahydrofuran (THF) demonstrating they had been cross-linked by POSS-1. No POSS-1 was extracted into the THF. The POSS-1-styrene copolymers have higher Tg values versus pure polystyrene (PS) prepared at the same conditions. The Tg elevation could be due to the cross-linking resulting from the four β-substituted styryl functions in POSS-1 and due to the effect of high molecular weight POSS units retarding segmental motion of a portion of the chain segments. The Tg of the 10 wt% POSS-1 copolymer is almost the same as that of the 5 wt% POSS-1 copolymer because the continuous phase in the 10 wt% POSS-1 copolymer might have a cross-linking density similar to that of the 5 wt% POSS-1 copolymer. The low POSS-1 mole percentage means that many all-styrene segments exist that can undergo segmental motion without being retarded by POSS. The tan δ peak for 10 wt% POSS-1 copolymer is much broader and less intense than that for PS or 5 wt% POSS-1 copolymer. A higher average cross-linking density and much less segmental motion in the dispersed POSS-1-rich phase account for this behavior in the 10 wt% copolymer. The bending storage modulus, E′, values of the VE/POSS-1 composites and the POSS-1-styrene copolymers are higher than those of either the neat vinyl ester resin or pure PS, respectively, over entire temperature range, especially at the low POSS-1 content (5 wt%). The incorporation of multifunctional POSS-1 into vinyl ester or PS by chemical bonding improves the thermal dimensional stabilities. The flexural modulus of the vinyl ester resin is raised by incorporation of POSS-1 while the flexural strengths are lowered. VE resin and VE/POSS-1 composites gave negligible weight gains after 50 days in toluene. The VE and composite samples cracked and fragmented after submersion in THF. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Mechanical property; Multifunctional polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane/vinyl ester nanocomposite; Viscoelastic property","Chemical bonds; Crosslinking; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Esters; Nanostructured materials; Oligomers; Phase separation; Thermoanalysis; Viscoelasticity; Nanoparticles; Copolymers; copolymer; polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane; polystyrene; resin; styrene derivative; tetrahydrofuran; unclassified drug; vinyl derivative; vinyl ester; article; chemical bond; cross linking; electron energy loss spectroscopy; molecular weight; phase separation; thermal analysis; thermostability; transmission electron microscopy; viscoelasticity; copolymer; mechanical property; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037161970

While hardware-based techniques require extra logic to keep track of memory references and make decisions about future mode transitions, compiler-directed schemes can only work on a single application at a time and demand sophisticated program analysis support, In this work, we present an operating system (OS) based solution where the OS scheduler directs the power mode transitions by keeping track of module accesses for each process in the system. This global view combined with the flexibility of a software approach brings large energy savings at no extra hardware cost. Our implementation using a full-fledged OS shows that the proposed technique is also very robust when different system and workload parameters are modified, and provides the first set of experimental results for memory energy optimization with a multi-programmed workload on a real platform. The proposed technique is applicable to both embedded systems and high-end computing platforms.","DRAM; Energy Estimation; Energy Management; Operating Systems; Scheduler","Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Embedded systems; Energy management; Estimation; Power electronics; Scheduling; Energy estimation; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036049630

We utilize the concept of Gated-Ground (NMOS transistor inserted between Ground line and SRAM cell) to achieve reduction in leakage energy without significantly affecting performance. Experimental results on gated-Ground caches show that data is retained (DRG-Cache) even if the memory are put in the stand-by mode of operation. Data is restored when the gated-Ground transistor is turned on. Turning off the gated-Ground transistor in turn gives large reduction in leakage power. This technique requires no extra circuitry; row decoder itself can be used to control the gated-Ground transistor. The technique is applicable to data and instruction caches as well as different levels of cache hierarchy such as the L1, L2, or L3 caches. We fabricated a test chip in TSMC 0.25 μ technology to show the data retention capability and the cell stability of DRG-cache. Our simulation results on 100 nm and 70 nm processes (Berkeley Predictive Technology Model) show 16.5% and 27% reduction in consumed energy in L1 cache and 50% and 47% reduction in L2 cache with less than 5% impact on execution time and within 4% increase in area overhead.","Gated-ground; Low leakage cache; SRAM","Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Leakage currents; Microprocessor chips; Static random access storage; Threshold voltage; Transistors; Gated-ground cache; Gated-ground transistors; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036051046

The field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research. The ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global positioning system (GPS), Flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high 'data homing' success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for ZebraNet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.

The ways that fluctuations in prey abundance and weather conditions can affect reproductive output in a 'capital breeding' ectotherm, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis) were examined. 2. Our longitudinal study confirms that female aspic vipers adjust reproductive investment by integrating allocations of energy from stores ('capital') and facultative feeding ('income'). Thus, long-term energy storage enabled females to reproduce successfully even in years when prey were scarce. 3. Not surprisingly, temporal changes in body reserves of female vipers preparing for reproduction depended upon current feeding rates. However, the mean environmental temperature during the active season also affected mass gain. 4. Allometric patterns suggest that reproductive output was limited by energy availability in 8 out of the 9 years of our study. In the other year, high prey availability in the preceding season meant that reproductive output was maximized within the constraints set by maternal body size (and thus, abdominal volume). 5. High summer temperatures increased basking opportunities of gravid vipers and thus accelerated gestation. However, maternal metabolic costs also increased in such situations, resulting in low postpartum body condition.","Capital breeding; Ectothermy; Environmental fluctuations; Food availability; Temperature","ectothermy; food availability; reproductive effort; resource allocation; snake; temperature; Amphibia; Reptilia; Serpentes; Vertebrata; Vipera aspis; Viperinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036114425

We showed previously that in the presence of ferrous iron recombinant yeast frataxin (mYfh1p) assembles into a regular multimer of ∼1.1 MDa storing ∼3000 iron atoms. Here, we further demonstrate that mYfh1p and iron form a stable hydrophilic complex that can be detected by either protein or iron staining on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and by either interference or absorbance measurements at sedimentation equilibrium. The molecular mass of this complex has been refined to 840 kDa corresponding to 48 protein subunits and 2400 iron atoms. Solution density measurements have determined a partial specific volume of 0.58 cm3/g, consistent with the amino acid composition of mYfh1p and the presence of 50 Fe-O equivalents per subunit. By dynamic light scattering, we show that the complex has a radius of ∼11 nm and assembles within 2 min at 30 °C when ferrous iron, not ferric iron or other divalent cations, is added to mYfh1p monomer at pH between 6 and 8. Iron-rich granules with diameter of 2-4 nm are detected in the complex by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

An understanding of the mechanisms by which bulk decomposition and reformation of the compound can occur in the presence of a surface catalyst is important to improving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of alanates for use in hydrogen storage applications. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), we have examined the microstructure and elemental composition of Na alanate samples, doped using a liquid Ti/Zr catalyst precursor, for a number of conditions. First, microscopy and compositional analyses were performed at different stages of the decomposition process within the first desorption cycle. Second, the material was characterized after multiple absorption/desorption cycles (five cycles). Finally, the effects of the catalyst doping procedure on particle size, surface morphology and surface composition were examined. Significant changes in particle morphology and in elemental distribution were found to be induced by the desorption and cycling processes. Importantly, our measurements indicate that the initial dehydriding reactions were accompanied by significant enhancement of Al concentration toward the surface of particles and that elemental segregation occurred with repeated absorption/desorption cycles. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Complex hydride; Electron microscopy; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydride; Na3AlH6; NaAlH4","Hydrogen storage; Catalysts; Crystal microstructure; Decomposition; Dehydration; Desorption; Doping (additives); Electron microscopy; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Gas absorption; Hydrogen; Rate constants; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface topography; Thermodynamic properties; Sodium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037122538

These enzymes include ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (G3PA). Acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is important to synthesize fatty acids into triglycerides. Two DGATs from different gene families have recently been identified. In the current study, we report that glucose preferentially enhances DGAT1 mRNA expression, whereas insulin specifically increases the level of DGAT2 mRNA. Treatment of adipocytes with glucose and insulin together results in higher DGAT activity in the membrane than cells treated with either of the agents alone, indicating that glucose and insulin have additive effect on DGAT activation. In mice treated with fast/refeeding protocol, DGAT2 mRNA decreased upon fasting and was replenished upon refeeding in adipose tissue and liver. This pattern of change was not observed for DGAT1. Inasmuch as DGAT1 mRNA is less abundant in liver, we suggest that DGAT1 is more involved in fat absorption in the intestine and in basal level triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue where it is more highly expressed. In contrast, DGAT2 is more likely to play important roles in assembly of de novo synthesized fatty acids into VLDL particles in the liver. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Regretfully, the comparative biomechanical analysis of energy storage and return and conventional prosthetic feet is rarely a motivation to either the technical development or clinical prescription of such devices. The development and prescription of prosthetic feet without supportive scientific evidence is likely due to the conflicting or non-significant results often presented in the scientific literature. Despite the sizeable history of comparative prosthetic literature and continued analysis of prosthetic components, the link between clinical experience and scientific evidence remains largely unexplored. A review of the comparative analysis literature evaluating energy storage and return and conventional prosthetic feet is presented to illustrate consistencies between the perceptive assessments and the objective biomechanical data. Results suggest that while experimental methodologies may limit the statistical significance of objective gait analysis results, consistent trends in temporal, kinetic, and kinematic parameters correlate well with perceptive impressions of these feet. These correlations provide insight to subtle changes in gait parameters that are deemed neither clinically nor statistically significant, yet are perceived by amputees to affect their preference for and performance of prosthetic feet during locomotion. Acknowledging and targeting areas of perceptive significance will help researchers develop more structured protocols for energy storage and return prosthesis evaluation as well as provide clinicians with information needed to enhance the appropriateness of their clinical recommendations. Expanding test environments to measure activities of perceived improvement such as high-velocity motions, stair ascent/descent, and uneven ground locomotion will provide a more appropriate assessment of the conditions for which energy storage and return prosthetic feet were designed. Concentrating research to specific test populations by age or amputation etiologies can overcome statistical limitations imposed by small study samples. Finally, directing research toward the areas of gait adaptation, heel performance, and the temporal release of energy in energy storage and return feet may reinforce the selection and utilization of advanced prosthetic components. These enhancements to current biomechanical analyses may serve to reduce the boundaries of perceptive significance and provide clinicians, designers, and researchers with the supportive data needed to prescribe, design, and evaluate energy storage and return prosthetic feet. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Recent research advocates using ""resizable"" caches to exploit cache requirement variability in applications to reduce cache size and eliminate energy dissipation in the cache's unused sections with minimal impact on performance. Current proposals for resizable caches fundamentally vary in two design aspects: (1) cache organization, where one organization, referred to as selective-ways, varies the cache's set-associativity, while the other, referred to as selective-sets, varies the number of cache sets, and (2) resizing strategy, where one proposal statically sets the cache size prior to an application's execution, while the other allows for dynamic resizing both within and across applications. In this paper, we compare and contrast, for the first time, the proposed design choices for resizable caches, and evaluate the effectiveness of cache resizings in reducing the overall energy-delay in deep-submicron processors.

Conductivity measurements were carried out as a function of temperature (723-821 K) and oxygen partial pressure (pO2 = 10-3 - 1 atm). The results were compared to the properties of bulk oxide of similar composition. Both the nanocrystalline and the coarsened oxide exhibit mixed conduction where the prevailing contribution is electronic. However, the nanocrystalline oxide shows a higher ionic contribution due to the enhancement of anionic vacancy mobility, which is more than one order of magnitude higher. In contrast with pure ceria, the electronic conductivity and activation energy for diffusion is similar in both nanocrystalline and sintered material, which could explain the similar reduction behavior shown by high and low surface area samples.

It presents a rich historical discussion and original research on the conversion of nuclear materials into electrical power, which can then be harvested to make long-lasting, more energy efficient batteries. With this technology, power-matched supplies would last decades - even centuries - using safe, direct, long-life, stable, integrated electric power from the highest energy density source available. Polymers, Phosphors, and Voltaics for Radioisotope Microbatteries presents the state-of-the-art in interdisciplinary research in radiochemistry, tritium storage, semiconductor fabrication and characterization, nuclear battery fabrication and testing, integration into MEMS and other electronic devices, and much more. A key feature of this book is its discussion of construction materials for miniaturized radioisotope power supplies, since progress in nuclear battery technology depends on characterization of functionally radiation-stable components. Though substantial progress has been made to solve problems of using integrated radioisotope batteries for micro- and nanoelectronics, each author has provided an authoritative assessment and has indicated where development is needed. Research in this area has the potential to revolutionize the microelectronics industry by enabling MEMS and nanotechnology. Significant technological progress depends today on coordinated interdisciplinary research.

The process of selecting and fitting such devices is complicated, partly because of confusing literature on the topic. Gait analysis methods for measuring energy characteristics are often incomplete, leading to inconsistencies in the energy classifications of different products. These inconsistencies are part of the reason for the lack of universally accurate terminology in the field. Inaccurate terminology perpetuates misunderstanding. In this paper, important prosthetic energy concepts and methods for measuring energy characteristics are reviewed. Then a technically accurate nomenclature and a method of functional classification are proposed. This review and proposed classification scheme should help to alleviate confusion and should facilitate enhancement of the design, selection, and fitting of prosthetic limbs for amputee patients.","Gait analysis; Lower-limb amputee; Prosthetic feet","Artificial limbs; Gait analysis; Patient treatment; Prosthetics; Prosthetic devices; Patient rehabilitation; article; classification; device; energy metabolism; equipment design; gait; leg amputation; leg movement; methodology; nomenclature; priority journal; prosthesis; Amputees; Artificial Limbs; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Energy Transfer; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Fitting; Sensitivity and Specificity; Terminology; Tibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036208095

Sch., Piscataway, NJ 08854, United States","The leg tendons of certain avian species normally calcify. The gastrocnemius, or Achilles, tendon of the domestic turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, is one such example. Its structure and biomechanical properties have been studied to model the adaptive nature of this tendon to external forces, including the means by which mineral deposition occurs and the functional role mineralization may play in this tissue. Structurally, the distal rounded, thick gastrocnemius bifurcates into two smaller proximal segments that mineralize with time. Mineral deposition occurs at or near the bifurcation, proceeding in a distal-to-proximal direction along the segments toward caudal and medial muscle insertions of the bird hip. Mineral formation appears mediated first by extracellular matrix vesicles and later by type I collagen fibrils. Biomechanical analyses indicate lower tensile strength and moduli for the thick distal gastrocnemius compared to narrow, fan-shaped proximal segments. Tendon mineralization here appears to be strain-induced, the muscle forces causing matrix deformation leading conceptually to calcium binding through the exposure of charged groups on collagen, release of sequestered calcium by proteoglycans, and increased diffusion. Functionally, the mineralized tendons limit further tendon deformation, reduce tendon strain at a given stress, and provide greater load-bearing capacity to the tissue. They also serve as important and efficient elastic energy storage reservoirs, increasing the amount of stored elastic energy by preventing flexible type I collagen regions from stretching and preserving muscle energy during locomotion of the animals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, they are not unique models and, because of their mathematical structure, give equal weight to rate deviations at the low- and high-temperature regions. This makes them particularly useful for systems where what happens at low temperatures is of interest, as in spoilage of foods during storage, or where the effect is indeed exponential over a large temperature range, as in the case of viscosity. There are systems, however, whose activity is only noticeable above a certain temperature level. A notable example is microbial inactivation, for which these two classical models must be inadequate simply because cells and spores are not destroyed at ambient temperature. For such systems a model that identifies the temperature level at which the rate becomes significant is required. Such an alternative model is Y=1n{1+exp[c(T-Tc)]}m, where Y is the rate parameter in question (eg a reaction rate constant), Tc is the marker of the temperature range where the changes accelerate, and c and m are constants. (When m = 1, Y at T ≫ Tc is linear. When m ≠ 1, m is a measure of the curvature of Y at T ≫ Tc.) This model has at least a comparable fit to published rate-temperature relationships of browning and microbial inactivation as well as viscosity-temperature data previously described by the Arrhenius or WLF equation. This alternative log logistic model is not based on the assumption that there is a universal analogy between totally unrelated systems and simple chemical reactions, which is explicitly assumed when the Arrhenius equation is used, and it has no special reference temperature, as in the WLF equation, whose physical significance is not always clear. It is solely based on the actual behaviour of the examined system and not on any preconceived kinetics. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Browning; Energy of activation; Kinetics; Microbial inactivation; Oxidation; Temperature; Viscosity","food; kinetics; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037105493

This particular fuel cell system is intended for household stand-alone power generation. The inverter proposed has a nominal fuel cell input of 48 Vdc and is capable of two single phase 120 Vac outputs and one 240 Vac output. Different topology options are explored for the dc-dc converter and the inverter stages, and one combination is evaluated in detail. There is a clear topological choice for the dc-dc converter, but there are a couple of options that work well for the inverter stage. Different choices for energy storage also exist and a good alternative to batteries is presented. The chosen topology contains two modular units, which are supplemented with a set of ultracapacitors at the input for transient conditions.

We introduce metrics for comparing fine-grain dynamic deactivation techniques that include the effects of deactivation energy and startup latencies, as well as longterm leakage current. We present a new circuit-level technique for leakage current reduction, leakage-biased bitlines, that has low deactivation energy and fast wakeup times. We show how this technique can be applied at a fine grain within an active microprocessor, and how microarchitectural scheduling policies can improve its performance. Using leakage-biased bitlines to deactivate SRAM read paths within I-cache memories saves over 24% of leakage energy and 22% of total I-cache energy when using a 70 nm process. In the register file, fine-grained read port deactivation saves nearly 50% of leakage energy and 22% of total energy. Independently, turning off idle register file subbanks saves over 67% of leakage energy (57% total register file energy) with no loss in performance.",,"Cache memory; Microprocessor chips; Static random access storage; Transistors; Dynamically-deactivated fast transistors (DDFT); Leakage currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036292678

Size exclusion chromatography was used extensively for purification. The arrays have sufficient solubility in toluene or other solvents for routine handling. With increasing size, the intense near-UV Soret (S0→S2) absorption band broadens, splits, and red shifts due to inter-porphyrin exciton coupling. In contrast, the weaker visible bands (S0→S1 remain essentially unchanged in position or width in proceeding from the monomer all the way to the 21-mer; however, the molecular extinction coefficients of the visible bands scale with the number of porphyrins. Similarly, the one-electron oxidation potentials, of the porphyrins are virtually unchanged as the arrays get larger. These results are indicative of relatively weak (but significant) electronic coupling between ground states and between the photophysically relevant lowest-excited-singlet states of the diarylethyne-linked porphyrins; thus, the characteristic properties of the individual ufiits are retained as the architectures increase in complexity. Efficient excited-singlet-state energy transfer occurs among the Zn-porphyrins and ultimately to the sole Fb-porphyrin in each of the arrays, with the overall arrival time of energy at the trapping site increasing modestly with the number of Zn-porphyrins= 1 (45 ps), 2 (90 ps), 8 (105 ps), and 20 (220 ps). The overall energy-transfer efficiencies are 98%, 96%, 96%, and 92% in the same series. The ground-state hole-storage properties of the 21-mer (Zn20Fb) were examined. Bulk electrolysis indicates that 21 (or more) electrons can be removed from this array (e.g., one hole resides on each porphyrin) to yield a stable ""super-charged"" π-cation radical. Taken together, these results indicate that the convergent building-block synthesis approach affords dendrimeric multiporphyrin arrays with favorable properties for light-harvesting and hole storage.",,"porphyrin derivative; solvent; toluene; zinc; article; chemical reaction; chemical structure; electrolysis; electron; energy transfer; gel permeation chromatography; light; molecular size; oxidation; productivity; purification; reaction analysis; solubility; synthesis; ultraviolet spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036149464

The genes encoding these proteins are in essence the blueprints that we have inherited from our parents. However, what determines the way in which blueprints are interpreted is largely dictated by a collection of environmental factors. The nutrients we consume are among the most influential of these environmental factors. During the early stages of evolutionary development, nutrients functioned as primitive hormonal signals that allowed the early organisms to turn on pathways of synthesis or storage during periods of nutrient deprivation or excess. As single-cell organisms evolved into complex life forms, nutrients continued to be environmental factors that interacted with hormonal signals to govern the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell differentiation, and cell growth. Nutrients govern the tissue content and activity of different proteins by functioning as regulators of gene transcription, nuclear RNA processing, mRNA degradation, and mRNA translation, as well as functioning as posttranslational modifiers of proteins. One dietary constituent that has a strong influence on cell differentiation, growth, and metabolism is fat. The fatty acid component of dietary lipid not only influences hormonal signaling events by modifying membrane lipid composition, but fatty acids have a very strong direct influence on the molecular events that govern gene expression. In this review, we discuss the influence that (n-9), (n-6), and (n-3) fatty acids exert on gene expression in the liver and skeletal muscle and the impact this has on intra- and interorgan partitioning of metabolic fuels.","HUFA; Insulin resistance; Mediterranean diet; Obesity; Omega-3 fatty acids; Repartitioning agents","messenger RNA; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; transcription factor; cell differentiation; cell growth; conference paper; diet; energy metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genomics; human; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; nutrient; obesity; regulatory mechanism; RNA degradation; RNA processing; RNA translation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036291392

A new longevity gene, Indy (for I'm not deadyet), which doubles the average life span of flies without a loss of fertility or physical activity, was postulated to extend life by affecting intermediary metabolism. We report that functional studies in Xenopus oocytes show INDY is a metabolite transporter that mediates the high-affinity, disulfonic stilbene-sensitive flux of dicarboxylates and citrate across the plasma membrane by a mechanism that is not coupled to Na+, K+, or Cl-. Immunocytochemical studies localize INDY to the plasma membrane with most prominent expression in adult fat body, oenocytes, and the basolateral region of midgut cells and show that life-extending mutations in Indy reduce INDY expression. We conclude that INDY functions as a novel sodium-independent mechanism for transporting Krebs and citric acid cycle intermediates through the epithelium of the gut and across the plasma membranes of organs involved in intermediary metabolism and storage.

The lowest reported values (approximately 0.3 Wg-1) occur in tethered bees generating the minimum lift to support their body weight, free-flying 2-day old bees, winter bees, or bees flying at high air temperatures (45°C). The highest values (approximately 0.8 Wg-1) occur in foragers that are heavily loaded or flying in low-density air. In different studies, flight metabolic rate has increased, decreased, or remained constant with air temperature. Current research collectively suggests that this variation occurs because flight metabolic rates decrease at thorax temperatures above or below 38°C. At 30°C, approximately 30% of colonial energy is spent during typical foraging, so variation in flight metabolic rate can strongly affect colony-level energy balance. Higher air temperatures tend to increase colonial net gain rates, efficiencies and honey storage rates due to lower metabolic rates during flight and in the hive. Variation in flight metabolism has a clear genetic basis. Different genetic strains of honey bees often differ in flight metabolic rate, and these differences in flight physiology can be correlated with foraging effort, suggesting a possible pathway for selection effects on flight metabolism. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

A functional growth analysis was used to determine the duration of strict dependency on seed reserves for energy and nitrogen in three woody Bignoniaceae species (Tabebuia rosea DC., Challichlamys latifolia K. Schum. and Pithecoctenium crucigerum A. Gentry) which differed in cotyledon function (photosynthetic, semi-photosynthetic and storage) and shade tolerance (probability of seedling establishment and survival in the understorey). 2. Seedlings were raised from seeds in sand culture under combinations of three nitrogen levels (daily supply of nutrient solution containing 100, 10 and 0% of 2.6 mM N) and two irradiances (27 and 1% full sun). Time course of biomass, non-cotytedonous biomass and leaf area for 40 days post-germination were compared to identify when the external availability of nitrogen or light began to affect seedling growth. 3. Seedlings of all species became dependent on external energy supply earlier than they did on nitrogen supply. In all species seed nitrogen was sufficient to support positive seedling growth for 40 days in shade, but not in sun. 4. Tabebuia rosea with photosynthetic cotyledons responded to light availability earlier than more shade-tolerant species with storage cotyledons. Challichlamys latifolia, the most shade-tolerant species, had the highest nitrogen concentration in seeds and was the last to respond to external nitrogen availability. Thus seedlings of the most shade-tolerant species depended on seed reserves for the longest period for both energy and nitrogen. 5. Relative growth rate after seedlings initiated autotrophic growth was in a trade-off relationship with seedling survivorship in the understorey across the three species.

The mechanical power developed during single running steps was calculated from force-plate and high-speed video measurements as turkeys accelerated over a trackway. Steady-speed running steps and accelerations were compared to determine how turkeys alter their running mechanics from a low-power to a high-power gait. During maximal accelerations, turkeys eliminated two features of running mechanics that are characteristic of steady-speed running: (i) they produced purely propulsive horizontal ground reaction forces, with no braking forces, and (ii) they produced purely positive work during stance, with no decrease in the mechanical energy of the body during the step. The braking and propulsive forces ordinarily developed during steady-speed running are important for balance because they align the ground reaction force vector with the center of mass. Increases in acceleration in turkeys correlated with decreases in the angle of limb protraction at toe-down and increases in the angle of limb retraction at toe-off. These kinematic changes allow turkeys to maintain the alignment of the center of mass and ground reaction force vector during accelerations when large propulsive forces result in a forward-directed ground reaction force. During the highest accelerations, turkeys produced exclusively positive mechanical power. The measured power output during acceleration divided by the total hindlimb muscle mass yielded estimates of peak instantaneous power output in excess of 400 W kg-1 hindlimb muscle mass. This value exceeds estimates of peak instantaneous power output of turkey muscle fibers. The mean power developed during the entire stance phase increased from approximately zero during steady-speed runs to more than 150 W kg-1 muscle during the highest accelerations. The high power outputs observed during accelerations suggest that elastic energy storage and recovery may redistribute muscle power during acceleration. Elastic mechanisms may expand the functional range of muscle contractile elements in running animals by allowing muscles to vary their mechanical function from force-producing struts during steady-speed running to power-producing motors during acceleration.","Bird; Locomotion; Meleagris gallopavo; Muscle; Power; Running; Turkey; Work","acceleration; animal; article; biomechanics; body posture; elasticity; gait; hindlimb; locomotion; motor activity; physiology; regression analysis; running; skeletal muscle; turkey (bird); Acceleration; Animals; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Gait; Hindlimb; Locomotion; Motor Activity; Muscle, Skeletal; Posture; Regression Analysis; Running; Turkeys; Animalia; Aves; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036322861

Comparison of the hybrid approach with single power sources (either a battery or energy conversion device alone) shows that it offers several potential advantages including reduced size, increased flexibility, long lifetime and increased reliability. Such an approach is well suited to the expected duty cycles of remote microsensors. Realization of the advantages of a hybrid system depends on the availability of a battery with the required characteristics. Initial experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating microbatteries with the proper characteristics and the use of these batteries as part of a hybrid micropower supply.

The model is also used to investigate the effect of nonuniform distributions of salt in the electrolyte phase of the electrode in the context of dilute solution theory. We use the model to compare the performance of capacitors with electrodes made from different activated carbons and to investigate the effects of varying carbon content and discharge current density. Even at low discharge current density, concentration polarization in the electrodes results in underutilization of the electrodes' charge-storage capability, and thus decreased performance. Among various types of activated carbons, those with large micropore surface areas and low meso- and macropore surface areas are preferred because they give high double-layer capacitance and favor efficient packing of RuO2 nanoparticles, thus maximizing faradaic pseudocapacitance. Increasing the electrode carbon content decreases the delivered charge and energy density, but the reductions are not severe at moderate carbon content and high discharge current. This suggests the possibility of optimizing the carbon content to minimize cost while achieving acceptable discharge performance. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

Significant dynamic energy savings can be realized for adaptive storage structures such as caches, issue queues, and register files by disabling unnecessary storage resources. Prior studies have analyzed individual structures and their control. A common theme to these studies is exploration of the configuration space and use of system IPC as feedback to guide reconfiguration. However when multiple structures adapt in concert, the number of possible configurations increases dramatically, and assigning causal effects to IPC change becomes problematic. To overcome this issue, we introduce designs that are reconfigured solely on local behavior. We introduce a novel cache design that permits direct calculation of efficient configurations. For buffer and queue structures, limited histogramming permits precise resizing control. When applying these techniques we show energy savings of up to 70% on the individual structures, and savings averaging 30% overall for the portion of energy attributed to these structures with an average of 2.1% performance degradation. © 2002 IEEE.","Adaptive control; Cache storage; Computer science; Dynamic scheduling; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Microarchitecture; Microprocessors; Programmable control; Registers","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Computer science; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Parallel architectures; Adaptive Control; Dynamic scheduling; Micro architectures; Programmable controls; Registers; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948754628

Transgenic plants provide a potential means of producing this polymer cost-effectively. To date, however, few reports of the successful production of this polymer have been published, with the exception of work with transgenic Arabidopsis. Using a variety of chimeric constructs, we have determined that the constitutive, chloroplast-localized expression of one of the genes involved in PHB production - the β-ketothiolase (phbA) gene - is detrimental to the efficient production of transgenic PHB. The alternate use of either inducible or somatically activated promoters allowed the construction of transgenic PHB-producing potato (Solanum tuberosum) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, although the amount of PHB formed was still rather low. Taking advantage of an inducible promoter, the maximal amount of PHB produced in transgenic potato was 0.09 mg g-1 dry weight. In transgenic tobacco using a somatically activated promoter, up to 3.2 mg g-1 dry weight was accumulated. In Arabidopsis, the formation of high levels of PHB had previously been shown to be accompanied by severe negative effects on growth and development of the plant. Phasins are proteins known from PHB-producing bacteria speculated to serve as protectants against the highly hydrophobic surface of the PHB granules in the bacterial intracellular milieu. Co-expression of the phasin gene in parallel with the PHB synthesis genes, however, did not lead to reduced symptom development.",,"Bacteria; Cost effectiveness; Genes; Polymers; Proteins; Tobacco; Promoters; Plants (botany); Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta; Nicotiana; Nicotiana tabacum; Nicotiana tabacum; Solanum; Solanum tuberosum; Solanum tuberosum; acetyl coenzyme A acyltransferase; hybrid protein; hydroxybutyric acid; lectin; phasin; plant lectin; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; Arabidopsis; article; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; potato; promoter region; tobacco; transgenic plant; Acetyl-CoA C-Acyltransferase; Arabidopsis; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hydroxybutyrates; Lectins; Plant Lectins; Plants; Plants, Genetically Modified; Polyesters; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Solanum tuberosum; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036010654

In this paper we demonstrate how this frequent value phenomenon can be exploited in designing a cache that trades off performance with energy efficiency. We propose the design of the Frequent Value Cache (FVC) in which storing a frequent value requires few bits as they are stored in encoded form while all other values are stored in unencoded form using 32 bits. The data array is partitioned into two arrays such that if a frequent value is accessed only the first data array is accessed; otherwise an additional cycle is needed to access the second data array. Experiments with some of the SPEC95 benchmarks show that on an average a 64 Kb/64-value FVC provides 28.8% reduction in Ll cache energy and 3.38% increase in execution time delay over a conventional 64 Kb cache. © 2002 IEEE.","Batteries; Cache memory; Computer science; Delay effects; Encoding; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Mobile computing; Power engineering and energy; Process design","Buffer storage; Cache memory; Computer architecture; Computer science; Embedded systems; Encoding (symbols); Energy utilization; Mobile computing; Process design; Solar cells; Time delay; Additional cycles; Cache energy; Delay effects; Energy efficient; Frequent Value Cache; Frequent values; Memory access; Power engineering and energies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948961559

I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 °C, a constant 12 °C, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 °C. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 °C consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 °C individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 °C tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 °C. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 °C had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 °C tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 °C, although this trend was not statistically significant (p= 0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The power issue is one of the chief disadvantages of TCAMs over RAM based methods for forwarding. For a system using multiple TCAMs we present methods to significantly reduce TCAM power consumption for forwarding, making it comparable to RAM based forwarding solutions. Using our techniques one can use a TCAM for forwarding at 3 to 4 watts worst case. Our techniques also have an interesting connotation to TCAM forwarding rates. For a static distribution of requests we present methods that make the forwarding rate of a system proportional to the number of TCAMs. So if a system has four TCAMs, one could achieve a four fold performance of that of a single TCAM for a static distribution of requests. © 2002 IEEE.","Aggregates; Energy consumption; Partitioning algorithms; Random access memory; Throughput","Aggregates; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Static random access storage; Throughput; Emerging technologies; High power; Networking industries; Packet forwarding; Parallel structures; Partitioning algorithms; Random access memory; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865765205

We undertook a systematic survey for the genes that affect glycogen accumulation by taking advantage of the strain deletion set generated by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project. The strain collection analyzed contained some 4600 diploid homozygous null deletants, representing approximately 88% of all viable haploid disruptants. We identified 324 strains with low and 242 with elevated glycogen stores, accounting for 12.4% of the genes analyzed. The screen was validated by the identification of many of the genes known already to influence glycogen accumulation. Many of the mutants could be placed into coherent families. For example, 195 or 60% of the hypoaccumulators carry mutations linked to respiratory function, a class of mutants well known to be defective in glycogen storage. The second largest group consists of approximately 60 genes involved in vesicular trafficking and vacuolar function, including genes encoding 13 of 17 proteins involved in the structure or assembly of the vacuolar ATPase. These data are consistent with our recent findings that the process of autophagy has a significant impact on glycogen storage (Wang, Z., Wilson, W. A., Fujino, M. A., and Roach, P. J.

Biol. 21, 5742-5752). Autophagy delivers glycogen to the vacuole, and we propose that the impaired vacuolar function associated with ATPase mutants (vma10 or vma22) results in reduced degradation and subsequent hyperaccumulation of glycogen.",,"glycogen; proteome; active transport; article; cell vacuole; fungal gene; gene deletion; genetics; metabolism; mutation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Biological Transport, Active; Gene Deletion; Genes, Fungal; Glycogen; Mutation; Proteome; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Vacuoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036491627

Reported performance has improved dramatically, particularly in the past few years, due to changes in synthesis methods, better characterization and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms. These actuators are able to displace large loads (up to 100 × greater than mammalian skeletal muscle), with moderate displacements (typically 2 %), and with power to mass ratios similar to that of muscle, while powered using potentials of no more than a few volts. Unlike electric motors and muscle, these actuators exhibit a catch state, enabling them to maintain force without consuming energy. Despite the impressive performance, commercial applications are at an early stage. One reason is the need to carefully consider the details of the actuator construction, including the thickness and surface area of the polymer, the electrolyte conductivity and geometry, the counter electrode spacing, the shape of the input voltage and the means of electrical contact to the polymer, in designing effective actuators. A set of design guidelines is presented that assist the device designer in determining the optimum actuator configuration. These are derived from extensive characterization and modeling of hexafluorophosphate-doped polypyrrole actuators. The set of design tools helps transform conducting polymer actuators into engineering materials that can be selected and designed for particular applications based on rational criteria. Most of the underlying physical principles used in determining these rules also underlie other conducting polymer actuators, polymer devices such as electrochromic displays, supercapacitors and batteries, carbon nanotube actuators, and electrochemically driven devices that involve volumetric charge storage.","Actuator; Carbon nanotubes; Conducting polymer; Diffusion; Impedance; Model; Polypyrrole","Carbon nanotubes; Electric conductance; Electric contacts; Electric impedance; Electric potential; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy utilization; Polypyrroles; Conducting polymers; Actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036028329

It is up-regulated by leptin, and CART-derived peptides acutely inhibit food intake. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess the long-term effects of central CART administration on food intake, body weight, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, free fatty acids and triglycerides, and on fuel utilisation in normal and high-fat-fed obese rats. DESIGN: Normal and high-fat-fed obese rats were cannulated intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) and infused for 6 days with CART (55-102) or its vehicle. At day 4, animals were placed in an indirect calorimeter for a 24 h period during which the respiratory quotient and the energy expenditure were determined hourly. RESULTS: In both normal and obese animals, the chronic i.c.v. infusion of CART (55-102) had marked, sustained inhibitory effects on food intake and body weight gain that were accompanied by decreases in plasma insulin and leptin levels. Using indirect calorimetry, it was observed that CART infusion promoted an increase in lipid oxidation in normal and in obese animals, although this increase reached statistical significance only in the obese group. The hypothalamic CART mRNA expression was found to be higher in obese rats (displaying hyperleptinaemia) than in normal animals. CONCLUSION: The data together show that chronic i.c.v. CART infusion is effective in inhibiting food intake, favouring lipid oxidation and limiting fat storage, both in normal and high-fat-diet-induced obese rats. The CART pathway thus seems to be an important determinant of body weight homeostasis in normal animals as well as in a model of nutritionally induced obesity.","CART mRNA; Food intake; Fuel utilisation; Indirect calorimetry; Respiratory quotient (RQ)","cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide; cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide[50-102]; drug vehicle; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; leptin; lipid; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; calorimetry; controlled study; drug effect; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; food intake; gene expression; gene expression regulation; glucose blood level; hormone blood level; hypothalamus; lipid blood level; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; long term care; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; priority journal; rat; respiratory quotient; weight gain; Animals; Blood Glucose; Blotting, Northern; Body Weight; Calorimetry, Indirect; Circadian Rhythm; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Primers; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Gene Expression Regulation; Infusion Pumps, Implantable; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Obesity; Peptide Fragments; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Respiration; RNA, Messenger; Triglycerides; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047697803

With the increasing number of transistors, smaller feature sizes, lower supply and threshold voltages, the focus on energy optimization is shifting from dynamic to leakage energy. Leakage energy is of particular concern in dense cache memories that form a major portion of the transistor budget. In this work, we present several architectural techniques that exploit the data duplication across the different levels of cache hierarchy. Specifically, we employ both state-preserving (data-retaining) and state-destroying leakage control mechanisms to L2 subblocks when their data also exist in L1. Using a set of media and array-dominated applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques through cycle-accurate simulation. We also compare our schemes with the previously proposed cache decay policy. This comparison indicates that one of our schemes generates competitive results with cache decay. © 2002 IEEE.","Cache memory; Energy capture; Energy consumption; Energy management; Engineering profession; Integrated circuit technology; Power generation; Power supplies; Threshold voltage; Turning","Budget control; Buffer storage; Embedded systems; Energy management; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Parallel architectures; Power generation; Professional aspects; Threshold voltage; Turning; Cache hierarchies; Cycle-accurate simulation; Energy capture; Energy optimization; Engineering profession; High performance architectures; Integrated circuit technology; Power supply; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948762407

Its measurement is necessary for quality control, as well as for postharvest studies to develop procedures for preparation and handling of fresh-cut tomato slices. This study had two objectives, to determine how initial ripeness and cutting affect the textural changes in tomato tissue during storage and to develop a method for measuring textural attributes of tomato slices. Firmness and force relaxation characteristics were compared for tomato flesh harvested at six maturity stages and stored intact or as slices for 0-20 days. Measurements were made at three sites in the outer pericarp and three in columellar tissue on 7-mm thick transverse slices. Following loading, stress relaxation was recorded for 10 s. A 4-mm cylindrical probe provided more consistent firmness measurements (lower% CV) than a 6.4-mm spherical probe at harvest, and distances of 3 mm provided more consistent results than 1 mm. Therefore, stored tomato samples were tested only with the 4-mm cylindrical probe and distance of 3 mm. Fmax (maximum force) of freshly harvested tomatoes ranged from 15 to 2 N for mature green and red tomatoes, respectively. Fmax was closely related to loading energy (area), slope, and yield force; i.e. all four parameters measured elastic behavior. Fmax also was related (r2= 0.77-0.97) to forces at specific relaxation times. Tomatoes stored intact generally had lower CVs than those sliced before storage, although there was little difference in average firmness (Fmax) between the two at a given storage time for a given initial ripeness. A three-parameter model was developed to fit the relaxation curves: Y = 1 - A ln(1 + t) - Bt/(C + t) where t is relaxation time. There was little correlation between Fmax and the three relaxation parameters (r2 = 0-0.33), i.e. the relaxation parameters measured a different physical property, presumably viscoelasticity. The responses of the relaxation parameters over storage time were dependent on the initial maturity of the tomatoes; but values usually differed significantly between tomatoes stored intact or sliced, with tomatoes sliced before storage generally having higher values, which we interpret as having lower viscoelasticity.","Firmness; Force relaxation; Viscoelasticity","Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036156779

The key issue that will determine the feasibility of this approach is whether or not an autonomous robotic factory can be devised such that it is light enough to be transported to the moon, yet complete in its ability to self-replicate with no other inputs than those resources available on the lunar surface. Self-replication leads to exponential growth, and would allow as few as one initial factory to spawn lunar production of materials and energy on a massive scale. Such capacity would dramatically impact man's ability to explore and colonize space and collect solar energy for terrestrial applications. Our concept of a self-replicating robotic factory consists of four subsystems: 1) multifunctional robots for digging and transportation of materials, and assembly of components during the replication process; 2) materials refining and casting facility; 3) solar energy conversion, storage and transmission; and 4) electromagnetic rail guns for long-distance transportation (for example, for sending materials to low-earth orbit (LEO), or transporting replicated factories to distal points on the moon). Each of these subsystems is described in the context of current technologies, with an emphasis on 1). We build on previous concepts for self-replicating systems, present a simple prototype that demonstrates active mechanical replication, and develop an analytical model of how the proliferation of such systems on the lunar surface would occur.","Artificial life; Degenerate diffusion; Lunar resources; Moon; Proliferation; Robot; Rotation group; Self-replication","Earth (planet); Lunar surface analysis; Moon; Robotics; Self-replicating robots (SRR); Robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036977975

Furthermore, ADX rats drinking sucrose have normal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA throughout brain. In ADX rats without sucrose, all of these variables are abnormal. Systemic corticosterone (B) replacement also restores these variables in ADX rats to normal. To test whether B acts centrally, we infused B or saline intracerebroventricularly into ADX rats under basal conditions and after repeated restraint. Rats were exposed to no stress or 3 h/d restraint for 3 d. Body weights and food and fluid intakes were measured. Brains were analyzed using immunocytochemistry against glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and CRF. Intracerebroventricular B blocked the positive effects of sucrose on metabolism, increased basal ACTH concentrations, and augmented ACTH responses to restraint on d 3. B-infused rats exhibited nuclear GR staining in perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei, showing that infused B spreads effectively.

The elastic spring constant for elastic fibers was found to be strain-rate and age dependent, whereas that for collagen was only age dependent. Fibril lengths were observed to decrease with increased strain rates and age for both elastic and collagen fibers; however, the large decrease in collagen fibril viscosity was hypothesized to be a result of thixotropy that results when neighboring collagen fibrils slide by each other. It is concluded that the elastic spring constant measured for elastic fibers may be higher than previously reported and is consistent with stretching of α-helical segments of elastin into a more extended conformation during the initial part of the elastic stress-strain curve. The decrease in the elastic spring constant with increased age observed is consistent with disruption of the elastic fibers and loss of α-helical structure. The pH dependency of the elastic modulus reported previously for collagen suggests that charge-charge interactions within and between collagen molecules are involved in energy storage during stretching. Elastic energy storage is consistent with the stretching of charged pairs located in flexible regions of the collagen molecule. Shear thinning, or thixotropy of skin, is hypothesized to reflect breakage of bonds that occur between collagen fibrils. It is hypothesized that both collagen and elastin are complex macromolecules that are hybrids of flexible and rigid regions. The flexible regions reversibly store elastic energy during stretching by breakage of secondary bonds. After stretching, the flexible regions become extended and transfer stress to the rigid regions of these molecules. This prevents premature mechanical failure of collagen and elastic fibers in the dermis.","Collagen; Elastic tissue; Skin; Thixotropy; Viscoelasticity","Collagen; Conformations; Elastic moduli; Failure (mechanical); Macromolecules; pH; Strain rate; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Elastic energy storage; Elastic fibers; Elastic spring constant; Elastin; Human dermis; Stress strain measurement; Thixotropy; Skin; collagen; elastin; adult; dermis; elasticity; energy; hypothesis; senescence; skin; stress strain relationship; tensile strength; thixotropy; viscoelasticity; collagen; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037153007

ATP-dependent accumulation of glucosylated chlorsulfuron by vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from red beet (Beta vulgaris) storage root approximates Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is strongly inhibited by agents that collapse or prevent the formation of a transmembrane H+ gradient, but is completely insensitive to the phosphoryl transition state analog, vanadate. In contrast, ATP-dependent accumulation of the glutathione conjugate of a chlorsulfuron analog, chlorimuronethyl, is incompletely inhibited by agents that dissipate the transmembrane H+ gradient but completely abolished by vanadate. In both cases, however, conjugation is essential for net uptake because neither of the unconjugated parent compounds are accumulated under energized or nonenergized conditions. That the attachment of glucose to two naturally occurring phenylpropanoids, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid via aromatic hydroxyl groups, targets these compounds to the functional equivalent of the transporter responsible for chlorsulfuron-glucoside transport, confirms the general applicability of the H+ gradient dependence of glucoside uptake. It is concluded that H+ gradient-dependent, vanadate-insensitive glucoside uptake is mediated by an H+ antiporter, whereas vanadate-sensitive glutathione conjugate uptake is mediated by an ATP-binding cassette transporter. In so doing, it is established that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry affords a versatile high-sensitivity, high-fidelity technique for studies of the transport of complex organic molecules whose synthesis as radiolabeled derivatives is laborious and/or prohibitively expensive.",,"Adenosinetriphosphate; Biosynthesis; Glucose; Herbicides; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Molecular biology; Transmembranes; Plants (botany); Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036851184

A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure the stored energy, from which the dislocation density was estimated. The energy released during recrystallization in the DSC experiments was attributed primarily to the annihi?ation of dislocations with the energy contribution from recovery, deformation twins and point-defects estimated to be relatively small. The dislocation density in the 10 GPa shock-deformed materials first increased and then decreased with increasing Al content (decreasing SFE) while the dislocation density in the 35 GPa shock-deformed materials initially decreased and then remained constant with increasing Al content.

Some recent multi-bank memory architectures help reduce memory energy by allowing an unused bank to be placed into a low-power operating mode. This paper describes an automatic data migration strategy which dynamically places the arrays with temporal affinity into the same set of banks. This strategy increases the number of banks which can be put into low-power modes and allows the use of more aggressive energysaving modes. Experiments using several array-dominated applications show the usefulness of data migration and indicate that large energy savings can be achieved with low overhead.","Data Migration; Energy Consumption; Multi-Bank Memories","Computer architecture; Data transfer; Energy utilization; Storage allocation (computer); Data migration; Multi-bank memories; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036059441

Energy balance is regulated by a more complex neuroendocrine feedback loop. The hypothalamus integrates peripheral neural and hormonal afferent signals of satiety and energy reserve and directs neuroendocrine efferent arms to effect energy storage versus expenditure; however, in this feedback loop, the pituitary is not integral. Damage to this hypothalamic control system results in a syndrome of intractable weight gain. This syndrome of hypothalamic obesity is usually caused by cranial insult, such as brain trauma, tumor, surgery, or radiation. In some cases, however, it may have a congenital cause. The cause and pathogenesis of obesity in such subjects is akin to an animal model of obesity in which the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is destroyed or deafferented. The VMH-lesioned rat exhibits a vagally mediated potentiation of insulin secretion in response to glucose. Excess insulin secretion favors and promotes partitioning of energy substrate into fat, even with caloric restriction. Similarly, patients with hypothalamic obesity exhibit insulin hypersecretion. By suppressing insulin release at the β cell in a specific manner using the somatostatin agonist octreotide, the shunting of energy substrate to adipose is attenuated. Treated patients exhibit weight loss and improved quality of life, which correlate with insulin suppression. Thus, hypothalamic obesity is the sixth cranial endocrinopathy, with an identifiable cause, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.",,"glucose; insulin; octreotide; somatostatin derivative; abducens nerve; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; brain injury; brain surgery; brain tumor; caloric restriction; cell specificity; controlled study; correlation analysis; deafferentation; endocrine disease; energy resource; glucose metabolism; head injury; hormone release; human; human cell; human tissue; hypothalamus function disorder; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; insulin release; negative feedback; neuroendocrine disease; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; quality of life; radiation exposure; rat; review; satiety; syndrome delineation; weight gain; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036270001

We explored this trade-off by manipulating food availability for juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, so as to create the same reduction in growth and loss of energy reserves at different times of the year. The fish showed seasonal differences in their responses to the nutritional deficit when food was restored. In winter, fish restored lipid reserves, but their growth in length over the recovery period was negligible. In summer, fish allocated resources to growth in length as well as the restoration of lipid reserves; moreover, this skeletal growth was significantly faster than that of control fish that had received food ad libitum throughout. We demonstrate that current physiological and energetic models of animal growth cannot account for such seasonal variation in compensatory growth and allocation patterns, and the regulation of growth and energy reserves is a dynamic and state-dependent process. We then predict - on the basis of expected effects on fitness - how somatic allocation and catch-up growth should vary over time and in contrasting environments.","Atlantic salmon; Body size; Fat reserves; Growth; Salmo salar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042526799

Storage, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1107, United States","The deposition of layers is an effective way to improve the tribological performance of rough surfaces. The contact mechanics of layered rough surfaces needs to be studied to optimize layer parameters. Since 1995 a lot of progress has been made in the development of numerical contact models, which analyze the contact behavior of layered rough surfaces with no assumption concerning the roughness distribution as well as the effect of interfacial liquid film on the contact statistics. These models predict the contact pressure profile on the interface and contact statistics, namely fractional contact area, the maximum value of contact pressure, von Mises and principal tensile stresses, and relative meniscus force. The results allow the specification of layer properties to reduce friction, stiction, and wear of layered rough surfaces. A comprehensive review of these numerical contact models is presented here. Based on the formulation of contact problems, these models are classified into three categories: direct formulation, weighted residual formulation, and minimum total potential energy formulation. The numerical methods applied in these models include Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Boundary Element Method (BEM). Typical examples of layered rough surfaces of contact simulated by those models are presented. The examples contain data for various surface topographies, elastic and elastic-plastic material properties, normal and tangential loading conditions, and dry and wet interfaces. A 3D BEM model based on a variational principle is described in detail for its capability to analyze the layered rough surfaces of contact involving a large number of contact points. Applications of the model to magnetic storage devices and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) are presented.

With the continued scaling down of threshold voltages, the power consumed due to leaky memory cells in on-chip caches will constitute a significant portion of the processor's power budget. This work focuses on reducing the leakage energy consumed in the instruction cache using a compiler-directed approach. We present and analyze two compiler-based strategies termed as conservative and optimistic. The conservative approach does not put a cache line into a low leakage mode until it is certain that the current instruction in it is dead. On the other hand, the optimistic approach places a cache line in low leakage mode if it detects that the next access to the instruction will occur only after a long gap. We evaluate different optimization alternatives by combining the compiler strategies with state-preserving and state-destroying leakage control mechanisms. © 2002 IEEE.","Cache memory; Counting circuits; Energy consumption; Hip; Impedance; Leak detection; Microprocessors; Optimizing compilers; Threshold voltage; Voltage control","Budget control; Buffer storage; Computer architecture; Counting circuits; Electric impedance; Energy utilization; Hot isostatic pressing; Leak detection; Microprocessor chips; Program compilers; Threshold voltage; Voltage control; Conservative approaches; Instruction caches; Leakage control; Leakage energies; Leakage optimization; Optimistic approach; Optimizing compilers; Power consumed; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948993747

When given a correctly specified battery design technology for the required product application, the VRLA battery will offer the end-user, some, if not all, of the following characteristics: high current capability; good reliability under cyclic, deep-discharge conditions (cycle life); good power density; high recharge efficiency; rapid rechargeability; resistant to overcharge; good charge stability (resistant to thermal runaway); no addition of water (topping-up) during service life (maintenance-free); long service life; wide operating temperature; robust design; low cost per Wh; high volumetric energy density (Wh/l); low self-discharge; high gravimetric energy density (Wh kg-1); may be stored and used in any position (orientation); resistant to shock and vibration; no need to be recharged immediately after discharge and environmentally 'safe'. The most commonly used gelling agent, fumed silica, has many disadvantages such as, contamination of the local working environment, particularly during paste-mixing, and occupational hygiene and handling problems. It is also bulky to transport and has long gel times unless used at very high concentrations. There is, therefore, an increasing demand for an alternative gelling agent for sulfuric acid in the production of gelled-electrolyte (GEL) VRLA batteries. Silica sols can provide a solution to all of these problems, and moreover at a lower cost to the battery producer. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Gel electrolyte; Silica sols; Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries","Contamination; Electric energy storage; Electrolytes; Gravimetric analysis; Maintenance; Reliability; Silica; Sulfuric acid; Volumetric analysis; Battery design technologies; Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037197357

Results of previous studies suggest that the collagen molecule is made up of alternating rigid and flexible domains, and extension of the flexible domains is associated with elastic energy storage. In this study, we model the flexibility of the α1-chains found in types I-III collagen molecules and microfibrils in order to understand the molecular basis of elastic energy storage in collagen fibers by analysing the areas under conformational plots for dipeptide sequences. Results of stereochemical modeling suggest that the collagen triple helix is made up of rigid and flexible domains that alternate with periods that are multiples of three amino acid residues. The relative flexibility of dipeptide sequences found in the flexible regions is about a factor of five higher than that found for the flexibility of the rigid regions, and the flexibility of types II and III collagen molecules appears to be higher than that found for the type I collagen molecule. The different collagen α1-chains were compared by correlating the flexibilities. The results suggest that the flexibilities of the α1-chains of types I and III collagen are more closely related than the flexibilities of the α1-chains in types I and II and II and III collagen. The flexible domains found in the α1-chains of types I-III collagen were found to be conserved in the microfibril and had periods of about 15 amino acid residues and multiples thereof. The flexibility profiles of types I and II collagen microfibrils were found to be more highly correlated than those for types I and III and II and III. These results suggest that the domain structure of the α1-chains found in types I-III collagen is an efficient means for storage of elastic energy during stretching while preserving the triple helical structure of the overall molecule. It is proposed that all collagens that form fibers are designed to act as storage elements for elastic energy. The function of fibers rich in type I collagen is to store and then transmit this energy while fibers rich in types II and III collagen may store and then reflect elastic energy for dissipation through viscous fibrillar slippage. Impaired elastic energy storage by extracellular matrices may lead to cellular damage and changes in signaling by mechanochemical transduction at the extracellular matrix-cell interface. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The increasing importance of Internet electronics is driving changes in development of IC technology. One important characteristic of the Internet Age is computational disaggregation. Whereas, over the past 20 years, PCs have been characterized by ever-increasing computation capabilities, emerging Internet electronic products are characterized by sufficient computation to achieve the function in a small, often portable, form factor. The imperative for lower cost, which enables penetration into mass markets, is a second area where Internet electronic products differ from PCs. Disaggregation and cost requirements are driving an unprecedented degree of system-on-a-chip (SoC) integration, in the Internet Age, SoC integration means more than integrating different digital cores, it also means integrating functions that are realized today in different technologies: logic, memory, analog, power management, passives and radio or wireline driver, depending on the product. Because SoC integration is motivated primarily by cost, diverse functions must be integrated together in standard CMOS with minimal cost addition. Cost-effective embedded memory technology also needs to be developed. Current examples of SoC integration include cell phones, cable/DSL modems, and internet audio. These representative examples, together with others, are driving changes in the way ICs are developed. In the latter half of the decade, it is likely that SoC integration will expand to include MEMS, microphotonics, and on-chip energy sources. Moore's Law scaling will continue at least through the end of this decade, but SoC integration will become an increasingly important technology imperative for continued cost reduction throughout the Internet Age.",,"Analog to digital conversion; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital signal processing; Personal computers; Random access storage; Transceivers; Flash converters; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036105656

Many studies so far have examined and proposed techniques to reduce leakage in on-chip storage structures. In this study, static energy is reduced in the integer functional units by leveraging the unique qualities of dual threshold voltage domino logic. Domino logic has desirable properties that greatly reduce leakage current while providing fast propagation times. However due to the energy cost of entering the low leakage current state (sleep mode), domino logic has thus far been used only for leakage reduction in the longterm standby mode. We examine the utility of the sleep mode (while considering the aforementioned costs) when idle times are relatively short, one to a few hundred cycles, as is often the case for functional units. Using an analytical energy model suitable for architecture-level analysis, we explore the interaction of the application and technology, and the effect on energy and performance as the underlying parameters are varied, on a set of benchmarks. Our results show that if the leakage approaches the magnitude as projected in the literature, even for short idle intervals as few as ten cycles, an aggressive policy of activating the sleep mode at every idle period performs well and a more complex control strategy may not be warranted. We also propose a simple design, called Gradual Sleep, to reduce the energy impact of using the sleep mode for smaller idle periods. © 2002 IEEE.","Circuits; CMOS technology; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Leakage current; Logic; Microprocessors; Performance analysis; Subthreshold current; Threshold voltage","Benchmarking; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer architecture; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Microprocessor chips; Networks (circuits); Sleep research; Threshold voltage; CMOS technology; Dual threshold voltage; High-performance microprocessors; Logic; Low-leakage current; Performance analysis; Sub-threshold current; Sub-threshold leakage currents; Leakage currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955970060

Specifically, we propose an optimization algorithm that targets the reduction of extra off-chip memory accesses caused by inter-processor communication. This is achieved by increasing the application-wide reuse of data that resides in the scratch-pad memories of processors. Our experimental results obtained on four array-intensive image processing applications indicate that exploiting inter-processor data sharing can reduce the energy-delay product by as much as 33.8% (and 24.3% on average) on a four-processor embedded system. The results also show that the proposed strategy is robust in the sense that it gives consistently good results over a wide range of several architectural parameters.","Access patterns; Compiler optimizations; Data tiles; Embedded multiprocessors; Energy consumption; Scratch pad memories","Embedded multiprocessors; Algorithms; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Image processing; Optimization; Program compilers; Multiprocessing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036058776

For the RuO2·xH2O samples annealed at temperatures lower than 100 °C and higher than 200 °C, a high proton activation energy was obtained, implying that the proton dynamics/diffusive motion is relatively restrained, whereas the samples annealed at temperatures between 100 and 200 °C exhibited relatively low proton activation energies, indicating that the protons can easily diffuse into the bulk of the material. Therefore, the proton activation energy correlates strongly with the hydrogen transfer and storage ability of the proton-conducting materials.

Our numerical model was composed of about 83,000 spherical elastic particles that were bonded together to create an initial solid numerical rock mass, capable of macroscopic fracture and faulting in response to displacement loading. The algorithim is fully dynamic and as such allowed for the storage and sudden release of elastic strain energy in the form of seismic events. We induced progressive along-strike fault-growth and attendant non-cylindrical fold development by varying the along-strike friction within a seeded, planar zone of weakness within the aggregate, a zone that was to become the fault. The result was a well-developed, plunging ramp anticline that grew in amplitude and along-strike length as the macroscopic fault propagated from lower to higher friction regions. Lateral fault propagation was relatively rapid compared with shortening, with a ratio of thrust displacement-to-propagation length (K) of 6.5%. Incremental motion of the particles reflected episodic slip at both the laterally propagating fault-tip and along the existing fault. These episodes were characterized by local clusters of outward radiating velocity vectors that propagated at seismic velocities, marking the model equivalents of earthquakes. The finite displacement vectors in the hanging wall were approximately parallel to the far-field transport direction, with a strike-parallel component that ranged from one to two orders of magnitude less than the strike-perpendicular component. Furthermore, about two-thirds of the particles had strike-parallel motion in the direction of fault propagation and fold plunge. Because the far-field, shortening boundary conditions were uniformly perpendicular to fault strike, this component of motion in the plunge direction was apparently due to a topographically-induced, plunge-parallel shear stress. The along-strike motion involved slip on the main fault as well as transient strike slip on minor vertical, sometimes conjugate zones, apparently induced by the increased topographic load. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Out-of-plane motion; Thrust ramp; Thrust sheet","Thrust ramp; Algorithms; Earthquakes; Numerical methods; Rocks; Seismic prospecting; Vectors; Velocity measurement; Structural geology; fault displacement; fault plane; fault propagation; fold and thrust belt; three-dimensional modeling; thrust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036403873

They present pathologically as lysosomal storage diseases but are also characterised by severe neurodegeneration. Although the biochemical defects appear primarily centred on lysosomes and defects in proteolysis, the link between this and pathogenesis of neuronal death is poorly understood. The pathogenesis of neurodegeneration has been studied particularly in two animal models these being the English setter dog and the New Zealand Southhampshire sheep (OCL6). In these, and some of the human entities, there is evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. This includes the accumulation of subunit c of ATP synthase as a component of storage material in at least six of eight genetic forms of the disease; structural abnormalities of mitochondria and selective loss of neurons in areas of the brain that are particularly metabolically active. Direct evidence of dysfunction comes from mitochondrial function tests in fibroblasts and, in animal models, isolated liver mitochondria. Supporting evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction was shown by disturbances in proportions of energy-rich phosphates in fibroblasts in some of these diseases. If these various defects were reflected in neurons, then it would support the hypothesis that neuron death was associated with energy-linked excitotoxicity. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","ATP synthase; Batten disease; Ceroid-lipofuscinosis; Excitotoxicity; Mitochondria; Subunit c","phosphate; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; article; clinical feature; degenerative disease; disease association; disease model; disease severity; disorders of mitochondrial functions; dog; enzyme subunit; fibroblast; function test; genetic disorder; human; hypothesis; liver mitochondrion; lysosome storage disease; mitochondrial energy transfer; mitochondrial respiration; nerve cell; nerve cell necrosis; nerve degeneration; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; neurotoxicity; nomenclature; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; sheep; structure analysis; Animals; Dogs; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Mitochondria; Nerve Degeneration; Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses; Sheep; Animalia; Canis familiaris; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036176571

This chronosequence study in southern Georgia evaluated the effect of pine planting and the associated cessation of agricultural activity such as tillage and fertilization on soil C storage and soil nutrient stocks. Soils are Arenic or Typic Kandiudults with coarse-textured surface soils. Soil C, nutrients, and bulk density from 0 to 50 cm in planted stands 1, 3, 7, and 14 yr old, as well as soils beneath natural longleaf pine stands that were in a never tilled (NT) condition, were evaluated (n = 3 per stand age). No accumulation of soil C was apparent during the first 14 yr of pine growth. The average content of soil C in planted stands (11 ± 1 Mg/ha; mean ± 1 SE) was ∼16 Mg/ha less than that in the NT soils (27 ± 4 Mg/ha). Soil total N content within planted stands also did not differ by age, although extractable NO3 declined rapidly. Despite agricultural N inputs, the mean N content of planted stands (410 ± 83 Mg/ha) was below that in NT stands (730 ± 21 Mg/ha). Total P (1507 ± 21 Mg/ha) and extractable P (113 ± 21 Mg/ha) contents also did not differ between planted stands but had highly elevated values compared to total P (728 ± 38 Mg/ha) and extractable P (2 ± 1 Mg/ha) for NT soils. Soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K had generally decreasing contents with stand age but varying patterns related to NT soils. During the first 14 yr of reforestation, soils did not sequester C. Carbon benefits may be gained, however, in aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation and through the cessation of high energy-consumptive activities such as fertilization or tillage. Enhanced P fertility on these marginal lands can improve pine growth, but only if other elements such as N are not limiting to growth.","Carbon storage; Conservation reserve program; Longleaf pine; Marginal agricultural lands; Soil cations; Soil change; Soil nitrogen; Soil phosphorus","afforestation; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; soil nutrient; (Southeast); United States; Pinus palustris; Pinus palustris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036825781

However, the radiation environment within high-energy storage rings makes essential the determination of the degree of radiation sensitivity as well as the mechanisms of radiation-induced demagnetization. Sample Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets were irradiated at the Advanced Photon Source with bending magnet X-rays up to an absorbed dose of approximately 280 Mrad (1 Mrad = 10 kGy). Sample magnets were also irradiated with 60Co γ-rays up to an absorbed dose of 700 Mrad at the National Institute of Standards and Technology's standard gamma irradiation facility. Changes in the residual induction were found to be within the experimental uncertainties for both the X-ray and γ-ray irradiations. Sample Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets were then irradiated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Californium User Facility for Neutron Science with fast neutrons up to a total fast fluence of 1.61 × 1014 n/cm2, and with thermal neutrons up to a total thermal fluence of 2.94 × 1012 n/cm2. The fast-neutron irradiation revealed changes between residual induction measurements of the sample magnets before and after irradiation of 0.6% and greater for fast-neutron fluence levels of 2 × 1013 n/cm2 and above. Thermal-neutron irradiation revealed changes in the residual induction measurements of the sample magnets before and after irradiation that were within the experimental uncertainties for thermal-neutron fluence levels up to 3 × 1012 n/cm2. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) modulate this regulation, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address the role of central GRs in the regulation of energy balance, we studied mice in which GRs have selectively been inactivated in the nervous system. Mutant mice display marked growth retardation. During suckling age this is associated with normal fat deposition causing a 60% temporary increase of percent body fat, compared with control littermates. After weaning, fat and protein depositions are reduced so that adults are both smaller and leaner than their controls. Decreased food intake and, after weaning, reduced metabolic efficiency account for these developmental disturbances. Plasma levels of leptin and insulin, two important energy balance regulators, are elevated in young mutants but normal in adults. Leptin/body fat ratio is higher at all ages, suggesting disturbed control of circulating leptin as a consequence of chronically elevated GC levels in mutant animals. Adult mutants display increased hypothalamic CRH and NPY levels, but peptide levels of melanin concentrating hormone and Orexin A and B are unchanged. The increased levels of plasma GCs and hypothalamic CRH may act as catabolic signals most likely leading to persistently reduced energy accumulation.",,"corticotropin releasing factor; fat; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; insulin; leptin; melanin concentrating hormone; neuropeptide Y; orexin A; orexin B; protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; controlled study; corticosteroid blood level; developmental disorder; energy balance; female; food intake; gene inactivation; growth retardation; hormonal regulation; hypothalamus; insulin blood level; lipid storage; male; mouse; mouse mutant; nervous system; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; signal transduction; starvation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036093434

Two strains of Ralstonia pickettii isolated from different areas within the UPW system (pretreatment and polishing loop, and referred to as strains 3A1 and MF254A, respectively) and a strain of Bradyrhizobium sp. were compared to increase our understanding of the fundamental behavior of bacteria contaminating UPW. R. pickettii (3A1) grew significantly slower in R2A medium, with a final cell yield much lower than the isolate from the polishing loop. In addition, R. pickettii MF254A showed a broader substrate range than either strain 3A1 or Bradyrhizobium sp. In UPW, there appears to be a threshold cell concentration (approximately 106 colony-forming units/ml), whereby the cell numbers remain constant for a prolonged period of 6 months or more. Below this concentration, rapid proliferation is observed until the threshold concentration is attained. Preliminary experiments suggested that nitrogen gas (frequently added to UPW storage tanks) may contribute to growth of Bradyrhizobium sp. Above the threshold concentration, the strain of Ralstonia sp. isolated from the polishing loop was capable of cryptic growth with heat-killed cells in UPW. However, cryptic growth was not observed when the cells supplied as nutrients were killed using UV254 light. Furthermore, cryptic growth did not appear to contribute significantly to proliferation of Bradyrhizobium sp. or Ralstonia sp. 3A1 (isolated from the pretreatment loop). We believe that cryptic growth may aid survival of the bacteria in UPW, but further experiments are warranted to prove this phenomenon conclusively.","Cryptic growth; Nitrogen fixation; Oligotroph; Substrate utilization","carbon; water; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; Bradyrhizobium; cell count; cell killing; cell proliferation; colony forming unit; concentration (parameters); controlled study; energy resource; heat treatment; nonhuman; nutritional requirement; Ralstonia; ralstonia picketti; time; Colony Count, Microbial; Environment; Gram-Negative Aerobic Rods and Cocci; Heat; Time Factors; Ultraviolet Rays; Water Microbiology; Water Purification; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bradyrhizobium; Bradyrhizobium sp.; Ralstonia; Ralstonia pickettii; Ralstonia sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036669915

Measurements of tune shifts with betatron oscillation amplitude and closed orbit shifts were used to characterize the nonlinear fields. Because of the narrow pole width in BL11, the nonlinear fields seen along the wiggling electron trajectory are dramatically different from the magnetic measurements made along a straight line with a stretched wire. This difference explains the tune shift measurements and the observed degradation in dynamic aperture. Because of the relatively large dispersion (1.2 m) at BL11, the nonlinearities particularly reduced the off-energy dynamic aperture. Because of the nature of these nonlinear fields, it is impossible, even theoretically, to cancel them completely with short multipole correctors. Magic finger corrector magnets were built, however, that partially correct the nonlinear perturbation, greatly improving the storage ring performance. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144369253

The susceptibility of Alloy 22 to localized corrosion is an important consideration in the evaluation of the waste package behavior and the assessment of the overall performance of the proposed repository. The effects of environment chemical composition and temperature on localized corrosion susceptibility were examined by measuring the repassivation potential for crevice corrosion in chloride-containing solutions at temperatures ranging from 80 to 150°C. The effect of potentially inhibiting anionic species, such as nitrate, was also determined. In addition to the mill annealed material, tests were conducted on both welded and thermally aged material to evaluate microstructural effects related to container fabrication processes. The resistance of Alloy 22 to localized corrosion decreased with increasing temperature and chloride concentration. Welding and thermal aging also decreased the localized corrosion resistance of the alloy.",,"Aging of materials; Composition effects; Corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Environmental impact; Geological repositories; Metallographic microstructure; Stainless steel; Steel containers; Temperature; Thermal effects; Welding; Crevice corrosion; Localized corrosion susceptibility; Microstructural effects; Thermal aging; Waste package container material; Yucca Mountain; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036380093

The products containing the phase-change technology show branding, emphasizing that the products with this technology will reduce body temperature fluctuations and, thus, increase comfort. The thermal resistance of traditional fabrics is tested using a steady-state procedure, whereby a temperature difference is maintained between a simulated skin and a simulated outdoor environment. These procedures are adequate for traditional fabrics. Little or no energy is stored in the fabric. In the case of phase-change products, these tests ignore the fact that during a transient, energy is stored or released in the phase-change material, depending on the activity level of the wearer. A new test instrument and test protocol has been developed for testing the dynamic performance of fabrics containing phase-change material. The instrument uses a sinusoidally varying heat input to a hot plate to simulate human activity. Cold plates at constant temperature simulate the environment outside the garment. A new metric, the temperature regulating factor (TRF), has been developed to characterize how well a phase-change fabric moderates skin temperature. This metric also allows fabrics to be compared. As expected, test results show that phase-change fabrics can significantly reduce hot plate temperature fluctuations when compared to similar fabrics without phase-change material.",,"Energy storage; Heat resistance; Phase transitions; Temperature regulating factors (TRF); Fabrics; Fabric; Phase Transition; Thermal Resistance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144460270

Studies on germinating cereal seeds indicate that production of sugars from starch is inhibited by increasing sugar levels. Although numerous studies have focused on the regulation of starch metabolism, very few studies have addressed the control of storage lipid metabolism by germinating oilseeds. Results: Mobilization of storage lipid by germinating seeds of the model oilseed plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. occurs at a greatly reduced rate in the presence of exogenous glucose or mannose, but not in the presence of equi-molar 3-O-methylglucose or sorbitol. The sugar-insensitive5-1/abscisic acid-insensitive4-101 (sis5-1/abi4-101) mutant is resistant to glucose inhibition of seed storage lipid mobilization. Wild-type seedlings become insensitive to glucose inhibition of storage lipid breakdown within 3 days of the start of imbibition. Conclusions: Growth in the presence of exogenous glucose significantly retards mobilization of seed storage lipid in germinating seeds from wild-type Arabidopsis. This effect is not solely due to the osmotic potential of the media, as substantially higher concentrations of sorbitol than of glucose are required to exert significant effects on lipid breakdown. The inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown is limited to a narrow developmental window, suggesting that completion of some critical metabolic transition results in loss of sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown. © 2002 To et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; 3 methylglucose; carbohydrate; fatty acid; glucose; mannose; sorbitol; Arabidopsis; dose response; drug effects; genetics; growth, development and aging; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mutation; plant seed; seedling; time; 3-O-Methylglucose; Arabidopsis; Carbohydrates; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Lipid Metabolism; Mannose; Mutation; Seedling; Seeds; Sorbitol; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038707921

Don is frequently planted on land under pasture primarily for production forestry, but with the added advantage of potentially offsetting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy and industrial sources. Conversion of pasture to P. radiata plantations can, however, result in lowered contents of soil carbon (C) at some sites. We here examine the effects of this land-use change on soil C and nitrogen (N) pools, and on microbial properties involved in the cycling of these nutrients, at 5 paired sites, each with an established pasture and P. radiata plantation. Four sites had first-rotation trees aged 12-30 years and the other site second-rotation trees aged 20 years. In mineral soil at 0-10 cm depth, total and microbial C and N, extractable C, CO2-C production, and, generally, net mineral-N production were lower under P. radiata than under pasture; differences were significant (P &lt; 0.05), except for total and extractable C at 2 sites. Differences between these land uses were less distinct in soil at 10-30 cm depth. On an area basis, total C in 0-30 cm depth soil was lower under P. radiata than under pasture at most sites, but significantly lower at only one site. Total N, microbial C and N, and CO2-C and net mineral-N production were, however, again generally significantly lower under P. radiata. These ecosystem differences were less marked, although still present, except for CO2-C production, when forest litter (LFH material) was included in the area calculations. Overall, our study suggests that afforestation with P. radiata leads to a reduction in total N, microbial biomass, and microbial activity, but a less consistent effect on soil C storage after one rotation.","Extractable organic nitrogen; Grassland; Land-use change; Metabolic quotient; Microbial biomass; Nitrification; Paired sites; qCO2","Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Afforestation; Soils; afforestation; microbial activity; mineralization; pasture; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; New Zealand; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036918705

Thus, understanding the complex pathological mechanisms underlying hyperphagia and obesity has an important clinical significance. Leptin, or ob protein, is a key element in the long-term regulation of food intake and body weight homeostasis. It circulates in the blood at levels correlated with body fat mass. Leptin binds to specific receptors in the hypothalamus to mediate events that regulate feeding behavior. In light of new evidence, the initial view that leptin is an adipocyte-derived signal, which acts centrally to decrease body weight, has been modified. It has been shown that leptin may also have specific functions in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that feeding and energy homeostasis is regulated by both central and peripheral signals. Evidence supports the view that leptin integrates short-term, meal-related signals from the gut into long-term regulation of energy balance. In addition, the gastric leptin level is altered by the nutritional state and the administration of cholecystokinin. This commentary aims to review the evidence of the role of leptin as a peripherally acting signal in the gut in the regulation of nutrient intake, adiposity, and body weight. Based on currently available data, some potential future studies are suggested. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Here, we tested the potential interactions between sucrose intake and circulating corticosterone on behavioural, metabolic, autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to the stress of cold. Rats were left intact, sham-ADX, or ADX and replaced with pellets that provided normal, basal (30%B) or high stress (100%B) constant circulating concentrations of corticosterone ± sucrose. More calories were consumed in cold than at room temperature (RT), provided that corticosterone concentrations were elevated above mean daily basal values in cold. Neither increased sucrose nor increased chow ingestion occurred in cold if the rats were ADX and replaced with 30%B. However, sucrose drinking in this group markedly ameliorated other responses to cold. By contrast, ADX30%B rats not drinking sucrose fared poorly, and none of the metabolic or endocrine variables were similar to those in sham-ADX controls. ADX100%B group in cold, resembled intact rats without sucrose; however, this group was metabolically abnormal at RT. We conclude that drinking sucrose lowers stress-induced corticosterone secretion while reducing many responses to cold; elevated corticosterone concentrations in the stress-response range are essential for the normal integrated cold-induced responses to occur.","Body weight; Core temperature; Fat; Insulin; Stress; Testosterone; Uncoupling protein-1","corticosterone; corticotropin releasing factor; lipid; messenger RNA; sucrose; uncoupling protein 1; adrenalectomy; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; autonomic nervous system; autonomic nervous system function; caloric intake; cold; cold stress; concentration (parameters); controlled study; corticosterone release; energy balance; feeding behavior; fluid intake; food intake; hormone substitution; lipid storage; male; metabolism; modulation; neuroendocrine system; neuroendocrinology; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; room temperature; sugar intake; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Adrenalectomy; Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Chronic Disease; Cold; Corticosterone; Dietary Sucrose; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Lipids; Male; Neurosecretory Systems; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stress; Testosterone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036211249

New data are from the Princeton flow reactor, a lower temperature (850-950 K) and high-pressure (5-10 atm) data set (φ = 2.5). The second set is for a high-temperature (&gt;2000 K) and low-pressure (20 torr), premixed laminar fuel-rich flame (φ = 1.9) studied by Bhargava and Westmoreland. Several reaction sets were tested, but only the present set demonstrated good agreement in both cases. A key difference between this set and previous ones lies in the modeling of the complex C2H3 + O2 reaction. New rate constants were calculated based on recent findings regarding the potential energy surface of the C2H3 + O2 system. In the 850-1600 K range that is crucial in these experiments, the product set CH2CHO + O was found to contribute much less than reported in earlier studies, and the HCO + CH2O channel dominated. The present reaction set predicted the species profiles in both cases with reasonable accuracy, allowing us to interpret and compare the reaction pathways over a wide range of conditions. In the low-pressure flame, C2H4 is mainly consumed by abstraction, while in the high-pressure system, abstraction (mainly by OH instead of H) competes with H addition that forms C2H5. In both cases, abstraction forms C2H3 that reacts with O2 to make HCO and CH2O and eventually CO and CO2 However, higher levels of C2H5 and HO2 at the high-pressure, lower temperature flow reactor condition drive distinct pathway differences. The key role of HO2 chemistry is particularly emphasized through the reaction CH2O + HO2. Model comparisons support a lower value of the rate constant for this reaction, consistent with that recommended by Hochgreb and Dryer.",,"Abstracting; Aliphatic compounds; Combustion; Digital storage; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Different pressures; Ethylene combustions; High pressure system; Low-pressure flames; Lower temperatures; Oxygen combustion; Reaction pathways; Reasonable accuracy; Ethylene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037899072

Although leptin was elevated in both strains in response to a high-fat diet, its role in the development of diet-induced obesity has remained unclear since insulin and other factors that affect similar tissue targets are altered. Thus, we administered recombinant leptin by subcutaneous infusion to chow-fed mice to mimic the changes in plasma leptin across its broad physiologic range. We observed strain differences in responsiveness to reduced and elevated leptin levels. A reduction in leptin during fasting evoked a greater response in C57Bl/6J mice by decreasing energy expenditure and thyroxin, increasing corticosterone and stimulating food intake and weight gain during refeeding. However, C57Bl/6J mice were less responsive to an increase in leptin in the fed state. Conversely, the leptin-mediated response to fasting was blunted in SWR/J mice, whereas an increase in leptin profoundly reduced food intake and body weight in SWR/J mice fed ad libitum. Sensitivity to fasting in C57Bl/6J mice was associated with higher hypothalamic NPY mRNA and reduced POMC and UCP-1 mRNA expression, while the robust response to high leptin levels in SWR/J mice was associated with suppression of NPY mRNA. These results indicate that differences in leptin responsiveness between strains might occur centrally or peripherally, leading to alteration in the patterns of food intake, thermogenesis and energy storage.","Adipose Tissue; Hypothalamus; Leptin; Neuroendocrine; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling Protein","corticosterone; insulin; leptin; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; proopiomelanocortin; recombinant leptin; thyroxine; uncoupling protein 1; animal experiment; animal model; article; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; diet restriction; disease predisposition; disease resistance; energy expenditure; gene repression; hypothalamus; lipid diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; refeeding; thermogenesis; weight gain; Animals; Body Weight; Dietary Fats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Hypothalamus; Leptin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred Strains; Obesity; Recombinant Proteins; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036875212

Food consumption was monitored at weekly intervals and all mice were evaluated after consuming their respective diets for 4 wk for analysis of mRNA levels of selected metabolic genes. Despite similar food consumption, body weight and fat deposition were significantly greater in AKR/J than in SWR/J mice, and this difference was greatly accentuated by the HF diet. The HF diet produced distinct differences between strains in gene expression patterns among fat depots. In AKR/J mice, UCP1 mRNA was decreased 10-fold in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and four- to fivefold in retroperitoneal and inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT). The HF diet also decreased PGC-1 and β3-adrenergic receptor mRNA by two- and ninefold in BAT from AKR/J mice. In contrast, the HF diet either increased uncoupling protein (UCP)1 in BAT or had no effect on expression of these genes in adipose tissues from SWR/J mice. UCP2 mRNA was fourfold higher in WAT from AKR/J compared with SWR/J mice and increased by an additional twofold in WAT from AKR/J mice fed the HF diet. UCP2 was unaffected by diet in SWR/J mice. These studies show that the diet-induced obesity of AKR/J mice is characterized by increased metabolic efficiency and is associated with changes in adipocyte gene expression that limit the adaptive thermogenic response to increased energy density.","Adaptive thermogenesis; Adipose tissue; Mice; Uncoupling proteins","uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 2; adipocyte; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; food intake; gene expression regulation; inguinal region; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; obesity; strain difference; thermogenesis; Animalia; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036846146

All measurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also calculated these resonance strengths and energies using two independent, state-of-the-art techniques: the perturbative multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) and multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) methods. Overall, reasonable agreement is found between our experimental results and theoretical calculations. The most notable discrepancies are for the 3l3l′ resonances. The calculated MCBP and MCDF resonance strengths for the n = 3 complex lie, respectively, ≈47% and ≈31% above the measured values. These discrepancies are larger than the estimated ≲20% total experimental uncertainty in our measurements. We have used our measured 2 → 2 and 2 → 3 results to produce a Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficient for DR of Fe XIX. Our experimentally derived rate coefficient is estimated to be good to better than ≈20% for kB Te ≥ 1 eV. Fe XIX is predicted to form in photoionized and collisionally ionized cosmic plasmas at kB T e ≫ 1 eV. Hence, our rate coefficient is suitable for use in ionization balance calculations of these plasmas. Previously published theoretical DR rate coefficients are in poor agreement with our experimental results. None of these published calculations reliably reproduce the magnitude or temperature dependence of the experimentally derived rate coefficient.

Although LTS prototypes have been demonstrated for motors, generators, power cables, transformers and current limiters, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) systems offer striking economic and system reliability advantages and are now seen as the central vehicle for broad commercialization of superconductivity in the power grid. Operating at temperatures from 30 to 80 K, they open the door to highly simplified cryogenics and increased stability, which result in economic systems not feasible with LTS. HTS prototypes at commercial power levels have already been demonstrated, particularly power transmission cables and motors. Key merits as well as remaining open technical challenges for such HTS applications will be reviewed in this paper.","BSCCO; Cryogenic; HTS; Superconducting","Cryogenics; Electric cables; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric motors; Electric transformers; Limiters; Oxide superconductors; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting transition temperature; Superconducting wire; Superconductivity; Low temperature superconductors; Power transmission cables; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509811

Since typical MIMO electrohydraulic transmission systems have significant nonlinear dynamics that vary with system operating conditions, a robust controller design is paramount. The increased robustness of the H ∞ controller over the H 2 scheme is demonstrated qualitatively in the time domain through both disturbance rejection and trajectory tracking comparisons.

The CIOQ router is also frequently used as an abstract model for routers: at one extreme is input queueing, at the other extreme is output queueing, and in-between there is a continuum of performance as the speedup is increased from 1 to N (where N is the number of linecards). The model includes architectures in which a switch fabric is sandwiched between two stages of buffering. There is a rich and growing theory for CIOQ routers, including algorithms, throughput results and conditions under which delays can be guaranteed. But there is a broad class of architectures that are not captured by the CIOQ model, including routers with centralized shared memory, and load-balanced routers. In this paper we propose an abstract model called Single-Buffered (SB) routers that includes these architectures. We describe a method called Constraint Sets to analyze a number of SB router architectures. The model helped identify previously unstudied architectures, in particular the Distributed Shared Memory router. Although commercially deployed, its performance is not widely known. We find conditions under which it can emulate an ideal shared memory router, and believe it to be a promising architecture. Questions remain about its complexity, but we find that the memory bandwidth, and potentially the power consumption of the router is lower than for a CIOQ router.

We report here the studies performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) on the on- and off-momentum particle motion that provides a good understanding of these limitations. Using off-momentum simulations and experiments together with frequency map analysis, we could precisely correlate beam loss areas with resonance locations. The very good agreement between simulations and experiments allowed us to provide guidance for avoiding these dangerous areas. This analysis results in predictive improvements of the momentum aperture, which actually led to a lifetime increase of 25% at the ALS for very high bunch charge. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,"Advanced light source (ALS); Charged particle storage rings; Particle motion; Touschek scattering; Computer simulation; Damping; High energy physics; Light sources; Optimization; Particle beams; Photons; Synchronization; Particle accelerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41349083327

(Connect. Tissue Res., 2001b). Results of the analysis of tensile elastic stress-strain curves suggest that the elastic modulus of cartilage from the superficial zone is approximately 7.0 GPa parallel and 2.21 GPa perpendicular to the cleavage line pattern. Collagen fibril lengths in the superficial zone were found to be approximately 1265 μm parallel and 668 μm perpendicular to the cleavage line direction. The values for the elastic modulus and fibril lengths decreased with increased extent of osteoarthritis. The elastic modulus of type II collagen parallel to the cleavage line pattern in the superficial zone approaches that of type I collagen in tendon, suggesting that elastic energy storage occurs in the superficial zone due to the tensile pre-tension that exists in this region. Decreases in the elastic modulus associated with osteoarthritis reflect decreased ability of cartilage to store elastic energy, which leads to cartilage fibrillation and fissure formation. We hypothesize that under normal physiological conditions, collagen fibrils in cartilage function to store elastic energy associated with weight bearing and locomotion. Enzymatic cleavage of cartilage proteoglycans and collagen observed in osteoarthritis may lead to fibrillation and fissure formation as a result of impaired energy storage capability of cartilage.

The focus is on the vertically integrated energy components, their monthly tendencies, transports, and divergences, using the most accurate computations in model and pressure coordinates. Approximate equations have often been used previously: although relatively small compared with the moist static energy, kinetic energy transports should be taken into account, as divergences can exceed several tens of watts per square meter. Changes in energy storage terms over a month are not negligible, as they are typically over 25 W m 2 in storm track regions. Transports of energy are meaningful only if the mass budget is closed. Typical magnitudes of the divergence of sensible heat and potential energy are very large (several hundred watts per square meter), but partly cancel when combined as dry static energy, reflecting the role of isentropic flow. The latent energy and sensible heat contributions are strongly positively correlated because of the dominance of low-level flow, and the latent energy divergence also cancels a large component of the dry static energy divergence, leaving a modest residual. This arises from the dominance of moist adiabatic processes in the Tropies and subtropies as the net divergent transports depend on temperature departures in the vertical from the saturated adiabatic lapse rate and their covariability with wind. Careful numerical treatments are required or else small errors in the large terms that should cancel can be amplified. Common assumptions that diagnostics can be computed on model terrain-following coordinates, which therefore vary from day to day as the surface pressure changes, lead to errors in energy budgets of the order of 5 W m 2 owing to the covariability of energy terms with surface pressure. How well model coordinate results can be replicated in pressure coordinates has been explored along with the role of vertical resolution using a postprocessor developed at NCAR. The standard 17-level reanalysis pressure level archive does not adequately resolve the atmosphere, and we propose a new set of 30 pressure levels that has 25-mb vertical resolution below 700 mb and 50-mb vertical resolution in the rest of the pressure levels that diagnostics reveal major problems in the NCEP reanalyses in the stratosphere that are inherent in the model formulation, making them unsuitable for quantitative use for energetics in anything other than model coordinates. In addition, small flaws are found in the ECMWF postprocessing onto pressure levels. These stem from the way the vector fields are truncated, which is a necessary step to avoid aliasing before putting the values out on a 2.5 grid. Moreover, it is desirable to compute the gridpoint values exactly rather than interpolating them from the Gaussian grid, as currently done by ECMWF. The diagnostic results computed with 30 levels replicate the full model level vertically integrated energy divergences to within about 2 W m 2 over the ocean, while errors exceed 10 W m 2 in small spots over Greenland, Antarctica, and the Himalayan Tibetan Plateau complex.",,"Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Kinetic energy; Potential energy; Saturation (materials composition); Thermal effects; Weather forecasting; Wind; Atmospheric energy budgets; Climatology; accuracy assessment; atmospheric modeling; energy balance; energy budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036951249

While miniaturized fuel cells have been demonstrated for the low power regime (1-20 Watts), numerous issues still must be resolved prior to deployment for applications as a replacement for batteries. As traditional fuel cell designs are scaled down in both power output and physical footprint, several issues impact the operation, efficiency, and overall performance of the fuel cell system. These issues include fuel storage, fuel delivery, system startup, peak power requirements, cell stacking, and thermal management. The combination of thin-film deposition and micro-machining materials offers potential advantages with respect to stack size and weight, flow field and manifold structures, fuel storage, and thermal management.

Previous work in rats has shown that interventions resulting in a negative energy balance lead to alterations in the trafficking of dietary fat. This study was undertaken to determine whether exercise after an overnight fast would alter the partitioning of dietary fat between oxidation and storage. Methods: Seven female subjects (age = 26 ± 1 yr, BMI = 21 ± 1 kg.m-2; mean ± SEM) were recruited for three visits: rest, light, and heavy exercise. Stationary cycle exercise sessions were calculated to use 1250 kJ and were done in a whole-body calorimeter. Dietary fat oxidation was calculated from the recovery of 13C-oleate corrected for acetate sequestration and d31-palmitate given in a liquid meal 30 min after the completion of exercise. Results: Cumulative oxidation of 13C-oleate at 11.5 h postdose was significantly greater during the heavy exercise (49 ± 4%) trial than both the light exercise (39 ± 4%) and the rest trials (34 ± 4%) (P &lt; 0.005). Oxidation of d31-palmitate recovery at 11.5 h postdose was not different during the heavy exercise (12 ± 1%), light exercise (11 ± 11%), and rest trials (10 ± 1%).

The atmosphere of Venus provides several advantages for flying a solar-powered aircraft. At the top of the cloud level, the solar intensity is comparable to or greater than terrestrial solar intensities. The atmospheric pressure makes flight much easier than on planets such as Mars. Also, the slow rotation of Venus allows an airplane to be designed for flight within continuous sunlight, eliminating the need for energy storage for nighttime flight. These factors make Venus a prime choice for a long-duration solar-powered aircraft.

Future changes of water budget of the Upper Volga catchment area were estimated from: past and present dynamics of the atmospheric, water and forest conditions, different climatic scenarios and SVAT (Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer) and hydrological models. Analysis of past climatological and hydrological data showed a large atmospheric and hydrological variability of the Upper Volga catchment. During the last 50-60 years the mean annual air temperature increased by 1.2 °C, and annual precipitation increased by 140 mm. However, no significant trend of annual runoff during the last 20 years could be found. Air temperature and precipitation changes were significant during winter and spring but very small in summer. Coniferous and mixed coniferous-broadleaf forests cover at present about 72% of the catchment area. During the last 30 years the area of natural coniferous forests (spruce, pine) decreased from 8.4% to 7% and the area of mixed forests increased from 52% to 59% of the total land area. Results of field measurements at a forest site showed a large variability of energy and water fluxes during the entire year. Transpiration of the boreal forest ecosystem measured using a sap flow method during the dry summer 1999 was limited by very dry soil water conditions, especially for spruce trees, and during the rainy summer 2000 probably by lack of oxygen in the rooting zone. Transpiration was about 10-20% larger for broadleaf trees (birch, aspen) than for spruce trees. Model estimations of possible changes in the hydrological regime of the Upper Volga catchment area for climatic scenarios suggest changes of evapotranspiration, surface runoff and soil moisture storage. Reduced snow accumulation, earlier melting, increased runoff reaction on precipitation in autumn and winter and drier soils in summer are the principal impacts on water resources of predicted future climatic changes. Surface runoff during the spring will be higher but summer and autumn runoff can be slightly suppressed by higher transpiration of deciduous tree species. Decreased summer precipitation and increased transpiration will result in decreasing ground water discharge, and lowering water levels of Volga river and of the Upper Volga lakes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Zn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to determine the nature of the zinc center in Datura innoxia plant tissue culture exposed to 250 μM, 500 μM, and 1000 μM Zn2+ for 4 days. Both edge and EXAFS data suggest that the zinc complex accumulated in D. innoxia cells is distinctly different from the types of zinc complexes expected to be associated with the accumulation, transport and storage of Zn2+ in plants. In D. innoxia at the levels of Zn2+ investigated, the X-ray absorption edges of Zn in the cell samples are similar to each other and occur at a similar energy to that of a complex between Zn2+ and free histidine, however, the shape and intensity of the edge suggests that the zinc center in the cells is not identical to that of this model solution. EXAFS analysis suggests that the zinc center is 4 coordinate with mixed N/O ligation at an average distance of approximately 1.98 Å for the cells exposed to 250 μM and 500 μM Zn2+. For cells exposed to 1000 μM Zn2+, a 5 coordinate N/O zinc center with an average first shell bond length of 2.02 Å was indicated. These bond lengths are significantly shorter than the ∼2.06/2.07 Å bond length expected for a zinc-histidine or zinc-organic acid complexes and the ∼2.35 Å bond length expected for a zinc complex with cysteine (errors in bond length determined by EXAFS are 0.02 Å). Some possible interpretations of these results are that under the conditions of study, a zinc metalloenzyme is over expressed in the cells, or that a novel zinc-binding protein is produced by the cells. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The DC/DC converter interfaces the low voltage battery to the fuel cell powered higher voltage DC bus system (255 V ∼ 425 V). Dual half-bridges interconnected through a transformer are employed to minimize the number of switching devices and their associated gate drive components. The transformer provides voltage level matching and galvanic isolation for safety requirements. Snubber capacitors and the transformer leakage inductance are utilized to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS). Therefore, no extra resonant components are required for ZVS, further reducing component count. The inherent soft-switching capability and the low component count of the converter allows efficient power conversion and compact packaging. A prototype was built and successfully tested.

Unfortunately, overexposure can lead to neurological damage, which is manifested as a movement disorder marked by tremors. Preclinical symptoms have been found in populations occupationally exposed to the element, and it is suggested that in late stages of the disorder, removing the Mn exposure will not prevent symptoms from progressing. Hence, it is desirable to have a means of monitoring Mn body burden. In vivo neutron activation analysis (IVNAA) is a technique which allows the concentration of some elements to be determined within sites of the body without invasive procedures. Data in the literature suggests that the Mn concentration in bone is greater than other tissues, and that it may be a long term storage site following exposure. Therefore, using the McMaster KN-accelerator to produce neutrons through the 7Li(p,n)7 Be reaction, the feasibility of IVNAA for measuring Mn levels in the human hand bone was investigated. Mn is activated through the 55Mn(n,γ)56Mn reaction, and the 847 keV gamma rays emitted when 56Mn decays are measured outside the body using NaI(T1) detectors. An optimal incident proton energy of 2.00 MeV was determined from indium foil and microdosimetry measurements. Hand phantom data suggest a minimum detectable limit of approximately 1.8 ppm could be achieved with a reasonably low dose of 50 mSv to the hand (normal manganese levels in the human hand are approximately 1 ppm). It is recommended the technique be developed further to make human in vivo measurements. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","Accelerator; Body composition; Bone; Humans; In vivo; Manganese; Neutron activation","Biochemistry; Bone; Chemical activation; Digital storage; Gamma rays; Manganese; Neutron logging; Neutrons; Particle accelerators; Sodium Iodide; Body composition; Essential nutrients; Growth and development; Humans; In-vivo; In-vivo measurement; Minimum detectable limits; Neutron activation; Neutron activation analysis; manganese; calcium; manganese; article; body burden; bone; hand; human; microdosimetry; neutron activation analysis; phantom; priority journal; proton radiation; bone; chemistry; comparative study; evaluation; feasibility study; image quality; instrumentation; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Bone and Bones; Calcium; Feasibility Studies; Hand; Humans; Manganese; Neutron Activation Analysis; Particle Accelerators; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036852644

A super-ferric storage ring has been constructed in which the field is to be known to 0.1 ppm. In addition, a new type of air core superconducting inflector has been developed and constructed, which successfully serves as the injection magnet. The injection magnet cancels the storage ring field, 1.5 T, seen by the entering muon beam very close to the storage ring aperture. At the same time, it gives negligible influence to the knowledge of the uniform main magnetic field in the muon storage region located at just 23 mm away from the beam channel. This was accomplished using a new double cosine theta design for the magnetic field which traps most of the return field, and then surrounding the magnet with a special superconducting sheet which traps the remaining return field. The magnet is operated using a warm-to-cold cryogenic cycle which avoids affecting the precision field of the storage ring.

The intermolecular interactions that develop between the PFPE lubricant and the carbon overcoat govern the adhesion, coverage, and physical properties of the lubricant, e.g. the lubricant structure and mobility. Consequently, the molecular interactions at the lubricant-carbon interface will contribute to the overall tribological performance of the disk-drive. Due to the ever-increasing demands for storage capacity, pressure exists to reduce the separation distance between the read-write head and disk surface. One means of reducing this separation distance is to use thinner protective overcoats on both the head and disk surfaces. In this study the interactions between Fomblin Zdol and both amorphous hydrogenated (CHx) and nitrogenated (CNx) carbon overcoats were investigated as a function of overcoat thickness from 0 to 100 Å. The Zdol film structure was probed by titrating the magnetic alloy, the CHx and CNx surfaces with Zdol. The molecular weight dependence of the maximum bonded Zdol thickness on these surfaces is used to deduce structural information on the adsorbed Zdol film. In progressing from CHx to CNx to the magnetic alloy, we find the Zdol boundary layer film to be characterized by an increase in average distance between the PFPE backbone and the surface, or equivalently an increase in the average Zdol monolayer thickness. On the CHx overcoat, Zdol preferentially lies more parallel to the surface, whereas on the magnetic layer, Zdol is oriented more perpendicular to the surface. When these experiments were conducted as a function of carbon overcoat thickness, we found that interaction of Zdol with the field of the underlying magnetic film becomes important at carbon film thicknesses ≤ 30 Å. The dependence of the Zdol adhesion on carbon overcoat thickness was quantified by determining the Zdol film thickness dependence of both the dispersive and polar components of the Heimholte free energy. The Zdol bonding kinetics were also studied as a function of carbon thickness. © 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Carbon overcoat; Film thickness; Head-disk interface; Lubricant; Perfluoropolyether","boundary lubrication; film thickness",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26844533848

The appearance of characteristic ethylenic, hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP), and low-wavenumber photoproduct bands in the Raman spectra is instrument-response-limited, consistent with a subpicosecond product appearance time. Intense high and low-frequency anti-Stokes peaks demonstrate that the all-trans photoproduct is produced vibrationally hot on the ground-state surface. Specifically, the low-frequency modes at 282, 350, and 477 cm-1 are highly vibrationally excited (T &gt; 2000 K) immediately following isomerization, revealing that these low-frequency motions directly participate in the reactive curve-crossing process. The anti-Stokes modes are characterized by a ∼2.5 ps temporal decay that coincides with the conversion of photorhodopsin to bathorhodopsin.

For these a precision impedance analyzer was used, in conjunction with a high-voltage capacitor dc-bias circuit configured for voltage-isolation from the analyzer input. A peak effective permittivity ε ∼ 4300 was derived at the capacitance peak of 133 nF at 400-V dc-bias, yielding an energy density storage of ∼0.5 J/cc in the device volume of 0.022 cc. Modeling of the experimental C-V response was applied to three conceptual series-connected capacitance regions within each grain and grain-boundary region of the MLC. The equivalent capacitance component for the first region was derived from the voltage-dependent polarizations within a ferroelectric and/or antiferroelectric grain. This involved application of differing Langevin functions for modeling the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric polarizations. That for the second region related to the voltage and frequency dependence of the equivalent p-n junction capacitance at opposite sides of a grain-boundary and compensation-region, with Debye-type relaxation constants relating its frequency dependence. The third capacitance region was associated with the insulator-barrier region itself.

This paper embarks on a new philosophy for reducing the number of accesses to the instruction TLB (iTLB) for power and performance optimizations. The overall idea is to keep a translation currently being used in a register and avoid going to the iTLB as far as possible - until there is a page change. We propose four different approaches for achieving this, and experimentally demonstrate that one of these schemes that uses a combination of compiler and hardware enhancements can reduce iTLB dynamic power by over 85% in most cases. These mechanisms can work with different instruction-cache (iLl) lookup mechanisms and achieve significant iTLB power savings without compromising on performance. Their importance grows with higher iLl miss rates and larger page sizes.

The amount of food consumed is influenced by both the motivation to procure food and the consummatory act of ingestion. In some species, the rate of food intake remains relatively constant, while survival is maintained via changes in food procurement, external storage and internal expenditure. For example, in hamsters, metabolic signals, peripheral hormones and central neuropeptides influence hunger motivation, food hoarding and changes in energy expenditure without necessarily influencing the amount of food ingested. A similar suite of metabolic signals, hormones and neuropeptides is involved in optimizing reproductive success under fluctuating energetic conditions. Reproductive processes are inhibited or delayed when energy expenditure outstrips energy intake and mobilization from storage. Estrous cyclicity in Syrian hamsters is sensitive to the availability of oxidizable glucose, but the presence of central glucose alone is not sufficient for normal estrous cycles. Food deprivation-induced anestrus does not depend upon food deprivation-induced increases in concentrations of adrenal hormones such as glucocorticoids. If hormones such as insulin and leptin play a role, they might do so by modulating the availability of glucose detected at extra-hypothalamic sites, instead of or in addition to direct effects on the mechanisms that control gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion. Despite our ability to measure and manipulate gene transcription, understanding of fuel homeostasis requires examination of indirect effects of hormones and neuropeptides on peripheral metabolism, attention to the motivational as well as consummatory aspects of ingestion, and the study of behaviour in a natural or seminatural context.","Estrous cycles; Glucose; Hamsters; Hoarding; Insulin; Leptin","glucocorticoid; glucose; gonadorelin; hormone; insulin; leptin; neuropeptide; anestrus; concentration (parameters); conference paper; energy balance; estrus cycle; food deprivation; food intake; food storage; genetic transcription; genomics; hamster; homeostasis; hormone determination; hormone release; hunger; hypothalamus; metabolism; motivation; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; reproduction; reproductive success; Syrian Arab Republic; Animals; Brain; Cricetinae; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Estrous Cycle; Female; Homeostasis; Hormones; Neuropeptides; Neurosecretory Systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036460667

Methods: Thirty-five women, aged 21-73 yr. volunteered to participate. Weekly swimming distance was determined from a self-reported exercise log. Body composition was estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), waist circumference, abdominal sagittal diameter, and skinfold thickness measures. Associations between swimming distance and age with body composition were examined using regression analysis. Results: Swimming distance had shared variances as follows: 23% with percent body fat, 26% with waist circumference, 20% with abdominal sagittal diameter, and 20%, 24%, and 22% with subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps skinfolds, respectively. Abdominal sagittal diameter was the only adiposity measure demonstrating a stronger relationship with age (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.00) than with swimming distance (R2 = 0.20, P = 0.03). Bone mineral content was linearly related to swimming distance and age having a negative association with age (r2 = 0.18, P = 0.01) and a positive one with swimming distance (r2 = 0.12, P = 0.05). In addition, there was a negative linear association observed between swimmer age and bone mineral density (r2 = 0.12, P = 0.05). Conclusion: In these female adults, endurance swimming was mildly associated with body adiposity. Age was not associated with body fat mass independently from swimming activity except with that measure reflecting abdominal visceral fat deposits. These data suggest that greater fat mass in female swimmers is more strongly related to lower levels of exercise than to age but that there is an additional influence of age on fat accumulation in the intra-abdominal area of the body.","Body fat; Master swimmer; Regional adiposity","abdomen; adult; age; article; body composition; body fat; bone mineral; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; endurance; exercise; female; human; human experiment; lipid storage; normal human; regression analysis; skinfold; swimming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036897676

The transcription factors, stimulatory proteins 1 and 3 (Sp1 and Sp3), nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) have cognate binding sites on the promoter of the FAS gene. It was shown that Sp1 and NF-Y interact co-operatively at the diet-induced DNase I-hypersensitive site at position -500. Adjacent binding sites for NF-Y and Sp1 have also been found between -71 and -52, and -91 and -83. cAMP regulation is mediated via the inverted CAAT element (ICE) at -99 to -92, which binds NF-Y. The FAS insulin-responsive element 3 (FIRE3)-binding site at -71 to -52 is capable of binding NF-Y, USF and SREBP-1, and is required for the sterol response in conjunction with the co-activator NF-Y around -100.

Using microdialysis, the respective tissues were perfused with Ringer's solution (+ 50 mM ethanol) and dialysate [ethanol], [glycerol], [lactate] and [pyruvate] were measured in order to estimate blood flow (ethanol dilution technique), lipolysis and glycolysis, respectively. At rest, blood flow tended to be higher in the respective tissues of women when compared to men. During exercise, blood flow was increased significantly in fSAT and muscle, but not in aSAT. Dialysate [glycerol] was increased two- to three-fold in aSAT and fSAT, similarly in men and women. However, in muscle, dialysate [glycerol] was increased five-fold in women and four-fold in men without reaching a steady state in women. Corrected for blood flow, the increase in lipolysis was greater in muscle than in fSAT, and greater in fSAT than in aSAT, and in muscle the increase was greater for women compared with men. Dialysate [lactate] and [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio were much more increased in muscle compared with aSAT and fSAT. It is concluded that lipids stored in muscle are rather used than lipids stored in adipose tissue for fueling the energy metabolism of muscle during exercise.

Our aim was thus to obtain more insights into the actions of these peptides on adipocytes, an approach initially undertaken with a functional genomic assay. First we showed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes express both NPFF-R1 and NPFF-R2 transcripts, and that NPAF binds adipocyte membranes with a nanomolar affinity as assessed by surface plasmon resonance technology. Then, and following a 24-h treatment with NPFF or NPAF (1 μM), we have measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR the mRNA steady state levels of already well characterized genes involved in key pathways of adipose metabolism. Among the 45 genes tested, few were modulated by NPFF (∼10%) and a larger number by NPAF (∼27%). Interestingly, NPAF increased the mRNA levels of β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors (AR), and to a lesser extent those of β1-ARs. These variations in catecholamine receptor mRNAs correlated with a clear induction in the density of β2- and β3-AR proteins, and in the potency of β-AR subtype-selective agonists to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Altogether, these data show that NPFF-R1 and NPFF-R2 are functionally present in adipocytes and suggest that besides their well described pain modulation effects, NPAF and to a lesser extent NPFF, may have a global impact on body energy storage and utilization.",,"Bioassay; Biological membranes; Metabolism; Proteins; RNA; Tissue; Surface plasmon resonance technology; Genes; adenylate cyclase; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; catecholamine; catecholamine receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide; neuropeptide af; neuropeptide FF; neuropeptide receptor; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; article; binding affinity; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene induction; molecular recognition; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; steady state; surface plasmon resonance; 3T3 Cells; Adenylate Cyclase; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Cell Membrane; Cyclic AMP; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase; Humans; Mice; Neuropeptides; Oligopeptides; Protein Binding; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; RNA, Messenger; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Time Factors; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037131415

Coryphaenoides acrolepis was collected from 1997 to 1998 in the San Diego Trough (1200 m depth).

The Internet has been championed as a new tool for environmental improvement. A life-cycle energy analysis of digital libraries, a growing application of information technology, was conducted to test this premise. Life-cycle models were compared for journal collections in digital and traditional formats. The basis for analysis was the amount of information in a typical scientific journal article (∼12 pages), which is equivalent to 0.97 hr of on-screen reading time. Digital system elements such as servers, routers, laser printers, and computer workstations were modeled. Journal production, delivery, storage, binding, interlibrary loan, and photocopying were examined for the traditional system. Building-related infrastructure, office paper, and personal transportation of the library patron were analyzed for both cases. In all, the study incorporated nearly 30 model elements, 90 input variables, and numerous fixed parameters. Five primary scenarios were constructed to consider increasing levels of complexity, Scenario I assumes only one reading per article (unit of analysis). Additional scenarios assume 1,000 readings and vary the following: laser printing, photocopying, and personal transportation. Energy consumed by the digital collection ranged between 4.10 and 216 MJ. The traditional system realized burdens from 0.55 to 525 MJ. Four significant effects were uncovered: (I) Energy consumption per unit was highly influenced by the number of readings per article. (2) Networking infrastructure by itself had a relatively small effect on total energy consumed by the digital system. (3) When personal transportation was considered, its effects tended to dominate. (4) The impact of making personal copies varied. Photocopying always increased energy consumption, whereas laser printing actually saved energy when it substituted for on-screen reading.","Digital library; Electronic publishing; Information and communications technology (ICT); Internet; Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Life-cycle energy analysis","Digital libraries; Information technology; Photocopying; Printers (computer); Servers; Digital technology; Energy utilization; Energy Consumption; Printers; Reprography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036524931

As energy consumption has become an important issue in the design of embedded systems (e.g., mobile computing and wireless communication devices), various techniques have been developed for the design of energy-efficient embedded software. In OS-driven embedded systems, the OS has a significantly impact on the system's energy consumption directly (energy consumption associated with the execution of the OS functions and services), as well as indirectly (interaction of the OS with the application software). As a first step towards designing energy-efficient OS-based embedded systems, it is important to develop methodologies to analyze the energy consumption of the embedded OS.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) lose body cell mass (BCM) by unknown mechanisms. Since the loss of BCM in normal aging individuals parallels the characteristic age-related decline in growth hormone (GH) secretion, this study was carried out to determine whether further decreased GH secretion plays a role in the pathogenesis of this loss of BCM in RA patients, termed ""rheumatoid cachexia."" Methods. GH secretory kinetics were determined by deconvolution analysis in 16 patients with RA and 17 healthy controls matched for age (mean ± SD 45.4 ± 13.2 years and 47.1 ± 14.6 years, respectively), sex, race, and body mass index. Blood samples were obtained every 20 minutes for 24 hours. Body composition was ascertained using total-body potassium (TBK) as a measure of BCM and dual x-ray absorptiometry to determine fat mass. Results. BCM was reduced in patients with RA compared with healthy controls (mean ± SD gm TBK 79.5 ± 9.5 versus 94.9 ± 11.9; P ± 0.0005), but there was no difference in fat mass. GH kinetic parameters in patients with RA did not differ from those in controls. Conclusion. These findings suggest that GH kinetics are unaltered in RA patients compared with healthy subjects; thus, GH deficiency does not account for rheumatoid cachexia.",,"growth hormone; prednisone; adult; aged; aging; article; blood analysis; body composition; body fat; body mass; cachexia; clinical article; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; growth hormone release; human; kinetics; lipid storage; pathogenesis; potassium balance; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036822634

This new pump arrangement will eliminate the sump level-control valves and the potential for overflowing the pump sump vessels.

A conceptual model is developed for the response of alpine ecosystems in temperate, midlatitude areas to changes in energy, chemicals, and water, based on a case study from Green Lakes Valley-Niwot Ridge, a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. A linear regression shows the increase in annual precipitation of about 300 millimeters from 1951 to 1996 to be significant. Most of the precipitation increase has occurred since 1967. The annual deposition of inorganic nitrogen in wetfall at the Niwot Ridge National Atmospheric Deposition Program site roughly doubled between 1985-1988 and 1989-1992. Storage and release of strong acid anions, such as those from the seasonal snowpack in an ionic pulse, have resulted in episodic acidification of surface waters. These biochemical changes alter the quantity and quality of organic matter in high-elevation catchments of the Rocky Mountains. Affecting the bottom of the food chain, the increase in nitrogen deposition may be partly responsible for the current decline of bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains.

Recent work has suggested that even larger branch predictors can and should be used in order to improve microprocessor performance. A further consideration is that the branch predictor is a thermal hot spot, thus further increasing its leakage. For these reasons, it is natural to consider applying decay techniques-already shown to reduce leakage energy for caches-to branch-prediction structures. Due to the structural difference between caches and branch predictors, applying decay techniques to branch predictors is not straightforward. This paper explores the strategies for exploiting spatial and temporal locality to make decay effective for bimodal, gshare, and hybrid predictors, as well as the branch target buffer. Overall, this paper demonstrates that decay techniques apply more broadly than just to caches, but that careful policy and implementation make the difference between success and failure in building decay-based branch predictors. Multi-component hybrid predictors offer especially interesting implementation tradeoffs for decay.",,"Computer simulation; Leakage currents; Signal filtering and prediction; Threshold voltage; Application programmers; Branch predictors; Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036398350

By storing and returning strain energy, the nuchal ligament reduces the amount of oscillatory head movements. These conclusions are derived from examination of the functional morphology of the equine nuchal ligament, its deformation during head movements, and the measurements of the mechanical properties of the tissue using a loading frame. The modulus of elasticity (Young's Modulus) was found to be similar to published values for bovine nuchal ligament: 8.4 × 105 (0.2 × 105 S. E.).

In this article, we define three distinct partitioning steps: procedure determination, preclustering, and N-way partitioning, with the first two steps focusing on granularity selection. Using three steps instead of one can provide for a more thorough design space exploration and for faster partitioning. We emphasize the first two steps in this article since they represent the most novel aspects. We illustrate the approach on an example, provide results of several experiments, and point to the need for future research that more fully automates the three-step approach.","Behavioral partitioning; Functional partitioning; Hardware/software partitioning; Partitioning; System level partitioning","Computational methods; Computer aided software engineering; Computer hardware; Computer software; Data storage equipment; Optimization; Problem solving; Partitioning sequential programs; Three-step approaches; Computer aided design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036660088

Environmental scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies indicated that silicate structures do in fact grow within the interior of ca. 0.8 mm thick films rather than forming undesirable silica precipitates on the surface. The combination of a domain-selective swelling solvent (DMAc) and the attachment of large organic counterions (benzyltrimethylammonium) along the styrene blocks facilitated the preferential migration of hydrolyzed Si(OEt)4 monomers to these ionic domains where the sol-gel reactions are apparently seeded. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical studies indicated that Tg for the polyisobutylene (PIB) phase is essentially unaffected, but the PS phase Tg shifts to higher values with ionomer formation, and to even higher values with subsequent silicate phase insertion. These two methods provide indirect evidence that the silicate component is mainly incorporated in the PS rather than PIB domains. Combined with the results of earlier atomic force microscopy studies that demonstrated that the basic morphology of the unmodified block copolymer is unchanged despite the insertion of a silicate phase, the data presented here reinforce the concept of a robust sol-gel reaction template. Also, the rubbery plateau storage modulus was elevated as a result of ionomer formation and more so after the ionomer was imparted with a silicate phase, which illustrates mechanical reinforcement. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These films include poly(ethylene terephthalate) or PET, poly(ethylene naphthalate) or PEN, and aromatic polyamide (ARAMID). PET film is currently the standard substrate used for magnetic tapes; thinner tensilized-type PET, PEN, and ARAMID were recently used as alternate substrates with improved material properties. The thickness of the films ranges from 6.2 to 4.8 μm. Young's modulus of elasticity, F5 value, strain-at-yield, breaking strength, and strain-at-break were obtained at low strain rates by using a tensile machine. Storage (or elastic) modulus, E′, and the loss tangent, tan δ, which is a measurement of viscous energy dissipation, are measured by using a dynamic mechanical analyzer at temperature ranges of -50 to 150°C (for PET), and -50 to 210°C (for PEN and ARAMID), and at a frequency range of 0.016 to 29 Hz. Frequency-temperature superposition was used to predict the dynamic mechanical behavior of the films over a 28 decade frequency range. Results show that ARAMID and tensilized films tend to have higher strength and moduli than standard PET and PEN. The rates of decrease of storage modulus as a function of temperature are lower for PET films than those for PEN and ARAMID films. Storage modulus for PEN films are higher than that for PET films at high frequencies, but this relationship reverses at low frequencies. ARAMID has the highest modulus and strength among the films in this study. The relationship between polymeric structure and mechanical properties are also discussed.","Dynamic mechanical analysis; Loss tangent; Magnetic tape; Polymer film; Storage modulus","Dynamic mechanical analysis; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Magnetic tape; Polyamides; Polyethylene terephthalates; Strain rate; Tensile properties; Thermal effects; Thickness measurement; Ultrathin films; Aromatic polyamide; Loss tangent; Polyethylene naphthalate; Ultrathin polymeric films; Plastic films; film",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037034728

High enzymatic flux capacities through pathways of carbohydrate and long-chain fatty acid oxidation indicate that either substrate can fuel flight. Although hummingbirds are known to rely on fat to fuel migratory flight, short foraging bouts are fueled by the oxidation of carbohydrate, not fat. This allows birds refueling at meadows during migration to deposit fat at higher rates and avoids the energetic inefficiency that results from synthesizing fat from dietary sugar, and then breaking down the fat to fuel foraging flight. On cold mornings in subalpine meadows, refueling hummingbirds achieve net energy gain despite the high energetic costs of thermoregulation and flight. In doing so, they sustain the highest known time-averaged metabolic rates among vertebrates. However, low sucrose concentrations, provided in volumes large enough to allow the maintenance of energy balance at low temperature, result in energy deficit and mass loss. The problem of disposing of dietary water at low ambient temperature when intake rates are elevated suggests that the kidneys may be involved in establishing the upper limit to intake rates and, therefore, maximum sustained metabolic rates. It is suggested that hummingbird behaviour and metabolism have coevolved to maximize net energy gain. Further, the energetics of hummingbird thermoregulation and flight may have influenced the evolution of sucrose content in floral nectar. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This bearing was operated at speeds to 30,000 rpm, equivalent to three million DN, and loads to 445 N (100 1b). Uniqueness of this bearing lies in its application of dry particulate powders to provide a long life, low power loss backup hearing. Impetus behind this development is the necessity for high performance auxiliary bearing systems in magnetic bearing supported rotors. Potential applications include ground and space based Flywheel Energy Storage Systems, Auxiliary and Integrated Power Units and Gas Turbine engines. The two main technology components of this bearing are the palletized powder lubricant delivery system and the powder lubricated journal bearing design. Using established criteria, powder materials suitable for the expected operating environments were reviewed. The selected powder lubricant properties and the design tool were used to fabricate the powder pellets and design the 100 mm diameter powder lubricated bearing which was tested in a magnetically suspended rotor bearing test rig. Tests conducted on this powder lubricated bearing included short duration testing at low speeds, transient shock testing (simulating magnetic bearing failure), high speed testing and lubricant starvation testing. The acquired results spanned the range of the expected operating conditions, including lubricant feed rate, bearing temperatures and operational dynamic performance, clearly validating the lubricant delivery system and the overall powder lubricated bearing design analysis. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Friction; Hydrodynamic; Molybdenum disulfide; Powder lubrication; Quasi-hydrodynamic powder lubrication; Solid lubricants; Solid lubricated; Solid lubricated; Solid lubrication; Wear","Molybdenum Disulfide; Powder Lubrication; Quasi-Hydrodynamic Powder Lubrication; Solid Lubrication; Flywheels; Friction; Gas turbines; Hydrodynamics; Journal bearings; Magnetic bearings; Molybdenum compounds; Solid lubricants; Auxiliary equipment; Energy storage; Lubricants; Powders; Antifriction bearings; Bearings (machine parts); Lubricant delivery system; bearing; hydrodynamic bearing; lubrication; solid lubricant; wear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036006994

We investigated the response to capture stress in male and female Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the breeding season on montane rivers and during moult on coastal waterways of Washington State. Females arrived at the breeding grounds in better condition and had a smaller rise in circulating corticosterone during 1 h of restraint than males. As the breeding season progressed, body condition declined in females and their adrenocortical response to acute stress became more pronounced. A potentially disruptive environmental condition, high river flow during the breeding season, was not associated with lower nesting success, lower body condition indices, or higher corticosterone levels (baseline or maximum concentration). The maximum corticosterone concentration reached over 1 h of restraint was negatively correlated with body condition in females during the breeding season. Lastly, males and females had similar adrenocortical responses to capture and handling during moult.

The precise identity of the types of adipocyte in the mammary gland has never been investigated but was always assumed to be only white fat. In this study, we show that both white and brown adipocytes are present in the postnatal mammary gland. The amount of brown adipose tissue (BAT) examined by histology and electron microscopy correlates with the transcript levels of uncoupling protein 1, which is a mitochondrial carrier expressed exclusively in BAT. Uncoupling protein 1 mRNAs are the highest during prepuberty, decrease upon puberty, and are finally undetectable in the adult mammary gland. The analysis of a BAT-depleted mouse model showed that depletion of mammary BAT in early postnatal development induces epithelial differentiation. Alveolar structures were formed along all ducts and were functional since they produced β-casein. However, mammary transplantation experiments indicated that a systemic effect was responsible for epithelium differentiation.

Aberrations in the control of energy metabolism is apparent in diseases such as diabetes and obesity and is evident early on in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has been observed at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes and is characterized by decreased glucose disposal and increased glucose production, driven by enhanced and uncontrolled fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Mechanisms aimed at limiting the availability of substrates or the activity of processes involved in FAO should provide an immediate reduction in undesired glucose production in these individuals. Numerous targets are available which influence directly the metabolism of fat, including limiting availability of substrate to FAO, inhibiting oxidation of the fatty acid per se, and uncoupling the energy obtained during the oxidation of the fatty acid. These include antilipolytic agents which limit the availability of substrate, FAO inhibitors which limit fatty acid transport (carnitine palmitoyl transferase, CoA sequestration), FAO per se (β oxidation), and agents which uncouple the energy of FAO (uncoupling proteins, β3 agonists).

Phases composed of stoichiometric compounds with two, four and six lithium atoms per molecule are observed. The intercalation involves a substantial charge transfer from the lithium atoms to the molecules. Moreover, a high binding energy of the dopant-induced valence band electronic states is observed by photoelectron spectroscopy. Those observations suggest a high energy storage capacity for small- and medium-size aromatic hydrocarbons and their potential use in batteries. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both donors form a densely packed π-donor shell surrounding the fullerene core. In these novel core-shell ensembles (7 and 19), either an efficient energy transfer from the dialkoxyanthracene periphery, or an electron transfer from the o-phenylene diamine periphery transduces the flow of excited-state energy or electrons, respectively, to the fullerene moiety, which resides in the central core. Due to the relatively high reduction potential of the fullerene core, which is anodically shifted by ≈0.7 V, compared with that of pristine C60, the outcome of these intramolecular reactions depends mainly on the donor ability of the peripheral system. Interestingly, the charge-separated state in the o-phenylene diamine heptad (7; τ = 2380 ns in benzonitrile) is stabilized by a factor of 20 relative to the corresponding o-phenylene diamine dyad (6; τ = 120 ns in benzonitrile), an effect that points unequivocally to the optimized storage of charges in this highly functionalized fullerene ensemble.","Donor-acceptor systems; Electron transfer; Fullerenes; Nanostructures","Electrons; Energy transfer; Reduction; Transducing systems; Chemistry; carbon; fullerene derivative; article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; chemical structure; electron transport; energy transfer; molecular interaction; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037084159

It is also known that this fish is a multiple spawner, which spawns at intervals of a few days for one month, and the sperm introduced into the ovary at the beginning of the spawning season retain their fertilizability for the entire period. To clarify how the fertilizability of sperm is maintained internally, the ultrastructure of sperm, the morphological characteristics related to sperm storage in the ovary, and the characteristics of sperm motility were investigated. Mature sperm generally have the normal form of teleost sperm, devoid of acrosomal structures. However, it was found that the midpiece is comparatively elongated and has a compact aggregation of many small-size mitochondria. The intraovarian sperm remained floating in the ovarian fluid throughout the spawning season. The sperm showed high motility in isotonic and weak alkaline solution, containing sodium ions, which was similar to the ovarian fluid of this fish. Sperm continued to move in artificial ovarian fluid for 7-14 days. Considering these results together, it is thought that the intraovarian sperm move throughout the spawning season due to the plentiful energy generated by the many mitochondria. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"animal; article; cell survival; copulation; female; fertilization; fish; male; mitochondrion; ovary; ovulation; physiology; season; spermatozoon; ultrastructure; Animal; Cell Survival; Copulation; Female; Fertilization; Fishes; Male; Mitochondria; Ovary; Ovulation; Seasons; Spermatozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036462436

This paper addresses hydrogeological issues at the 241-SX tank farm, especially focusing on Tank SX-108, which is one of the highest heat load, supernate density and ionic strength tanks at Hanford and a known leaker. The behavior of contaminants in the unsaturated zone near SX-108 is determined by an interplay of multiphase fluid flow and heat transfer processes with reactive chemical transport in a complex geological setting. Numerical simulation studies were performed to obtain a better understanding of mass and energy transport in the unique hydrogeologic system created by the SX tank farm. Problem parameters are patterned after conditions at Tank SX-108, and measured data were used whenever possible. Borrowing from techniques developed in geothermal and petroleum reservoir engineering, our simulations feature a comprehensive description of multiphase processes, including boiling and condensation phenomena, and precipitation and dissolution of solids. We find that the thermal perturbation from the tank causes large-scale redistribution of moisture and alters water seepage patterns. During periods of high heat load, fluid and heat flow near the tank are dominated by vapor-liquid counterflow (heat pipe), which provides a much more efficient mechanism than heat conduction for dissipating tank heat. The heat pipe mechanism is also very effective in concentrating dissolved solids near the heat source, where salts may precipitate even if they were only present in small concentrations in ambient fluids. Tank leaks that released aqueous fluids of high ionic strength into the vadose zone were also modeled. The heat load causes formation dry-out beneath the tank, which is accompanied by precipitation of solutes. These may become remobilized at a later time when tank temperatures decline and previously dried out regions are rewetted. Simulated temperature and moisture distributions compare well with borehole measurements performed in 2000. The temperature maximum observed beneath Tank SX-108 can be explained from past thermal history of the tank; it is not necessary to invoke heat generation from leaked radioactive contaminants. A novel composite medium model is used to explore effects of moisture tension-dependent anisotropy, which is shown to have important impacts on fluid flow and solute transport in the Hanford sediments.",,"Digital storage; District heating; Flow of fluids; Groundwater; Heat conduction; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Hydrogeology; Ionic strength; Moisture; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Seepage; Solute transport; Tanks (containers); Thermal load; Boiling and condensations; Borehole measurements; Dissolution of solids; Mass and energy transport; Multi-phase fluid flow; Numerical simulation studies; Radioactive contaminants; Underground storage tanks; Transport properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842501729

In experiment 1 the effects of anticoagulants on metabolite measurements and packed-cell volume (PCV) were evaluated. Blood samples (n = 12) were collected into one of four evacuated blood-collecting tubes: No anticoagulant (SER; yields serum), and plasma-yielding sodium heparin (HEP), sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate (NAF), and tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K3EDTA). Anticoagulant affected (P &lt; 0.05) metabolite values, with total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and L-lactate highest in SER, and glucose highest in HEP; NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate measurements were not affected (P &gt; 0.10) by anticoagulant. In addition, among the plasma-yielding tubes, PCV was highest in HEP and lowest in NAF (P &lt; 0.01). Experiment 2 investigated the effects of repetitive freezing-thawing cycles of plasma on metabolite levels. Blood samples (n = 20) were collected using NAF tubes, and plasma was stored at -20°C and thawed in a water bath (21°C) 0, 1, 2, and 3 times within 18 h after collection. Compared with fresh samples (Thaw 0), by thaw 2, L-lactate increased (P &lt; 0.01) 5%, and glucose and total cholesterol decreased (P &lt; 0.001) 13 and 4%, respectively. Plasma NEFA increased 10% (P &lt; 0.01) between thaws 0 and 1, but returned to fresh levels (Thaw 0) with subsequent freeze-thaw cycles (P &lt; 0.05). Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate decreased (P &lt; 0.01) between thaws 0 and 1, but there was no further decline with subsequent freeze-thaw cycles (P &lt; 0.05). Experiment 3 evaluated the effects of plasma storage temperature (-20°C versus -80°C) and length (0-180 days) on metabolite levels in blood samples (n = 12) collected in NAF tubes. All plasma metabolites were affected by storage length (day effect, P &lt; 0.01) but only total cholesterol values were affected by storage temperature, with values being higher in plasma stored at -20 than -80°C (P &lt; 0.01). Glucose measurements were higher in samples stored at -20°C for up to 30 days, but were higher thereafter in samples stored at -80°C (storage length × temperature effect, P &lt; 0.01). Experiment 4 evaluated the effects of anticoagulant (SER versus NAF) and whole blood storage (4°C) for 0, 1, 3, and 7 days on metabolite concentrations. Glucose was higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in NAF, possibly the result of the presence of the glycolytic inhibitor, sodium fluoride, whereas L-lactate, NEFA, total cholesterol and β-hydroxybutyrate were higher in SER (P &lt; 0.01). Total cholesterol, L-lactate, and NEFA increased, whereas β-hydroxybutyrate decreased with days in storage (P &lt; 0.01). Development of hemolysis in the samples artifactually elevated glucose and NEFA values by as much as 41 and 230%, respectively. Attention to proper blood handling, processing, and storage procedures, and avoidance of hemolysis are important in blood clinical analyses and in the proper interpretation of experimental results. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Incomplete factorization (ILU) type preconditioners are used to determine their effectiveness in accelerating GMRES for this application. ILU(τ), which requires the specification of a dropping criteria τ, proves to be a good choice for the types of problems examined in this paper. The combination of ILU(τ) and GMRES is compared with both DSA and unaccelerated transport sweeps for several model problems. It is found that the computational workload of the ILU(τ)-GMRES combination scales nonlinearly with the number of energy groups and quadrature order, making this technique most effective for problems with a small number of groups and discrete ordinates. However, the cost of preconditioner construction can be amortized over several calculations with different source and/or boundary values. Preconditioners built upon standard transport sweep algorithms are also evaluated as to their effectiveness in accelerating the convergence of GMRES. These preconditioners show better scaling with such problem parameters as the scattering ratio, the number of discrete ordinates, and the number of spatial meshes. These sweeps based preconditioners can also be cast in a matrix free form that greatly reduces storage requirements. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Raccoons were collected near a stream drainage system (Steel Creek delta) and a former reactor-cooling reservoir (pond B) that received inputs of mercury-contaminated Savannah River water. Mercury concentrations were determined for hair, liver, kidney, muscle, and spleen tissues. Samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS). Raccoons were also collected from a natural stream floodplain system (Upper Three Runs/Tinker Creek) located upstream of Hg use and storage areas and near coal ash basins. These samples were compared to samples collected from off-site hunting areas near the SRS. Hg concentrations between internal tissues were significantly correlated. Hair did not correlate well with internal tissue and was a weak indicator of raccoon exposure to Hg. Nonetheless, raccoons are potentially good indicators of Hg contamination because tissue concentrations were higher in raccoons from areas with known Hg input than in those from reference areas, and muscle biopsies can be used as biomarkers for contaminant exposure. Muscle Hg concentrations ranged from 0-0.14 ppm from nearby hunting grounds, indicating that people hunting in designated areas near the SRS are at negligible risk for Hg consumption from raccoon meat. Several raccoons collected from the SRS had muscle Hg concentrations at or near the FDA action level for seizing commercial fish due to mercury contamination of 1.0 ppm. Though Hg action levels for wild game have not been proposed, it is clear that some SRS raccoons had Hg levels that warrant concern if these areas would be open to public hunting.

Traditionally it has been thought to be the major source for the production of acetyl-CoA destined for fatty acid formation. Recent work suggested that the accumulation of lipids in developing Arabidopsis seeds was more closely correlated with the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex than with the expression of ACS, suggesting that most of the carbon for fatty acid formation in the plastids of seeds comes from pyruvate rather than from acetate. To explore the role of this enzyme, Arabidopsis plants with altered amounts of ACS were generated by overexpressing its cDNA in either the sense or the antisense configuration. The resulting plants had in vitro enzyme activities that ranged from about 5% to over 400% of wild-type levels. The rate of [1-14C]acetate conversion into fatty acids was closely related to the in vitro ACS activity, showing that the amount of enzyme clearly limited the capacity of leaves to convert exogenous acetate to fatty acids. There was, however, no relationship between the ACS level and the capacity of the plants to incorporate 14CO2 into 14C-labeled fatty acids. These data strongly support the idea that, although plants can convert acetate into fatty acids, relatively little carbon moves through this pathway under normal conditions. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The task, while not difficult in principle, is complicated by two factors. First is the importance of basin snow-cover, soil and water-body storage in the surface water budget. Month-to-month changes in these components are frequently greater than the atmospheric flux terms, for example, during spring snowmelt. Furthermore, there is approximately a six-week lag before local changes are evident in the discharge at the mouth of the basin. Second, the coarse resolution of all of the supporting data may add significant systematic errors. For example, the two radiosonde soundings per day available to the project are unlikely to account adequately for all the moisture generated locally through evapotranspiration during the summer convective season. This analysis will directly address these two main issues by applying hydrologic and atmospheric computations to assess the storage question, and by using additional soundings at a single site to sample the diurnal signature in atmospheric moisture caused by evapotranspiration. Resulting modifications to the atmospheric moisture and surface water budgets then allow near closure of the MAGS monthly water budget within acceptable error limits. © Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society.",,"atmospheric moisture; evapotranspiration; river basin; water budget; water storage; Canada; Mackenzie River Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036020884

In this paper, we focus on the application of a combinatorial approach to two specific material areas, transparent conducting oxides and thin film Si. In the former case, libraries are generated by sputtering and in the latter by the hot-wire chemical vapor deposition. The application of a combinatorial approach to these materials areas can greatly accelerate the rate of discovery and optimization of new materials and the optimization of devices.

Derived ΔG° values indicate that the PuO2+H2O reaction spontaneously forms oxide compositions up to PuO2.5 at 300 K and are consistent with diffraction data for fluorite-related solids formed by PuO2 and amorphous Pu(OH)4 in aqueous solutions. Free energies of formation for PuO2+x at 300 K vary systematically from -246.8±2.0 kcal mol-1 for x=0.1 to -273.9±6.0 kcal mol-1 for x=0.5 and become increasingly positive at elevated temperatures. Estimated equilibrium O2 pressures for the Pu+O2 reaction suggest that 2+x at the upper phase boundary in air falls below 2.5 at 600-700 K and approaches 2.0 above 850 K. Results indicate that H2 pressures generated by the oxide-water reaction in storage containers are not limited by equilibrium and suggest that low firing of oxygenated precipitates forms PuO2+x, a product with enhanced solubility and potential for generating high O2 pressures upon heating. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The relationship between prominence support and the global topology of the surrounding poloidal magnetic field is discussed, with a particular interest in the role of magnetic flux ropes in the support of inverse prominences. A novel solution is also studied describing a rope of purely azimuthal magnetic flux held in equilibrium by the weight of an internal distribution of cold mass and by an external poloidal magnetic field rigidly anchored to the base of the model corona. This solution illustrates the role that prominence weight may play in storing magnetic energy for driving coronal mass ejections.","MHD; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: prominences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013242216

Basic aspects of running Monte Carlo particle transport calculations on parallel architectures are described. Our parallelization is based on equally partitioning photons among the processors and uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for interprocessor communication and the Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator (SPRNG) to generate uncorrelated random number streams. These parallelization techniques are also applicable to other distributed memory architectures. A linear increase in computing speed with the number of processors is demonstrated for up to 32 processors. This speed-up is especially significant in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) simulations involving higher energy photon emitters, where explicit modeling of the phantom and collimator is required. For 131I, the accuracy of the parallel code is demonstrated by comparing simulated and experimental SPECT images from a heart/thorax phantom. Clinically realistic SPECT simulations using the voxel-man phantom are carried out to assess scatter and attenuation correction.

Baumjohann et al. [1996] presented evidence that there is no obvious change in lobe field in ""quiet time"" substorms but that ""storm time"" substorms exhibit the classic pattern of storage and release of lobe field energy. This result led them to speculate that the former are caused by current sheet disruption, while the latter are caused by reconnection of lobe flux. In this paper we examine their hypothesis with a much larger data set using definitions of the two types of substorms similar to theirs, as well as additional more restrictive definitions of these classes of events. Our results show that the only differences between the various classes are the absolute value of the lobe field and the size of the changes. When the data are normalized to unit field amplitude, we find that the percent change during storm time and non-storm time substorms is nearly the same. The above conclusions are demonstrated with superposed epoch analysis of lobe field (Bt and Bz) for four classes of substorms: active times (Dst < -50 nT, mostly recovery phase), main phase substorms, non-storm times (Dst > -25 nT), and quiet time substorms (no evidence of storm in Dst). Epoch zero for the analysis was taken as the main substorm onset (Pi2 onset closest to sharp break in AL index). Our results suggest that there is no qualitative distinction between the various classes of substorms, and so they are all likely to be caused by the same mechanism.

In such designs, the ROB is a complex multi-ported structure that occupies a significant portion of the die area and dissipates a non-trivial fraction of the total chip power, as much as 27% according to some estimates. In addition, an access to such ROB typically takes more than one cycle, impacting the IPC adversely. We propose a low-complexity and low-power ROB design that exploits the fact that the bulk of the source operand values is obtained through data forwarding to the issue queue or through direct reads of the committed register values. Our ROB design uses an organization that completely eliminates the read ports needed to read out operand values for instruction issue. Any consequential performance degradation is countered by using a small number of associatively-addressed retention latches to hold the most recent set of values written into the ROB. The contents of the retention latches are used to satisfy the operand reads for issue that would otherwise have to be read from the ROB slots. Significant savings of the ROB real estate as well as power savings in the range of 20% to 30% for the ROB are achieved using the proposed technique. At the same time, the fact that results are accessible in a single cycle from the retention latches actually leads to an overall improvement in the IPC of up to 3 % on the average for SPEC 2000 benchmarks.","Low-complexity datapath; Low-power design; Reorder buffer","Buffer storage; Computational complexity; Data recording; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Microprocessor chips; Low-complexity recorders; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036374205

A dynamic energy budget model tracks the flow of energy through individuals and is parameterized using the rotifer species Brachionus calyciflorous: Ingested energy is allocated between new growth, energy reserves, and reproductive effort, in proportions determined by the organism's physiological state, leading to a three-way trade-off when food supplies are unpredictable. The model generates testable predictions regarding how variability in food affects optimal allocation strategies. There is selection for indeterminate growth and for norms of reaction in body size, storage, and age at maturity. Harsher environments select for smaller sizes and increased storage and, consequently, greater ability to withstand starvation. The model's predictions about body size, age at maturity, and effects of food deprivation are consistent with experimental results for B. calyciflorous, indicating that these life history traits have all been shaped by evolution of energy allocation and storage strategies in response to environmental variability.","Brachionus calyciflorous; Dynamic energy budget model; Genetic algorithm; Indeterminate growth; Life history theory; Norm of reaction; Rotifers; State-dependent; Storage; Variable environments","bioenergetics; growth; life history theory; reproductive effort; resource allocation; Brachionus; Brachionus calyciflorous; Brachionus calyciflorous; Rotifera; Rotifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038814755

The main innovation is the use of the HTS magnet's bearings that promise low friction so that high momentum storage can be achieved with high spin speed. The bearings consist of seeded growth superconducting discs arranged in rings located above and below the rotating levitated wheel containing ring-magnets embedded at the top and bottom. The reaction wheel is in the shape of a hollow stainless steel cylinder. A brushless dc motor is installed inside the hollow cylinder to provide the necessary torque to the reaction wheel. The maximum design spin speed is 15 000 RPM to store 3.5 J s-1 of angular momentum. Spin-down test of the reaction wheel was performed in air. We have also measured the input power required to sustain rotational speed of the reaction wheel in air. Results from both of these measurements, when extrapolated to full speed in vacuum, indicate that power consumption, even accounting for the needs of the cooling system, is significantly smaller than that for state of the art commercial reaction wheels using mechanical ball bearings.",,"Bearings (machine parts); DC motors; Energy efficiency; Friction; Satellites; Torque; Reaction wheels; High temperature superconductors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036572512

Furthermore, the system can achieve a coordinated turn on high traction surfaces.

We show that IBS calculations for the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) damping ring, when using the formalism of Bjorken-Mtingwa, a modified formalism of Piwinski (where η2/β has been replaced by H), or a simple high-energy approximate formula all give results that agree well. Comparing theory, including the effect of potential well bunch lengthening, with a complete set of ATF steady-state beam size versus current measurements we find reasonably good agreement for energy spread and horizontal emittance. The measured vertical emittance, however, is larger than theory in both offset (zero current emittance) and slope (emittance change with current). Almost all the offset error can be accounted for by considering the expected projected vertical emittance due to machine errors rather than the real emittance. This result is consistent with the assumed Coulomb log factor being close to the correct one. The slope error indicates measurement error and/or additional current-dependent physics at the ATF. © 2002 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18144371584

In these experiments, an rf discharge is used to weakly ionize a volume of air; then a projectile is fired through this plasma. Relative to the conditions without the discharge, the shock standoff distance is observed to increase substantially, and the bow shock becomes flatter. We have modeled the rf discharge and the resulting thermochemical state of the air within the discharge region. Based on these conditions, the projectile flowfield was simulated to determine whether the relaxation of the stored internal energy causes the observed shock movement. The results indicate that the stored internal energy does not relax fast enough to reproduce the experimental results, and, therefore, vibrational energy storage is not responsible for the observed shock movement. We consider two additional mechanisms to explain the experiments: modification of the electric field by the presence of the metallic projectile, and thermal nonuniformities in the plasma. The latter effect appears to provide the best explanation for the observations. We have also modeled experiments in which microwave-discharge excited air flows over a model. Unsteady thermal effects in the pulsed discharge can account for most of the observed drag change.",,"Atmospheric ionization; Electric fields; Mathematical models; Plasma shock waves; Projectiles; Pulsatile flow; Thermal effects; Vibration measurement; Supersonic blunt bodies; Vibrational excitation; Supersonic flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036714212

In this communication, we use high resolution chlorophyll fluorescence imaging techniques under strictly controlled conditions to quantify day courses of relative effective quantum yield (φPSII) of an entire leaf of the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant Kalanchoë daigremontiana at different light intensities. Careful interpretation of the combined gas exchange and fluorescence data, in combination with micro malate samples, allow the interpretation of underlying metabolic properties, such as leaf internal CO2 concentration (ciCO2) and energy demand of the cells. Spatial variations of φPSII, which occur as running wave fronts at the transition from phase III to phase IV of CAM, may reflect spatial differences of ciCO2, which are preserved in the tightly packed mesophyll cells of K. daigremontiana. An endogenous rhythm is driven by a master switch which mediates between malate storage and malate release to and from the vacuole, however, using fluorescence techniques, four different metabolic states can be distinguished which also account for the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.","Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging; Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM); Internal CO2 concentration; Kalanchoë daigremontiana; Malate; Photosynthetic efficiency; Quantum yield of photosynthesis","chlorophyll; crassulacean acid metabolism; endogenous cue; fluorescence; monitoring; photosynthesis; Kalanchoe daigremontiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036873124

These functionalities depend upon the volume fraction of porosity, type (open/closed) and pore size. The independent controllable pore volume fraction, pore size and fraction of open and closed porosity of these structures offers the possibility of tailoring a structures properties to specific applications. Here, the elastic stiffness and acoustic attenuation of highly porous structures made from hollow gas atomized superalloy spheres have been measured. The Young's and elastic shear moduli were deduced from ultrasonic wave velocities while the acoustic attenuation was evaluated from the temporal decay of laser induced standing acoustic waves. The elastic stiffness of these structures varied with the pore volume fraction and the acoustic attenuation scaled with the pore volume fraction and size. The unique attributes of these hollow powder cellular structures offer the potential to tailor their properties for individual applications thereby exploiting the multi-functional nature of these structures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Despite this, virtually all on-chip array structures use six-transistor (6T) static RAM cells that store data indefinitely. In this paper we propose the use of quasi-static four-transistor (4T) RAM cells. Quasi-static 4T cells provide both energy and area savings. These cells have no connection to Vdd and thus inherently provide decay functionality: values are refreshed upon access but discharge over time without use. This makes 4T cells uniquely well-suited for predictive structures like branch predictors and BTBs where data integrity is not essential. We use quantitative evaluations (both circuit-level and cycle-level) to explore the design space and quantify the opportunities. Overall, 4T-based branch predictors offer 12-33% area savings and 60-80% leakage savings with minimal performance impact. More broadly, this paper suggests a new view of how to support transient data in power-aware processors.","4T; Decay; Leakage power; Memory cell; Quasi-static; Transient data","Buffer storage; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Threshold voltage; Transistors; Leakage power; Memory cell; Transient data; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036953963

Several approaches are available: internal core heating; external electric heating of a module; internal electric heating in the module around each cell, internal fluid heating around each cell; and external fluid heating around each module. To identify the most energy efficient approach, we built and analyzed several transient thermal finite element models of a typical battery. The thermal transient response of the battery core was computed for the first four heating techniques, which were compared based on the energy required to bring the battery to the desired temperature in a given time. Battery core heating was the most effective method to warm battery quickly with the least amount of energy.

The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine to drive a radial-gap permanent magnet alternator at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the permanent magnet alternator is diode-rectified to a high voltage (∼400 V) dc link, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. As part of the power electronics for this unit, a 7 Kw bi-directional dc-dc converter has also been developed. The converter can charge 24 V batteries that are used to start the internal combustion engine and to power auxiliary low voltage dc loads. Additionally, the bi-directional converter can also draw power from the batteries to help maintain the high voltage dc link during severe load transients. Because of stringent weight and volume requirements for this application, the minimum in energy storage elements (high frequency transformers, capacitors, and inductors) was used. This paper presents a description and experimental analysis of this novel dc-dc converter design.",,"Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Internal combustion engines; Permanent magnets; Synchronous generators; Thermal effects; Mobile generators; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036443066

To determine whether less time consuming and invasive methods could be employed, we examined whether selected indices of insulin sensitivity derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (ISOGTT) or fasting glucose/insulin levels (ISQUICKI and ISHOMA) can be used to predict insulin sensitivity in women before and during pregnancy. A 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (5 mol/L glucose, 40 mU·m-2·min-1 insulin), and 120 min OGTT (75 gload pregravid, 100 g pregnant), was repeated on 15 women [10 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 5 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)], pregravid, and during both early (12-14 weeks) and late (34-36 weeks) pregnancy. An index of insulin sensitivity derived from the clamp (ISCLAMP) was obtained from glucose infusion rates adjusted for change in fat free mass and endogenous glucose production measured using [6,6-2H2]-glucose. Univariate analysis with combined groups and periods of pregnancy resulted in significant correlations between ISCLAMP and ISOGTT (r2 = .74, P &lt; .0001), ISQUICKI (r2 = .64, P &lt; .0001), and ISHOMA (r2 = .53, P &lt; .0001). The ISOGTT provided a significantly better correlation (P &lt; .0001) than either ISQUICKI, or ISHOMA. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant group effect (P &lt; .0003) on the prediction model, and separate equations were developed for the NGT (r2 = .64, P &lt; .0001) and GDM (r2 = .85, P &lt; .0001) groups. When subdivided by period of pregnancy the correlation between ISCLAMP and ISOGTT pregravid was r2 .63, P = .0002, during early pregnancy; r2 = .80, P &lt; .0001 and during late pregnancy; r2 = .64, P = .0002. The ISOGTT provides an excellent means of estimating maternal insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. The information obtained from the ISOGTT will be useful in making clinical decisions on maternal care and facilitating optimal pregnancy outcome. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Varying the direction of the magnetic field can change the easy axis orientation. We believe that the magnetically induced alignment of the ferro-liquid crystal (LC) suspension is caused by adsorption of the ferro-particles on the glass surface and this alignment can be manipulated with a magnetic field.

In an effort to better understand the performance of these lubricant films, the dynamic behavior of nanoscale, perfluoropolyether lubricant films is analyzed via kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. The lattice-based model, which represents lubricant molecules as simple reactive spheres, specifically includes long-range van der Waals, molecule-surface; interlayer, polar endgroup-endgroup coupling; and polar endgroup-surface coupling interactions. The full-blown three dimensional capabilities of the model allow for a detailed nanostructure analysis of the lubricant films. The model is used to investigate the steady-state surface structure of lubricant films, which describes the dewetting phenomenon and is examined via a function of the interaction parameters, surface loading, and initial surface structure. The evolution of the surface structures is monitored to better understand the mechanism for dewetting or ""mogul"" dynamics. This modeling effort initializes the groundwork for future research with heterogeneous, polar films. Critical endgroup-endgroup and endgroup-surface interaction energies are identified in terms of film dewetting.

Significant changes in the utilization of stored lipids may occur during reproduction and the patterns of utilization observed often differ between females and males. Changes in levels of stored lipid reserves have been described extensively in animals from many taxa, but detailed biochemical analyses of alterations in the enzymes and substrates regulating lipid metabolism during periods of active reproductive effort rarely have been performed. In addition, few studies have compared males and females from the same population during the same reproductive season. In this study we examined lipid metabolism in free-living female and male tree lizards across a single reproductive season. We measured lipid stores, circulating lipid substrates, and the activities of enzymes regulating lipid storage and release in both liver and adipose tissue. Overall, females and males showed significant variation in abdominal fat body mass, liver total lipid, the activity of an enzyme regulating fat storage (DGAT) in both of these tissues, and circulating free fatty acids across the reproductive season. In females, total fat body mass, adipose DGAT, liver lipid, and liver DGAT significantly varied across reproductive stage, with vitellogenic and Gravid females often at opposite extremes. In males, fat body mass and liver fat varied across reproductive stage (without significant variation in DGAT in either tissue), as did circulating glycerol and free fatty acids. Correlations among sex steroid hormone levels and lipid metabolism variables suggested a role for these hormones in producing the patterns observed in each sex and in the observed sex differences lipid metabolism. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Developing effective strategies to optimize hourly bid curves for a hydrothermal power system to maximize profits becomes one of the most important tasks of a GenCo. This paper presents a unified framework for optimizing energy and reserve bidding strategies under a deregulated market. In view of high volatilities of market clearing prices (MCP), the hourly MCPs and reserve prices are modeled as discrete random variables, whose probability mass functions are predicted with a classification based neural network approach. The mean-variance method is applied to manage bidding risks, where a risk penalty term related to MCP and reserve price variances is added to the objective function. To avoid buying too much power from the market at high prices, a GenCo may also require covering at least a certain percentage of its own customer load. This self-scheduling requirement is modeled similar to the system demand in traditional unit commitment problems. The formulation is a stochastic mixed-integer optimization with a separable structure. An optimization based algorithm combining Lagrangian relaxation and stochastic dynamic programming is presented to optimize bids for both energy and reserve markets. Numerical testing based on an 11-unit system in New England market shows that the method can significantly reduce profit variances and thus reduce bidding risks. Near-optimal energy and reserve bid curves are obtained in 4-5 minutes on a 600Hz Pentium III PC, efficient for daily use.","Bidding strategies; Deregulation; Pumped-storage unit; Reserve market; Risk management; Unit commitment","Algorithms; Deregulation; Dynamic programming; Electric load management; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Optimization; Probability; Pumped storage power plants; Random processes; Risk management; Scheduling; Strategic planning; Electric power industry; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036085597

Fatty acid oxidation defects encompass a spectrum of clinical disorders, including recurrent hypoglycemic, hypoketotic encephalopathy or Reye-like syndrome in infancy with secondary seizures and potential developmental delay, progressive lipid storage myopathy, recurrent myoglobinuria, neuropathy, and progressive cardiomyopathy. As all of the known conditions are inherited as autosomal recessive diseases, there is often a family history of sudden infant death syndrome in siblings. Early recognition and prompt initiation of therapy and the institution of preventive measures may be life saving and significantly decrease long-term morbidity, particularly with respect to central nervous system sequelae. Seizures may be the result of cerebral bioenergetic failure associated with acute episodes of hypoglycemic, hypoketotic encephalopathy, or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the context of cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiomyopathy. This review provides an overview of the fatty acid oxidation pathway and the central role of carnitine, as well as a discussion of normal fasting adaptation and the critical metabolic adaptations that occur at birth.

They are widely used as a substitute for X-ray films for diagnostic studies. In diagnostic radiology this technology is known as computed radiography. In this work, the energy response of a commercial IP to beta-particle reference radiation fields used for calibrations at the National Institute of Standards and Technology was investigated. The absorbed dose in the active storage phosphor layer was calculated following the scaling procedure for depth dose for high Z materials with reference to water. It was found that the beta particles from Pm-147 and Kr-85 gave 68% and 24% higher PSL responses than that induced by Sr-90, respectively, which was caused by the different PSL detection efficiencies. In addition, normalized response curves of the IPs as a function of depth in polystyrene were measured and compared with the data measured using extrapolation chamber techniques. The difference between both sets of data resulted from the continuous energy change as the beta particle travels across the material, which leads to a different PSL response. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Artificial groundwater recharge started in the late 1980s and as of the year 2000, the Southern Nevada Water Authority entities have recharged over 246,000,000 m 3 (200,000 acre-ft) of water, which is in storage in the valley's aquifer system. Benefits from artificial recharge accrue to all valley residents, but in particular to municipal-industrial, domestic, public supply, and commercial well owners. The benefits are lower energy costs for pumping, decreased need to deepen wells, lower maintenance for wells that could potentially be damaged by subsidence, and additional for the aquifer system. Although artificial recharge is currently a ""free"" benefit to all nonmunicipal groundwater pumpers, active management of the aquifer system would be enhanced by participation of all users in the artificial recharge program. In an effort to include all groundwater pumpers in the management of the aquifer system, a groundwater management program (GMP) was established. The costs and benefits for participation by nonmunicipal groundwater pumpers are presented, indicating a savings of about $700 annually for nonmunicipal members of the GMP.","Cost analysis; Ground-water management; Ground-water recharge; Nevada","Artificial recharge; Participation; Cost benefit analysis; Energy management; Recharging (underground waters); Water well pumps; Aquifers; artificial recharge; cost-benefit analysis; groundwater resource; resource management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036717055

Inadequate rainfall and soil compaction, which limits root exploration of stored soil water, exacerbate this problem. Potential solutions, though costly and energy intensive, include irrigation and annual deep tillage. Sometimes, doing both provides additive yield increases for corn. The objectives of this study were: (1) to prove a site-specific irrigation system, and (2) to test the separate and combined effects of irrigation, tillage, N-fertilizer, and crop rotation on corn and soybean yield. A center-pivot irrigation system that had been modified to allow variable-rate water and nutrient applications to 100-m2 plots within the system was used to manage an experiment with corn-soybean rotation, irrigation, deep tillage, and N-fertilizer treatments during 1995-1998. The modified center-pivot system satisfactorily applied water and N fertilizer to the treatment areas, and reliability of the control system improved during this experiment. Irrigation increased corn yield all years (8% to 135%) and soybean yield three of four years (26% to 31%). Deep tillage increased yield in only two years, for corn (4% to 6%). For these soil and weather conditions, irrigation increased corn and soybean yields more consistently than deep tillage. The site-specific irrigation facility performed as expected and should provide the research infrastructure to answer many long-standing questions about irrigated cropping systems in the southeastern Coastal Plain.","Center pivot; Precision agriculture; Site-specific irrigation; Soil compaction; Soil water storage","Compaction; Crops; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Soils; Deep tillage; Agricultural engineering; crop; irrigation; soil; water; cereal; irrigation; nitrogen; soil water; soybean; tillage; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036590374

Their performance is dependent upon interface morphology which is a sensitive function of deposition condition such as the deposition rate, deposition temperature, and flux angle of incidence. A two-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo method has been developed and used to explore these effects during the growth of model Ni/Cu/Ni multilayers under low adatom impact energy conditions where thermal diffusion is the only mechanism of atomic assembly. An embedded atom method potential with a two-body cross-potential was used for calculation of the activation energies. It takes into account both the atomic configuration of neighboring atoms and their species. Using an extended set of activation barriers the simulations demonstrate that the interface roughness increases almost linearly with increasing layer thickness during the growth, and is more pronounced when depositing a nickel layer than when depositing a copper layer. The deposition of copper is found to help smooth nickel layers. The simulations demonstrate the existence of an optimal growth window in deposition rate-temperature space where the interfacial roughness of a Ni/Cu/Ni multilayer could be minimized. By analyzing the details of individual atomic jumps, the cause of the surface instability is revealed to be the activation and rapid increase of reverse Schwoebel jumps above a temperature threshold. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This trend started in commercial shipping, especially cruise ships, and there is now a move to adopt the benefits in military systems [1]. This paper describes the design and analysis of a very large actuator for a military ship system - an Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launching System, or EMALS, which will accelerate aircraft to flight speeds in very short distances. The aim is to replace the steam catapult currently used on aircraft carriers with a linear electric motor. The entire system should fit within the confines of the existing steam catapult. The advantages of such a system are increased operational availability, lower airframe stress due to programmable acceleration profiles, and reduced maintenance (and hence reduced manning). The goal of the study described here is to investigate the many feasible solutions and to use simulations to compare their performance. This paper reports on the initial stages of the work, which uses the Virtual Test Bed (VTB) as the simulation and virtual prototyping environment. This yields substantial side benefits because the EMALS research program represents a meaningful test case for the VTB itself. Models of the different parts of the systems are being built up from the specifications and the characteristics required by the U.S. Navy, and will be refined with increasing detail as the project is developed.",,"Acceleration; Actuators; Airframes; Catapults (aircraft launchers); Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric network topology; Electromagnetic launchers; Military aircraft; Power electronics; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Electric actuators; Electromagnetic aircraft launch systems; Steam catapult; Virtual test bed; Linear motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036443026

The aim of this study was to examine whether the distribution of body fat depots is related to impaired endothelial function in older men. METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of 38 older (68±1 y) sedentary (VO2max=2.4±0.1 l/min) men. Flow-mediated endothelial dependent vasodilation (EDD) was assessed in the brachial artery in response to reactive hyperemia using high-resolution ultrasound. Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat depots were assessed by computed tomography scan (CT-scan) at the L4-L5 region in the supine position. Percentage body fat was assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). RESULTS: Flow-mediated percentage change in brachial artery was 7.64±0.7%, suggesting an impaired flow-mediated EDD. Using simple linear regression analysis, there were no statistically significant relationship observed between flow-mediated EDD and the indices of total and abdominal adiposity (percentage body fat=29.3±0.9%, r= -0.11; total abdominal fat area=465±23 cm2, r= -0.1; intra-abdominal fat area=200±14 cm2, r= -0.14; subcutaneous fat area=265±13 cm2, r= -0.05; BMI=29.3±0.9 kg/m2, r= -0.07; and waist to hip ratio=0.98±0.01, r= -0.20).

Coullana sp., a meiobenthic harpacticoid copepod, is abundant in Louisiana salt marshes and has high incidence (∼50%) of ciliate epibionts. Field and laboratory grazing experiments indicated that ciliate epibionts did not hinder Coullana feeding on benthic or planktonic algae. Contrary to expectations, Coullana with high levels of ciliate epibionts (&gt; 8 ind-1) grazed at a significantly higher rate on 14C-labeled benthic diatoms added to intact sediment cores than did Coullana with no epibionts. Coullana neutral lipids (examined using Nile Red, a hydrophobic fluorophore) were not significantly influenced by the presence of ciliate epibionts, suggesting that copepods are able to compensate for any additional energetic demands imposed by epibionts. Epibiont effects on Coullana susceptibility to hydrocarbon contaminants were measured by examining survivorship in diesel-spiked sediments. The presence of ciliate epibionts significantly decreased survivorship at relatively low PAH concentrations (12.8 ppm).

The relative effectiveness of the pull and shear methods is compared using BGA packages with documented susceptibility to brittle interfacial failure during accelerated temperature cycling tests or isothermal aging. Accelerated temperature cycling is used typically to measure long term solder joint attachment reliability in various use environments and isothermal aging is used to measure susceptibility to degradation following high temperature storage. The shear and pull tests are conducted on packages in the as received condition and after thermal preconditioning.

With respect to the pure metal, Ni d states appear to be strongly modified upon alloying. The experimental investigation of the icosahedral alloy shows good agreement with the theoretical calculations for the approximant.

Our benchmarks show a system (processor + off-chip bus + off-chip memory) power savings of 28% to 36%, an energy savings of 13% to 35%, all while increasing the execution time in the range of 1% to 29%.

This habit necessitates long-term sperm storage, which considerably lengthens the fertile period of the female. This in turn increases the amount of time available to females to engage in extrapair copulations. Because food delivered by the male is the primary source of energy for female maintenance, egg production, incubation, female moult and offspring provisioning, male parental investment (and thus cuckoldry) in these hornbills is extremely expensive. This combination of costly male parental care and female dependence potentially places hornbills at a critical endpoint in the spectrum of genetic promiscuity operating within pairs of socially monogamous birds. A paradigm of reproductive conflict suggests that these factors might allow males to coerce females into a state of genetic monogamy. Sperm storage, however, might allow female hornbills to thwart monopolization attempts by their mates. We used minisatellite multilocus DNA fingerprinting to analyse paternity in a Namibian population of Monteiro's hornbill, Tockus monteiri. Despite the ability of female hornbills to store sperm for long periods, we found no evidence of extrapair paternity (EPP). Although we cannot explicitly rule out a role for coercion in the evolution of the genetic monogamy we observed, the benefits of EPP appear to be devalued to the point that the reproductive interests of males and females overlap considerably. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The motivation for this work is the development of a lightweight actuation system with system energy and power densities significantly greater than a DC motor and battery combination. For the scale of interest, the design tradeoffs between complexity of an energy conversion system and fuel specific energy density make many conventional approaches inappropriate. Conventional actuation, such as a battery powered DC motor system, does not possess adequate energy storage to perform significant amounts of mechanical work for significant periods of time autonomously. A system design comparison for a six-degree of freedom walking robot is presented which compares the expected performance of a monopropellant powered actuation system to a battery powered DC motor system. Results from this comparison demonstrate the viability of such an approach and indicate significant increases in energy and power densities.

We determined wingbeat kinematics and mechanical power expenditure for one of the largest flower bats (Leptonycteris curasoae Martinez and Villa) during hovering flight in normodense and hypodense gas mixtures. Additional experiments examined the effects of supplemental oxygen availability on maximum flight performance. Bats failed to sustain hovering flight at normoxic air densities averaging 63% that of normodense air. Kinematic responses to hypodense aerodynamic challenge involved increases in wing positional angles and in total stroke amplitude; wingbeat frequency was unchanged. At near-failure air densities, total power expenditure assuming perfect elastic energy storage was 17-42% greater than that for hovering in normodense air, depending on the assumed value for the profile drag coefficient. Assuming a flight muscle ratio of 26%, the associated muscle-mass-specific power output at the point of near-failure varied between 90.8 W kg-1 (profile drag coefficient of 0.02) to 175.6 W kg-1 (profile drag coefficient of 0.2). Hyperoxia did not enhance hovering performance in hypodense air, and, with the exception of a small increase (10%) in stroke plane angle, yielded no significant change in any of the kinematic parameters studied. Revised energetic estimates suggest that mechanical power expenditure of hovering glossophagines is comparable with that in slow forward flight.","Aerodynamics; Bat; Density; Flight; Glossophagine; Hovering; Hyperoxia; Leptonycteris curasoae; Power","oxygen; air; animal; article; bat; biomechanics; energy metabolism; flying; forelimb; physiology; Air; Animals; Biomechanics; Chiroptera; Energy Metabolism; Flight, Animal; Oxygen; Wing; Animalia; Glossophaginae; Leptonycteris; Leptonycteris curasoae; Phyllostomidae; Vertebrata; Villa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036909384

This remapping algorithm is the first fully automatic approach applicable to pointer-intensive dynamic applications. We show that data remapping can be used to significantly reduce the energy consumed as well as the memory size needed to meet a user-specified performance goal (i.e., execution time) - relative to the same application executing without being remapped. These twin advantages afforded by a remapped program - reduced cache size and energy needs - constitute a key step in a framework for design space exploration: for any given performance goal, remapping allows the user to reduce the primary and secondary cache size by 50%, yielding a concomitant energy savings of 57%. Additionally, viewed as a compiler optimization for a fixed processor, we show that remapping improves the energy consumed by the cache subsystem by 25%. All of the above savings are in the context of the cache subsystem in isolation. We also show that remapping yields an average 20% energy saving for an ARM-like processor and cache subsystem. All of our improvements are achieved in the context of DIS, OLDEN and SPEC2000 pointer-centric benchmarks.","Data remapping; Design space exploration; Power aware","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Data remapping; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036974895

To achieve high energy density requires miniaturization of the “rest of the system”, which can be achieved by incorporation of emerging MEMS technology. High conversion efficiency also presents a challenge to portable electronics designers to provide high efficiency electronics that support fuel cell operation. An additional challenge concerns the safety of a micro fuel cell system, particularly with respect to fuel handling and storage.

Powered by a single-phase sinusoidal power-clock, our SRAM delivers read and write operations with single-cycle latency. To that end, a precharge-low scheme is employed along with a modified sense amplifier design that achieves high efficiency at differential voltages near VSS. A simple control circuit is used to maintain driver operation in synchrony with the power-clock waveform. Feedback circuitry from the driver output to the control circuit ensures that our driver remains efficient, independent of the access pattern. Our energy recovering SRAM functions correctly while achieving substantial energy savings over a wide range of supply voltages and operating frequencies. Hspice simulations of a simple full-custom adiabatic 256×256 SRAM, that includes the energy recovering bit/word line drivers, the cell array, and the sense amplifiers, show over 2.6x energy savings at 3V, 300MHz in comparison with its conventional counterpart.","Adiabatic circuitry; Cache memories; Charge recovery; Low-energy design; Low-power computing; On-chip memories","Buffer storage; Computer aided design; Data storage equipment; Electric frequency measurement; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Power control; Random access storage; Voltage measurement; Differential voltages; Energy recovering memory; Low energy design; On chip memory; Power clock waveform; Power dissipation; Static random access memory; Power electronics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036954547

The dc-dc converter serves two main purposes. Firstly, it is used as the power electronics interface required for load leveling EV batteries. By employing high power ultracapacitors, the battery energy density and peak power density requirements are decoupled, offering opportunities to design and use EV batteries that are optimized for energy density, life and low cost, with less attention being given to the peak power. Secondly, the dc-dc converter is used to achieve speed extension and constant power operation of the BLDCM. To determine how well the dc-dc converter works together with the inverter/motor, and to develop a proper control method for the whole propulsion system, mathematical analysis and Matlab/Simulink simulations were carried out based on control theories. The zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) technique has been adopted in the bidirectional dc-dc converter to solve the problems associated with high frequency operation of PWM power converters, such as high switching loss resulting in low efficiency thus requiring larger heat sinks, and severe EMI noise. The final ZVT bidirectional dc-dc converter had an efficiency of greater than 96%.",,"Capacitors; Computer simulation; Electric inverters; Electric propulsion; Numerical analysis; Optimization; Power control; Power electronics; Storage battery vehicles; Battery energy density; Brushless dc machine; Switching loss; Zero voltage transition; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036444952

In this paper, we develop a control methodology to endow the resulting n-DOF common passive mechanical tool with useful passive tool dynamics which incorporates inertia scaling, guidance/avoidance system while preserving energetic passivity of the closed-loop system. A fictitious energy storage is used to scale the apparent inertia of the teleoperator. The passive velocity field control [2] for a velocity field tracking and artificial potential function are utilized for guidance/avoidance system. Thus, with the control law proposed in [1], the control law renders the 2n-DOF teleoperator as a n-DOF common passive mechanical tool which has programmable apparent inertia and moves under the effects of velocity/potential field tailored to task objectives and obstacles in the workspace.",,"Closed loop control systems; Collision avoidance; Control system synthesis; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Differential equations; Energy storage; Manipulators; Matrix algebra; Mechanical control equipment; Nonlinear control systems; Velocity control; Artificial potential function; Bilateral control; Common passive mechanical tool; Energetic passivity; Inertia scaling; Passive tool dynamics rendering; Teleoperation system; Remote control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036060540

In parallel, the formulation of high-performance materials that are stronger and more durable than conventional cement-based materials has emerged as an issue of considerable importance in the construction industry. This paper shows that it is possible to utilize fly ash, a byproduct of coal burning, to produce a high-performance material at a potentially lower cost and without compromising its structural integrity. The high-performance material reported in this study is polymer concrete (PC) made with fly-ash fillers. The PC is investigated for its compressive strength, flexural strength, creep deformation, and bond strength of PC overlay on portland cement concrete under thermal cycling. The use of fly ash as an aggregate in PC is very promising because it enhances the physical properties of the material and particularly its compressive and flexural strength. PC using fly ash could be used as an overlay in pavement, bridges, and runways or in precast applications such as utility, transportation, and hydraulic components.","Compressive strength; Creep; Fly ash; Polymer concretes; Recycling","Creep deformation; Electrical energy; Fly-ash fillers; Polymer concretes (PC); Structural integrity; Bending strength; Byproducts; Coal combustion; Compressive strength; Creep; Deformation; Electric energy storage; Fly ash; Plastics fillers; Polymers; Portland cement; Recycling; Thermal cycling; Concretes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142573979

In the first of two experiments, we compared birds under 24 h:24 h (fasting:ad libitum feeding) food restriction with controls under continuous ad libitum feeding. In the second experiment, we compared birds under 24 h:6 h:12 h:6 h (fasting:ad libitum:fasting:ad libitum) food restriction with birds under 24 h:24 h food restriction. We estimated total energy expended on activities from daily mass balance using an additive model based on measures of gross energy intake, thermoregulation, basal metabolism, and a sensitivity analysis of gross utilization efficiency and energy density of reserve body tissue. Dunlin under 24 h:24 h food restriction overcompensated for body mass lost while fasting, increasing their body mass relative to controls fed ad libitum. Dunlin under 24 h:6 h: 12 h:6 h food restriction were unable to recover body mass lost during the first fasting day. When allowed to feed, food-restricted birds reduced the amount of energy spent on being active and increased food intake and energy storage relative to controls, but when forced to fast, they increased their activity energy expenditure. These patterns suggest winter body mass regulation consistent with the behaviors of free-living dunlin in winter.","Body mass regulation; Calidris alpina; Dunlins; Energy balance; Food availability; Metabolism; Shorebirds; Winter storms","bioenergetics; body mass; food availability; overwintering; wader; California; Tomales Bay; United States; Aves; Calidris; Calidris alpina; Calidris alpina; Scolopacidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036863914

In this system, the cool storage unit was the most important unit. From the viewpoint of safety and economy, it was most promising to store the cold energy as the sensitive heat of a solid such as pebbles or concrete. A simulator was developed to predict temperature variations of the solid cool storage unit. The simulator calculated unsteady heat transfer between a supercritical gas flow and the solid material. Comparison of calculated and experimental results showed that the temperature variation of the metal cool storage medium was accurate within 11%. The calculated results showed for the concrete cool storage unit that a smaller quantity of medium was required with a smaller pitch of the tube. The minimum quantity of concrete calculated at the smallest pitch was three times that of concrete, which was simply estimated from the heat capacity of concrete and air. The volume required for concrete cool storage was less than 1/100 that of reservoirs for a pumped-hydro power station having a vertical drop of 500 m. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previous value prediction research allows for generous assumptions regarding table configurations and access conditions, while ignoring prediction latencies and energy issues. However, the latency of a high-performance value predictor cannot always be completely hidden by the early stages of the instruction pipeline as previously assumed, and it causes noticeable performance degradation versus unconstrained value prediction. This paper describes and compares several variations of basic value prediction methods: at-fetch, post-decode, and decoupled. The performance of at-fetch and post-decode value predictors is limited by the high access latency of accurate predictor configurations. Decoupled value prediction excels at overcoming the high-frequency table access constraints by placing completion-time predictions into a separate and easily accessible storage. However, it has high energy requirements. We study a value prediction approach that combines the latency-friendly approach of decoupled value prediction with a more energy-efficient implementation. The traditional PC-indexed prediction tables are removed and replaced by a queue of prediction traces. This latency and energy aware method of maintaining and distributing speculated values leads to a 58%-95% reduction in value predictor energy consumption versus known value prediction techniques while still maintaining high performance.","Complexity-effective design; Data speculation; Low power; Trace cache processors","Decoding; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Personal computers; High-frequency processors; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036374279

Various proxy measures of fitness based on measurable biological quantities, such as average population size or average per-capita fecundity, fail to predict evolutionary stable strategies. The predicted strategies indicate that selection strongly favors storage allocation for juveniles, but only for adults when prey densities are high.

Compression is an useful and widely employed mechanism to reduce the memory requirements of the system. As the leakage energy of a memory system increases with its size and because of the increasing contribution of leakage to overall system energy, compression also has a significant effect on reducing energy consumption. However, storing compressed data/instructions has a performance and energy overhead associated with decompression at runtime. The underlying compression algorithm, the corresponding implementation of the decompression and the ability to reuse decompressed information critically impact this overhead. In this paper, we explore the influence of compression on overall memory energy using a commercial embedded Java virtual machine (JVM) and a customized compression algorithm. Our results show that compression is effective in reducing energy even when considering the runtime decompression overheads for most applications.","Compression; Embedded Java; Leakage energy","Algorithms; Data compression; Data storage equipment; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy utilization; Java programming language; Response time (computer systems); Java virtual machine; Leakage energy; Scratch pad memory; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036047123

Runoff ratios were low, and evapotranspiration accounted for most of the precipitation over the area. The accumulated storage change, over the 3 year period, was 47 mm or 3.4% of the total precipitation, but precipitation exceeded the sum of discharge and evapotranspiration by 80 mm or 15% of the precipitation in 1994.

This bearing was operated at speeds to 30,000 rpm, equivalent to three million DN, and loads to 445 N (100 lb). Uniqueness of this bearing lies in its application of dry particulate powders to provide a long life, low power loss backup bearing. Impetus behind this development is the necessity for high performance auxiliary bearing systems in magnetic bearing supported rotors. Potential applications include ground and space based Flywheel Energy Storage Systems. Auxiliary and Integrated Power Units and Gas Turbine engines. The two main technology components of this bearing are the pelletized powder lubricant delivery system and the powder lubricated journal bearing design. Using established criteria, powder materials suitable for the expected operating environments were reviewed. The selected powder lubricant properties and the design tool were used to fabricate the powder pellets and design the 100 mm diameter powder lubricated bearing which was tested in a magnetically suspended rotor bearing test rig. Tests conducted on this powder lubricated bearing included short duration testing at low speeds, transient shock testing (simulating magnetic bearing failure), high speed testing and lubricant starvation testing. The acquired results spanned the range of the expected operating conditions, including lubricant feed rate, bearing temperatures and operational dynamic performance, clearly validating the lubricant delivery system and the overall powder lubricated bearing design analysis.","Friction; Hydrodynamics; Molybdenum disulfide; Powder lubrication; Quasi-hydrodynamic powder lubrication; Solid lubricants; Solid lubricated; Solid lubrication; Wear","Design; Hydrostatic bearings; Lubrication; Pelletizing; Powder lubricants; Hydrodynamics; hydrodynamic bearing; molybdenum disulfide; solid lubricant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036591807

The parallelization philosophy and its implementation as a platform-independent solver is discussed. A performance analysis is carried out to determine the communication and storage requirements, and the associated overhead. As a case study, the LES methodology is used for a parametric investigation of swirl effects on the turbulent reacting flow in the gas-turbine.","Large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulent combustion; Parallel computing","Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Flame research; Gas turbines; Kinetic energy; Swirling flow; Turbulent flow; Large-eddy simulation (LES) algorithms; Turbulent combustions; Parallel processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036568738

Corp., Boulder, CO 80306, United States","Philbrick, R.H., Ball Aerospace and Technol. Corp., Boulder, CO 80306, United States","A software model is described that performs a ""real world"" simulation of the operation of several types of charge-coupled device (CCD)-based detectors in order to accurately predict the impact that high-energy proton radiation has on image distortion and modulation transfer function (MTF). The model was written primarily to predict the effectiveness of vertical preflushing on the custom full frame CCD-based detectors intended for use on the proposed Kepler Discovery mission, but it is capable of simulating many other types of CCD detectors and operating modes as well. The model keeps track of the occupancy of all Phosphorous-Silicon (P-V), Divacancy (V-V) and Oxygen-Silicon (O-V) defect centers under every CCD electrode over the entire detector area. The integrated image is read out by simulating every electrode-to-electrode charge transfer in both the vertical and horizontal CCD registers. A signal level dependency on the capture and emission of signal is included and the current state of each electrode (e.g., barrier or storage) is considered when distributing integrated and emitted signal. Options for performing preflushing, preflashing, and including mini-channels are available on both the vertical and horizontal CCD registers. In addition, dark signal generation and image transfer smear can be selectively enabled or disabled.

It functions not only in energy storage and intermediary metabolism but also in detoxification, communication and the immune response. Some of these functions are confined to distinct groups of fat body cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, discrete precursor-cell clusters populate the fat body [Hoshizaki, D.K., Blackburn, T., Price, C., Ghosh, M., Miles, K., Ragucci, M. and Sweis, R. (1994) Embryonic fat-cell lineage in Drosophila melanogaster. Development 120: 2489-2499; Hoshizaki, D.K., Lunz, R., Ghosh, M. and Johnson, W.

(1998) The genetic control of the distinction between fat body and gonadal mesoderm in Drosophila. Development 125: 713-723]. Whether these clusters populate defined morphological regions or whether they represent the precursors to functionally similar groups of fat-body cells has not been formally demonstrated. We have identified a 2.1 kb enhancer region from serpent (srp), a GATA transcription factor gene that is sufficient to induce fat-cell formation. This enhancer region drives expression in specific groups of precursor-cell clusters, which we show give rise to defined regions of the mature embryonic fat body. We present evidence that srp expression in different precursor fat cells is controlled by independent cis-acting regulatory regions, and we have tested the role of trans-acting factors in the specification of some of these cells. We suggest that the different positional cues regulating srp expression, and therefore general fat-cell specification, might also be involved in the functional specialization of fat cells. This may be a common mechanism in insects to explain the origin of biochemically distinct regions of the larval/adult fat body.","Drosophila; Enhancers; Fat body; Fat-cell lineage; Mesoderm","Drosophila melanogaster; Hexapoda; Insecta; Melanogaster; complementary DNA; DNA binding protein; Drosophila protein; homeodomain protein; insect protein; serpent protein, Drosophila; transcription factor; transcription factor GATA; ultrabithorax protein, Drosophila; animal; article; DNA responsive element; Drosophila melanogaster; enhancer region; fat body; gene; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; prenatal development; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Base Sequence; DNA, Complementary; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Fat Body; GATA Transcription Factors; Gene Expression; Genes, Insect; Homeodomain Proteins; Insect Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Response Elements; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036008687

The materials are selected on the basis of bonding energies of the elements in the periodic table. It is shown that the physical limit to energy density of batteries is about 10-13 times larger than in the present lead-acid batteries, and an optimistic practical limit is approximately 450 Wh/kg. Based on the basic energy and power requirements of military vehicles and supposing that 25% is the maximum acceptable value of battery weight ratio to vehicle total weight, it is found that the proposed high energy density battery can support the vehicle highway driving at speeds of 70mph for over 250 miles, and 15 miles at hill climbing at speeds of 6 mph. It is also found that with the best currently available batteries, the highway driving range is only about 105 miles, and hill climbing for about 6.4 miles. The study also shows that power capacities of batteries at present can meet the power requirement of the vehicle, even in hard acceleration.",,"Acceleration; Electric vehicles; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrons; Energy storage; Molecular weight; Thermodynamics; Chemical batteries; Electrochemical cell; Energy capacity; Energy density; Electric batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036452912

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the amount of glucose given during recovery on substrate storage and utilisation during recovery and subsequent exercise in a warm environment. A group of 11 healthy male volunteers took part in two experiments in a controlled warm environment (35°C, 40% relative humidity), 1 week apart. On each occasion the subjects completed two treadmill runs (T1 and T2) at a speed equivalent to 60% of maximal oxygen uptake, for 90 min, until they were fatigued, or until aural temperature (Taur) reached 39°C. The two runs were separated by a 4 h recovery period (REC), during which subjects consumed 55 g of naturally enriched [U-13C]-glucose in the form of a 7.5% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES, mass of solution 667 g) immediately after T1. The subjects then consumed either: the same quantity of CES, or an equivalent volume of an electrolyte placebo, at 60, 120 and 180 min during REC, providing a total of 220 g (C220) or 55 g (C55) of[U-13 C]-glucose, respectively. Expired gases were collected at 15 min intervals during exercise and 60 min intervals during REC, for determination of total CHO and fat oxidation by indirect respiratory calorimetry, and orally ingested [U-13C]-glucose oxidation, estimated from the 13C: 12C ratio of expired CO2. Substrate metabolism did not differ between conditions during T1. Despite the fact that total CHO (P&lt; 0.05) and ingested glucose oxidation (P&lt;0.01) were greater during REC of the C220 condition, glycogen synthesis was estimated to be approximately fivefold greater (P&lt;0.01) than in the C55 condition. During T2 the rate of total CHO oxidation was higher (P&lt;0.01) and total fat oxidation lower (P&lt; 0.01) at all times during the C220 compared to the C55 condition. The greater CHO oxidation during C220 appeared to be met from ingested sources, as the rate of [U-13C]-glucose oxidation was greater (P&lt;0.01) at all times during T2, compared to C55. Whilst more of the ingested substrate remained unoxidised on completion of T2 during C220, exercise duration was similar in the two experimental conditions, and was limited by thermoregulatory incapacity (Taur&gt;39°C) rather than substrate availability per se.","Carbohydrate oxidation; Exercise duration; Glucose; Glycogen; Metabolism","carbohydrate; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; electrolyte; glucose; glycogen; oxygen; adult; article; calorimetry; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; environmental temperature; expired air; fatigue; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose utilization; glycogen synthesis; human; human experiment; ingestion; lipid oxidation; male; normal human; oxygen consumption; priority journal; running; temperature measurement; thermoregulation; treadmill exercise; velocity; volunteer; Administration, Oral; Adult; Blood Glucose; Dehydration; Drinking; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Exercise; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose; Glycogen; Heat; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Endurance; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036940865

(2) Nearly constant fissile fuel contents and keff. (3) No on-site refueling and fueling hardware. (4) The ENHS modules are factory manufactured and transported already fueled to the site. (5) No access to neutrons. (6) No mechanical connections between the ENHS module and the energy conversion plant (The ENHS module has the function of a nuclear battery - with 20 years of full power operation at 125 MWth). (7) At end of life, the ENHS module serves as a spent fuel storage cask and, later, as a spent fuel shipping cask. That is, the fuel is locked inside the ENHS from ""cradle to grave"". (8) 100% natural circulation resulting in passive load following capability and autonomous control. This combination of features offers a highly safe nuclear energy system that is characterized by low waste, high proliferation resistance and high uranium utilization. The low waste and high uranium ore utilization are achieved by recycling the Pu and MA many times using a proliferation-resistant dry process; only fission products are to be extracted between cycles. Spent LWR fuel can provide for the HM make-up. The high level of proliferation resistance is obtained by restricting access to the fuel and neutrons and by eliminating the economic incentive of the client country to invest in sensitive technologies or infrastructure that can be used for clandestine production of strategic nuclear materials. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Bismuth; Fission products; Lead; Neutrons; Nuclear reactors; Plutonium; Radioactive waste encapsulation; Reactor refueling; Recycling; Spent fuels; Uranium; Encapsulated nuclear heat sources (ENHS); Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036381169

The method is partly based on the Fourier transform of the observed electron decay signal, which is known in this experiment only after some time ts after injection. It is shown that the standard Fourier transform would give a wrong frequency distribution even if the signal were known immediately after injection. Only the cosine Fourier transform with the properly determined initial time t0 (different for different detectors placed along the orbit) gives the correct frequency distribution in such a case. As for a later starting time, ts &gt; t0, a special procedure must be used to find t0 and to compensate for the lack of information about the signal between t0 and ts.

All three species of oaks present in the study area produced excellent crops the year of the study, and thus woodpeckers could readily have filled their granaries with acorns of any one of the species. Nonetheless, species composition of stored acorns was highly variable among territories and at least some acorns of all three species were stored in all granaries. There was no consistent difference in insect parasitism between stored and unstored acorns. Relative to estimated availability, birds preferred to store Quercus lobata acorns and avoided Q. douglasii acorns, but showed no preference for Q. agrifolia acorns even though they are energetically more valuable than the other two species. Stored acorns of two of the three oak species also weighed less, and were thus presumably smaller, than the average unstored acorn. On average, Acorn Woodpeckers did not maximize the energetic value of their stores and could have increased the energy stored in their granaries by 14-108% had they chosen larger acorns or more energetically rich Q. agrifolia acorns. Storing may be better understood in a more traditional optimal foraging context in which the costs of harvesting and caching, together with the energetic value of stored acorns, are considered together.","Caching; Food storage; Granary; Insect damage; Melanerpes formicivorus; Oaks","Aves; Insecta; Lobata; Melanerpes; Melanerpes formicivorus; Melanerpes formicivorus; Picidae; Quercus; Quercus agrifolia; Quercus agrifolia; Quercus douglasii; Quercus douglasii; Quercus lobata; Quercus lobata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036320556

The ability of IPC to protect hepatocytes from a model of hypothermic transplant preservation injury was tested in this study. Rat hepatocytes were subjected to 30min of warm ischemia (37°C) followed by 24 or 48h of hypothermic (4°C) storage in UW solution and subsequent re-oxygenation at normothermia for 1h. Studies were performed with untreated control cells and cells treated with IPC (10min anoxia followed by 10min re-oxygenation, 1 cycle). Hepatocytes exposed to IPC prior to warm ischemia released significantly less LDH and had higher ATP concentrations, relative to untreated ischemic hepatocytes. IPC significantly reduced LDH release after 24h of cold storage before reperfusion and after 48h of cold storage and after 60min of warm re-oxygenation, relative to the corresponding untreated hepatocytes. ATP levels were also significantly higher when IPC was used prior to the warm and cold ischemia-re-oxygenation protocols. In parallel studies, IPC increased new protein synthesis and lactate after cold storage and reperfusion compared to untreated cells but no differences in the patterns of protein banding were detected on electrophoresis between the groups. In conclusion, IPC significantly improves hepatocyte viability and energy metabolism in a model of hypothermic preservation injury preceded by normothermic ischemia. These protective effects on viability may be related to enhanced protein and ATP synthesis at reperfusion. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Its stored energy need only satisfy customers' needs for the time it takes to bring on conventional 'back-up'. The FES itself must come up to power quickly enough to avoid any disruption in the customer's operation (e.g., continuous industrial processes involving fragile materials, for example paper forming). Such customers do not care about the price of electricity nearly as much as they care about not ruining their product, damaging their machines or having 'clean ups' that stop or slow output. Firms that engage in electronic commerce and/or telecommunications also value uninterruptible power. Another set of potential customers (construction, electric railroads) may wish to avoid fluctuations in their electrical supply or they may wish to avoid causing harm to others who may hold them liable for poor power quality.

The increasing importance of Internet electronics is driving changes in development of IC technology. One important characteristic of the Internet Age is computational disaggregation. Whereas, over the past 20 years, PCs have been characterized by everincreasing computation capabilities, emerging Internet electronic products are characterized by sufficient computation to achieve the function in a small, often portable, form factor. The imperative for lower cost, which enables penetration into mass markets, is a second area where Internet electronic products differ from PCs. Disaggregation and cost requirements are driving an unprecedented degree of system-on-a-chip (SoC) integration. In the Internet Age, SoC integration means more than integrating different digital cores. It also means integrating functions that are realized today in different technologies: logic, memory, analog, power management, passives and radio or wireline driver, depending on the product. Because SoC integration is motivated primarily by cost, diverse functions must be integrated together in standard CMOS with minimal cost addition. Cost-effective embedded memory technology also needs to be developed. Current examples of SoC integration include cell phones, cable/DSL modems, and internet audio. These representative examples, together with others, are driving changes in the way los are developed. In the latter half of the decade, it is likely that SoO integration will expand to include MEMS, microphotonics, and on-chip energy sources. Moore's Law scaling will continue at least through the end of this decade, but SoO integration will become an increasingly important technology imperative for continued cost reduction throughout the Internet Age.",,"Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit manufacture; Microprocessor chips; Personal computers; Embedded memories; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036230216

The solid state, inductive adder, pulse generator is similar in operation to the linear induction accelerator. The main difference is that solid state, adder couples energy by transformer action from multiple primaries to a voltage summing stalk, instead of an electron beam. Ideally, the inductive adder produces a rectangular voltage pulse at the load. In reality, there is usually some voltage variation at the load due to droop on primary circuit storage capacitors, or, temporal variations in the load impedance. Power MOSFET circuits have been developed to provide analog modulation of the output voltage amplitude of a solid state, inductive adder, pulse generator. The modulation is achieved by including MOSFET based, variable subtraction circuits in the multiple primary stack. The subtraction circuits can be used to compensate for voltage droop, or, to tailor the output pulse amplitude to provide a desired effect in the load. Power MOSFET subtraction circuits have been developed to modulate short, temporal (60 - 400 ns), voltage and current pulses.

The paper focuses on the various switch technologies- mainly closing switches, their suitability for specific applications and their dominating parameters like Peak Voltage, Peak Current, di/dt, Charge Transfer, Turn-on and Turn-off timings, Losses and the Action etc. In addition the paper enumerates the switch requirements for emerging Military and Industrial applications. During the last decade there has been a significant progress in switching technology especially in the wide- band semiconductors. The paper discusses the state-of-the-art of emerging switch technologies.",,"Electric breakdown; Industrial applications; Military applications; Modulators; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor device structures; Silicon carbide; Solid state devices; Thermal conductivity; Thyristors; Power switching technology; Solid state switch; Wide-band semiconductor; Semiconductor switches",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036998914

Based on isothermal DSC results, the activation energy for the curing reaction is estimated to be 129 kJ/mol. When heated from - 100 to 150°C, the cured material exhibits a single endothermic peak near -45°C, which corresponds to the melting of silicone oils in the sample. On cooling, the cured material crystallizes, but shows various degrees of undercooling depending on the cooling rate. Upon crystallization, DMTA analysis revealed that the storage modulus of the cured material increases dramatically, from several MPa to a few GPa. In the same process, the ultimate elongation decreases by almost a factor of 10. The impact of such static and dynamic mechanical behavior on packaging reliability will be addressed. The influence of curing on the mechanical modulus was also evaluated by DMTA. In addition, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and thermal stability of this material will be discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Small-area, high-efficiency, thin-film batteries and solar cells are an attractive choice for such applications. The NASA Glenn Research Center, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Lithium Power Technologies, MicroSat Systems, and others, have been working on the development of autonomous monolithic packages combining these elements, or what are called integrated power supplies (IPS). These supplies can be combined with individual satellite components and are capable of providing continuous power, even under intermittent illumination associated with a spinning or earth-orbiting satellite. This paper discusses the space mission applicability, benefits, and current development efforts associated with IPS components and systems. The characteristics and several mission concepts for an IPS that combines thin-film photovoltaic power generation with thin-film lithium ion energy storage are described.

The storage and loss components of the high-frequency complex mechanical modulus are interpreted in terms of the rigidity resulting from network connectivity and the energy dissipated in aperiodic motions of small structural moieties, respectively. A series of glass-forming oxides with variable fragility was investigated. Most revealing is the fact that thermo-rheological simplicity does not apply to high-frequency processes in these supercooled oxide melts. In order to describe the temperature dependence of the complex moduli consistently for all systems we investigated, we enhanced Maxwell's theory of visco-elasticity to explicitly account for the transition between thermodynamically distinct structural states corresponding to liquid and glass respectively. Using complementary information pertaining to short-range structural characteristics, based on atomic-scale computer simulations and experiments, we have identified mechanisms that are invoked upon transition between structural states. Thereby, we uncovered some attributes of the beginning and ending configurations associated with, what we believe to be, the polyamorphic transformations that underlie the glass transition. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The experiments are designed to study the collisions of fundamental particles, called ""events"", each of which is represented as a point in a multi-dimensional universe. In these environments, the best retrieval performance can be achieved only if the data is clustered on the tertiary storage by all searchable attributes of the events. Since the number of these attributes is high, the underlying data-management facility must be able to cope with extremely large volumes and very high dimensionalities of data at the same time. The proposed indexing technique is designed to facilitate both clustering and efficient retrieval of high-dimensional data on tertiary storage. The structure uses an original space-partitioning scheme, which has numerous advantages over other space-partitioning techniques.

Electromagnetic launchers, aircraft catapults, directed energy systems including microwave sources and electric lasers, and electric armors all require high energies delivered intermittently at very high power. Power systems that can provide both compact energy storage and have the ability to generate, condition and deliver power to these types of loads are of particular interest. Recent advances in rotating machines that incorporate composite structural materials have allowed significant improvement in the achievable energy storage density. Optimized electromagnetic designs, using both iron-based and air-core magnetic circuits, are being studied for pulsed and intermittent duty applications. Combining these electromagnetic designs with the ability to store energy in compact form, and advanced output power conditioning technologies offers a variety of opportunities for rotating machine innovation in pulsed power. This paper summarizes current trends in high-performance pulsed rotating machine development, and discusses some of the trade-offs involved in the selection of an appropriate rotating machine approach to a given set of application requirements. A system level view, including energy recharge, output power conditioning, and auxiliary support systems, must be considered to minimize overall power supply weight and volume.

In this work, the general corrosion behavior of welded and annealed Alloy 22 and Ti Grade 7 in BSW-12 environments from 60° to 105°C was studied by simple immersion test for four weeks and eight weeks. The corrosion rate for Alloy 22 was found to be 0.003 mpy at 60°C and 0.012 mpy at 105°C (0.075 and 0.30 microns/year) and 0.008 mpy at 60°C to 0.026 mpy at 105°C (0.2 and 0.65 microns/year) for Ti Grade 7. The corrosion of Ti Grade 7 and Alloy 22 is discussed in terms of the corrosion rates as functions of temperature and exposure time and the correlation between the corrosion behavior and surface morphology. For Ti Grade 7, the imperfections (precipitates, inclusions, stringers, pores etc.) inherited from materials processing may serve as the sites of preferential dissolution or ""traps"" for corrosion products. In case of Alloy 22, the existence of graphite particles (or carbides) did not seem to deteriorate the excellent corrosion resistance of both annealed and welded materials. The apparent activation energies for Ti Grade 7 and Alloy 22 in BSW-12 environment were found to be approximately 22.4-23.5 KJmol-1 and 24.9-26.8 KJ mol-1, respectively.

However, the energy efficiency of the equipment has not dropped at the same rate. This has resulted in a significant increase in power density and heat dissipation within the footprint of computer and telecommunications hardware. The heat dissipated in these systems is exhausted in the room and the room has to be maintained at acceptable temperatures for reliable operation of the equipment. Cooling computer and telecommunications equipment rooms is becoming a major challenge. This paper reviews the literature dealing with various aspects of cooling computer and telecommunications equipment rooms. Included are papers on experimental work analyzing cooling schemes, numerical modeling, energy saving schemes, natural convection room cooling, forced convection room cooling, cooling raised floor versus non-raised floor type installations, and other related areas.

The anomalously high energy density, coupled with its high dielectric strength, allow f or a significant reduction in size over a gas insulated design. Moreover, the high currents required to produce ICF demanda low inductance design, which is aided by the high electrical breakdown strength of water. The inductance introduced by the spark channel is a significant source of inductance. The new design will also increase the charge voltage on the water switches and introduces serious concerns regarding the physics of electrical breakdown in water in general and the scaling of water switches in particular. A major concern is the losses associated with water switching in the multi-megavolt regime. In such large pulsed power machines, accurate estimations of switch losses are necessary for new high efficiency pulsed power the switch losses constitute a major portion of the total energy loss.

Most prior work on radiation effects in materials has focused on structural damage from alpha radiation. Beta radiation, on the other hand, causes little atomic displacement, but the decay transmutation, that is, the radioactive decay of a radioisotope to an isotope of another element, results in progeny with different the valence and ionic radius. Cesium-137, a fission product of uranium, is a major contaminant at U.S. Department of Energy production facilities. Pollucite is an aluminosilicate ceramic with potential use for long-term storage of 137Cs. We focused on one of several available 137Cs sources originally fabricated in the 1970s and 1980s. These sources were small, sealed, stainless steel capsules containing pollucite in which varying amounts of the natural Cs had been replaced by radioactive 137Cs (t1/2 = 30.13 years). The sample chosen for TEM examination, aged for nearly 20 years, contained the most radiogenic barium and was expected to show the largest radiation effects. Bright field transmission images revealed a homogeneous crystalline matrix, with no evidence of distinct Ba phases or ex-solution phenomena resulting from the 137Cs transmutation. Electron diffraction patterns obtained from several portions of the sample were consistent with literature values for pollucite. These data suggest that little substantial damage was done to the crystal structure of this sample, despite the transmutation of nearly 1.5% of the total cesium to barium over the elapsed 20 years. Although our observations are limited, to our knowledge these are the only available data in which transmutation effects have been isolated from other radiation damage phenomena.",,"Aluminum compounds; Barium; Cesium; Crystal structure; Crystalline materials; Electron diffraction; Radiation effects; Radioisotopes; Stainless steel; Transmission electron microscopy; Crystalline aluminosilicate ceramic; Crystalline pollucite; Radioactive decay; Radiogenic transmutation effects; Stainless steel capsules; Silicates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036381442

In response to concern about increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), resulting from increase in global energy use, the cycling of carbon has become the object of many intensive investigations. Terrestrial ecosystems are a huge, natural biological scrubber for CO2 currently sequestering, directly from the atmosphere, about 22% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. It is assumed that a significant fraction of this carbon uptake goes into roots. Presently, there are no means by which root morphology, distribution, and mass can be measured without serious sampling artifacts that alter these properties. This is because the current methods are destructive and labor intensive. A non-invasive, imaging procedure for examining roots in situ would be a powerful tool quantifying subsurface storage, as well as for documenting changes in root structure. Preliminary results using a high frequency, 1.5 Ghz, impulse Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for nondestructive imaging of tree root systems in situ are presented.

This residual energy, much of it stored in the barrel inductance, can be close to 50% of the initially stored energy. This is the result of significant current flowing in the projectile armature when the projectile exits the barrel. Muzzle shunts are designed to manage this residual current and energy, and as a result reduce or eliminate muzzle flash. To date, resistive and inductive muzzle shunts have been proposed and implemented. Resistive shunts can dissipate a majority of the residual energy in addition to preventing muzzle flash. Inductive-shunt schemes have been proposed as a means to recover the residual energy in a pulsed-alternator pulsed-power system. This paper describes a different muzzle-shunt approach; a capacitor shunt that is used to recover a large portion of the residual energy. This muzzle shunt is used in conjunction with a capacitor-based pulsed-power system, where one of the capacitor bank sections is used both as the shunt element as well as the recovered-energy storage element. Results are presented of an analysis of this scheme using a transient circuit model of a representative railgun circuit.",,"Electric currents; Inductance; Plasmas; Power supply circuits; Muzzle shunt energy; Railgun capacitor; Residual energy; Transient circuit model; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037001632

Bioenerg, Biomembr. 28, 483-493) that pH dependent reversible Ca2+ binding near the N- and C-terminal end of the 8 kDa subunit c modulates ATP synthesis driven by an applied pH jump in chloroplast and E. coli ATP synthase due to closing a ""proton gate"" proposed to exist in the F0H+ channel of the F0F1 ATP synthase. This mechanism has further been investigated with the use of membrane vesicles from mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Vesicles from a mutant with serine at position 37 in the hydrophilic loop of the c-subunit replaced by the charged glutamic acid (strain plc 37) has a higher H+/ATP ratio than the wild type and therefore shows ATP synthesis at low values of ΔμH+. The presence of 1 mM CaCl2 during the preparation and storage of these vesicles blocked acid-base jump ATP formation when the pH of the acid side (inside) was between pH 5.6 and 7.1, even though the ApH of the acid-base jump was thermodynamically in excess of the necessary energy to drive ATP formation at an external pH above 8.28. That is, in the absence of added CaCl2, ATP formation did occur under those conditions. However, when the base stage pH was 7.16 and the acid stage below pH 5.2, ATP was formed when Ca2+ was present. This is consistent with Ca2+ being displaced by H+ ions from the F0 on the inside of the thylakoid membrane at pH values below about 5.5. Vesicles from a mutant with the serine of position 3 replaced by a cysteine apparently already contain some bound Ca2+ to F0. Addition of 1 mM EGTA during preparation and storage of those vesicles shifted the otherwise already low internal pH needed for onset of ATP synthesis to higher values when the external pH was above 8. With both strains it was shown that the Ca2+ binding effect on acid-base induced ATP synthesis occurs above an internal pH of about 5.5. These results were corroborated by 45Ca2+ ligand blot assays on organic solvent soluble preparations containing the 8 kDa F0 subunit c from the S-3-C mutant ATP synthase, which showed 45Ca2+ binding as occurs with the pea chloroplast subunit III. The phosphorylation efficiency (P/2e), at strong light intensity, of Ca2+ and EGTA treated vesicles from both strains were almost equal showing that Ca2+ or EGTA have no other effect on the ATP synthase such as a change in the proton to ATP ratio. The results indicate that the Ca2+ binding to the F0 H+ channel can block H+ flux through the channel at pH values above about 5.5, but below that pH protons apparently displace the bound Ca2+, opening the CF0 H+ channel between the thylakoid lumen and H+ conductive channel.","ATP synthase; Ca2+ binding; CF0 subunit c; Cyanobacteria; Energy conservation; Enzyme regulation; H+; Proton translocation","calcium chloride; calcium ion; glutamic acid; protein subunit; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; egtazic acid; protein subunit; proton; article; calcium binding; chloroplast; Cyanobacterium; energy metabolism; hydrophilicity; membrane vesicle; pH; proton transport; thermodynamics; thylakoid; binding site; biosynthesis; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; ion transport; metabolism; site directed mutagenesis; Cyanobacteria; Escherichia coli; Pisum sativum; Synechocystis; Synechocystis sp.; Synechocystis sp.

Because it is based on speculative static information, the approach removes the burden of provable correctness in compiler analysis passes that extract static information. This makes Cool-Mem applicable for large and complex applications, without having any limitations due to complexity issues in the compiler passes or the presence of precompiled static libraries.

This study examined if the combination of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and cold exposure would adversely affect thermoregulatory responses to acute cold exposure in survivors awaiting rescue. Seven male submariners (33 ± 6 yrs) completed a series of cold-air tests (CAT) that consisted of 20-min at Tair = 22°C, followed by a linear decline (1°C·min-1) in Tair to 12°C, which was then held constant for an additional 150-min. CAT were performed under normoxic, normocapnic conditions (D0), acute hypoxia (D1, 16.75% O2), after 4 days of chronic hypoxia, hypercapnia and cold (D5, 16.75% O2, 2.5% CO2, 4°C), and hypoxia-only again (D8, 16.75% O2). The ΔTsk during CAT was larger (P&lt;0.05) on D0 (-5.2°C), vs. D1 (-4.8°C), D5 (-4.5°C), and D8 (-4.40C). The change (relative to 0-min) in metabolic heat production (ΔM) at 20-min of CAT was lower (P&lt;0.05) on D1, D5, and D8, vs. DO, with no differences between D1, D5 and D8. ΔM was not different among trials at any time point after 20-min. The mean body temperature threshold for the onset of shivering was lower on D1 (35.08°C), D5 (34.85°C), and D8 (34.69°C), compared to D0 (36.01°C). Changes in heat storage did not differ among trials and rectal temperature was not different in D0 vs. D1, D5, and D8. Thus, mild hypoxia (16.75% F1O2) impairs vasoconstrictor and initial shivering responses, but the addition of elevated F1CO2 and cold had no further effect. These thermoregulatory effector changes do not increase the risk for hypothermia in DISSUB survivors who are adequately clothed.","Hypercapnia; Hypothermia; Hypoxia; Shivering; Vasoconstriction","noradrenalin; adult; article; blood; caloric intake; cold; human; hypothermia; male; microclimate; military medicine; pathophysiology; physiology; rectum; shivering; skin temperature; thermoregulation; vasoconstriction; vasodilatation; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold; Ecological Systems, Closed; Energy Intake; Humans; Hypothermia; Male; Norepinephrine; Rectum; Shivering; Skin Temperature; Submarine Medicine; Vasoconstriction; Vasodilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036769076

However, the energy efficiency of the equipment has not dropped at the same rate. This has resulted in a significant increase in power density and heat dissipation within the footprint of computer and telecommunications hardware. The heat dissipated in these systems is exhausted in the room and the room has to be maintained at acceptable temperatures for reliable operation of the equipment. Cooling computer and telecommunications equipment rooms is becoming a major challenge.

The key findings show that people who lived near the facility were exposed to plutonium mainly through inhalation during routine operations, from a major fire in 1957, and from plutonium resuspended from contaminated soil from an outdoor drum storage area, called the 903 Area. Results were presented for five exposure scenarios that were location-independent. Individuals described by the laborer scenario received the highest risk of all scenarios considered. Upper bound (95th percentile) incremental lifetime cancer incidence risks for the laborer scenario were in about the 10-4 range (1 chance in 10, 000) for developing cancer from Rocky Flats plutonium releases during a lifetime. At the 5th percentile level, the maximum cancer risk was about 10-7 (1 chance in 10 million) for developing cancer during a lifetime.

Besides the actual data, which constitute the first term of the series, each of the other terms is computed as a multidimensional convolution of OBS data with streamer data, and aims at removing one specific order of multiples. If the streamer data do not contain free-surface multiples, we found that the computation of only the second term of the series is needed to predict and remove all orders of multiples, whatever the water depth. As the computation of the various terms of the series is the most expensive part of ISMA, this result can produce significant savings in computation time, even in data storage, as we no longer need to store the various terms of the series. For example, if the streamer data contained free-surface multiples, OBS seismic data of 6-s duration, corresponding to a geological model of the subsurface with 250-m water depth, require the computation of five terms of the series for each of the four components of OBS data. With the new implementation, in which the streamer data do not contain free-surface multiples, we need the computation of only one term of the series for each component of the OBS data. The saving in CPU time for this particular case is at least fourfold. The estimation of the inverse source signature, which is an essential part of ISMA, also benefits from the reduction of the number of terms needed for the demultiple to two because it becomes a linear inverse problem instead of a nonlinear one. Assuming that the removal of multiple events produces a significant reduction in the energy of the data, the optimization of this problem leads to a stable, noniterative analytic solution. We have also adapted these results to the implementation of ISMA for vertical-cable (VC) data. This implementation is similar to that for OBS data. The key difference is that the basic model in VC imaging assumes that data consist of receiver ghosts of primaries instead of the primaries themselves. We have used the following property to achieve this goal. The combination of VC data with surface seismic data, which do not contain free-surface multiples, allows us to predict free-surface multiples and receiver ghosts as well as the receiver ghosts of primary reflections. However, if the direct wave arrivals are removed from the VC data, this combination will not predict the receiver ghosts of primary reflections. The difference between these two predictions produces data containing only receiver ghosts of primaries.",,"Algorithms; Attenuation; Inverse problems; Optimization; Reflection; Seismology; Acoustic wave absorption; Acoustic wave reflection; Acoustic wave scattering; Acoustic waves; Forecasting; Seismic prospecting; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Underwater acoustics; Inverse scattering multiple attenuation (ISMA) algorithms; Geophysical techniques; Geophysics computing; Linear inverse problems; Multidimensional convolution; Ocean-bottom seismic datum; Oceanic crust; Optimisations; Surface seismic data; Geophysics; Digital storage; data inversion; ocean bottom seismometer; optimization; seismic attenuation; signal processing; wave scattering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036638348

Flywheel energy storage technology is an ideal candidate for this mission because, in addition to benefiting the commercial and military satellite industries, it offers significant operating cost savings to the ISS. This paper describes a proposed flight experiment using the ISS Expedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Pallet as a test platform to demonstrate the feasibility of operating high speed, composite flywheels in LEO for energy storage applications. The proposed ISS payload, the Flywheel Express Pallet Experiment (FEPE), will build upon the legacy of an earlier technology development effort for ISS, the Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) program. FESS was specifically designed to replace the Nickel Hydrogen (NiH 2) Battery orbital replacement units in the ISS Electric Power System. In contrast, FEPE will incorporate two counter-rotating flywheels, on the ISS Express Pallet, exchanging energy with each other. The ISS will provide the small amount of power needed to make up for losses. From a technology perspective, FEPE is being proposed to validate flywheel systems in the combined LEO environment, which cannot be fully simulated in a ground facility.

Reducing the power used by the storage device is crucial for reducing overall power consumption. A new class of secondary storage devices based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) promises to consume an order of magnitude less power with 10-20 times shorter latency and 10 times greater storage densities. We describe three strategies to reduce power consumption: aggressive spin-down; sequential request merging; sub-sector accesses. We show that aggressive spin-down can save up to 50% of the total energy consumed by the device at the cost of increased response time. Merging of sequential requests can save up to 18% of the servicing energy and reduce response time by about 20%. Transferring less data for small requests such as those for metadata can save 40% of the servicing energy. Finally, we show that by applying all three power management strategies simultaneously the total power consumption of MEMS-based storage devices can be reduced by about 54% with no impact on I/O performance. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Electric power utilization; Electromechanical devices; MEMS; Merging; Microelectromechanical devices; Response time (computer systems); Virtual storage; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Mobile computers; Power conservation; Power management strategies; Secondary storage; Storage densities; Storage systems; Total power consumption; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349110557

In some cases, this may not be the best strategy because each loop nest might work best with a different cache configuration and transforming a nest for a given fixed cache configuration may not be possible due to data dependences. Working with a fixed cache configuration can also increase energy consumption in loops where the best required configuration is smaller than the default (fixed) one. In this paper, we take an alternate approach and modify the cache configuration for each nest depending on the access pattern exhibited by the nest. We call this technique compiler-directed cache polymorphism (CDCP). More specifically, in this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we present an approach for analyzing data reuse properties of loop nests. Second, we give algorithms to simulate the footprints of array references in their reuse space. Third, based on our reuse analysis, we present an optimization algorithm to compute the cache configurations for each nest. Our experimental results show that CDCP is very effective in finding the near-optimal data cache configurations for different nests in array-intensive applications.","Cache locality; Cache polymorphism; Compilers; Data reuse; Embedded software; Energy consumption","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Computer software; Database systems; Software engineering; Polymorphism; Program compilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036979988

The proposed scheme employs a PWM AC-AC converter (4, IGBTs per-phase) along with an autotransformer. During a disturbance such as voltage sag, the proposed scheme supplies the missing voltage and helps in maintaining rated voltage at the terminals of the critical load. The approach does not employ any energy storage components such as bulk capacitors/inductors and provides fast response at low cost. Under normal conditions the approach works in by-pass mode, delivering utility power directly to the load, this method of control allows the transformer to be rated only for transient conditions, thus reducing its required size. A four-step switching technique to drive AC-AC converter is employed to realize snubber less operation.

Unlike thermal engines, where chemical energy is metered into a combustion chamber, batteries are unique in the storage of all energy content within a limited material construction. Fuel cells are a logical cross between the concepts of electric storage battery and thermal engine. The requirements for military and some civilian AUVs demand increased battery energy density and volume compared to the overall AUV vehicle. Batteries, like fuel cells, are most cost-effective when they may be recharged and reutilized. The aspects of increased energy density, intrinsic power capability and electrical or mechanical recharging present a significant challenge in designing a power supply system that is safe under all conditions for the AUV and for the deployment platform.

Hydrogen is an attractive fuel because it is plentiful and clean. It is found in atomic abundance in water and hydrocarbons, and its only oxidation product is water. The major challenge hydrogen fuel must overcome is the issue of storage. As the distributed energy market grows and looks to hydrogen as a clean fuel for combustion engines and fuel cells, questions loom about which methods of containment will prove to be safest and simplest for storage and delivery of hydrogen. This paper will contrast hydrogen fueling system technologies for standby power applications and allow readers, through a fair comparison, to measure the fit of various technologies for this telecommunications application. Issues such as system cost, operating cost, system volume and weight, start-up time, refueling time, maintenance, safety, environmental impact, and ease-of-use are the characteristics analyzed for the different fueling technologies. These requirements are matched against the specifications for standby electricity generators to quantify the trade-offs among the hydrogen fueling technologies. Two power ranges for the standby power applications will be considered. Small units have power capabilities of 500-1,000 watts, and large units provide power at 50-100 kilowatts. For the small systems, the storage technologies to be compared are liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, reversible metal hydrides, reactive hydrides with water, and carbon nanostructures. The common thread for all of these hydrogen storage systems is that they are all zero emission at the point of use, making them suitable for operation in an enclosed area such as an office. For larger systems the list will be expanded to include reforming technologies, with the caveat that reformers can only be used in well ventilated areas due to the carbon emissions associated with reforming of hydrocarbon fuels.",,"Combustion; Electric energy storage; Fuel cells; Gas fuels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Standby power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036916576

Additional facilities are expected to reach a similar status in the future. Most of these facilities are being, or eventually will be, withdrawn from service, decontaminated, and dismantled, with the resulting scrap materials being either recovered and recycled or sent to disposal. Among the materials that will require effective management are large quantities of scrap metal. Large portions of this material may not be contaminated; other portions may contain only small amounts of residual radioactive material; still other portions may be heavily contaminated. In the United States, the bulk of these metals will be generated as a result of the decommissioning of existing commercial nuclear power plants and the defense nuclear weapons production facilities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Lesser amounts of scrap metal will be generated through the decommissioning and dismantling of research and test reactors, accelerators, and facilities associated with the military operations of the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional quantities may result from the decontamination and dismantlement of facilities associated with the use of radioactive materials in medicine, research, private industry, and agriculture. In most cases, the bulk of these materials will be components or equipment used in the basic structure of the facilities and in maintaining the functionality and safety of the supporting systems. Concerns about the scrap metal generated in these facilities are generally associated with man-made and naturally occurring radionuclides, although in some facilities such as commercial nuclear power plants the predominant concern is on man-made radionuclides. Large quantities of scrap metal will also be generated during routine operations and from the decommissioning and dismantling of facilities in industries involved in the exploration and extraction of natural resources such as petroleum, phosphate or minerals. In these cases, the contamination will be due solely to naturally occurring radioactive materials. Instead, it will be due to the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) or technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM). Generally, the scrap metals will include mainly iron and steel that have relatively low economic value, and smaller quantities of more valuable metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, stainless steel, zirconium, and precious metals. In all, it is estimated that a total of up to nine million metric tons (MT) of scrap metal will ultimately be generated in the United States as a result of these activities involving man-made radioactive materials or TENORM. For the carbon and alloy steel that comprises the majority of the potential scrap metal inventory, the estimated quantity represents about 20 percent of the nation's annual scrap metal consumption, or about 10 percent of the nation's annual steel production. Since only a portion of the scrap metal will have been in contact with or in proximity to radioactive materials, it is expected that much of it will be free of contamination. Nonetheless, because it will have originated through the dismantlement of facilities that were associated with the use or processing of radioactive materials, it is referred to in this Report as potentially radioactive scrap metal (PRSM). In general, PRSM includes all suspect or contaminated metal within a facility, if it cannot be otherwise classified under existing laws or regulations. Developing a systematic approach to managing the disposition of PRSM is a challenging task in today's regulatory environment. Although current regulations are firmly established for the disposal of various types of well-characterized radioactive waste, the provisions are not adequately formulated to address comprehensive disposition options for materials that do not fall within existing regulatory confines. In particular, the current regulatory system does not provide systematic options for releasing materials containing either very small amounts of contaminants or no contamination at all. Although there are provisions for exempting particular radioactive materials or categories from regulatory control, the threshold or other basis for releasing such materials has not been consistently or clearly specified. In the absence of clear standards and a systematic approach, PRSM and similar waste streams may be classified as radioactive waste, regardless of their actual content of radioactive material. The lack of a full range of options for such materials severely constrains facility operators in effectively managing the disposition of PRSM. Based on estimates of the volumes of scrap metal likely to be generated and the lack of consistent policies and/or regulations that will permit effective management of even the cleanest materials, it has become clear that efforts to manage these materials have been, and will continue to be, seriously impeded by the current situation. As such, the effectiveness of efforts to cleanup facilities and sites, such as DOE sites that engaged in nuclear weapons production or large-scale research and development, will be in question, unless the problems of managing and regulating PRSM are systematically addressed. The same may be true of the decommissioning and dismantling of commercial nuclear power plants. One approach for solving these problems is to develop a regulatory framework that will facilitate application of a comprehensive management strategy for disposition of the full range of PRSM that will be generated. The regulatory framework should provide consistency across numerous applications in a manner that builds public and industry confidence. The management strategy to be developed should address two important factors. First, it must be based on appropriate national and international policies; second, it must provide those involved in the disposition of such materials with the opportunity to evaluate an array of options. Only through such an approach will it be possible to achieve an optimal balance between the potential benefits and impacts that may result. In seeking such a balance, two guiding principles must be followed: (1) protection of human health and the environment must be ensured, and (2) the production of waste should be minimized. Appropriate application of this latter principle can both reduce environmental pollution and achieve cost savings.",,"aluminum; carbon; copper; iron; lead; metal; nickel; radioactive material; radioisotope; stainless steel; steel; zirconium; cooperation; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental radioactivity; environmental release; environmental sanitation; human; landfill; law; policy; pollution control; radiation dose; radiation protection; radioactive contamination; radioactive waste disposal; radioactive waste processing; radioactive waste storage; recycling; review; safety; standard; United States; waste management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444447732

We present the first quantitative nondestructive assay of the plutonium content of fast-breeder reactor spent-fuel assemblies while still underwater in their facility storage pond. We have calibrated and installed an underwater neutron coincidence counter (Spent Fuel Coincidence Counter (SFCC)) in the BN-350 reactor spent-fuel pond in Aqtau, Kazakhstan. A procedure has been developed to convert singles and doubles (coincidence) neutron rates observed by the SFCC into the total plutonium content of a given BN-350 spent-fuel assembly. The plutonium content has been successfully determined for spent-fuel assemblies with a contact radiation level as high as ∼105Rads/h. Using limited facility information and multiple measurements along the length of spent-fuel assemblies, the combined measurement and facility declaration error is ∼8%.

It has been well established that chitins bind to the cleft of lysozymes and the subsites of the location of the different N-acetylglucos- amines that are parts of chitins have been identified. Moreover, it has been well documented that a 1,4-β-bond must be located between subsite D and subsite E to be cleaved. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the biophysical and biochemical processes is needed. In this paper, pulsed fluorescence was used to further investigate the mechanism by which the binding of fluorescent analogs of chitin (4-methylumbelliferyl chitobiose and 4-methylumbelliferyl chitotriose) to hen egg-white lysozyme results in an increase of their fluorescence intensity. Although such an increase is not observed when these chitobiosides bind to turkey egg-white lysozyme, synchronous fluorescence techniques show that this binding induces a quenching of the native fluorescence of both these proteins. The findings of this study, associated with previously published cyrstallographic data allow us to suggest that the system lysozyme-chitobioside partitions in two three-dimensional conformational states: an enzymatic active conformation and a storage conformation. These states are separated by an energy barrier, with the storage conformation being more populated than the enzymatic active conformation below 45°C.","3D conformational state; Chitobiosides; Hen and turkey egg-white lysozyme; Pulsed fluorescence; Synchronous fluorescence","3D conformational state; Chitobioside; Hen and turkey egg-white lysozyme; Pulsed fluorescence; Synchronous fluorescence; Biological membranes; Chitin; Conformations; Crystallography; Fluorescence; Hydrolysis; Luminescence; Microorganisms; Quenching; Thermodynamics; Proteins; Aves; Meleagris gallopavo",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942486271

The critical condition for this type of nucleation was investigated with a Monte Carlo code. The findings were as follows. (1) The nucleus size is a key factor for survival of an embryo. An embryo with a size below a critical value is not able to grow into the matrix. If the initial radius becomes larger than the critical value, the radius has a small effect on the growth rate. (2) High stored energy is definitely necessary for both nucleation and growth. (3) In order to grow into the critical size, the neighboring subgrains must have a small disorientation with nucleus. If the disorientation of the surrounding subgrains becomes large after growth of an embryo to critical size, the nucleus can grow into the matrix abnormally.","Abnormal Grain Growth; Computer Simulation; Monte Carlo; Nucleation; Recrystallization","Computer simulation; Crystal orientation; Deformation; Energy storage; Grain growth; Monte Carlo methods; Disorientation; Nucleation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036952384

In order to improve the efficiency of an active isolation system we analyze different feedback control strategies which will provide an electrical energy regeneration. In this case, the power is flowing from the mechanical disturbance through the electromechanical actuator and its switching drive into the electrical storage device (batteries or capacitors). We demonstrate that regeneration occurs when controlling one or both of the flow states (velocity and current). This regenerative control strategy also affects the closed loop dynamics. The regenerative control applied to a voice-coil actuator results in a closed loop system which has a reduced amount of damping compared to the initial system. In fact the regenerative control strategy will increase the level of vibration compared to the closed electrical circuit boundary condition in order to make the system absorb more energy, of which a part is transfered to an electrical storage device. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.","Electromechanical system; Optimization; Power flow; Power harvesting; State-space control","Actuators; Boundary conditions; Damping; Feedback control; Optimization; Power amplifiers; State space methods; Electromechanical systems; Systems analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036380342

The overall objective of this research was to develop a generalized methodology for determining the long-term performance of an existing cool storage system based on short-term field measurements. Specifically, this involved: i. the development of an analysis methodology for determining energy and demand savings of the cooling plant due to the cool-storage system as compared to an otherwise identical one without such a cool-storage system. The analysis was to be based as much as possible on monitored data as against conventional methods that rely on simplified calculations of ""typical"" days during summer and winter which are then extrapolated to the whole year; and ii. recommendations for formulating a short-term measurement and verification (M & V) plan. This includes issues such as what specific measurements to make, the time of the year in which to make them (i.e., how one season may be more suitable than another), and the duration of the short-term monitoring period. Such a methodology has been developed and tested using monitored data from three case study sites, resulting in significant advances in the analysis of in-situ cool storage system performance. This methodology will simplify the evaluation of existing cool storage systems, which will enhance the application of cool storage technology. It will also provide a basis for the development of evaluation methodologies for other technologies; for example, thermal heating storage systems used in areas where expensive electrical energy is used for heating. While the companion paper describes the validation of field data used for the performance evaluation (Elleson et al. 2002), this paper describes details of the analysis methodology and presents the results of applying the methodology to the three case study sites.

The performance of the StatCom, a self-commutated solid-state voltage converter, can be improved with the addition of energy storage.

While the wheel spin rates of the conventional CMGs are controlled to be constant, the rates of VSCMGs are allowed to have variable speeds. Therefore, VSCMGs have extra degrees of freedom and can be used for additional objectives such as energy storage as well as attitude control. In this paper VSCMGs are used for an IPACS. The gimbal rates are used to provide the reference-tracking torques, while the wheel accelerations are used both for attitude reference tracking and power tracking. The latter objective is achieved by storing or releasing the kinetic energy in the wheels. The control algorithm performs both attitude and power tracking goals simultaneously. A model-based control and an indirect adaptive control for a spacecraft with uncertain inertia properties are developed. Moreover, control laws for equalization of the wheel speeds are also proposed. Wheel speed equalization minimizes the possibility of wheel speed saturation and avoids zero-speed singularities. Finally, a numerical example for a satellite in a low Earth near-polar orbit is provided to test the proposed IPACS algorithm.",,"Adaptive control systems; Algorithms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Earth (planet); Energy storage; Gyroscopes; Kinetic energy; Power tracking; Satellites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036062146

Accidental or intentional impact of these structures by aircraft is a concern. The potential for penetration of these facilities by the aircraft or its components and the subsequent damage to the contents and release of toxic substances is a major concern. This paper focuses on analyzing the impact of jet engines into heavily reinforced concrete walls. These engines are among the stiffest and most massive components of an aircraft and the most likely to seriously damage and penetrate the reinforced concrete. We model both the engine and the reinforced concrete deformations using failure models for reinforced concrete and metals. Unlike many projectile impact problems, the impacting engine cannot be considered to be rigid. A large amount of energy is consumed in the plastic deformation and fracture of the engine components. The reinforced concrete is modeled using hexahedral elements for the concrete and beam elements for the rebar reinforcement. An advanced three invariant viscoplastic softening cap constitutive model describes the ductile and brittle rate-dependent characteristics of concrete. The rebar is modeled using a rate dependent, strain hardening von Mises formulation with failure controlled by fracture energy dissipation. A similar constitutive model is employed for the shell elements used to represent the engine components. These failure models are included in the FLEX large deformation finite element code which uses an explicit, central difference solution procedure with subcycling to solve the equations of motion. Element erosion using different criteria for concrete and metals is used to remove severely distorted and failed elements. Procedures used to mitigate the deleterious and unrealistic effects of hourglass control and viscoplasticity in the softening and failure regimes are discussed. The results from the computations are compared with experimental data generated by impacting a TF-30 engine into a two foot thick concrete wall.",,"Reinforced concrete walls; Energy dissipation; Failure analysis; Finite element method; Mathematical models; Nuclear power plants; Plastic deformation; Reinforced concrete; Strain hardening; Viscoplasticity; Walls (structural partitions); Aircraft engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036382347

""Kidneys"" used for controlled removal of NPEs can help maintain efficient operation of a highly closed kraft mill. It is critical to determine the dynamic effect of process changes on NPE levels in order to optimize closure strategies and evaluate different ""'kidney"" options. We built a dynamic full-mill model that can represent general dynamic kraft mill behavior regarding NPE build up. It is used to test different mill recycle schemes and ""kidney"" strategies for NPE removal. The over-all mill dynamics are assumed to be controlled by the liquor and pulp storage tanks. The model uses an equilibrium module based upon SOLGASWATER to predict the partitioning of NPEs between the aqueous and fiber phases We based the equilibrium model upon a combination of literature thermodynamic data and mill-tuned results, and it is fully integrated into a commercial process simulation program (WinGEMS). In this first paper, we demonstrate the dynamic impact of chloride (CI) and potassium (K +) levels on the sticky dust temperature in the recovery boiler due to the shutdown of a NPE chip kidney. Simulation results show that with ""normal"" chloride and potassium inputs, an open bleach plant, and no electrostatic precipitator (ESP) dust purge, the sticky dust temperature drops from 800°C to 580°C in 250 days. In a case with bleach plant filtrate recycling and an ESP dust purge of 16 kg/ton 90, the sticky dust temperature drops from 760°C to 700°C, reaching steady state in 80 days. In a case with high input chloride levels, a NPE chip kidney can alleviate sticky dust problems in the recovery boiler. The slow process dynamics indicate the NPE chip kidney can be safely shutdown on a periodic basis. We based the mill model on specifications defined in the ""Ecocyclic Pulp Mill (KAM)"" program.

Stochastic simulation techniques are usually required for preserving heterogeneity in models, through the simulation of depositional facies prior to the simulation of petrophysics. A cube of facies proportions is usually needed to input in the simulation the 3D drift that describes the depositional model. The assessment of this cube, together with the building of a real stratigraphic grid, is a critical stage in the modeling process, as it drives the quality and the realistic aspect of the model. However, whatever the input data used for its computation, the cube of proportions constitutes up to now one of the most uncertain parameter. As well, the available methologies for gridding produce stratigraphic grids far from reality. Neptune is a methodology and a tool (gOcadTM plug-in developed in house by TotalFinaElf) which enables the building of a realistic and consistent stratigraphic layering, and the computation of the facies proportions from hard data and geological knowledge. Neptune is based on the principle that, in shelf marine sedimentary environments, the depositional facies depends on the water depth, the energy of deposit, and the stratigraphic context. Therefore, Neptune provides models of depositional facies constructed on real stratigraphic grids, which reproduce in the whole field the prograding or transgressive features recorded at wells. This is possible thanks to a prior modeling of palaeobathymetry and also of accommodation potential, the easiest parameter to extrapolate. When this approach is associated with the modeling of diagenetic features that usually overprint depositional facies, it can drive the 3D distribution of petrophysics, and renders very realistic images of reservoir heterogeneity.

In recent years, many of the emerging technologies rely heavily on energy transport at extremely short time and length scales as a mean to overcome the superparamagnetic limit - a serious impediment to future advancement of storage technology. Additionally, thermally induced failure and reliability issues at the nanoscale are becoming increasingly important due to rapid device miniaturization in data storage applications. Further advances in high-technology data storage systems will be difficult, if not impossible, without rigorous treatment of nanoscale energy transport. This manuscript reviews the thermal design issues and challenges in thermally assisted magnetic disk recording, thermally assisted scanned probe recording, phase change optical data recording, magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) heads. Relevant thermally induced failures in GMR heads, write coil, interconnects and MRAM will be discussed as well.

The basic idea is to partition the memory space into a number of sectors. These sectors can, for example, represent address spaces for the code, heap, and stack segments of one or more application programs. Each address is first dynamically mapped to the appropriate sector and then is encoded with respect to the sector head. Each sector head is updated based on the last accessed address in that sector. The result of this sector-based encoding technique is a reduction in the number of bus transitions when encoding consecutive addresses that access different sectors. Our proposed techniques have small power and delay overhead when compared with many of the existing methods in the literature. One of our proposed techniques is very suitable for encoding addresses that are sent from an on-chip cache to the main memory when multiple application programs are executing on the processor in a time-sharing basis. For a computer system without an on-chip cache, the proposed techniques decrease the switching activity of data address and multiplexed address buses by an average of 55% and 67%, respectively. For a system with on-chip cache, up to 55% transition reduction is achieved on a multiplexed address bus between the internal cache and the external memory. Assuming a 10pF per line bus capacitance, we show that power reduction of up to 52% for an external data address bus and 42% for the multiplexed bus between cache and main memory is achieved using our methods.",,"Algorithms; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy conservation; Interconnection networks; Storage allocation (computer); Memory buses; Power reduction; Sector-based encoding technique; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036949789

ME 472 builds directly on the material covered in Thermodynamics (EM 301) taken during the student's junior year. In the first segment of ME 472, the students study advanced thermodynamic topics including exergy and combustion analyses. The students then analyze various mechanical systems including refrigeration systems, internal combustion engines, boilers, and fossil fuel-fired steam and gas turbine combined power plants. Exergetic efficiencies of various equipment and systems are determined. The final portion of the course covers direct energy conversion technology, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, thermionics, and magnetohydrodynamics.

A variety of ionization states and atomic-shell configurations arises in a hot plasma generated by short high-power pulses of laser light. The non-radiative conversion of the ionization energy within an atom can be suppressed in the hot plasma surroundings. The time scales of different processes in nuclear, atomic and condensed-matter subsystems are compared and the fast ionization in a solid, X-ray radiance in a plasma, and sample melting and recrystallization may precede nuclear fluorescence.

Energy-conscious design is important at all levels of system architecture, and the software has a key role, to play in conserving battery energy on these devices. With the increasing popularity of spatial database applications, and their anticipated deployment on mobile devices (such as road atlases and GPS-based applications), it is critical to examine the energy implications of spatial data storage and access methods for memory resident datasets. While there has been extensive prior research on spatial access methods on resource-rich environments, this is, perhaps, the first study to examine their suitability for resource-constrained environments. Using a detailed cycle-accurate energy estimation framework and four different datasets, this paper examines the pros and cons of three previously proposed spatial indexing alternatives from both the energy and performance angles. Specifically, the Quadtree, Packed R-tree, and Buddy-Tree structures are evaluated and compared with a brute-force approach that does not use an index. The results show that there are both performance and energy trade-offs between the indexing schemes for the different queries. The nature of the query also plays an important role in determining the energy-performance trade-offs. Further, technological trends and architectural enhancements are influencing factors on the relative behavior of the index structures. The work in the query has a bearing on how and where (on a mobile client or/and on a server) it should be performed for performance and energy savings. The results from this study will be beneficial for the design and implementation of embedded spatial databases, accelerating their deployment on numerous mobile devices.","Energy optimization; Multidimensional indexing; Resource-constrained computing; Spatial data","Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data storage equipment; Database systems; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Global positioning system; Indexing (of information); Miniature batteries; Servers; Trees (mathematics); Brute-force approach; Mobile computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036876664

It interacts with the processor by supporting related traffic (again comprising addresses, instructions, and data). Continuing exponential growth in processor performance, combined with technology, architecture, and application trends, place enormous demands on the memory system to permit this information storage and exchange at a high-enough performance (i.e., to provide low latency and high bandwidth access to large amounts of information). This paper comprehensively analyzes the redundancy in the information (addresses, instructions, and data) stored and exchanged between the processor and the memory system and evaluates the potential of compression in improving performance of the memory system. Analysis of traces obtained with Sun Microsystems' Shade simulator simulating SPARC executables of nine integer and six floating-point programs in the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite yield impressive results. Well-designed compression schemes may provide benefits in performance that far outweigh the extra time and logic for compression and decompression. This will be more so in the future since the speed and size of logic (which will be used to perform compression/decompression) are improving and are projected to improve at a much higher rate compared to those of interconnect (which will be used to communicate the information), both on-chip and off-chip.

Shipboard environments, driven by war fighting, hoteling, and safety arguments, are already influencing the development of high impulse weapons systems away from chemical or nuclear derived charging mechanisms. Shipboard High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons system concepts, for example, are already under pressure to adopt environmentally integratable, all-electric, solutions to meet requirements. Because of these influences, HEL weapons systems that employ solid-state cavity technology are being favorably received. Alternative technologies that are more difficult to integrate, such as the Free Electron Laser (FEL) and possibly the Chemical Oxygen-Iodine Laser (COIL) systems, are still under consideration but will require different electric power resources. For HEL systems, there are several critical factors in electric power delivery. Depending on the HEL technology; source capacity, flow rate regulation, drop-out and other source stability aspects can significantly influence weapons availability or performance. The nominal solution to achieving these reserve capacity and regulation requirements is to incorporate specialized components within the weapons system. Given the infrequency of weapons use, these specialized components should not be relegated to specific tasks only when their functions could be generally beneficial to the over-all power grid. Design approaches that cross-pollinate weapons systems power solutions with those being considered for the transmission, distribution and storage solutions in the power system would be more practical and cost efficient. Reserve power components designed to insure a consistent supply voltage and insulate against power failure can, for example, be used to enhance the performance of a nearby power grid node. With this approach, the all-electric ship power grid could undergo performance improvements with the addition of each new weapons system. ©2002 IEEE.",,"All-electric ships; Cross-pollinate weapons; High energy laser weapons; Power grid node; Accident prevention; Cost effectiveness; Electric potential; Electric power distribution; High energy lasers; Insulation; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844514511

For both planned and unplanned shutdowns, live fluids from the wellbore will come into contact with a cold flowline and can form hydrates during restart since the conditions at the mudline are often well within the hydrate formation region. As the water depth increases, the potential for even higher shut-in pressures exists, exacerbating the probability of hydrate formation. The achievable restart flowrates are directly related to the available inhibitor rates. Ultradeepwater systems often require high hydrate inhibitor (i.e. methanol) dosage rates to protect the flowline from hydrate formation. In general, the temperature warm-up trend is exponential and is a function of the amount of energy input into the system. If the restart flowrate is too low, limited by inhibitor availability, the temperature may slowly approach a condition at which the system is free from hydrate formation and ultimately require a significant inhibitor volume. For these low restart flowrates, the time to reach conditions above the hydrate formation region can be very significant or the flowline may never warm up above hydrate conditions. At high restart flowrates, the flowline warms up quickly, but the inhibitor delivery rates are high, often significantly higher than those required for a similar development in shallow water. There is a trade-off between inhibitor deliverability (line size) and consumption (storage) that must be accounted for at the design stage of a project when considering how to restart the system. Operational procedures such as preheating the flowline with dead (de-gassed/de-watered) crude oil to warm up the pipe walls before restarting the wells have been suggested as a means of expediting the overall flowline warm-up. Preheating the pipe walls maintains, the thermal energy in the production fluid and reduces temperature losses associated with the fluid warming up the pipe walls. The effectiveness of this technique, while potentially reducing the warm-up time, may again be limited by the allowable restart flowrates.",,"Heat resistance; Hydrates; Marine risers; Oil field development; Oil well drilling; Oil well production; Petroleum reservoirs; Probability; Project management; Flowrates; Wellbores; Flowlines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142278776

Various forms of regenerative braking systems have been proposed. They include electric batteries, capacitors, flywheels, and compressed air. Some have been implemented on a limited scale. The benefits of regenerative braking systems are easy to qualitatively describe, but can be challenging to quantify. The potential benefits depend upon obvious things such as driving patterns and the often overlooked considerations such as additional weight and cost, the less than ideal charge-discharge efficiency and a strategy for energy storage management that requires a forecast of the future driving pattern, such as uphill or downhill or stopping or accelerating. This paper will analyze a hydraulically coupled compressed air storage system that has been proposed for heavy vehicles. It uses the hydraulic system for transferring energy between the compressed air and the vehicle. The paper will also consider the possibility of thermal enhancement of the compressed air with engine exhaust heat. With this enhancement the compressed air system becomes an Otto cycle engine. The expansion can occur at a higher pressure than the compression. Thus, thermally enhanced storage has the potential of recovering more work for the vehicle with the discharge expansion than was put in during the charging compression. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Enhanced options; Enhanced storage; Regenerative braking; Rolling drag; Acceleration; Electric potential; Friction; Kinetic energy; Motion control; Regenerators; Traffic control; Braking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844532670

Due to their attractive performance characteristics, lithium-ion batteries have been identified as the battery chemistry of choice for a number of future applications, including planetary orbiters, rovers and landers. For example, under the Mars Surveyor Program MSP 01 lithium -ion batteries were developed by Lithion (each being 28 V, 25 Ah, 8-cells, and 9 kg) and fully qualified prior to mission cancellation. In addition to the requirement of being able to supply at least 90 cycles on the surface of Mars, the battery demonstrated operational capability (both charge and discharge) over a large temperature range (-20°C to +40°C), with tolerance to non-operational excursions to-30°C and 50°C. Currently, JPL is implementing lithium-ion technology on the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER), which will be coupled with a solar array. This mission has similar performance requirements to that of the 2001 Lander in that high energy density and a wide operating temperature range are necessitated. In addition to planetary rover and lander applications, we are also engaged in determining the viability of using lithium-ion technology for orbiter applications that require exceptionally long life (>20,000 cycles at partial depth of discharge). To assess the viability of lithium -ion cells for these applications, a number of performance characterization tests have been performed (at the cell and battery level) on state-of-art prototype lithium- ion cells, including: assessing the cycle life performance (at varying DODs), life characteristics at extreme temperatures (< -10°C and >+40°C), rate capability as a function of temperature (-30° to 40°C), pulse capability, self-discharge and storage characteristics, as well as, mission profile capability. This paper will describe the current and future NASA missions that are considering lithium ion batteries and will contain results of the cell testing conducted to-date to validate the technology for these missions. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Cell testing; Lithium-ion cell technology; Mars Exploration Rover (MER); Surface Lander spacecrafts; Anodes; Computer hardware; Electric generators; Electrolytes; Ions; Martian surface analysis; Thermoelectricity; Lithium batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844494193

The PV module contains photovoltaic arrays that convert solar energy to electrical power, and an integrated equipment assembly (IEA) that houses electrical hardware and batteries for electric power regulation and storage. Each PV module contains two independent power channels for fault tolerance. Each power channel contains three batteries in parallel to meet its performance requirements and for fault tolerance. Each battery consists of 76 Ni-Hydrogen (Ni-H 2) cells in series. These 76 cells are contained in two orbital replaceable units (ORU) that are connected in series. On-orbit data are monitored and trended to ensure that all hardware is operating normally. Review of on-orbit data showed that while five batteries are operating very well, one is showing signs of mismatched ORUs. The cell pressure in the two ORUs differs by an amount that exceeds the recommended range. The reason for this abnormal behavior may be that the two ORUs have different use history. An assessment was performed and it was determined that capacity of this battery would be limited by the lower pressure ORU. Steps are being taken to reduce this pressure differential before battery capacity drops to the point of affecting its ability to meet performance requirements. As a first step, a battery re-initialization procedure was developed to reduce this pressure differential. The procedure was successfully carried out on-orbit and the pressure differential was reduced to the recommended range. This paper describes the battery performance and the consequences of mismatched ORUs that make a battery. The paper also describes the re-initialization procedure, how it was performed on orbit and battery performance after the re-initialization. On-orbit data monitoring and trending is an ongoing activity and it will continue as ISS assembly progresses. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Battery re-initialization; Battery/charge/discharge unit (BCDU); International space station; Photovoltaic module; Electric fault currents; Electric potential; Electric power systems; Fuel cells; Parameter estimation; Photovoltaic effects; Pressure drop; Space stations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844474185

These vehicles will have the same range, power and maneuverability currently enjoyed by those powered with the internal combustion (IC) engine. The vehicles will have an electric drive motor (or motors) with minimal on-board energy storage (flywheel, capacitor, battery or fuel cell) as a reservoir when not in the range of the recharge network. The goal is to retain all the positive attributes of the IC-engine driven vehicles while eliminating pollution and dependency on hydrocarbon fuels. The recharge network is called the Remote Charging System for a Vehicle, or simply the Vehicle Remote Charge (VRC). This is a wireless power transmission system that replenishes the on-board energy storage system of a moving (or parked) vehicle with a microwave or laser power beam. The concept of transmitting electric power using a conductorless method has been in existence since the early 1900s. In the 1960s the idea was proposed to beam orbiting satellite-collected solar energy to the surface of the earth for use in the existing electric power grid. Hence utilizing a fully integrated network from satellite -collected solar power to on-board energy storage of a moving vehicle would entail a completely pollution-free, renewable energy transportation system for the country. Research in this field is an on-going effort, and the efficacy of wireless power transmission has been demonstrated in many tests around the world. A simple power transmission model demonstrates that the wireless power beam energy can be transmitted effectively to the vehicle, providing the necessary motive power to operate the vehicle. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Electric power grid; Proton exchange membranes; Remote charging systems; Vehicle remote charge (VRC); Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Laser beams; Wireless telecommunication systems; Electric power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844435696

An optimization algorithm based on the Lagrange Multiplier method has been developed to minimize the power system distribution losses. The objective function is obtained by the summation of the system peak real power loss cost, annual energy loss cost, and the cost associated with purchasing and installing the additional water heaters used for DLC. The objective function subject to a number of constraints is solved to obtain the optimal number and location of water heaters under DLC.

Currently, buoy environmental monitoring payloads use all available power. Future buoy upgrade options considered include increasing the environmental monitoring capability, as well as possibly supporting other U.S. Government functions, such as for the Federal Aviation Administration to support their air traffic control activities. These upgrade options will require an increase in buoy power system capability. Reductions in future buoy power system maintenance requirements are also desirable. The environmental conditions experienced by buoys located in high-latitude locations pose a special challenge. In the winter, the very cold temperatures and lack of sunlight severely limit the power output of the current buoy power system, which is based on conventional silicon-based photovoltaic cells and sealed lead-acid batteries. To address these issues, Science Applications International Corporation recently conducted a top-level system engineering design study to identify realistic, near-term cost-effective design options to meet emerging power system requirements for NDBC buoys, particularly in challenging high-latitude environments. The study identified requirements, design drivers, and operational issues, and examined potential power system upgrade solutions using aerospace-type technologies. The study found that increases in power output and energy storage capability were indeed possible through use of near-term alternative technology. At the conclusion of the study, a Ni-Cd battery based system was identified that could increase power capability and require less maintenance support. This paper also presents proposals for additional design study and supporting activities that may have additional potential to address this difficult issue.",,"Air traffic control; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Maintenance; Photovoltaic cells; Environmental monitoring; Buoys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037971672

This secondary particle flux can be exploited to provide a useful storage ring operations tool for optimization of luminosity. A novel segmented, multigap, pressurized gas ionization chamber is being develop for sampling the energy deposited near the maxima of the hadronic/electromagnetic showers in these absorbers.

The ionization chambers are instrumented with low-noise, fast, pulse-shaping electronics to be capable of resolving individual bunch crossings at 40 Mhz. Data on each bunch are to be separately accumulated over multiple bunch crossings until the desired statistical accuracy is obtained. At design luminosity, approximately 2 × 103 bunch crossings will suffice for a 1% luminosity measurement.

WAVE, a one-dimensional engine analysis tool available from Ricardo Software, was used to model a 2.5L 103 kW Detroit Diesel engine. This model was validated against engine performance and emissions data obtained from testing in a combustion laboratory. ADVISOR, an HEV simulation software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE), was used to model a 2002 Ford Explorer that is being converted into an HEV by the Penn State University FutureTruck team. By integrating the output file from WAVE as the input engine data file for ADVISOR, one can predict the effect of changes in engine parameters on vehicle emissions, fuel consumption, and power requirements for specified drive cycles. This information is used to optimize the HEV configuration (e.g., series versus parallel HEV) and control strategy (e.g., torque required from the IC engine versus the electric motor as a function of driver inputs and vehicle speed) for minimum overall vehicle fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. This research represents a novel integration and application of two widely available simulation tools to advance the development of hybrid electric vehicles. The research was carried out in support of Penn State's FutureTruck project. FutureTruck is a DOE- and corporate-sponsored competition that challenges teams of students from 15 top North American universities to reengineer a conventional production sport utility vehicle into a low-emissions vehicle with at least 25% higher fuel economy without sacrificing the performance, utility, safety, and affordability that consumers want. Modeling and simulation are playing a key role in meeting these objectives.

In one case a plasma blanket surrounds a plasma antenna. The surrounding plasma blanket has a variable and controlled density. In the regions of the plasma blanket with the plasma extinguished or with the plasma frequency much less than the antenna frequency, the region becomes transparent to electromagnetic waves from the antenna. In regions where the plasma frequency is much higher than the antenna frequency the plasma behaves like a good reflector and can block radiation. Thus we can create windows or aperture and shape a reconfigurable antenna radiation field. In the second model, we have a plasma wave guide with a plasma filled tube along the axis of the wave guide. When the waveguide is operating below cutoff with the plasma in the inner tube is extinguished, we can store electromagnetic energy in the evanescent field.

The average commercial building has smaller and more diverse energy requirements than would be expected at a typical industrial site. Consequently, even though the electrical requirements of the commercial and industrial sectors are very similar there is nine times more installed industrial CHP capacity than commercial CHP in the U.S. However, the advent of microturbines and increasing commercial viability of fuel cells promises generator sizes much more suitable for use in the commercial sector. There are many possible uses for the waste heat in a commercial building, depending upon geographic location, occupant requirements and the energy cost structures of both fuel and grid electricity. Possible waste heat technologies include absorption chillers, humidifiers, desiccant dehumidifiers, steam generators, hot water heating, space heating and thermal storage. Several of these could be combined with a generator to produce a commercial CHP for Buildings package. A well-designed and operated package should deliver energy and environmental savings as well as significant cost savings to the customer. Other potential value streams are improved indoor air quality, peak shaving to reduce demand charges, enhanced power reliability, tradable environmental credits or grid independence.

Steady progress has been made in implementing QCA; a small binary logic device has recently been manufactured and its logical switching behavior demonstrated. However, computation with hierarchical assemblies of primitive logic devices has not yet been demonstrated. Earlier work has shown that the four ground states of the originally proposed automata for implementing AND and OR are at slightly different energy levels. Because of this, certain combinations of these gates relax to ground states that encode an incorrect computation. A previously proposed construct, which essentially computes all four ground states simultaneously and thus evens out the disparities, works well under the idealized charge neutralization scheme originally proposed by the inventors of QCA. Unfortunately, under the more realistic image charge neutralization, the construction has only slightly better characteristics than the original gates and only then when the separation distance between the automaton and the metal layer generating the image charges is rather small. This paper investigates methods for evening out the disparate ground states in the presence of image charge neutralization. Previously, it was shown that the more symmetric the automaton, the better its computational behavior under image charge neutralization. It is shown that adding symmetry also reduces the disparity in ground states and a new construct for balancing QCA logic gates is presented. © 2002 IEEE.","Assembly; Energy states; Logic devices; Logic gates; Manufacturing; Quantum cellular automata; Quantum computing; Quantum dots; Quantum mechanics; Stationary state","Assembly; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Computation theory; Electron energy levels; Ground state; Image storage tubes; Logic devices; Logic gates; Manufacture; Nanocrystals; Nanotechnology; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Charge neutralization; Hierarchical assemblies; Quantum Cellular automata; Quantum Computing; Quantum mechanical effects; Quantum-dot cellular automata; Separation distances; Stationary state; Quantum theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649120939

This numerical study focuses on the thermal management issues that arise when electronic components experience a sudden surge in power dissipation. The transient response of the energy storage system to short pulses in power dissipation is studied. Convective cooling using air-cooled heat sinks on the sides of the containment remote from the heat sources provides for heat rejection to ambient air. The analysis is performed under different pulse frequencies. Different aspect ratios for the containment volume as well as different locations for the heat sources are studied in order to identify an optimal arrangement. Conduction and convection in the phase change material as well as conduction through the containment walls are considered in the computations. The constitutive equations are implicitly solved using a fully transient method on fixed orthogonal co-located finite volumes. The system is characterized based on the rate of heat absorption as well as the maximum temperatures experienced at the heat sources. Improvements that can be made in the application of latent heat energy storage in electronics cooling applications are discussed based on the results from the present study.","Electronics cooling; Phase change energy storage; Phase change material; Transient heat dissipation","Computational methods; Cooling; Electronics packaging; Heat conduction; Heat convection; Heat losses; Heat sinks; Phase change materials (PCM); Heat storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036459251

First, the classification system is generally applicable to any waste that contains radionuclides, hazardous chemicals, or mixtures of the two. Over the last two decades, the separate and quite different systems for classifying and managing radioactive and chemical wastes have led to considerable difficulties in managing mixed wastes that contain both types of hazardous substances. For the most part, however, the development of different approaches to classifying and managing waste was not driven by differences in the properties of radionuclides and hazardous chemicals or their potential risks to human health. Thus, there is no evident need of separate systems for classifying and managing radioactive and chemical wastes. Second, waste that contains hazardous substances is classified based on considerations of health risks to the public that arise from waste disposal. The existing classification systems for radioactive and chemical wastes in the United States are not based primarily on considerations of health risks to the public. Rather, classification of hazardous wastes has been based primarily on the source of the waste or the presence of particular hazardous substances. The absence of risk-based waste classifications has had a number of undesirable ramifications: Some wastes are managed more stringently and at higher cost than warranted by the health risks they pose. For example, lower-activity high-level radioactive wastes have been managed at high cost as if they require disposal in a geologic repository to protect public health, even though they are less hazardous than some low-level wastes that are managed at much less cost and are considered acceptable for near-surface disposal. Other wastes may be managed less stringently than warranted, such as wastes from mining and energy exploitation activities that contain elevated levels of hazardous chemicals, especially heavy metals, and naturally occurring radionuclides. Some wastes that pose similar health risks are placed in different classes (e.g., high-level, transuranic, and high-activity, longer-lived low-level radioactive wastes), whereas wastes that pose risks ranging from innocuous to highly hazardous may be placed in the same class (e.g., Class-A and greater-than-Class-C low-level radioactive wastes, diluted and highly concentrated listed hazardous chemical wastes). Such inconsistencies do not seem sensible to a nonexpert, and they may increase suspicion and mistrust of authorities by the public, which can only exacerbate the already difficult challenge of managing hazardous wastes. Third, the hazardous waste classification system includes an exempt class of waste. Waste in this class would pose a sufficiently low risk that it could be managed in all respects as if it were nonhazardous material. Wastes that contain low levels of hazardous substances have been exempted on a case-by-case basis, but existing waste classification systems do not include generally applicable exemption principles. As a consequence, many slightly contaminated waste materials are managed at considerable cost as if they were hazardous. If an exempt class of waste were established, recycling and reuse of exempt materials, such as scrap metals at nuclear facilities, could be considered, thus saving valuable resources for other needs and reducing impacts on the environment. Based on these principles, the hazardous waste classification system recommended by NCRP includes three classes of waste: exempt, low-hazard, and high-hazard waste. Each waste class is defined in relation to the type of disposal system (technology) that is expected to be generally acceptable in protecting public health as follows: Exempt waste: any waste containing hazardous substances that is generally acceptable for disposition as nonhazardous material (e.g., disposal in a municipal/industrial landfill for nonhazardous waste). Low-hazard waste: any nonexempt waste that is generally acceptable for disposal in a dedicated near-surface facility for hazardous wastes. High-hazard waste: any nonexempt waste that generally requires a disposal system more isolating than a dedicated near-surface facility for hazardous wastes (e.g., a geologic repository). Given these conceptual definitions, NCRP recommends that the boundaries of waste classes should be quantified in terms of limits on concentrations of hazardous substances based on the following principles: Waste would be classified as exempt if the concentrations of hazardous substances are sufficiently low that it poses no more than a negligible risk to a hypothetical inadvertent intruder at a municipal/industrial landfill for nonhazardous waste. A negligible risk, or the associated dose, is a value so low that further efforts at risk reduction generally are unwarranted (e.g., an excess lifetime cancer risk less than about 10-4 or doses of noncarcinogenic hazardous substances substantially less than nominal thresholds for induction of health effects in the general population). Waste that exceeds concentration limits for exempt waste would be classified as low-hazard if it poses no more than an acceptable (i.e., barely tolerable) risk to a hypothetical inadvertent intruder at a dedicated near-surface disposal facility for hazardous wastes, with the important condition that an acceptable risk or dose used to determine low-hazard waste should be substantially higher than a negligible risk or dose used to determine exempt waste. Waste that exceeds concentration limits for low-hazard waste would be classified as high-hazard. NCRP recognizes that potential risks to residents near waste disposal sites are a primary consideration in determining acceptable disposal practices for hazardous wastes. Because such risks are highly site-specific, they do not provide a suitable basis for generally classifying waste. However, NCRP expects that nearly all exempt and low-hazard waste would be acceptable for disposal using the intended technology at well chosen sites when potential risks to nearby residents are considered in the process of licensing or permitting specific disposal facilities. Based on suitable precedents for defining negligible and acceptable (barely tolerable) risks to the public from exposure to hazardous substances, the proposed classification system should be largely consistent with current classifications of hazardous wastes and plans for their disposal. For example: most low-level radioactive waste and hazardous chemical waste would be classified as low-hazard; and most high-level, transuranic, and high-activity, longer-lived low-level radioactive waste would be classified as high-hazard. However, some hazardous chemical wastes, especially wastes that contain high concentrations of heavy metals, might not be generally acceptable for near-surface disposal and, thus, would be classified as high-hazard. The existing classification system for hazardous chemical waste does not include such a class, and there are no planned alternatives to near-surface disposal for highly hazardous chemical wastes. NCRP believes that the proposed hazardous waste classification system offers significant advantages compared with the classification systems currently used in the United States. In addition to addressing deficiencies in the existing classification systems for radioactive and hazardous chemical wastes and promoting more cost-effective management of all hazardous wastes, the proposed approach to classification of waste based on risk is simple and understandable. The clear association of hazardous waste classification with requirements for protection of public health, which is lacking in the existing classification systems, should serve to increase public confidence in waste management and disposal activities.",,"radioactive element; radioisotope; classification; disease severity; drug mixture; geography; hazardous waste; health care planning; law; nonhuman; nuclear waste; public health; radiation hazard; radiation measurement; radiation protection; radioactive waste; radioactive waste disposal; radioactive waste processing; radioactive waste storage; review; risk assessment; technology; waste disposal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144433220

A complete solution of the 1D governing heat and mass transfer equations with an ideally selective reactor surface are used to predict bounds on performance in terms of volume flow rates and realistic actuation times.

The mRNA encoding ASP was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction which predicted a 76 residue peptide. Based on this sequence, we generated antisera to a C-terminal peptide (ASP)1-20) which aided ASP purification. Identity of the purified protein was verified by N-terminal sequencing. The molecular mass of porcine ASP is 8926. Porcine ASP stimulated esterification of fatty acid into triacylglycerol in cultured human cells with potency similar to that of human ASP (twofold at 5 μM).

Moreover, the IR magnets for high energy colliders and storage rings must operate in an environment where the amount of energy deposited on superconducting coils is rather large. In the case of doublet IR optics with flat beams, the design of the first 2-in-1 quadrupole defines the geometry and pole tip field in this and other IR magnets. This paper will present a novel design of this magnet that allows a very small separation between the two apertures. A brief discussion of the conceptual magnetic design of this and other magnets for interaction regions is given. The influence of critical current density in superconductor (a higher value of which is most beneficial to high performance IR magnet design) is also discussed. Since High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) retain most of their critical current density at high fields and at elevated temperatures, they offer an attractive possibility for the IR magnet designs of future colliders or upgrades of present colliders.","Accelerators; High temperature superconductors; Interaction region; Quadrupoles","Colliding beam accelerators; Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric coils; High temperature superconductors; Magnetic fields; Storage rings; Elevated temperature; Interaction region magnets; Very large hadron collider; Magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036509576

Soil carbon (C), which typically constitutes about one half of SOM, is closely linked to many desirable soil physical, chemical, and biological properties that are associated with enhanced soil productivity and quality (Reicosky, 1996b; Ismail et al., 1994). More recently, awareness has also increased concerning the negative impact that tillage has on SOM storage (Reicosky, 1995; Jackson, 1998). While moderate tillage may provide more favorable soil conditions for crop growth and development and weed control over the short term (Carter, 1998), intensive tillage of agricultural soils has historically led to substantial losses of soil C that range from 30 to 50%. Conventional tillage practices disrupt soil aggregates exposing more organic matter to microbial degradation and oxidation (Reicosky, 1996a), and are one of the primary causes of tilth deterioration over the long term (Karlen et al., 1990). Micro-and macrochannels within the soil, created by natural processes, such as decaying roots and worms, may also be destroyed by tillage (Carter, 1998). Deep tillage, as is customarily done as a routine soil preparation operation, is also costly and requires high energy and increased subsequent effort to prepare seedbeds. A recent survey by Jackson (1998), documenting a 40% decline in SOM since intensive tillage practices began in the Salinas Valley, confirms the conclusion drawn from other long-term crop rotation studies (e.g., the Morrow Plots at the University of Illinois; the Sanborn Field Plots in Columbia, MO; and the Columbia Plateau Plots near Pendleton, OR) that intensive tillage typically leads to decreased soil C via gaseous CO emissions in virtually all crop production systems (reviewed by Reicosky, 1996b). There is mounting evidence as well as concern that this C source has been a significant component of the historic increase in atmospheric CO (Wilson, 1978; Post et al., 1990), and the potentially associated greenhouse effect (Lal et al., 1998) that is attracting intense attention worldwide. © 2003 by CRC Press LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055369844

The experiments were designed to assess the injection/mixing/settling regimes required for optimum water-removal performance from a meso-stable water-in-oil emulsion with an oil spill demulsifier. The use of a demulsifier injected into a recovery system, combined with decanting, could substantially reduce the volume of water in temporary storage tanks and the water content of emulsions for disposal/recycling. The degree of emulsion breaking achieved increased with increasing mixing energy applied to the fluid. The best location for injection of the demulsifier was at the skimmer pump for recovered fluids containing ≤ 50% free water to maximize the amount and time of the mixing applied. Primary break occurred in only a few minutes. The use of a demulsifier increased TPH concentrations by approximately a factor of two in the decanted water. As long as the recovered fluid contained at least 33% free water, the pressure drops due to skin friction in the tubing and hoses approximated those expected for flowing water. The use of an in-line mixer significantly increased back pressures.

This numerical study focuses on the thermal management issues that arise when electronic components experience a sudden surge in power dissipation. The transient response of the energy storage system to short pulses in power dissipation is studied. Convective cooling using air-cooled heat sinks on the sides of the containment remote from the heat sources provides for heat rejection to ambient air. The analysis is performed under different pulse frequencies. Different aspect ratios for the containment volume as well as different locations for the heat sources are studied in order to identify an optimal arrangement. Conduction and convection in the phase change material as well as conduction through the containment walls are considered in the computations. The constitutive equations are implicitly solved using a fully transient method on fixed orthogonal co-located finite volumes. The system is characterized based on the rate of heat absorption as well as the maximum temperatures experienced at the heat sources.

Such strategies not only help to address climate change but also contribute significantly to conserving the earth's highly threatened forest ecosystems and biological diversity (""biodiversity"") - resources which are critical to human prosperity and survival. The Nature Conservancy has pioneered forest carbon sequestration projects in Latin America. The largest such project, Noel Kempff Climate Action Project in Bolivia, is described in detail, including some of the major design issues and challenges. The article concludes with a brief discussion of why the insurance industry might be motivated to participate in carbon sequestration strategies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346672736

They provide backup power when outages occur, which used to be pretty rare. However, changes to the business climate for utilities and the demand for improved power quality will increasingly subject these batteries to a more demanding cycle service environment. C&D has developed improved designs for this more rigorous duty cycle by focusing on the active material retention system. For the flooded types, adopting retention methods commonly used in forklift truck batteries significantly improves the cycle life. For valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries, which have inherently better endurance in cycling applications but are susceptible to overheating and dry-out, a proprietary AGM/gel hybrid technology is used to achieve improved life in standby applications.",,"Electric power generation; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Lead acid batteries; Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036907272

One such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array (LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberations in the image plane. Second, the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order, but to others as well. This multiple-order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane. We describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations. The proposed postprocessing technique is based on a Wiener deconvolution filter. The technique, however, is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.","Broadband; Image restoration; Image steering; Optical phased array","Aberrations; Diffraction gratings; Digital image storage; Image reconstruction; Liquid crystal displays; Object recognition; Optical design; Optical filters; Reflection; Spectrum analysis; Broadband imagery; Chromatic aberrations; Digital image restoration; Image steering; Liquid crystal optical phased array; Wiener deconvolution filter; Imaging systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036810719

The storage container, the ALR8(SI), must be investigated for quality and longevity requirements. As a part of validating the U.S. Department of Energy's quality requirements, a computer model was developed and validated to predict the temperature distribution within both the stored components and the internal structure of the ALR8(SI) container to analyze the thermal performance of the container. Experimental data were obtained and served as a comparison for examining the validity of the numerical model. The thermal response of the ALR8(SI) under normal storage conditions was investigated experimentally. Results were obtained for different values of heat generation rate (15, 20, 25, and 30 W), outside container temperature (20, 25, and 30°C), and different backfill gases (air, argon, and helium). A finite element model consisting of a thermal and a flow domain was created and solved simultaneously using SDRC I-DEAS Master Series 6. Solutions were obtained for most of the experiments performed. The predicted temperature distribution matched quite well in magnitude with the experimental data. For most locations, predicted temperatures deviated less than 2°C from the experimental temperatures, whereas the maximum deviation was around 4°C. In most cases, the maximum-recorded temperature exceeded the quality limit of 60°C. A theoretical study of the heat transfer mechanisms showed either conduction through the backfill gas or natural convection as the primary mode of heat transfer, depending on the backfill gas. In an attempt to reduce the interior temperatures of the ALR8(SI), a modification to one of the ALR8(SI) components was made in the numerical model to enhance heat transfer. Solutions of this modified container predicted significantly lower temperatures of the interior.",,"Computer simulation; Density (specific gravity); Heat conduction; Heat transfer coefficients; Plutonium; Prandtl number; Surfaces; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Velocity; Heat generation rate; Plutonium storage container; Rayleigh number; Thermoanalysis; Thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036810420

As in conventional electric railway drive trains, the base loading is still provided by the overhead line. However, the peaking power is provided by an on-board energy storage device.

Then, we explore design trade-offs by varying these parameters to minimize the system-wide energy. For matrix multiplication, we consider a uniprocessor architecture and a linear array architecture to develop energy-efficient designs. For the uniprocessor architecture, the cache size is a parameter that affects the I/O complexity and the system-wide energy. For the linear array architecture, the amount of storage per processing element is a parameter affecting the system-wide energy. By using maximum amount of storage per processing element and minimum number of multipliers, we obtain a design that minimizes the system-wide energy.

The validation approach is a product of ASHRAE Research Project RP-1004, Determining Long-Term Performance of Cool Storage Systems from Short-Term Tests. Ensuring the quality of the data by field validation is preferable to post-processing. However, data validation is necessary to verify the accuracy of measurements, even when sensor accuracy has been verified in the field. Validation is critical if data collected by others are to be used for performance evaluation or if field verification capabilities are limited. The paper presents several tests for verifying the accuracy and consistency of a data set. Tests are based on instantaneous energy balances, energy balances over time, flow balances, and temperature agreements where more than one sensor is measuring the same quantity. The general procedure for the tests is to calculate two or more quantities from selected subsets of the data and verify that they agree within a desired tolerance. Lack of agreement indicates that further analysis or on-site measurements are necessary to determine which sensor(s) are in error. Appropriate tests for a given system generally depend on the specific configuration and operating strategy. This paper describes a number of tests that are applicable to many cool storage systems.

These databases are actively maintained by a team of systems analysts so that they contain state-of-art data as well as the most recent technology performance projections. Sizing of the power subsystems can be accomplished either by using an assumed mass specific power (W/kg) or energy (Wh/kg) or by a bottoms-up calculation that accounts for individual component performance and masses.

The goal of the current study was to evaluate the protective effect of intracellular trehalose on sperm nucleus by predicting the long-term nuclear degradation kinetics of desiccated spermatozoa using an Arrhenius model whose parameters are obtained from high temperature-short time storage studies. B6D2F1 sperm isolated in an EGTA supplemented tris-HCl buffer (with or without 0.5M intracellular trehalose) were convectively dried with inert nitrogen gas in a controlled manner to moisture content &lt;5%. The samples were then vacuum packed and stored at 22, 37, 45, 60 and 90°C for 1, 3 or 7 days. Following rehydration, the sperm sample was assayed for DNA damage using the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Results indicate significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower DNA degradation for cells dried with intracellular trehalose at 45, 60 and 90°C for 1, 3 or 7 days compared to cells dried without trehalose. Based on a 10% increase in the index of injury, the calculated activation energy and frequency factors were 10.33 kcal/mole and 5.4×105 hr-1 respectively for cells dried in EGTA solution only. The corresponding numbers for cells dried in EGTA solution supplemented with 0.5M trehalose were 5.7 kcal/mole and 43.73 hr-1. Based on these parameters the time required for 10% DNA degradation are 279 and 759 hours for samples desiccated in plain EGTA vs. trehalose supplemented EGTA.

To reduce this effect, the electrodes of instruments are usually covered with electroconductive light- absorptive coatings having low reflectivity at the wavelength of 121.6 nm. In this paper the physical mechanisms are considered applicable to reduce the reflectivity of the Al-based coatings to be applied on electrodes of the particle analyzing instruments. Particular emphasis has been given to the role of three phenomena: (i) multiple light scattering in light traps of the rough surface, (ii) diffraction of the incident light at the rough surface of the coating, and (iii) electron scattering in a skin layer.

Dual pulse width capability allows for ready selection of 5.2 ms, for slow beam spills, or 2.6 ms operation for reduced thermal stresses on the focusing horns during fast spill. Intended for installation in an underground equipment room, the design incorporates several novel features to facilitate transport, installation, and maintenance. Various designs were examined to arrive at the most economical approach for providing the high pulse currents to the horns located in the very high radiation field, up to 3 × 10̂7 kRads/yr absorbed dose of the beamline.

A small amount of energy is switched each cycle but only a fraction is actually transferred to the store during the first portion of the charging process. The series resonant inverter behaves as a current source; and a constant amount of charge is delivered to the capacitor store each switching cycle. During the first portion of the charging process, the voltage on the store is low and the power or energy transfer is small compared to the constant volt-ampere capacity of the circuit. That is, there is a low power factor or impedance mismatch. During the switching cycle, there is an initial transfer of energy from the power source through the switching circuit; however, only a small portion of the energy stays in the capacitor store. The remainder flows back to the source and is then recycled again during the next switching cycle. Therefore, to transfer a given energy to the store requires the processing of a large amount of reactive power. By introducing an ""energy trap"" innovation to the circuit, the initial energy is forced to transfer to the store [1]. The time required for this forced transfer to occur depends upon the voltage on the store. The transfer time is long when the voltage is low and decreases as the voltage increases. Since a new switching cycle cannot be initiated until the energy transfer of the present cycle is completed, the switching frequency must be chirped to match the circuit state as the charging process proceeds. An ""adaptive clocking innovation"" is used to monitor the energy transfer process and to clock the beginning of the next switching cycle when the energy transfer is completed. The result is a lower over-all switching frequency with lower losses for the same total energy transfer to the load. Since the circuit operates at a lower frequency at the beginning of the charging process one may be concerned that it would force the transformer size to increase. This is not the case because the transformer is working at a lower voltage during the low frequency part of the charging process and this combination of frequency and voltage results in a constant transformer flux and a lower over-all core loss.",,"Capacitance; Circuit resonance; Computer simulation; Electric inverters; Electric network analysis; Electric power factor; Electric transformers; Energy transfer; Impedance matching (electric); Switching networks; Adaptive clocking; Energy trapping; Series resonant inverter; Switching cycle; Capacitor storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036999035

Along with impurity data, often absent or unknown as a result of post-processing storage environment is moisture content. Radiolysis of moisture may lead to a hydrogen flammability hazard within a closed volume such as a storage can or a transportation package. This paper offers a practical means of qualifying payloads of unknown moisture content for shipment within Type B packaging, while supporting the DOE program to maintain radworker dose as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA).

Subsequent belljar testing can measure the rate of gas leakage from a storage can.

The lithium would provide a source for tritium and remove the problems associated with the radioactivity of stored tritium and the cryogenic storage of propellant for long times. Tritium has a 12.4 year half-life and is present naturally only in infinitesimal quantities. Lithium hydrides are used in nuclear weapons but the pellets used in nuclear pulse propulsion are much smaller than thermonuclear devices and so it will be difficult to make use of the lithium effectively. The product of the cross-section, the density and the distance traveled through the lithium controls the probability for lithium to produce tritium when it collides with a neutron. There is little control over the cross-section since the cross-section is a function of the neutron kinetic energy, and the initial neutron kinetic energy is fixed by the nuclear reactions. Safety concerns also limit control over the size of the pellets since they must be kept below the size of a thermonuclear nuclear device. Hence only the density can be adjusted, which must be done by compressing the pellet. This initial study indicates that significant compression will be required to effectively use lithium. Several methods are available to compress the pellet: 1) chemical implosion, 2)-laser compression and 3) electron or ion beam compression. Particle beam compression appears to be the best choice.

After optimizing the frequency ramp parameters, we used 100 multiple spin flips to measure a spin-flip efficiency of [Formula presented].

The key element of the scheme represents an additional plasma volume, where a magnetically accelerated wire array is used for inductive current switching. This plasma acceleration volume is connected in parallel to a microsecond capacitor bank and to a 100-ns current ruse-time useful load. Simple estimates suggest that optimized scheme parameters could be reachable even when operating at ultra-high currents. We describe first proof-of-principle experiments carried out on GIT12 generator [1] at the wire-array current level of 2 MA. The obtained confirmation of the concept consists in generation of a 200 kV voltage directly at an inductive load. This load voltage value can be already sufficient to transfer the available magnetic energy into kinetic energy of a liner at this current level. Two-dimensional modeling with the radiational MHD numerical tool Marple [2] confirms the development of inductive voltage in the system. However, the average voltage increase is accompanied by short-duration voltage drops due to interception of the current by the low-density upstream plasma. Upon our viewpoint, this instability of the current distribution represents the main physical limitation to the scheme performance. © 2002 AIP.",,"Kinetics; Particle beams; Pinch effect; Current distribution; Inductive energy storage; Inductive voltages; Physical limitations; Plasma acceleration; Power conditioning; Proof-of-principle experiments; Two dimensional model; Kinetic energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865032428

The fast energy storage systems investigated in these design studies included Fast Marx Generators (FMG with √LC = 200 ns and √;LC = 300 ns) and Linear Transformer Drivers (LTD). A design sketch of a compact 20-MA PRS driver and a potential upgrade of Double-EAGLE using FMG technology will be presented. The first concept that will be discussed is a 16-MA driver for PRS (plasma radiation source) loads. This generator would consist of 48 eight-stage FMG units and 13 m diameter and would drive the PRS directly without further pulse compression. The second concept that will be presented is a potential upgrade of an operational simulator, Double-EAGLE. This concept would utilize the FMG to replace the existing slower Marx generator, transfer capacitor and triggered gas switch. The basic building blocks for these future FMG driven machines are a low- inductance Marx switch and a low-inductance capacitor designed to be integrated with the new switch. These components are configured in a low-inductance FMG stage and then stacked in series to form a unit for the voltage required and a number of units in parallel for the required system inductance and stored energy. A review of the FMG component requirements and the status of the FMG component testing in a single-stage FMG configuration will also be presented. A four-stage FMG unit is being built and tested to demonstrate the required stage voltage and inductance. Results of these initial tests will be presented. © 2002 AIP.",,"Energy storage; Inductance; Particle beams; Pinch effect; Plasma sources; Radiation; Basic building block; Component testing; Energy storage systems; Fast Marx generator; Linear transformer drivers; Low inductance capacitors; Plasma radiation sources; Transfer capacitor; Simulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865001287

Smectite platelets were formed from volcanic glass by loss of Si4+. Partially-formed platelets have Si4+ between 4.55-4.10 a.p.f.u., Mg+Mn and the interlayer charge are relatively uniform while VIAl+Fe3++Ti varies between 0.98 and 1.63 a.p.f.u., Almost fully transformed platelets have Si4+ of 4.08-4.04 a.p.f.u.; Mg+Mn and the interlayer charge decrease proportionally to increasing VIAl+Fe3++Ti. Smectite-kaolinite mixed layers have octahedral occupancies of 2.01-2.15 a.p.f.u., IVAl3+ 0.09-0.55 a.p.f.u. and interlayer charges about half that of smectite; structural formulae corresponding to smectite (0.75-0.80)-kaolinite indicate octahedral occupancy of 2.50 a.p.f.u., tetrahedral replacement 0-0.31 a.p.f.u., and interlayer charge 0.24-0.51 equivalents, some indicating interstratifications of beidellite. Kaolinite is presumed to have formed from K-feldspar; smectite-kaolinite interstratifications sustain the transformation of kaolinite to smectite in an increasingly siliceous high-cation environment. In the mudstones of low-hydraulic conductivity and practically stagnant alkaline fluids, glass was transformed to 2H2O-smectite lamellae of IVAl between 0 and 0.47 a.p.f.u., octahedral occupancy 1.70-2.00 a.p.f.u. and interlayer charge of 0.23-1.21 equivalents, some corresponding to beidellite. The interlayer charge increases with IVAl and decreasing occupancy of the octahedral sheet; the abundance of Mg+Mn is inverse to that of VIAl+Fe3++Ti. Clay suspensions containing 1H2O- and 2H2O-smectite, kaolinite and R3-2H2O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite lead to low-energy edge-to-edge particle associations, non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior, and maximum apparent viscosity of 180 Pa s at 0.008 s-1 followed by rapid descent. Clay fractions with slightly larger 2H2O-smectite contents and smaller kaolinite contents reach maximum viscosity of 3611 Pa s at a shear rate of 0.0018 s-1 and of 3300 Pa s at 0.0024 s-1. They denote two high-energy face-to-face particle associations, followed by slow descent of the apparent viscosity under viscous flow. Suspensions change from elastic to viscous behavior at shear stresses of 1.03 and 5.91 Pa, respectively. Clay suspension vibrated at a frequency of 1 Hz develops a shear storage dynamic modulus greater than the shear dynamic loss modulus or the energy is preferentially stored, whereas at 5 Hz more energy is dissipated than stored.","Clay mineralogy; Diagenesis; Mexican Basin; Recent volcanogenics; Rheology","Gravel; Kaolin; Rheology; Shear stress; Smectic liquid crystals; Thermal stratification; Viscosity; Diagenesis; Clay minerals; clay mineral; diagenesis; Pleistocene; rheology; sedimentary sequence; smectite; volcanogenic deposit; Mexican Basin; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036940176

Since there is usually a temporal variance between the availability of low temperature waste heat and demand for commercial building air conditioning, a cold TES system is incorporated into this advance energy system. The proposed TES system uses a lithium bromide/water solution both as a refrigerant and as a cold thermal storage material. The cold storage material can be stored at ambient temperature without thermal insulation for an indefinite period of time without losing its charge, making it an ideal system for utilizing peaking system's low temperature waste heat or to utilize low temperature waste heat during nocturnal operation of continuous generation systems at a time when there are usually low or minimal air conditioning requirements. The heat pump and waste heat is used to recover the thermal storage by reprocessing the stored lithium bromide weak solution to a higher concentration.",,"Energy storage; Evaporators; Lithium compounds; Low temperature operations; Pumps; Refrigerants; Waste heat; Water; Cold thermal energy storage; Energy cogeneration systems; Heat pumps; Low temperature waste heat; Cogeneration plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036439472

For many applications this entire range must be present on the same substrate with the upper end serving as decoupling capacitors and the lower end providing a variety of filtering, timing, coupling, RF and A/D functions. There are many thin film candidate materials and processes for dielectrics including ferroelectrics and paraelectrics formed by sputtering, anodization, CVD, sol-gel, etc. as well as polymers and ferroelectric/polymer composites. It is difficult, if not impossible, for any single dielectric material and capacitor configuration to provide this entire range without the lowest valued components occupying too small an area or exhibiting excessively high series resistance. Therefore, it will often be necessary to mix integrated capacitor technologies on a single substrate. Paraelectrics are more suitable for integrated capacitors in the 1 - 100 pF range because their low specific capacitance enables them to be formed with sufficiently large sizes; ferroelectrics would give footprints too small to be fabricated with acceptable precision. Also, the dielectric behavior of paraelectrics are more stable with regard to bias, frequency, temperature and time which is important to the functions delivered by low-valued caps. On the other end of the spectrum, ferroelectrics are better for decoupling and energy storage where high k is more important than stability.","Dielectric; Integrated capacitor; Integrated passive","Capacitance; Chemical vapor deposition; Dielectric materials; Ferroelectric materials; Polymers; Sol-gels; Sputtering; Temperature; Anodization; Paraelectrics; Thin film integrated capacitor; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036389389

Fracture mechanics concepts were used to establish the severity and growth rate of such a flaw. The strain energy release rates of various-sized delaminations were evaluated using a 2-D finite element method, and the effects of flaw radial location and press-fitting were investigated. Once a flaw attains a certain size, the strain energy release rate is found to decrease, thus stabilizing further growth. Flaw growth rates under cyclic loading were estimated using the Paris law. Several virtual containment strategies were also investigated. Once a flaw is detected during flywheel operation, the maximum operating speed can be reduced to prevent catastrophic failure, achieve a specific design life, and maximize energy storage capacity over the remaining life. With a speed control strategy for energy maximization following the detection of damage, a numerical example showed an improvement of more than four times the energy capacity over a system without virtual containment.","Crack growth; Fatigue; Flywheel; Fracture mechanics; Life prediction; Strain energy release rate; Virtual containment","Crack propagation; Cyclic loads; Delamination; Energy storage; Fatigue of materials; Filament winding; Flywheels; Fracture mechanics; Rotors; Speed control; Strain; Composite flywheel rotors; Composite materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036298916

After transuranic wastes were identified as a separate category of radioactive wastes (distinct from low-level wastes) in 1970 by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, they were generally segregated and placed in retrievable storage pending the availability of a geologic repository. Updated information on buried transuranic wastes was recently developed to support future decisions on how to manage these materials. This paper summarizes the approach used to develop this information for U.S. Department of Energy facilities and presents the volumes and transuranic activities of these wastes. The total volume of buried transuranic wastes at DOE sites is approximately 126,000 m3 with a much smaller volume (about 11,000 m3) disposed of at intermediate depths. The reported transuranic activity in these previously disposed of wastes is about 28,000 TBq.","Plutonium; Radioactive materials; Uranium; Waste disposal","plutonium; uranium; article; environmental protection; nuclear power plant; nuclear waste; priority journal; radioactive waste disposal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036133306

This makes Cool-Mem applicable for large and complex applications, without having any limitations due to complexity issues in the compiler passes or the presence of precompiled static libraries. Based on extensive evaluation, for both SPEC2000 and Mediabench applications, 12% to 20% total energy savings are obtained in the processor, with performance ranging from 1.2% degradation to 8% improvement, for the applications studied.

They are also increasing the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and possibly causing an undesirable warming of the earth by the ""Greenhouse Effect"". The search for a solution has resulted in visions of hydrogen as the fuel of the future to power transportation and to generate electricity with water as the only combustion product. While such a future would be highly desirable it is fundamentally flawed. That is because hydrogen is not a fuel. To consider hydrogen a fuel is akin to considering electricity as a fuel.

To fully realize these attributes, optimum design and dynamic performance of integrated systems for a given application have to be pursued. Whether referred to as cogeneration, combined heat and power (CHP) or building cooling, heating, and power (BCHP), integrated energy systems manifest effective energy management aimed at closing spatial and temporal gaps between demand and supply of electrical and thermal energy. This is accomplished by on-site power production and utilization of the resulting thermal energy availability for thermally-driven technologies including desiccant dehumidification, absorption cooling, and space heating. The notion that the demands for thermal and electrical energy are not always congruent and in phase signifies the importance of considering thermal energy storage (TES) for integration. This paper explores the potential impact of implementing TES technology on the overall performance of integrated energy systems from the first- and second-law perspectives. In doing so, the dynamics of packed bed thermal energy storage systems for potential energy recovery from the exhaust gas of microturbines are investigated. Using a validated simulation model, the transient thermal response of these TES systems is examined via parametric analyses that allow variation in the thermal energy availability and physical characteristics of the packed beds. The parasitic electrical energy requirement associated with the pressure losses in the packed beds is included in the performance assessment. The results of this study are indicative of the promising role of TES in integrated energy systems.",,"Dehumidification; Integrated energy systems (IES); Thermal energy storage (TES); Computer simulation; Cooling; Energy absorption; Energy gap; Energy management; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Fuel economy; Power generation; Thermal load; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347516014

The phase change materials usually have very low thermal conductivity. To enhance the thermal response of the system, thermal conductivity enhancers like metal foams, internal fins and metal filler particles have been proposed. Local thermal equilibrium between the solid matrix and the fluid is not ensured in such systems since the thermal conductivities and heat capacities for the fluid and solid are very different. The use of a single volume-averaged energy equation for both the phases cannot be justified in such situations. A two-medium approach is developed in the present work to account for the local thermal non-equilibrium. Separate energy equations are written for the solid and fluid respectively, and are closed using a steady-state interstitial heat transfer coefficient between the two phases. A general momentum equation which includes the Brinkman-Forchheimer extension to Darcy flow is employed. The resulting equations are solved using a finite volume scheme. The influence of various parameters such as the ratios of fluid to solid conductivities and heat capacities, porosity, Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, and Darcy number on the thermal and flow fields is investigated. The importance of using a two-medium approach for such situations is illustrated using the results obtained.",,"Phase change materials (PCM); Thermal equilibrium; Control system analysis; Damping; Drag; Electronic equipment; Energy storage; Finite volume method; Heat pipes; Heat transfer coefficients; Porosity; Porous materials; Prandtl number; Reynolds number; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal load",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346254194

The University's steam-generation facilities supplied high-temperature water for injection. The Aquifer Thermal-Energy Storage system is a doublet-well design in which the injection-withdrawal wells are spaced approximately 250 meters apart. Water was pumped from one of the wells through a heat exchanger, where heat was added or removed. This water was then injected back into the aquifer through the other well. Four short-term test cycles were completed. Each cycle consisted of approximately equal durations of injection and withdrawal ranging from 5.25 to 8.01 days. Equal rates of injection and withdrawal, ranging from 17.4 to 18.6 liters per second, were maintained for each short-term test cycle. Average injection temperatures ranged from 88.5 to 117.9 degrees Celsius. Temperature graphs for selected depths at individual observation wells indicate that the Ironton and Galesville Sandstones received and stored more thermal energy than the upper part of the Franconia Formation. Clogging of the Ironton Sandstone was possibly due to precipitation of calcium carbonate or movement of finegrain material or both. Vertical-profile plots indicate that the effects of buoyancy flow were small within the aquifer. A three-dimensional, anisotropic, nonisothermal, ground-water-flow, and thermal-energy-transport model was constructed to simulate the four short-term test cycles. The model was used to simulate the entire short-term testing period of approximately 400 days. The only model properties varied during model calibration were longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivities, which, for final calibration, were simulated as 3.3 and 0.33 meters, respectively. The model was calibrated by comparing model-computed results to (1) measured temperatures at selected altitudes in four observation wells, (2) measured temperatures at the production well, and (3) calculated thermal efficiencies of the aquifer. Model-computed withdrawal-water temperatures were within an average of about 3 percent of measured values and model-computed aquifer-thermal efficiencies were within an average of about 5 percent of calculated values for the short-term test cycles. These data indicate that the model accurately simulated thermal-energy storage within the Franconia-Ironton-Galesville aquifer.",,"aquifer; energy converter; heat exchanger; aquifer; energy resource; thermal water; three-dimensional modeling; storage; testing method; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345581235

In the Gulf of Mexico, previous visions have married open-ocean aquaculture with the existing oil/gas industry. However, liabilities either to the platform owner/operator or against platform abandonment upon completion of the aquaculture venture, and safety and appropriateness of oil/gas platforms not specifically designed for offshore aquaculture limit this relationship. As an alternative, commercialization of aquaculture in the open ocean will benefit from the development of specialized aquaculture support vessels (ASVs). These innovative craft or barges will be designed for efficient cage servicing, harvesting and hauling of fish, and optimizing routine tasks associated with open-ocean fish farms. We will present the development of a lift-boat (or ""jack-up"" barge) designed specifically for the needs of an open-ocean aquaculture industry as one ASV solution. Design requirements include a safe working environment, a helicopter-pad, sufficient living space for workers, adequate feed storage, maintenance and office space, fish health and environmental monitoring laboratory, and a crane capable of lowering and raising a farm work boat and feed.",,"Gas industry; Logistics; Marine biology; Ocean engineering; Ocean structures; Lift-boats; Aquaculture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038648119

RDBMS are most suited to storing large volumes of repetitive data. RDBMS offer significant advantages over data storage methods (such as ASCII text files or spreadsheet programs) by offering flexibility in the types of information stored, speed of retrieval, and the ability to share data with other computer programs. Information contained in RDBMS can be accessed through desktop programs or may be distributed over the Internet. However, RDBMS may not be appropriate for all types of collected data, especially when the format of the data changes frequently. Snow hydrology data can be efficiently stored in a RDBMS, particularly if many repetitive measurements are made in time or in space, such as automated meteorological measurements obtained from data loggers. Intelligently designed RDBMS link metadata to the collected data and allow scientists to analyze and store comments on the quality of the data.

In this presentation Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) issues in modern high-density electronics are addressed through a new theory that seeks to explain that sudden energy releases are possible, even in powered-down states of systems, which could create erroneous or misleading internal signals in such systems. This theory introduces the concept of localized stored energy at defects within insulating and semi-insulating materials that make up modern electronics.

Liquid fuels are more desirable for the eventual realization of practical PDE than gaseous fuels because of their higher energy density and considerably better storage properties. However, laser-based fuel measurements when vapor and liquid droplets are present become more complicated than for vapor alone. Two of the reasons accounting for the increased complexity are the vapor of most hydrocarbon fuels has broader spectral features than the rapid tuning range of standard diode-lasers, and vapor absorption and droplet extinction of the probe beam are coupled. To overcome these challenges, a sensor based on five wavelength-multiplexed laser beam was developed to simultaneously measure droplet size, droplet volume fraction, and vapor concentration in fuel sprays.

Bulk powering has substantially increased the number of power equipment alternatives for both power conversion and energy storage and the need for more compact installations has increased. This has lead to the development of new battery configurations to further optimise energy density, reduce the space utilized and facilitate installation and maintenance. Two particular types of bulk power installation using VRLA batteries developed by FIAMM are described. The effects of ambient temperature, the number of parallel strings, temperature compensation and battery spacing are described in relation to recently gathered data on field service based on a surveillance programme of full discharge testing. The batteries all used absorptive glass mat separators and state-of-the-art electrochemical designs and are well-adapted to the required duty cycle. The batteries have been installed in remote terminals that are now environmentally controlled but were not controlled for more than half the period in service. Tests have been carried out after several years in service and are reported in detail. The overall results show good behaviour after 6 to 7 years of actual service and the design life of the cells will be readily achieved. Installation design is a key factor and the relation between battery design and configuration at monobloc level with the total battery is considered. Further tests are ongoing and the data generated by this study will serve to demonstrate the effectiveness as well as pointing to improvements of these battery types and configurations in service in an outside plant environment.",,"Air conditioning; Corrosion resistance; Electric rectifiers; Energy storage; Telecommunication equipment; Power equipments; Lead acid batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036911883

In this paper we discuss key issues, for other sources of energy, that could impact fusion energy deployment during the last half of this century. These include geographic issues such as resource availability, scale issues, energy storage requirements and waste issues. The resource needs and waste production associated with fusion deployment in the US should not pose serious problems (Fusion Technology 39 (2001) 513). One important feature of fusion power is the fact that a fusion power plant should be locatable within most local or regional electrical distribution systems. For this reason fusion power plants should not increase the burden of long distance power transmission to our distribution system. In contrast to fusion power, regional factors could play an important role in the deployment of renewable resources such as wind, solar and biomass or fossil energy with CO2 sequestration.

This container design, referred to as the standardized DOE SNF canister or standardized canister, was developed by the Department's National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP) working in conjunction with the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) and the DOE spent fuel sites. This canister had to have a standardized design yet be capable of accepting virtually all of the DOE SNF, be placed in a variety of storage and transportation systems, and still be acceptable to the repository. Since specific design details regarding the storage, transportation, and repository disposal of DOE SNF were not finalized, the NSNFP recognized the necessity to specify a complete DOE SNF canister design. This allowed other evaluations of canister performance and design to proceed as well as providing standardized canister users adequate information to proceed with their work. This paper is an update of a paper presented to the 1999 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Pressure Vessels and Piping (PVP) Conference.

Generation equipment includes internal combustion engines, combustion turbines, steam turbines, Stirling engines, and fuel cells. Thermal energy is captured through the use of a heat recovery steam generation or, in the case of a steam turbine, is extracted at various temperatures and pressures. The thermal energy can be used directly in industrial processes or used for space heating, e.g., district heating. The thermal energy can also be used for cooling. Extracted or generated steam can be used in a steam-driven chiller, absorption, adsorption, or a desiccant system.

For the fueling station application, hydrogen storage is the largest capital cost item followed by the cost of the heliostat field and compression. If the hydrogen could be consumed directly or used in another application where storage is eliminated and compression is moderate, then the cost of hydrogen from the system decreases by a factor of three. Adding a small electric heater, which supplies heat to the solar reactor when the hydrogen supply gets low, was a low-cost solution to increasing the productivity of the solar process. The power production application is able to use the hydrogen directly without storage, but the cost of power from this system was more than the base electricity price of the natural gas combined-cycle power plant for a carbon black price < $0.8/kg. Additionally, for this application, because of the value of the carbon, it is more profitable to sell the carbon than burn it and produce more power. The price of the carbon black has the greatest effect on the economics for both applications. Higher value carbon markets should definitely be pursued.

The transportation sector was selected as a basis for the design, since it is expected that this sector would see substantial growth in hydrogen utilization over the next decade. However, the design could be modified for stationary fuel cell systems. The design feasibility was proven quantitatively. The process started by removing a hydrogen odorant through adsorbers. The hydrogen was then stored in a metal hydride unit. After the fueling process, the battery stack might heat the hydride unit releasing hydrogen. The fuel cell stack produced useful electricity from this hydrogen.

Bush has enabled the competent U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to file for a license to build and operate the repository with the regulatory authority, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This step had been preceded by parliamentary deliberations and voting procedures in both houses of Congress, i.e. the House of Representatives and the Senate. These had become necessary because President Bush had presented the project to Congress on February 15, 2002, whereupon the Governor of the state of Nevada, Kenny Guinn, had interposed his veto. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and 1987, respectively, this required a final decision by parliament. The veto by the Governor of Nevada was outvoted by a large majority of 306: 122 votes in the House of Representatives and 60: 39 votes in the Senate. These decisions and votes constitute an important step in the matter of radioactive waste management in the United States. After twenty years of site exploration and site studies, the adoption of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and the prior proliferation-induced concentration on direct disposal by President Jimmy Carter, more concrete steps are now possible after completion of the legislative phase. Opponents of the Yucca Mountain repository project announced further litigation against the project. However, the outcome of the voting procedure in the Congress also clearly shows the change of mind about the peaceful utilization of nuclear power in the USA.

These two structures are integrated to form a banked-promotion (BP) TLB. Promotion overcomes the unbalanced utilization of a banked-TLB by moving adjacent entries out of the primary banks into a separate super-page TLB.

[1]. The model is based on two-group nodal diffusion in the context of the generalized equivalence theory (GET) [2]. The nodal parameters are determined from continuous energy Monte Carlo computations. The node-averaged diffusion coefficient is estimated by using an iterative technique. In the present paper, a new method, based on a genetic algorithm, is proposed for calculating the node-averaged diffusion coefficient to be used in the nodal diffusion model. The unknown diffusion coefficients in each group and region of the lattice cell are to be estimated such that the multiplication constant of the fine-mesh diffusion calculation at the lattice cell level matches the result obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation of that cell. Two approaches are considered for modeling the spent fuel assembly when generating the nodal parameters: one in which the assembly is homogenized, and one in which the geometry of the assembly is modeled in full detail. The method is tested on a 2-D benchmark configuration typical of a spent fuel storage rack at Savannah River Site [3].

The model contains three different physical domains, solid, liquid and vapor. The material properties such as absorptivity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity can be functions of temperature. The governing equations in each domain are solved numerically using the boundary irnmobilization transformation. The final solution is obtained by an iterative scheme to satisfy the energy balance along the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces. An Energy balance is implemented by calculating the energy reflected, Er, the energy loss due to convection and radiation at the boundaries, Eloss the energy storage, Eg, energy removal by vaporization, Ev, and energy removal by liquid expulsion, E l at each time step. These energies sum up to the total incident energy from the laser with less than 0.1% error.

Low-voltage (12 V) batteries are preferred as the storage device to maintain compatibility with the majority of today's automobile loads. A dc/dc converter is therefore needed to interface the low-voltage batteries with the fuel cell-powered higher-voltage dc bus system (255 V ∼ 425 V), transferring energy in either direction as required. This paper presents a soft-switched, isolated bi-directional dc/dc converter developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for FCPEV applications. The converter employs dual half-bridges interconnected with an isolation transformer to minimize the number of switching devices and their associated gate drive requirements. Snubber capacitors including the parasitic capacitance of the switching devices and the transformer leakage inductance are utilized to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). Therefore, no extra resonant components are required for ZVS, further reducing component count. The inherent soft-switching capability and the low component count of the converter allows high power density, efficient power conversion, and compact packaging. A prototype rated at 1.6 kW was built and successfully tested. Experimental results confirmed soft-switching operation and an average model based analysis.

We can easily schedule power demands to reduce the peak power below the potential maximum, but simple scheduling rules may not achieve the lowest possible peak to average power ratio.

Military applications for fuel cells vary but power and energy demands associated with the Objective Force and the Future Combat System requires a revolution in power. We have projected fuel cell missions for small man portable 1- 500 watt systems with 180 - 12,000 Watt-Hrs of stored energy to mobile auxiliary power units (APUs) in the 0.5 - 10 kW power range. Military power sources must be robust and capable of powering equipment under all environmental and operational conditions. Fuel cell power sources have been demonstrated for several military applications and are being investigated as possible power sources for the Soldier System, Robotics, Sensors and APUs. CECOM's Power Division's efforts have been focused on small battery replacement and hybrid fuel cell/battery systems. Examples include a hydrogen/oxygen unit developed in the mid 90s and currently under evaluation by NASA for future space missions; a 100 W fuel cell based battery charger and a 50 Watt fuel cell used to power remote sensor systems. Because proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells provide quiet, vibration free and low signature operation, a future application for these power sources are as APUs for combat vehicles. Small APUs (0.3 -2kW) with Methanol Reformers are feasible now for SILENT WATCH. Although considerable progress has been made in reducing the size and weight of PEM fuel cells, a key technical barrier for military applications has been the fuel supply, hydrogen. The effective use of fuel cells in the military will require a safe, high energy dense, transportable, and reliable source of hydrogen. The Army's current and future research and development efforts are focusing on methods of either storing or generating hydrogen on the battlefield. Hydrogen storage technology is considered critical to small military and/or commercial fuel cell systems, and is being pursued in a host of commercial and government programs. CECOM, in a joint effort with the Army Research Office (ARO) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is developing several promising hydrogen generating technologies. The goal of this program is a safe, reliable hydrogen source that can provide rates up to 100 Watts with an energy density of 1000 Watt-hrs/kg. CECOM with the same group of co-sponsors, developed the world's first portable fully integrated Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) prototype. It is presently being tested by CECOM. For larger fuel cell units (>500 Watts), it is imperative that the fuel cell power units be able to operate on fuels within the military logistics systems. CECOM is currently conducting research on catalysts and micro-channel fuel reformers that appear to offer great promise for the reforming of diesel and JP-8 fuels into hydrogen, the fuel feed required by the fuel cell. In addition to research work on PEM fuel cells and enabling technologies, the Army is also conducting research on direct methanol and solid oxide fuel cells.Copyright © 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobile bodies; Auxiliary power systems; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Engineering research; Fighter aircraft; Gas fuel purification; Hydrogen storage; Logistics; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Military applications; Military vehicles; NASA; Secondary batteries; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Space flight; Vibrations (mechanical); Voltage dividers; Auxiliary power units; Defense advanced research projects agencies; Fuel cell development; Fuel-cell power sources; Hydrogen storage technologies; Military logistics systems; Operational conditions; Research and development; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072464285

Water is chilled or ice is made during the night to either replace or augment operation of cooling equipment during the day. Off-peak demand and consumption rates produce significant dollar savings. TES requires favorable electric rate structures, available space to house the associated equipment, and either variation in buildings cooling loads or favorable climatic conditions. TES can be implemented anywhere cooling loads can be shifted to off-peak hours, with the best applications being office buildings, hospitals, and schools. Most TES projects are implemented in conjunction with an existing cooling system expansion, replacement of older cooling equipment, or new construction, thus reducing energy costs, consumption, and demand. A model was developed to estimate the potential application for TES in the federal sector utilizing weather data, cooling profiles for buildings of various size and geographic locations, projected electric rates, and federal building demographics. The model showed that savings ranging from $29 million to $42 million per year could be realized through TES projects in the federal sector. These results are comparable to a 1998 report that estimated the potential for TES in the U.S. Army to be $4.7 million per year. (Sohn and Cler, 1998). Although TES shows good potential, opportunities to implement projects are often overlooked. Lack of experience and training on the part of facility personnel can play a roll. The uncertainty surrounding the future of deregulation of the electric industry is a problem because TES is dependent on favorable rates. Various options are available for funding TES projects in federal facilities, including direct agency funding, capital improvement funds, utility financing, and alternative financing. federal facilities should, as standard practice, evaluate TES options whenever a chiller retrofit or replacement is performed. © 2002 Energy Engineering.

Our procedure consists of (i) use of storage bandwidth optimization (SBO) techniques to simplify the conflict graph and (ii) use of memory exploration techniques to determine the best memory configuration (number of modules, size and number of ports per module) with the minimum area if the energy and timing are bounded or with the minimum energy/timing if the area is bounded. Here the simplest conflict graph implies more possibilities for the arrays assigned to the same module without the penalty in an increase of the number of ports for each module. Our benchmark shows that the heuristic algorithm is very efficient to decide the best memory configuration for the system constraints (timing, area, or energy). In addition, the CACTI tool (Premkishore Shivakumar and N.P. Jouppi, 2001) is modified to estimate the timing, area, and energy for each module in different CMOS technologies (0.8 μm, 0.35 μm, and 0.18 μm). Furthermore, we consider the lifetime for arrays; this results in significant reduction in timing, area, and energy for the arrays executed in different cycles sharing the same memory module. © 2002 IEEE.","Bandwidth; CMOS technology; Concurrent computing; Costs; Delay; Electrocardiography; Energy storage; Heuristic algorithms; Integer linear programming; Timing","Bandwidth; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer architecture; Costs; Electrocardiography; Energy storage; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Integer programming; Optimization; CMOS technology; Concurrent computing; Delay; Integer Linear Programming; Timing; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948770617

When applied together and systemically across multiple missions, these practices can yield tremendous reduction of technical, schedule and cost risks for project development. An example of this synthesis can be found in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) Flight Hardware Logistics Program (FHLP), which uses space systems engineering expertise and supply-chain business acumen to achieve breakthroughs in the delivery of space flight hardware. To support the evolution from a few large projects to many smaller projects developed in shorter time, flight hardware delivery must evolve from serial, independent and resource-intensive processes to those characterized by commonality, multi-project support, anticipation, industry-partnering, reuse and easy access to information. These processes are fundamental to the communication, coordination and collaboration that FHLP provides to enhance JPL project success. The heart of FHLP centers on the commonality of flight hardware across multiple projects. As an example, FHLP has demonstrated significant schedule, cost and technical risk reduction using a common buy of 31 flight computers for 9 different projects. Understanding and coordinating similar product requirements for multiple subsystems, instruments, projects and companies can yield even greater savings. Knowledge of upcoming missions, their right product needs, hardware capabilities and supply sources allow anticipatory procurements of flight hardware to reduce or eliminate lead-time. This is being done for flight electronic parts, connectors and fasteners with replenishment funded by compensation from users for supplied hardware. Partnering with industry is achieved with suppliers and users of hardware. Open contracts and supplier early parts buys are examples of supplier agreements while synchronized procurement and inventory exchange are examples of user agreements between JPL and its contractors. Improved tracking, coordination, record keeping and storage of residual flight hardware can provide crucial cost and schedule benefits to future projects. FHLP has developed a low-cost, JPL-wide system and facilities to significantly increase the capability for current project use of residual material from past projects. Having the right hardware information at the engineer's fingertips saves considerable time and reduces the risk of missing important knowledge. FHLP provides limited hardware information today; tomorrow it will provide much more comprehensive one-stop shopping. The FHLP information tools include an on-line JPL-wide hardware catalog of available inventory (with reports, shopping carts and digital pictures), on-line product documentation and database of hardware usage by projects. The many simultaneous smaller projects implemented today do not enjoy the substantial infrastructure and stable expertise more prevalent in the past on fewer large projects. FHLP fills these gaps with services of hardware information, availability, investigation, delivery and storage. Likewise, proposed projects hungry for higher fidelity information, increased heritage and lower costs welcome a menu of support from FHLP that includes information about available hardware, costs, lead-times and suppliers. FHLP's early focus on hardware delivery and inventory will be augmented by enhanced hardware information and expand to include other NASA Centers and industry partners. Breakthroughs will be limited only by imagination, innovation, commitment and energy. © 2002 IEEE.",,"Aerospace community; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Multiple subsystems; Product documentation; Product requirements; Project development; Space systems engineering; Space-flight hardware; Aerospace engineering; Computer hardware; Cost reduction; Industry; NASA; Hardware",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879356587

B6D2F1 sperm isolated in an EGTA supplemented tris-HCl buffer (with or without 0.5M intracellular trehalose) were convectively dried with inert nitrogen gas in a controlled manner to moisture content &lt;5%. The samples were then vacuum packed and stored at 22, 37, 45, 60 and 90°C for 1, 3 or 7 days. Following rehydration, the sperm sample was assayed for DNA damage using the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Results indicate significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower DNA degradation for cells dried with intracellular trehalose at 45, 60 and 90°C for 1, 3 or 7 days compared to cells dried without trehalose.

The corresponding numbers for cells dried in EGTA solution supplemented with 0.5M trehalose were 5.7 kcal/mole and 43.73 hr-1. Based on these parameters the time required for 10% DNA degradation are 279 and 759 hours for samples desiccated in plain EGTA vs. trehalose supplemented EGTA.

To fully realize these attributes, optimum design and dynamic performance of integrated systems for a given application have to be pursued. Whether referred to as cogeneration, combined heat and power (CHP) or building cooling, heating, and power (BCHP), integrated energy systems manifest effective energy management aimed at closing spatial and temporal gaps between demand and supply of electrical and thermal energy. This is accomplished by on-site power production and utilization of the resulting thermal energy availability for thermally-driven technologies including desiccant dehumidification, absorption cooling, and space heating. The notion that the demands for thermal and electrical energy are not always congruent and in phase signifies the importance of considering thermal energy storage (TES) for integration. This paper explores the potential impact of implementing TES technology on the overall performance of integrated energy systems from the first- and second-law perspectives. In doing so, the dynamics of packed bed thermal energy storage systems for potential energy recovery from the exhaust gas of microturbines are investigated. Using a validated simulation model, the transient thermal response of these TES systems is examined via parametric analyses that allow variation in the thermal energy availability and physical characteristics of the packed beds. The parasitic electrical energy requirement associated with the pressure losses in the packed beds is included in the performance assessment. The results of this study are indicative of the promising role of TES in integrated energy systems.

TPCE/RF accomplished all of its objectives in the Space Shuttle flight in May 1996. The flow patterns observed generally agreed with a prior correlation derived from drop tower tests. Several existing mixing correlations were found to provide reasonable performance predictions. Low-energy mixing jets, dissipating on the order of 1 % of the kinetic energy of previous mixer designs, were found to be effective and reliable at reducing thermal non-uniformities. Those jets promote heat and mass active mixing, whether continuous or periodic. The mentioned factors offer increased reliability and predictability in space cryogenic systems and can be accomplished with no significant boiloff penalty caused by kinetic energy dissipation.",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Energy dissipation; Forced convection; Gravitation; Jets; Kinetic energy; Pressure control; Tanks (containers); Cryogenic systems; Payloads; Cryogenic liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442359340

The optical data is stored in glass as subsurface nanometer size defects called voxels. These voxels display secondary harmonic generation (SHG) to 800 nm input light. The device begins with an indium tin oxide film on a glass substrate coated with a film of Al2O3. In this preliminary device the Al2O3 was patterned via optical lithography with a periodic array of 10 micron holes that were filled with electrodeposited CdS. X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize the CdS. The device operation depends on the ability of the CdS with a bandgap of 2.4 eV to detect the 3.1 eV SHG light from the voxels while remaining unresponsive to 1.6 eV input light. The electrodeposited CdS was found to absorb 400 nm light at least a factor of 10 times greater than 800 nm light. Light to dark photocurrent ratios of 15 to 63 were observed from the CdS pillars using a 150 W xenon broadband light source. A light to dark ratio of about one was found when a long pass optical filter allowed only wavelengths above 750 nm. Thus the 10 micron CdS pillars have detected 400 nm light while rejecting the 800 nm input light.",,"Alumina; Electrodeposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Optical filters; Photocurrents; Photolithography; Second harmonic generation; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; Semiconducting glass; X ray diffraction analysis; Indium tin oxide; On-chip semiconducting readout; Voxels; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038826225

We start by defining a new concept called supporting function to replace the concept of energy function. As known, the energy function relies on the assumption of symmetric interconnection weights, which is used in the conventional Hopfield auto-associative memory, but not evidenced in any biological memories. We then formulate the information retrieving process as a dynamic system by making use of the supporting function and derive the attraction or asymptotic stability condition and the condition for convergence of an arbitrary state to a desired state. The latter represents a key condition for associative memory to have a capability of learning from variant samples. Finally, we develop an algorithm to learn the asymptotic stability condition and an algorithm to train the system to recover desired states from their variant samples. The latter called sample learning algorithm is the first of its kind ever been discovered for associative memories. Both recalling and learning processes are of finite convergence, a must-have feature for associative memories by analogy to normal human memory. The effectiveness of the recalling and learning algorithms is experimentally demonstrated.","Bidirectional associative memory; Learning algorithm; Recalling algorithm; Support function","Asymptotic stability; Convergence of numerical methods; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Auto-associative memory model; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036630295

In cold storage warehouses, the stored products themselves have the potential for use as an energy storage medium. By precooling the stored products during hours o flow electricity prices, it is possible to idle or ""float"" the refrigeration system during periods of high electricity prices. The shift in electrical usage to low-cost periods has the potential of yielding refrigeration system operating cost savings. The primary thrust of RP-1154 was to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of utilizing products in refrigerated warehouses as thermal energy storage media to minimize refrigeration system energy costs under real-time pricing rate structures. In this paper, we present a simple method that forecasts whether or not demand shifting the refrigeration system operation on a daily basis results in operating cost savings. The method includes predicting the maximum allowable floating duration based on the outside air temperatures for the next day and establishing the floating period that yields the greatest operating cost savings. A simple price ratio criterion was found to be a good indicator of energy cost savings by demand shifting. For the utility data and cold storage warehouse cases analyzed, operating cost savings through demand shifting are relatively small compared to the annual refrigeration system operating cost. Installation of additional refrigeration capacity results in projected savings in the range of 7% to 11%. Greater cost savings are possible for utility data that have large price excursions between daytime and nighttime.",,"Approximation theory; Energy storage; Real time systems; Warehouses; Refrigerated warehouses; Refrigeration; Energy Conservation; Refrigeration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036455378

Degradation of the die encapsulant material (glob-top) was selected as the failure criterion because electrical failure was not detected until significant delamination of the encapsulant was observed during a step stress life test. The activation energy, Ea, for encapsulant degradation was determined from an Arrhenius plot of two temperature conditions with the absolute humidity kept constant. The exponent, n, for partial pressure of water was determined from the log t50 vs. partial pressure of water plot. The activation energy, Ea, was determined to be 0.47 eV, and the exponent, n, was determined to be 2. We have established an empirical model for PBGA failure time prediction.

The shutdown of additional facilities is planned. In addition, during the past several decades, the Department of Energy has loaned nuclear material to a wide variety of private and governmental institutions for research and educational purposes. Subsequent changes in the Department's priorities have reduced the need for nuclear materials to support the Department's programs. Similarly, there has been a reduction in the need for borrowed nuclear materials by organizations and institutions using nuclear materials ""on loan"" from the Department. As a result, inventories of uranium material from the Department's facilities and ""on loan"" must be removed and returned to the Department. This material is in the form of low enriched uranium (LEU), normal uranium (NU), and depleted uranium (DU) in various forms. This uranium material is located at over one hundred sites within the United States and overseas, including universities and laboratories. Much of this uranium is not needed to support national priorities and programs. The Department of Energy has assumed a stewardship role in managing nuclear materials throughout their life cycle, from acquisition to storage. Surplus uranium has created challenges for DOE in managing and storing the material as well as identifying opportunities for its further use. On behalf of the Department, the Oak Ridge Operations Office has been given the responsibility to implement the Department responsibilities in meeting these challenges and managing the Department's uranium materials. To support this effort, the Office of Nuclear Fuel Security and Uranium Technology within the ORO complex coordinates uranium management functions across the Department of Energy. This coordination provides DOE with a number of important benefits, among which are: consolidated management and storage of uranium; improved security; a reduction of operating costs; effective use and reuse of DOT certified shipping containers; and accelerated site closure.",,"Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Life cycle; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactors; Radioactive materials; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive waste transportation; Reactor operation; Reactor shutdowns; Societies and institutions; Depleted uranium; Low enriched uranium; Normal uranium; Nuclear material; Uranium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036390625

Flowing fluids carry enormous fluxes of energy, magma, and solutes between these reservoirs. Fluids contributes to production of continental crust, generation of explosive volcanism, lubrication of plate boundary faults, formation of hydrates and mineral resources, and development and support of remarkable biological communities. Fluids affect the properties of sediments and basement rocks through which they move and are stored as a result of diagenesis, heat transfer, and stress-strain relations. These strong couplings present challenges to resolving the roles of fluids as agents of change, but have led to exciting scientific discoveries through ocean drilling. Essentially all studies of fluid flow within the seafloor deal with at least one of these four topics: (1) driving forces, (2) hydrogeologic properties (transmissive and storage), (3) fluxes, and (4) fluid sources. In quantifying these properties and processes, researchers grapple with spatial and temporal scaling issues, and the common challenge of reconciling interpretations based on different approaches and assumptions. In many cases, laboratory and in situ measurements are used as input or constraints for sophisticated models. Results of such models often lead to ideas for new approaches or techniques.

When a pattern of an encoded pair is presented, the other is expected to be recalled. It has been shown that standard BAM cannot correctly recall a pattern pair if it is not at local minima of the energy function. To overcome this problem, novel methods for encoding have been proposed. The efficient novel-encoding methods require knowledge of the interference noise in the standard BAM. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for computing the exact amount of interference noise in standard encoding of BAM. The computational complexity of the algorithm is the same as that of computing the correlation matrix for the standard BAM.","Bidirectional associative memory (BAM); Coding strategies; Interference noise; Multiple training","Algorithms; Calculations; Computational complexity; Correlation methods; Matrix algebra; Signal encoding; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Bidirectional associative memory; Correlation matrix; Interference noise; Multiple training; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036129266

This project is a collaboration between researchers from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University - Florida State University (FAMU-FSU) College of Engineering, researchers from High Energy Physics (HEP), Florida State University and High Energy Physics, Boston University (BU). The STC project is based on the specifications provided by the researchers at BU and a preliminary STC module designed using the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL). The upgraded STC has a modified memory map and a new Level 3 (L3) buffer module. Traditionally discrete components of memory and processor cores were externally connected, while current implementation aims at configuring them into a single device, thus increasing general system performance by decreasing board area and time delays associated with transmission lines on the printed circuit board. The STC targets the Advanced Programmable Embedded Matrix (APEX) family of PLDs developed by Altera Corporation. A comprehensive design package offered by Altera is used for synthesis, simulation, place and route and configuration of the device. Other third party Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are also used for synthesizing and optimizing modules written in VHDL.","APEX; DO; FLEX; PLD; Quark; STC; STT; VHDL","Computer hardware description languages; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Integrated circuits; Printed circuit boards; Programmable logic controllers; Silicon track cards (STC); Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036082119

The explanation was that this unusual behavior was due to instability in the frictional interfaces in the joints of the structures. In fact, this hypothesis has never been confirmed, either by direct measurement or by theoretical extrapolation. This paper explores the possible theoretical origin of such observations, should frictional instability be the root cause. It does so by formulating a lumped parameter model of a friction interface, based on recent experiments in friction at this scale of deformation and previous research in geomechanics. The purpose of this research is to determine whether or not the interface mechanics seen at the asperity level can account for the creep behavior and dynamic anomalies seen in previous experiments. The model experiences creep-like mechanics and nano-lurch response, similar to the quasi-static response measured in friction interfaces and deployed structures to date. Additionally, the model allows for the storage and spontaneous release of strain energy similar to earthquakes seen in crustal mechanics. While, such a release of energy could be responsible for the dynamic events seen historically in deployed structures, the evidence is inconclusive.",,"Creep; Earthquakes; Friction; Joints (structural components); Space telescopes; Geomechanics; Optical space structures; Aerospace engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036076337
