Stretching a contracting muscle leads to greater mechanical work being done during subsequent shortening by its contractile component; the mechanism of this enhancement is not known. 2. This mechanism has been investigated here by subjecting tetanized frog muscle fibres to ramp stretches followed by an isotonic release against a load equal to the maximum isometric tension, T(o). Shortening against T(o) was taken as direct evidence of an absolute increase in the ability to do work as a consequence of the previous stretch. 3. Ramp stretches (0.5‐8.6% sarcomere strain, confined to the plateau of the isometric tension‐length relationship) were given at different velocities of lengthening (0.03‐1.8 sarcomere lengths s‐1). Isotonic release to T(o) took place immediately after the end of the ramp, or 5‐800 ms after the end of the largest ramp stretches. The length changes taking place after release were measured both at the fibre end and on a tendon‐free segment of the fibre. The experiments were carried out at 4 and 14 degrees C. 4. After the elastic recoil of the undamped elastic elements, taking place during the fall in tension at the instant of the isotonic release, a well‐defined shortening took place against T(o) (transient shortening against T(o)). 5. The amplitude and time course of transient shortening against T(o) were similar at the fibre end and in the segment, indicating that it is due to a properly of the sarcomeres and not due to stress relaxation of the tendons. 6. Transient shortening against T(o) increased with sarcomere stretch amplitude up to about 8 nm per half‐sarcomere independent of stretch velocity. 7. When a short delay (5‐20 ms) was introduced between the end of the stretch and the isotonic release, the transient shortening against T(o) did not change; after longer time delays, the transient shortening against T(o) decreased in amplitude. 8. The velocity of transient shortening against T(o) increased with temperature with a temperature coefficient, Q10, of approximately 2.5. 9. It is suggested that transient shortening against T(o) results from the release of mechanical energy stored within the damped element of the cross‐bridges. The cross‐bridges are brought into a state of greater potential energy not only during the ramp stretch, but also immediately afterwards, during the first phase of stress relaxation. © 1994 The Physiological Society",,"animal tissue; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; frog; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; muscle stretching; muscle tone; nonhuman; priority journal; sarcomere length; temperature sensitivity; Animal; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Isotonic Contraction; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Rana temporaria; Sarcomeres; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028618345

Accumulation of the neurotransmitter depends on the proton electrochemical gradient across the organelle membrane and involves VMAT-mediated exchange of two lumenal protons with one cytoplasmic amine. It has been suggested in the past that His residues play a role in H+ movement or in its coupling to active transport in H+-symporters and antiporters. Indeed VMAT-mediated transport is inhibited by reagents specific for His residues. We have identified one His residue in VMAT1 from rat which is conserved in other vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. Mutagenesis of this His (H419) to either Arg or Cys completely inhibits [3H]serotonin and [3H]dopamine accumulation. Mutagenesis also inhibits other H+-dependent partial reactions of VMAT such as the acceleration of binding of the high affinity ligand reserpine, but does not inhibit the [3H]reserpine binding which is not dependent on H+ translocation.

This time-scale dependence has practical importance in magnetic recording, because the effective time scales of writing and storage are very different. A simple model accounts for the time-scale dependence of coercivity in terms of the thermally assisted crossing of an energy barrier whose height is reduced by the applied field. Fitting this barrier-crossing model to data provides an estimate of the volume that must switch magnetization direction in overcoming the barrier. The assumption of Stoner-Wohlfarth reversal is used to obtain an initial estimate of the dependence of the barrier height on the field. With some adjustment of the resulting energy expression, the model gives good agreement between calculated switching volume and actual particle volume for advanced recording particles of three types: acicular oxide, acicular metal, and barium ferrite platelets. The model can be used to estimate minimum practical particle volumes for use in magnetic recording. Switching due to fields nearly perpendicular to the particle's preferred axis, sometimes used as a measure of the anisotropy field, also shows the effect of thermal assistance. The switching volume determined from such measurements, like that from coercivity, approximates the particle volume.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449004760

Cogeneration facilities are supplying an ever increasing portion of this capacity due to the economic benefits of electrical generation combined with steam production. Predominantly these facilities use combustion turbines. The problem with combustion turbine based capacity is that the highest electrical peak demands often occur during times of high ambient temperature. High ambient temperatures result in substantially lower combustion turbine output from ISO rating. Combustion turbine inlet air cooling can reverse this degradation and increase electrical output by 20% to 30% with a constant or even increased steam production.

The neurons perform inner product operation and have sigmoid-like activation function. The 70 network inputs and the neural signal processing are analog, the synaptic weights are digitally programmable with 5 bit (4 bits + sign) precision. The synaptic weights are stored on on-chip static RAM cells. The combination of analog and digital techniques results unique computing power with ease of use. Programming can easily be performed with the help of a spreadsheet or other suitable interface program from a PC. The resolution of the input signals is mainly determined by the signal to noise ratio which lies typically between 8-12 bits. Therefore the equivalent input bandwidth can be as high as 28-42 Gbits/second. The system is designed for very high speed vector classification and the feasibility of a single chip neural network photon trigger for nuclear research is shown.

With the proposed write/erase method, the degradation of the read disturb life time after 106 write/erase cycles can be drastically reduced to 50% in comparison with the conventional bipolarity write/erase method. The features of the proposed write/erase method are as follows: (1) applying an additional pulse to the control gate just after a completion of the write/erase operation, (2) the voltage of the additional pulse is higher than that of a control gate in a read operation, and lower enough than that of a control gate in a write operation. (3) the polarity of the voltage is the same as that of the control gate voltage in the read operation.

An iterative modeling and analysis approach is used that provides macro-level models early in the project and establishes credibility with the customer. The results from the analyses based on the macro models influence system design decisions and provide information that helps focus subsequent model development.

Fault injection experiments indicates that most of the transient pulses can be tolerated with 7.5 ns penalty in performance, at least for the ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits. In circuits for critical systems, this penalty may be acceptable. Furthermore, this is not the best case penalty since the DFF can be individually optimized for the circuit and the transient pulse width can be somewhat shortened through redesign. Therefore, this is a viable approach for tolerating transient pulses in VLSI circuits used in critical systems.",,"Alpha particles; Computer simulation; Electric fault currents; Electric network synthesis; Fault tolerant computer systems; Flip flop circuits; Radiation shielding; Transients; VLSI circuits; Benchmarking; Radiation hardening; Transient pulses; Semiconductor storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028745345

A repository will not be completed in time for the scheduled receipt of SNF. A Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) Facility is therefore a feasible solution to bridge the gap between the 1998 date for fuel acceptance and the startup of the repository. SNF will be stored temporarily at the MRS and later retrieved from storage and shipped to the repository. To simplify fuel handling and to standardize components, the multi-purpose canister (MPC) concept was investigated. The MPC would be a sealed, metallic canister containing multiple SNF assemblies in a dry inert environment. MPCs would be placed into different overpacks for transportation, storage, and disposal at the repository. The MRS transfer facility MPC and SNF throughput requirements, assumptions, and operating concepts were used to initially determine the size of the facility and the major equipment contained within the facility. This initial estimate was based on simplified calculation techniques. The adequacy of the design configurations were then confirmed using SLAM2 simulation modeling software. Modeling incorporates uncertainties in task durations, the effects of equipment reliability, availability of personnel and equipment, and system breakdowns.

A continued investigation of the improvement of composite materials' impact resistance using SMA hybrid composites is presented here. Because graphite/epoxy composites lack a mechanism for dissipating impact strain energy such as plastic yielding, damage from impact type loading can be very severe. Initially, damage develops in the form of delamination and resin crazing which methods such as rubber toughening or creating a thermoplastic fiber-matrix interphase can reduce. At higher energy levels, impact loading causes fiber fracture and material puncture. Few methods exist to reduce the material perforation once the elastic strain energy storage capacity of the fibers has been exceeded. Embedding or laminating layers of superelastic SMA wire/epoxy composite in or on the composite has been shown to be effective in increasing the impact energy needed to cause fiber fracture and material puncture. The experimental results from an investigation of the low velocity impact response of hybrid SMA composite materials is presented.

Parametric studies are performed to assess the effect of various design and operating conditions on the thermal behavior of the unit. Results indicate that the average output heat load during the recovery period is strongly dependent on the minimum operating temperature, on the thermal diffusivity of the liquid phase, on the thickness of the PCM layer and on the HTF inlet mass flow rate and temperature.

A general applicable model has been developed for the coupling of two single phase systems by a voltage link with small storage capacitance. It allows the decoupling of the pulsating mains power from the panel. Based on this model, which avoids the need of large filters, a sophisticated control principle has been developed.

Moreover, the values of the resonant inductor and the capacitor can be reduced substantially, limited only by the di/dt ratings of the devices, since the resonant current peaks, which would otherwise have risen to a higher value (tank storage energy burden) no longer appear in this configuration. In the paper, converter is digitally simulated using 'ACSL' and output performance is investigated.

To this extend convergence studies are performed with constant and variable adaptivity indices, with error estimators based on global and elemental approaches and with domain decomposition matrix handling techniques and the preconditioned conjugate gradient solver.",,"Convergence of numerical methods; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Elasticity; Hierarchical systems; Iterative methods; Stiffness; Conjugate gradient method; Error estimation; Linear equations; Finite element method",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028729462

The novel results presented here show that cold cathode gyrotrons can be successfully pulsed repetitively. A tunable gyrotron with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 150Hz is demonstrated. This system developed >4MW mm-wave output pulses at 100GHz. The gyrotron is based on a two-electrode configuration comprising a field-immersed, field emission, cold cathode and a shaped anode cavity. A superconducting magnet was used to produce the homogeneous intra-cavity magnetic field and a cable pulser was used to drive the electron beam. This pulser produced up to a (200±20)kV pulse with 10ns rise time, a 100ns flat top, a 10ns decay with a characteristic impedance of 200Ω. The energy storage capacity of the cable pulser was 35J. The charging unit limited the maximum PRF to 330Hz. Due to spark gap switching limitations 330Hz was only obtainable in 5 to 10 pulse bursts. For substantial periods of the order of 30 seconds, 100Hz PRF was achieved over an oscillating range of 28 to 100GHz and 150Hz PRF was achieved at 80GHz. No degradation effects on the mm-wave output pulse was evident due to diode recovery time throughout this series of results. A subsequent conclusion is that the diode recovery time in our cold cathode gyrotron is less than 3ms. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Gyrotron; Megawatt Gyrotron; Repetitively pulsed gyrotron","Anodes; Electric impedance; Electron beams; Energy storage; Frequencies; Magnetic fields; Millimeter waves; Superconducting magnets; Thermionic cathodes; Cable pulser; Pulse repetition frequency; Gyrotrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028728511

In this report, actual data collected from buildings that have at least two years of operating experience will be used to demonstrate that the negative impacts recognized by these studies can be avoided when designers take full advantage of the unique technological features offered by an ice-based thermal system. Specifically, it will be shown that a thermal storage system that is fully integrated with the total building design will reduce annual energy consumption, reduce peak demand, reduce annual operating costs, and reduce the environmental impact from the use of mechanical systems.

By accounting for the thermal dynamics of the building structure and furnishings and any dedicated thermal storage systems, dynamic approaches permit equipment use to be rescheduled, within constraints of equipment size and permissible indoor temperature variations, in order to improve part-load performance or to operate equipment when the price of electricity is lower. Rescheduling equipment operation must account for storage losses, particularly when the building mass is the storage element and stored energy leaks to the environment. This paper focuses on the rescheduling problem under a very general rate structure known as real-time pricing, designed to accurately express short-term variations in the cost to the utility for producing and transmitting electricity. It examines the mathematical properties of the set of linear difference equations used to model thermal dynamics which are to be asymptotically stable, positive dynamic systems.

The approach advocated takes direct account of the trade-offs between maximal exploitation of heat integration and other scheduling objectives and constraints. Both direct and indirect heat integration are considered. In the former case, heat transfer takes place directly between the fluids undergoing processing in the heat-integrated unit operations, and therefore a degree of time overlap of these operations must be ensured. It is shown that this involves only relatively minor modifications to existing detailed scheduling formulations. Indirect heat integration utilizes a heat transfer medium (HTM) which acts as a mechanism both for transferring heat from one operation to another and for storing energy over time. This provides a degree of decoupling with respect to the timing of the operations involved. The mathematical formulation presented in this paper is based on a detailed characterization of the variation of the mass and energy holdups of HTM over time. In particular, it takes account of the limitations on energy storage due to heat losses to the environment.

The tested systems also had similar energy consumption levels.",,"Atmospheric humidity; District heating; Energy utilization; Heat losses; Heat storage; Infiltration; Performance; Radiant heating; Temperature; Ventilation; Condensing boilers; Dynamic behavior; Radiant floor heating systems; Test rooms; Thermal comfort conditions; Wall panel heating systems; Heating equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028698136

The idea of environmental justice has been actively pursued by the Clinton Administration, and this consideration has resulted in Executive Order 12898, which was signed by President Clinton on February 11, 1994. The Executive Order calls for adverse impacts of Federal actions on minority or low-income populations to be identified before decisions implementing those actions are made. Numerous studies show that noxious facilities, such as incinerators and landfills, have been constructed in minority or low-income communities. And since the Department has not yet decided on sites for high-level waste storage or disposal facilities, it will have to take the new Executive Order into consideration as another piece in the complicated quilt of requirements that cover facility siting. An interesting twist to this is the fact that twenty Native American Indian Tribes expressed interest in voluntarily hosting a high-level radioactive waste management facility for temporary storage. They made these expressions on their own initiative, and several Tribes continue to pursue the idea of negotiations with either the Federal Government or private entities to locate a temporary storage site on Tribal land. The Executive Order goes beyond simply studying the effect of siting a facility and addresses in spirit a criticism that the Federal Government has been guilty of `environmental racism' in its siting policies - that it has intentionally picked minority or low-income communities for waste management facilities. Environmental justice provisions contained in the Executive Order place responsibility on officials who site Federal facilities to conduct their activities in a manner that does not discriminate or have the effect of discrimination against low-income or minority populations, and makes provisions for disadvantaged populations to have an opportunity to participate fully in decisions affecting their health and environment. What Department of Energy staff and others may have considered foregone conclusions in terms of interim storage facility siting and transportation options will have to be reevaluated for compatibility with provisions of the new Executive Order.",,"Environmental protection; Facilities; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive waste transportation; Site selection; Environmental justice; Executive Order 12898; Low income communities; Minority communities; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028602399

In this paper, we demonstrate that these diffraction gratings are rather due to refractive index changes and we examine experimentally and theoretically the possibilities of increasing the diffraction efficiency. The physical mechanism underlying the creation of the refractive index grating is the following. When the first electron hole pair is created through one-photon absorption in the semiconductor nanocrystallite, the electron and hole move owing to diffusion. The electron can then be trapped in the host glass, whereas the hole is trapped inside the semiconductor dot. As observed experimentally, this physical mechanism leads to a two peak behavior of the diffraction efficiency plotted as a function of the number of write pulses (see Fig. 1). Evidently, such a behavior which is predicted by our model, cannot be observed for an absorptive grating. Figure 1 also demonstrates that the maximum diffraction efficiency is obtained in the early stage of the photo-darkening process. In the following, we review the influence of several parameters which could allow an increase of the maximum diffraction efficiency ρM of such gratings. Firstly, ρM increases linearly with the grating wavelength up to 7 μm and remains constant for larger values. This low response at high spatial frequencies, which prevents the use of such media in this frequency domain, is probably due to the low dot concentration (few 10-3). Secondly, ρM is independent of the 'write' beam's mean intensity but increases linearly with the fluence of the 'write' pulses. This is probably due to the onset of Auger relaxation occurring at high fluences, which can help the trapping of electrons in the glass matrix. Finally, ρM increases near the band gap resonance, thus demonstrating the importance of the choice of the write laser wavelength. In conclusion, as the use of a high dc electric field is also expected to strongly increase the refractive index change, the storage of efficient gratings in semiconductor doped glasses seems to be possible, especially if picosecond duration pulses delivered by frequency doubled mode-locked Ng-YAG lasers are used as the 'write' beams.",,"Electric fields; Electric space charge; Electron transport properties; Energy gap; Glass; Laser mode locking; Laser pulses; Neodymium lasers; Photochromism; Refractive index; Relaxation processes; Semiconductor doping; Auger relaxation; Electron hole pair; Electron trapping; Optical storage; Static Kerr effect; Diffraction gratings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028602337

Three weldments were made: one using the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding process (GTAW), one using the Shielded Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), and one using an automatic GTAW process. Finite element analysis was used to model the configuration of the test welds and the closure lid conceptual design for the MPC. This was done to determine the effect of the canister shell distortion due to welding on the MPC canister.",,"Containers; Deformation; Finite element method; Inert gas welding; Mathematical models; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste transportation; Spent fuels; Welds; Automatic GTAW process; Canister shell distortion; Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System (CRWMS); CRWMS Management and Operating (M&O) contractor; Gas Tungsten Arc Welding process (GTAW); Multipurpose canister (MPC) closure weld model study; Shielded Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028599348

This resource curriculum was developed in response to years and thousands of teacher, student, and general public requests for facts about nuclear waste - specifically, what the United States was doing and why. The curriculum materials when issued were the result of six years of development and testing by science and social studies teachers as well as multi-state field-testing and international critique. The curriculum is provided only to educators who specifically request it; and in the first one-and-a-half years following its availability more than 500,000 curriculum documents have been requested. Of all the requests for information received by OCRWM for any information or materials, most requests received are from educators or students. So one might consider educators and students to be `customers,' that is, as the business world might define customers: anyone expecting a product or a service from us. To determine usefulness and content for future editions of `Science, Society, and America's Nuclear Waste,' the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management has undertaken a usage evaluation to ensure that it focuses on the needs of the `customer;' that is, those who need and request it.

These new laser media have become available in part because of the improved understanding of the solid state physics issues that impact the laser performance. The physics and performance of the new tunable ultraviolet-emitting laser crystal, Ce3+:LiSAF, will be discussed, as will the critical physics issues pertaining to the operation of 3 μm Er3+ and Ho3+-based crystals. We also show that Yb-doped apatite crystals offer a viable alternative to 1.05 μm Nd-lasers. Since the realization by Dubinskii and coworkers that Ce3+-doped colquiriite-structure hosts exhibit reliable laser action in the ultraviolet region, the interest in developing UV solid state media has been revived. As a consequence, we have examined the gain and efficiency of lasers based on Ce3+-doped LiSrAlF6 (Ce:LiSAF). The gain spectrum was measured by pumping at 266 nm, as shown in Fig. 1, where it is revealed that the extracting field must be polarized as E∥c for useful laser operation. As a result, we measured the quantum yields, η, and branching ratios, β, for the 2.7-3.0 μm transitions for several Er and Ho-doped crystals, as reported in Table 1. From this data we see that the Er-doped gallium garnets (Gd3Ga5O12 and Gd3Sc2Ga3O12) offer much higher quantum yields than Y3Al5O12. As expected, the low phonon frequency of fluorides leads to η values of unity. The last two entries show that Ho-doped crystals generally offer 3 μm branching ratios of about one-half that available from Er. Of course, the overall merit of each material depends on many other optical and physical parameters. While Nd-doped materials have long been considered the laser ion of choice to generate light near 1.05 μm, Yb-doped apatite crystals are now able to offer a viable alternative. Yb offers the advantages associated with a longer energy storage time and a lower quantum defect, although the quasi-four-level nature of the system must be taken into account. In summary, the physics and performance of solid state laser media operating in the UV, near-infrared, and mid-infrared regions will be discussed.",,"Crystals; Doping (additives); Gain measurement; Garnets; Light absorption; Light polarization; Lithium compounds; Optical pumping; Performance; Solid state lasers; Solid state physics; Ultraviolet radiation; Solid state laser gain media; Optical materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028599274

The isothermal square outer enclosure with a width of W was fixed to a W/d = 20.33 in all the calculations. Pure conduction results were also obtained for rod-bundles from 3×3 to 13×13. It is found that the conduction Nusselt number for the Edge-Column-Bottom rod (rod ECB) decreases with increases in N from 3 to 7. However, the trend reverses and Nusselt number begins to increase for N&gt;9. This form of Nusselt number variations with N is generally applicable to the outer-edge rods in the array. The convection flow regime in the N = 3 to 9 arrays has been studied for a limited range of modified Rayleigh number (Ra*d&lt;320). It should be added that Ra*d approximately 1500 is a typical value for atmospheric pressure air convection in a unit cell of a PWR cask. The streamlines show that there is significant flow activity in the enclosure, especially in the top half region. It may be noted that for arrays with N = 3 to 9 significant convection heat transfer is observed even at Ra*d = 1. It is suspected that this horizontal orientation with distributed energy sources within the enclosure may be an inherently unstable natural convection phenomenon. Therefore, for this enclosure the range of the modified Rayleigh number investigated is for a high convection flow regime. The isotherms clearly show that the majority of the energy generated within the enclosure is transferred to the top and side plates. This indicates that, as suspected, convection is a major factor in heat transfer in transportation casks.",,"Confined flow; Containers; Enclosures; Heat convection; Mathematical models; Nuclear fuel elements; Radioactive waste storage; Spent fuels; Buoyancy driven fluid flow; Horizontal rod bundles; Nusselt number; Rayleigh number; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028590669

In particular, femtosecond kilohertz Ti:Al2O3 amplifier systems have been developed which produce average powers of 2 W or greater. One of the interesting capabilities of these chirped pulse amplification systems is the ability to produce shaped, amplified pulses. Plane simultaneous amplitude and phase control of the frequency components of the pulse is possible. This method of producing programmable optical pulse shapes was first demonstrated by Weiner et al. We have adapted this technique and designed two liquid crystal modulators which provide independent amplitude and phase control and can work within the diffractive stretcher system of the laser. This system has enabled us to produce amplified, shaped pulses. One of the most critical diagnostics in a laser system capable of producing arbitrarily shaped pulses is a correlation technique for determining the amplitude and phase of the amplified light. This enables us to determine how closely the shaped pulse approximates the ideal target pulse shape. We incorporate spectrally resolved autocorrelations, and/or frequency resolved optical gates in our system in order to accomplish this.",,"Amplification; Crystals; Iodine; Laser mode locking; Laser pulses; Light amplifiers; Light modulators; Molecules; Optical correlation; Optical variables measurement; Phase modulation; Amplitude reshaping effects; Chirped pulse amplification systems; Crystal modulator; Vibrational wave packet; Solid state lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028582541

Such signals are common in video coding applications. The 2-D DWT is applied separately to each frame of the three-dimensional (3-D) input sequence, resulting in a set of multiresolution (subband) image sequences. Mixed-D filtering is then used to enhance or reject linear trajectory signals within each subband image sequence. The output for each frame is formed by inverting the wavelet transform using the Mixed-D processed sequences. This method of filtering lends itself to use in subband video coding systems, which are becoming increasingly popular, and permits selective Mixed-D filtering of the subband signals depending upon the energy content within the subbands.

The acidification of these organelles is accomplished by proton-translocating ATPase belonging to the V-type H+-ATPase superfamily. However, in terms of chemiosmotic energy transduction, electrogenic proton pumping alone is not sufficient to establish and maintain those compartments inside acidic. Current studies have shown that the in situ acidification depends upon the activity of V-ATPase and vacuolar anion conductance; the latter is required for shunting a membrane potential (interior positive) generated by the positively charged proton translocation. Yeast vacuoles possess two distinct Cl- transport systems both participating in the acidification inside the vacuole, a large acidic compartment with digestive and storage functions. These two transport systems have distinct characteristics for their kinetics of Cl- uptake or sensitivity to a stilbene derivative. One shows linear dependence on a Cl- concentration and is inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS). The other shows saturable kinetics with an apparent Km for Cl- of approximately 20 mM.

The polariton being an hybrid matter-radiation mode these aspects may be drastically altered as its material support is altered for instance in the course of its propagation in inhomogeneous media. In this context the polariton transmission through an interface or a layer is a key problem. We have extended and applied to this problem the nonlocal time-resolved nonlinear technique we previously used for the study of polaritons in bulk crystals. This technique is in essence a 'time of flight' experiment consisting in separating in space the coherent excitation and probing stages of the picosecond time-resolved CARS, the excited polariton wave-packet being tracked in real time and space during its propagation. Here we have exploited the spatial and temporal selectivity of this technique to investigate the transmission of a phonon-polariton pulse through a vacuum layer separating two identical halves of an ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) crystal. The coherent excitation of the phonon-polariton is performed in the one half by coherent Raman scattering of two picosecond pulses and the transmitted wave-packet is tracked in the other half by measuring coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering of a third picosecond pulse. The nonlocal probing allows a separation of the temporal and spatial features and gives a direct and independent access to the influence of the interface on the polariton envelope. The transmission was studied for two layer thicknesses (d = 3 mm and 1 mm) and two different polariton modes of the same branch; the figure shows the intensity of the CARS signal as a function of the probing point for d = 3 mm. The second maximum (probing point displacement around 2.5 mm) corresponds to probing in the second crystal of the phonon-polariton wave-packet excited in the first one and transmitted through the vacuum layer. The above technique can be extended to measure polariton transmission and reflection coefficients on interfaces or dielectric layers that separate different crystalline media or other inhomogeneous configurations. Such information is very important when envisaging polariton pulse processing and interaction with other injected pulses.",,"Ammonium compounds; Crystals; Dielectric materials; Interfaces (materials); Phonons; Quantum theory; Raman scattering; Vacuum; Phonon polariton transmission; Polaritons; Vacuum layer; Electromagnetic wave transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028553582

The electrooptic and photoconductive properties of the composite have been studied and an apparent sublinear dependence of the photoconductivity on the illumination power density has been observed. Both degenerate and nondegenerate four-wave-mixing experiments have been carried out and a holographic diffraction efficiency of 1.1% has been achieved in a 160-μm-thick film at an external field of 62.5 V/μm. A nonlocal character of the photorefractivity has been established through the asymmetric energy transfer with a gain of 7 cm -1 in a two-beam coupling experiment. The dynamics of the formation and erasure of the holographic gratings has been studied. The rise time and erasure time for the space-charge field have been measured as a function of the writing and erasure beam intensities, respectively. The sublinear character of these dependencies can be explained by the apparent sublinear photoconductivity of the composite. The dependence of the grating rise time on the applied electric field is attributed to the field dependence of both the photocharge generation quantum efficiency and the charge mobility in the polymer matrix.

The structural changes with milling time were followed by X-ray diffraction, high-field magnetization measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Ball milling results in a continuous increase of the magnetization at 4.2 K in a field of 21 T with milling time. This gives evidence that by mechanical milling anti-site disorder is generated in Co2Si, similar to the case of orthorhombic Co2Ge. X-ray diffraction reveals that the number of diffraction peaks decreases with increasing milling time and that all diffraction peaks broaden. The absence of a large number of diffraction lines supports the creation of atomic disorder. The average crystallite size derived from the fine width shows a drastic decrease in the early stage of milling and tends to become constant with a value of 8-10 nm upon further milling. The material remains in the same structure as the starting compound even after prolonged periods of milling. Exothermic heat effects due to both atomic reordering and nanocrystallite growth are evident in the DSC scans of ball-milled samples. Well defined atomically disordered nanocrystalline Co 2Si is produced by ball milling.

Strain PCC 7942 is deprived of an essential macronutrient such as nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus, cellular phycobiliprotein and chlorophyll contents decline. The level of β-carotene declines proportionately to chlorophyll, but the level of zeaxanthin increases relative to chlorophyll. In nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells there is a net degradation of phycobiliproteins. Otherwise, the declines in cellular pigmentation are due largely to the diluting effect of continued cell division after new pigment synthesis ceases and not to net pigment degradation. There was also a rapid decrease in O2 evolution when Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 was deprived of macronutrients. The rate of O2 evolution declined by more than 90% in nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells, and by approximately 40% in phosphorus-deprived cells. In addition, in all three cases the fluorescence emissions from Photosystem II and its antennae were reduced relative to that of Photosystem I and the remaining phycobilisomes. Furthermore, state transitions were not observed in cells deprived of sulfur or nitrogen and were greatly reduced in cells deprived of phosphorus. Photoacoustic measurements of the energy storage capacity of photosynthesis also showed that Photosystem II activity declined in nutrient-deprived cells.

Energy equivalents (cal g-1 dry wt) was highest in December, before the overwintering period. The somatic weight component increased by 32 to 33% and total body weight by 26% during the spawning season, indicating that feeding not only met energy requirements of daily spawning but also provided surplus energy for growth.

Tail loss decreased neither survivorship nor rate of body growth for individuals in two natural populations. Lack of an influence of tail loss on survivorship in these two populations may be the result of high mortality. Under high mortality any differential effects of tail loss will be lower than in populations facing lower mortality. Growth experiments in the laboratory demonstrated that, under conditions of minimal environmental variation and social interactions, there is no tradeoff between body growth and tail regeneration as has been suggested for other species of lizards. One possible reason for this difference is that U. stansburiana does not use the tail as a storage organ for lipids. The original and regenerated tails are composed mainly of protein. In general, any differential body growth between tailed and tailless individuals may be due to social interactions and not a diversion of limited energy into tail regeneration. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Body growth; High mortality; Survivorship; Tail autotomy; Tail content","autotomy; survivorship; Uta stansburiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028166152

Jessica) and green bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cvs. Lokas and Medeo) were stored at different temperatures ranging from 2 to 12°C. After three different storage periods, fruits from each temperature were transferred to 20°C for 7 d to allow for the development of visual symptoms of chilling injury (CI). During storage, the photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) in peel tissue adapted to darkness, was calculated from measurements of pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorescence. The decrease in PSII quantum yield during storage at low temperatures in darkness can be described as a temperature-dependent inhibition of an enzyme according to Arrhenius, assuming a negative activation energy. By comparison with the radical-scavenger measurements of Hariyadi and Parkin (1991, Postharvest Biol. Techn. 1, 33-45) it is postulated that the time and temperature dependence of the quantum yield parallels the diminution of radical-scavenging activity at lower temperatures in cucumber and capsicum fruits. This is combined with an equation for the process of radical scavenging itself and an equation for the auto-catalytic radical-producing lipid peroxidation reaction. These three basic processes lead to both a static and a dynamic model for the occurrence of chilling injury in low-temperature-sensitive plant tissue. A statistical fit of the measured data using the static model leads to the estimates of the different activation energies and reaction rates with a high degree of accuracy. The estimated values are in accord with what one would expect on the basis of knowledge of the processes leading to chilling injury, and directly point to meaningful physico-chemical parameters. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Chilling injury; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Mathematical model; Radical scavenging",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027966206

Design: Male Wistar rats (n = 50) remained sedentary or were forced to run 840 meters/day, 5 days/week, on a rodent treadmill. Those on the high-intensity protocol covered this distance in less time (38 min) than those on the low-intensity program (60 min). Responses to high-fat (HF) and low-fat (LF) diets were compared within each exercise group for this 8-week study. Results: High fat feeding, as a single factor, did not affect energy intake, carcass fat, intramuscular fat, or fat associated with any tissue studied. The HF diet also did not affect responses to either exercise protocol. The high-intensity-exercised animals had less carcass fat (LF: 21% less; HF: 33% less), smaller omental fat pads (LF: 20% less; HF: 37% less), and retroperitoneal fat pads (LF: 19% less; HF: 38% less), and lower serum triglyceride levels (LF: 26% less; HF: 41% less) than sedentary rats. Those differences were less marked for the low-intensity-exercised rats. Neither mode of exercise or diet affected lipid concentrations in hindlimb muscles, livers, hearts, or kidneys.

The storage ring, capable of storing currents up to 300 mA at 7.0 GeV, or 200 mA at 7.5 GeV, will produce very intense and energetic synchrotron radiation (Ec = 24 keV for bending magnets, and Ec = 37.4 keV for wigglers, where Ec is the critical energy). The synchrotron radiation beam lines, consisting of experimental enclosures and transport lines, will have to be shielded against synchrotron radiation and gas bremsstrahlung scattered from beam line components. For insertion devices placed in the straight sections (length = 15 m), the gas bremsstrahlung produced by the interaction of the primary stored beam with residual gas molecules or ions in the storage ring vacuum chamber dominates the SR beam line shielding. Gas bremsstrahlung in the forward direction will be stopped by a tungsten beam stop, 18cm thick, located at the back of the experimental enclosure and placed in the median plane of the storage ring. The forward-directed gas bremsstrahlung is characterized, and the effectiveness of the tungsten beam stop is assessed. The Monte Carlo code FLUKA was used to determine the dose equivalent rates from gas bremsstrahlung in a cylindrical tissue phantom with and without the tungsten beam stop. Simulations were performed using an air target of length 15 m at a pressure of 1 atm and 1 10atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa = 760 torr) both with and without suppressing positron multiple scattering (M.S.) and Bhabha and Möller scattering in the air target. At a given pressure the dose equivalent rates are higher without positron multiple scattering in the air target than with multiple scattering. For simulations at Ps = 1 atm, the minimization of Bhabha/Möller scattering is important for areas with scoring radii less than 0.4 cm. The maximum dose equivalent rate (for E0 = 7 Gev, I = 300 mA, and P = 0.133 μPa or 10-9 torr) in the phantom (at a depth of 29.5 cm) for a scoring area of 0.0013 cm2 (radius = 0.02 cm) is 2.1 Sv/h, whereas for a scoring area of 0.5 cm2 (radius = 0.4 cm) it is 0.57 Sv/h. Scoring photon fluence and converting it to dose equivalent using Rogers' fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion factors results in an overestimation of dose equivalent. The maximum dose equivalent rate behind the tungsten beam stop, at a depth of 2.5 cm in the tissue, is 0.1 + 0.04 μSv/h for a scoring radius of 1 cm. The corresponding dose equivalent rates without the stop are 32 mSv/h (depth = 2.5 cm) and 0.17 Sv/h (depth = 29.5 cm). A simple expression has been derived for the upper limit on the dose equivalent that an individual can receive due to loss of vacuum in the straight section. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008204969

Nitrogenase activity in unamended sediments from different microhabitats ranged from undetectable values to ≈0.75 nmol C2H4 (g dry sediment)-1·hour-1. The bulk of organic material available to heterotrophic bacteria in saltmarsh lagoons is probably derived from primary production. Amendment of sediments with structural plant polysaccharides showed that xylan and alginate stimulated nitrogenase activity on average by 5 to 18-fold relative to unamended sediments, whereas cellulose and carrageenan were less effective. Amendment of sediments with storage plant polysaccharides produced the greatest stimulation of nitrogenase activity. Addition of laminarin and glycogen (amylopectin) significantly (p &lt;0.05) stimulated nitrogenase activity by 19 to 92-fold. In contrast to these polysaccharides of plant origin, chitin (a polymer of prawn exoskeletons) did not significantly enhance nitrogenase activity in these sediments. Aerobic conditions stimulated nitrogenase activity by 2 to 20-fold in surface sediments, but not in sub-surface sediments, indicating that aerobic or microaerophilic respiration was a significant source of energy for nitrogenase activity in surface sediments. Oxygen-stimulation of nitrogenase activity was less marked in aerobic sediments around the rim of prawn burrow openings where subsurface sediments had been displaced to the surface by bioturbation. Ammonium did not appear to play a major role in the regulation of nitrogenase activity in these sediments as in situ concentrations were ≈20-fold lower than the concentration (50 μM) which resulted in a slight (0-15%) reduction in nitrogenase activity. © 1994.","Bioturbation; Heterotrophic nitrogen fixation; Organics; Saltmarsh; Seagrass; Thalassinids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028190970

Kidneys from these donors have suffered warm ischemia (WI). The effectiveness of two preservation solutions, i.e., the University of Wisconsin (UW) and the histidine tryptophan ketoglutarate (HTK) solutions, for preservation of kidneys that have been subjected to WI was tested in dogs. The left kidney was autotransplanted after 30 min of WI, and subsequent 24-hr cold storage (CS) in either UW (n=6) or HTK (n=6), with immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Surgical biopsies from the cortex were taken before WI, after 30 min of WI, after 24 hr of CS, and after 1 hr of reperfusion for electron microscopy and for analysis of energy metabolites. At 2 weeks after transplantation in the UW group, 4 out of 6 and, in the HTK group, 1 out of 6 dogs survived. As from day 2, serum creatinine was lower in the UW group as compared with the HTK group (P<0.05). After 24 hr of CS, in the HTK group the luminal membranes of proximal tubular cells were partly denuded of microvilli. Moreover, the tubular lumen was filled with blebs and debris. In the UW group, the brush borders remained intact, although microvilli were swollen. Energy metabolites were analyzed with HPLC. Thirty minutes of WI resulted in a t 45% reduction of total adenine nucleotide (TAN) content. During CS, TAN levels further decreased in both groups; however, after 24 hr of CS, the levels of adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were significantly higher in the UW group as compared with the HTK group (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.01). At 1 hr of reperfusion, TAN levels were higher in the UW group as compared with the HTK group (4.66±0.16 vs. 4.02±0.28, P<0.05). Our results show that UW is a superior solution compared with HTK in the preservation of ischemically damaged kidneys, demonstrating better survival, better recovery of kidney function, better protection against ischemia-induced ultrastructural damage, and better preservation of en- ergy metabolism indicated by (a faster) regeneration of TAN levels after reperfusion. © 1994 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"adenine nucleotide; adenosine; creatinine; heparin; htk solution; hypoxanthine; inosine; morphine; sorbitol; thiopental; university of wisconsin solution; xanthine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell ultrastructure; dog; dose calculation; female; graft preservation; graft survival; intravenous drug administration; kidney biopsy; kidney ischemia; kidney preservation; kidney transplantation; nephrectomy; nonhuman; organ donor; priority journal; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine; Allopurinol; Animal; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cold; Comparative Study; Creatinine; Dogs; Female; Glucose; Glutathione; Insulin; Ischemia; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Kidney Tubules; Mannitol; Organ Preservation; Organ Weight; Potassium Chloride; Procaine; Raffinose; Reperfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028099215

These requirements impose many challenges on architectures and operating systems. This paper investigates three alternative storage devices for mobile computers: magnetic hard disks, flash memory disk emulators, and flash memory cards. We have used hardware measurements and trace-driven simulation to evaluate each of the alternative storage devices and their related design strategies. Hardware measurements on an HP OmniBook 300 highlight differences in the performance of the three devices as used on the Omnibook, especially the poor performance of version 2.00 of the Microsoft Flash File System [11] when accessing large files. The traces used in our study came from different environments, including mobile computers (Macintosh Power-Books) and desktop computers (running Windows or HP-UX), as well as synthetic workloads. Our simulation study showsthatflash memory can reduceenergy consumptionby an order of magnitude, compared to magnetic disk, while providing good read performance and acceptable write performance. These energy savings can translate into a 22% extension of battery life. We also find that the amount of unused memory in a flash memory card has a substantial impact on energy consumption, performance, and endurance: compared to low storage utilizations (40% full), running flash memory near its capacity (95% full) can increase energy consumption by 70-190%, degrade write response time by 30%, and decrease the lifetime of the memory card by up to a third. For flash disks, asynchronous erasure can improve write response time by a factor of 2.5.",,"Computer hardware; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Green computing; Hard disk storage; Hardware; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic storage; Personal computers; Response time (computer systems); Smart cards; Systems analysis; Virtual storage; Design strategies; FLASH file systems; Interactive performance; Low-power consumption; Magnetic hard disks; Simulation studies; Synthetic workloads; Trace driven simulation; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944405520

Our calculations begin at the onset of core collapse and stop several hundred milliseconds after the bounce, at which time successful explosions of the appropriate magnitude have been obtained. Similar to the classical delayed explosion mechanism of Wilson, the explosion is powered by the heating of the envelope due to neutrinos emitted by the protoneutron star as it radiates the gravitational energy liberated by the collapse. However, as was shown by Herant, Benz, &amp; Colgate, this heating generates strong convection outside the neutrinosphere, which we demonstrate to be critical to the explosion. By breaking a purely stratified hydrostatic equilibrium, convection moves the nascent supernova away from a delicate radiative equilibrium between neutrino emission and absorption. Thus, unlike what has been observed in one-dimensional calculations, explosions are rendered quite insensitive to the details of the physical input parameters such as neutrino cross sections or nuclear equation of state parameters. As a confirmation, our comparative one-dimensional calculations with identical microphysics, but in which convection cannot occur, lead to dramatic failures. Guided by our numerical results, we have developed a paradigm for the supernova explosion mechanism. We view a supernova as an open cycle thermodynamic engine in which a reservoir of low-entropy matter (the envelope) is thermally coupled and physically connected to a hot bath (the protoneutron star) by a neutrino flux, and by hydrodynamic instabilities. Neutrino heating raises the entropy of matter in the vicinity of the protoneutron star until buoyancy carries it to low-density, low-temperature regions at larger radii. This matter is replaced by low-entropy downflows with negative buoyancy. In essence, a Carnot cycle is established in which convection allows out-of-equilibrium heat transfer mediated by neutrinos to drive low-entropy matter to higher entropy and therefore extracts mechanical energy from the heat generated by gravitational collapse. We argue that supernova explosions are nearly guaranteed and self-regulated by the high efficiency of the thermodynamical engine. The mechanical efficiency is high because mixing during the heat exchange is limited by the rapid rise and shape-preserving expansion of the bubbles in a p ∝ r-3 atmosphere. In addition, the ideal Carnot efficiency is high due to the large temperature contrast between the surface of the protoneutron star and the material being convected down from large radii (this contrast remains large in spite of compression and shock heating which is relatively small). By direct P dV integration over the convective cycle, we estimate the energy deposition to be ∼4 foes per M⊙ involved. Further, convection, by keeping the temperature low in rising neutrino-heated high-entropy bubbles, allows the storage of internal energy while minimizing the losses due to neutrino emission. Thus convection continues to accumulate energy exterior to the neutron star until a successful explosion has occurred. At this time, the envelope is expelled and therefore uncoupled from the heat source (the neutron star) and the energy input ceases. This paradigm does not invoke new or modified physics over previous treatments, but relies on compellingly straightforward thermodynamic arguments. It provides a robust and self-regulated explosion mechanism to power supernovae that is effective under a wide range of physical parameters.","Hydrodynamics; Stars: interiors; Stars: neutron; Supernovae: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253106

The lowest occurs at the glass transition temperature (Tg) of pure amorphous water, is invariant with water content and is probably associated with crystal defects and other interfaces. The second, at about -60°C, is dependent upon water content and probably reflects rotational mobility of side chains (β-transition). It can be seen by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) as well, but the energies are too small to detect by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The third is the glass transition, which reflects the increase in diffusional mobility in the sample. The increase in fluidity can be measured by DMA and the increase in heat capacity of water is detectable by DSC. This is the transition that has been associated with changes in seed storage stability. Heretofore, DSC has been the method of choice because of its availability, familiarity and its ease of operation and interpretation. However, at low sample water contents, DSC signals become small and diffuse and the assignment of Tg becomes difficult. Because DMA is the most sensitive to local motion, it provides the most credible information on changes in sample viscosity that occur during glass transition. We have recently examined embryos in the Perkin-Elmer DMA-7 and found that DMA provides richer data for these studies than does DSC.","Glass, seeds, thermal analysis, vitrification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028003472

With the SERODS technology, the molecular interactions between the optical layer molecules and the substrate are modified by the writing laser, changing their surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) emitting properties, so that they are encoded to store information as bits. Since the SERS-emitting properties are extremely sensitive to molecular microenvironments (enhancement up to a million fold), lower laser energies (shorter pulses and/or faster rate) and much smaller ""molecular holes"" are required for the writing process. A reading laser with much lower energy than the writing laser, and a photometric detector tuned to the frequency of the Raman emissions, are used to retrieve the stored information. The SERODS technology has great potential to offer several advantages including high storage density, unique spectral features of the encoded signals, three-dimensional storage capability. © 1994 SPIE.

Responses of adenylate pools reflected the energy imbalance created during cold hypoxia in both rat and ground squirrel liver within minutes of organ isolation. In rat, ATP levels and energy charge values for freshly isolated livers were 2.54 μmol·g-1 and 0.70, respectively. Within 5 min of cold hypoxia, ATP levels had dropped well below control values and by 8 h storage, ATP, AMP, and energy charge values were 0.21 μmol·g-1, 2.01 μmol·g-1, and 0.17, respectively. In columbian ground squirrels the patterns of rapid ATP depletion and AMP accumulation were similar to those found in rat. In rat liver, enzymatic regulatory control of glycolysis appeared to be extremely sensitive to the decline in cellular energy levels. After 8 h cold hypoxia levels of fructose-6-phosphate decreased and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate increased, thus reflecting an activation of glycolysis at the regulatory step catalysed by phospho-fructokinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Despite an initial increase in flux through glycolysis over the first 2 min (lactate levels increased 3.7 μmol·g-1), further flux through the pathway was not permitted even though glycolysis was activated at the phosphofructokinase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase locus at 8 h, since supplies of phosphorylated substrate glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate remained low throughout the duration of the 24-h period. Conversely, livers of Columbian ground squirrels exhibited no activation or inactivation of two key glycolytic regulatory loci, phosphofructokinase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase. Although previous studies have shown similar allosteric sensitivities to adenylates to rat liver phospho-fructokinase, there was no evidence of an activation of the pathway as a result of decreasing high energy adenylate, ATP or increasing AMP levels. The lack of any apparent regulatory control of glycosis during cold hypoxia may be related to hibernator-specific metabolic adaptations that are key to the survival of hypothermia during natural bouts of hibernation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Cold-sensitivity; Glycolysis; Hibernating mammals; Liver preservation; Metabolic adaptations","acclimatization; animal; anoxia; article; cold; comparative study; energy metabolism; glycolysis; hibernation; in vitro study; liver; male; metabolism; physiology; rat; rat strain; Sciuridae; Acclimatization; Animal; Anoxia; Cold; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Glycolysis; Hibernation; In Vitro; Liver; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sciuridae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027995125

To measure the physical properties, a Rheometrics dynamic analyzer (RDA) was utilized for the poly(styrene-co-sodium methacrylate) (4 mol %) system, while for the poly(styrene-co-sodium styrenesulfonate) samples (5 mol %) the studies were performed on a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA). In the methacrylate samples of high molecular weight (&gt;100 000), the plot of tan δ vs temperature showed two peaks, as in other ionomers. However, for samples of the lowest molecular weight (ca. 21 000), the tan δ plot showed only one peak and a shoulder. Peak deconvolution, however, showed that, even in that sample, there are two peaks and that the deconvoluted peak areas do not change significantly with molecular weight. The flow behavior of the matrix in the low molecular weight samples partially masks the relaxation process of the clusters. In the terminal region, the viscosities of the ionomers are molecular weight dependent in a way similar to that in nonionic polystyrene; above the critical molecular weight for entanglements, compliance values of the ionomers are independent of the molecular weight. In the case of the sulfonates, many trends are similar to those seen in the methacrylates. As the molecular weight increases, the cluster δ tan peak becomes more visible, and slopes of storage modulus curves in the terminal region become less steep. However, there are some differences, which are due to the difference in the strength of the interaction between ionic groups in the multiplets. In the methacrylates, because of weaker interactions, the ionomers start to exhibit appreciable ion-hopping and chain mobility at a relatively low temperature (ca. 170 °C), which is the onset of the glass transition (Tg) of the cluster phase and is only ca. 50 °C higher than the matrix Tg. Above that temperature, the multiplets can no longer act as long-term cross-links, and the ionomers show a strong molecular weight dependent behavior. On the other hand, in the sulfonates, due to the stronger interaction, ion-hopping becomes important only at much higher temperature (ca. 220 °C), which is, again, the beginning of the cluster Tg; above that point these ionomers also start to show appreciable molecular weight dependent behavior. In addition, in the sulfonates, the activation energies for the matrix and cluster transitions and for ion-hopping are independent of the molecular weight. All these results suggest that the stability of multiplets is independent of the molecular weight. The thermal stabilities of the present ionomers are similar to that of polystyrene. © 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001315314

This period included seven strong radio outbusts with flux densities greater than 5 Jy at S band. All radio flares with maximum flux density greater than 0.5 Jy, including the seven strong radio outbursts, occurred when the 1-6 keV X-ray flux, averaged within 5 days before and after the peak of the radio flare, was greater than 0.37 counts s-1 cm-2, which was corrected for the 4.8 hr intensity modulation. These X-ray fluxes correspond to a high state with a luminosity of roughly 1038 ergs s-1 at 8.5 kpc, implying that a very high accretion rate induces the radio flares. However, no simultaneous increase of X-rays during the radio outburst was detected. This fact suggests that the direct cause of the radio outbursts is some other process, during the high accretion rate, such as a gradual storage and a sudden release of energy by a twisting magnetic field in the accretion process. Population distributions of the mean X-ray flux (1-6 keV) and the X-ray softness ratio (1-6 keV/6-20 keV) was also studied, and they indicated the existence of two distinct states, i.e., high (soft) and low (hard) states. This fact suggests a bimodal behavior of the accretion disk.","Radio continuum: stars; Stars: individual (Cygnus X-3); X-rays: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044257005

The response framework has been reorganized based on new information and response patterns described in published literature. The sentinel monitoring framework provides a tool for initial interpretation of adult fish surveys and description of priority areas for subsequent studies to allow identification of the mechanism of impact. Subsequent, focused, follow-up studies are required to identify the stressor(s) once the impact mechanism has been identified. Response pattern separation requires information from the sampled fish population including age structure, energy expenditure and energy storage. The patterns represent characteristic responses to changes in food availability, adult mortality, recruitment failure and metabolic disruption. The framework requires the identification and appropriate sampling of comparable reference sites, but the sentinel monitoring framework has proved to be a useful tool in preliminary trials, and should provide a focal point for cumulative effects studies using fish populations. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","assessment; fish population; framework; monitoring; tiered-testing","fish population; industrial effluent; monitoring framework; sentinel organism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028183529

In the native state, the enzyme activity does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. It hydrolyses IDP with K0.5 of about 900 μM and Vmax of 300-400 nmol Pi/mg protein/min. In the presence of Triton X-100, the enzyme is maximally stimulated and it renders to a Michaelis-Menten behavior with a Km of about 500 μM and a Vmax of 800-1200 nmol Pi/mg protein/min. The maximal effect of the detergent occurs at about 1 mM IDP (270%), being reduced (190%) at high IDP concentrations (&gt;2 mM) which, per se, have a slight stimulatory effect on the enzyme. On the other hand, we observed that ATP (&gt;2 mM) and adenosine inhibit the IDPase. The effects of the nucleotides and of the adenosine are abolished in the presence of Triton X-100, which makes the enzyme fully active. Furthermore, we observed that detergent treatment of the membranes reduces the change in the activation energy which occurs at 10 °C and eliminates cooperative effects, as revealed by the Arrhenius analysis and the Hill analysis, respectively. We also observed that IDPase inhibition by ATP is maximal at low IDP concentrations (1 mM), whereas it decreases at high concentrations of IDP (4 mM), which promote maximal velocities in the native enzyme. Conversely, the inhibitory effect of adenosine is not reduced at high IDP concentrations. Pyrophosphate also inhibits the IDPase, but the effect is non-competitive and it is cumulative with that of ATP. We also observed that the latent activity of the IDPase (Triton-stimulated IDPase) is reduced by pre-treatment of the membranes with glutaraldehyde. The results indicate that Golgi IDPase is an allosteric enzyme which is positively modulated by IDP and negatively modulated by ATP and adenosine. Pyrophosphate inhibits the IDPase, but it seems to act at the catalytic site, whereas the other modulators appear to interact with a distinct regulatory site. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Golgi membranes; Inosine diphosphatase; Roots; Zea mays",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027952319

A beneficial influence of the vascular expansion was most pronounced in the 40% group, with 10/10, 5/10, and 3/10 long-term survivors following transplantation after 30, 42, and 48 hr preservation versus 3/10 and 0/10 after 30 and 42 hr in the 0c/c controls.

Each calorimeter consists of three layers of CsI(T1) blocks followed by two layers of NaI(T1) blocks, a total of 16 radiation lengths of scintillating material. Scintillation light from the CsI(T1) is collected by wavelength-shifter plates and sensed by silicon photodiodes connected to charge-sensitive preamplifiers.

Luminescence depletion due to preheating of Holocene and Quaternary sediments with natural and artificial doses was examined and found to behave as expected. Preheating was found to have the following undesirable effects. In aliquots with very high doses, preheating lowered the onset of saturation by 20 to 40%. This effect is thought to be due to thermal quenching of recombination centres. In optically zeroed quartz and feldspar aliquots, preheating caused the luminescence signal to increase. In aliquots with geologically very low adsorbed doses, preheating to 230 degrees C caused dose response growth curves to become nonlinear. This effect can be explained in terms of second-order kinetic behaviour. A procedure is suggested which corrects for the undesirable thermal effects in young samples. When verified against thermoluminescence measurements, this procedure yielded correct optical dose estimates for sediments ≤12000 years in age. © 1994 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Activation energy; Aliquots; Charge trapping; Long term energy storage; Thermal stability; Energy gap; Energy storage; Feldspar; Preheating; Quartz; Quenching; Sediments; Stability; Thermal effects; Thermoluminescence; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028484789

This paper shows that a transverse coupled bunch instability occurs in NAR just after injection and that this instability limits the amount of current that can be stored. At such a low energy, the bunch length remains long because of the long radiation damping time. Sacheler's theory shows that the bunch length is so long that small changes in chromaticity produce a large effect on the form factor and thus on the growth rate of the instability.

The significant medical promise of this procedure motivates the development of smaller and less costly X-ray sources. Several exotic sources are candidates for consideration, using effects such as Cherenkov, channeling, coherent bremsstrahlung, laser backscattering, microundulator, parametric, Smith-Purcell, and transition radiation. In this work we present an analysis of these effects as possible sources of intense X-rays at the iodine K-edge (33.169 keV). The criteria we use are energy, efficiency, flux, optical properties, and technical realizability. For each of the techniques, we find that they suffer either from low flux, a low energy cutoff, target materials heating, too high electron beam energy requirement, optical mismatch to angiography, or a combination of these. We conclude that the foreseeable state-of-the-art favors a compact storage ring design (H. Wiedemann et al., these Proceedings (8th Nat.

The Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) was established by Louisiana State University to pioneer development of microfabrication while supporting research in basic science. Maxwell Laboratories designed, built, and successfully commissioned the 1.2 GeV, 400 mA light source for CAMD. Maxwell Laboratories has completed one X-ray lithography beamline at CAMD, and two more are now being manufactured. The completed beamline system, designed for thin resists, delivers photons up to 2 keV. The two beamlines currently under construction deliver photons up to 6 keV for thick (> 50 μm) resists, which play a role in the fabrication of 3-D nanostructures. One of the thick-resist beamlines includes an aspheric mirror that collimates the synchrotron-radiation beam in the horizontal plane while focusing it in the vertical direction - creating a sharp, uniform line image at the workpiece. The other thick-resist beamline has conventional planar optics. Beam position monitors (BPMs) developed for the CAMD beamlines provide a precise vertical profile of the beam by measuring differential photocurrents generated in the BPM probes. Beam power measurements are accomplished with a fixed-aperture calorimeter. Since each calorimeter is precisely calibrated before shipment, its thermal response in the beam is an accurate means to determine beam power for setting lithography exposure times or for computing beamline energy balance. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949156154

With progress in this diagnostic procedure, it is interesting to look for an optimum concept for providing a 33 keV radiation source which would fit into the environment of a hospital. A variety of competing effects and technologies to produce 33 keV radiation are available, but none of these processes provides the combination of sufficient photon flux and monochromaticity except for synchrotron radiation from an electron storage ring.

In systems which can be described in physical terms, there are two possible ways to produce and transport information. The first is the generation of information by changing the internal energy of the system. This kind of information production is the usual one in unanimated nature which utilizes the transformation of one kind of energy into another kind. The information gained in this process is determined by the irreversible energy exchange during this transformation. The second way is related to outer work done on the system without changing its internal energy. This process changes shape and generates form. In physical systems this kind of information production is less important. But for humans who are able to read forms, this kind of information generation, storage and transport is the most important one. It transmits information without transmitting large amounts of energy by presenting contentless pure forms, signs, symbols which are nothing but shapes. For intelligent species as the human race this kind of contentless symbolic information transport by form plays the dominant role. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Two preservation methods, simple hypothermic storage and continuous machine perfusion, both performed at 4°C for 48 h, were studied in male Lewis rats. Pyridoxylated hemoglobin-polyoxyethylene conjugate (PHP) was used as the oncotic oxygen carrier. University of Wisconsin (UW) solution served as a control solution. The test solution (PHP+UW) was a 1:1 mixture of PHP and UW solutions with 4.0g% of hemoglobin. We observed that oxygen consumption during perfusion was significantly higher in the PHP+UW than in the UW group. Hepatic mitochondrial function and tissue adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels were better preserved in the PHP+UW than in the UW group, and were also better preserved in continuous machine perfusion than in simple hypothermic storage. No significant differences were observed in perfusate biochemical parameters.

Because of the hazardous materials inside the waste tanks, all of the work must be done remotely. The purpose of this paper is to show how to reconstruct an enclosed environment from various scans of a Laser Range Finder (LRF). The reconstructed environment can then be used by a robot for path planning, and by an operator to monitor the progress of the waste remediation process. Environment reconstruction consists of two tasks: image processing and laser sculpting. The image processing task focuses first on reducing the quantity of low-confidence data and on smoothing random fluctuations in the data. Then the processed range data must be converted into an XYZ Cartesian coordinate space, a process for which we examined two methods. The first method is a geometrical transform of the LRF data. The second uses an artificial neural network to transform the data to XYZ coordinates. Once an XYZ data set is computed, laser sculpting can be performed. Laser sculpting employs a hierarchical tree structure formally called an octree. The octree structure allows efficient storage of volumetric data and the ability to fuse multiple data sets. Our research has allowed us to examine the difficulties of fusing multiple LRF scans into an octree and to develop algorithms for converting an octree structure into a representation of polygon surfaces. © 1994 SPIE.

The fluid phase distribution and transport of fluid in rocks strongly depend on the rheological conditions. In the lithologically heterogeneous crust changes in rheological regime can produce quite complex sandwich-like fluid transport layering, including domains of upward migration, very impermeable layers, or thin reservoirs with nearly horizontal fluid transport. In the present study two, two-dimensional thermal models of the stable continental crust with different spatial configurations of fluid systems have been calculated. The results show that such systems redistribute heat in the crust and give rise to zones of concentrated heat energy storage and transfer. The pattern of the disturbances to the conductive heat flow depends on the arrangement of the fluid systems (which is a function of the crustal structure, temperature and regional stress field) and shows significant lateral and vertical variations. Even at very low velocities of the fluid percolation (a few millimetres per year) the disturbances to the conductive heat flow may reach 30-60%. © 1994.",,"conduction; continental crust; fluid percolation; heat flow; hydrology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028591484

Both the emission history and assumed future control scenarios for emissions and forest carbon sink are considered. CO2 emissions from the use of the fossil fuels cause most of the radiative forcing due to human activities in Finland. Other important contributors to radiative forcing are N2O emissions from agriculture and transportation as well as CH4 emissions from animal husbandry and waste disposal. Radiative forcing in the year 1990 due to the considered Finnish emissions is estimated to be ∼ 3 mW/m2, which is ∼ 0.15% of global radiative forcing (the population of Finland is ∼ 0.09% of the Earth's population). Radiative forcing due to emissions resulting from human activities in Finland is increasing, and due to the slow change rates in emission producing activities and the slow removal of CO2 and N2O from the atmosphere, it seems unlikely that radiative forcing will be reduced in the next century to below the 1990 level using emission control. A remarkable additional measure in the control of radiative forcing due to activities in Finland might be to increase carbon storage in the forest ecosystem for some decades and to maintain this storage. © 1994.","Control potential; Greenhouse gases; Radiative forcing","control potential; greenhouse gas; radiative forcing; Finland; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen oxide; article; energy transfer; finland; gas; greenhouse effect; pollution control; priority journal; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028159538

The first is the occurrence of cocurrent heat exchange, this case may happen when a process can not be transferred to another process. The second is that time must be considered as a variable. We divide the problem into two cases, namely co-current heat exchange and counter-current one, and then intend to find the rules to satisfy the requirement of each case. For the former, a matching rule and a MILP formulation had been proposed but any method did not obtain the optimal solution. The latter including the time as a variable often occurs in the practical industry. The limitation of time has been reduced by changing the schedule of processing or using the heat storages. However, the systematic rule considering the batch cycle time has not been presented for the rescheduling and heat storage is not usually practical although it is reasonable concept. Therefore this paper presents general method for optimal rescheduling to maximize heat recovery and reduce batch cycle time when heat exchanges occur as counter-current type. In the exchanges of co-current type, the heuristic, called the modified H/H which can be used to find the optimal match sequence of heat exchange between hot and cold tanks, is proposed. The proposed heuristics have the advantages of simple calculation and small computation time. © 1994 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineering.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249165472

Clark are featured by `giant' strains when excited by a magnetic field. Among these materials, terbium-dysprosium-iron alloy, often called Terfenol-D, is the most attractive one because of its high magnetostrain level (typically 1600 ppm). One of the main keys of success in the design of many applications is the control of the largest possible dynamic strain amplitude. For example with appropriate bias and prestress conditions, a dynamic peak-to-peak strain of 2440 ppm has been measured. In order to use this exciting `giant' strain in applications, it is necessary to solve one particular engineering problem: a high magnetic bias has to be applied into Terfenol-D. The chosen method to deal with such a problem consists in studying three actuators, the difference of which concerns their magnetic bias system. The first actuator is biased using a coil. The second actuator is biased using permanent magnets in a parallel configuration. The third actuator is biased using permanent magnets in a series configuration. The aim of this paper is to present the experimental results on the three actuators and to explain the particular behavior of the third actuator. Thanks to their high bias, these Terfenol-D actuators have much more output power capability (a maximum of 2.4 kW of mechanical power) than PZT actuators. These actuators could be used as components in sonar transducers, industrial actuators for machining or sealing, systems for active control of vibration or friction motors. The method used for the analysis of the 3D behavior of the third actuator is modeling taking into account piezomagnetic coupling with the ATILA finite element program. This analysis has permitted to explain why its coupling coefficient is lower than expected. A first reason is that a part of the exciting magnetic energy is stored unusefully in the magnets. A second reason comes from magneto-mechanical conversion. Due to its structure, the actuator works on a combination of the longitudinal mode and the thickness mode. The coupling coefficient of this last mode is smaller than that of the longitudinal mode. As a result of this analysis, one can list a new validation of the ATILA code, numerical values for thickness-modes coefficients and a new method of characterization from device analysis.",,"Computer aided analysis; Finite element method; Iron alloys; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic properties; Magnetic storage; Magnetostriction; Mathematical models; Permanent magnets; Piezoelectricity; Rare earth alloys; Strain; Magnetostrain; Rare earth iron magnetostrictive alloys; Terfenol D; Magnetostrictive devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028464071

A charged wall is unstable, which becomes metastable if a zigzag wall is formed to minimize its energy. When information is stored in thin-film magnetic recording media by means of the application of a recording head field, it induces magnetization reversal of head-on domains. The charged zigzag walls in uniaxial ferromagnetic thin films have been observed in several magnetic media such as Co, Gd-Co, and many others. In this paper we propose and derive an analytic expression based on the Néel tail transition model to deal with the minimum energy surface configuration in the media. We take into account: (1) the surface energy of the wall spine proper; (2) the changes in the crystalline anisotropy and exchange energy in the Néel tail transition region; (3) the self-demagnetization energy in the Néel tail transition region due to the in-plane magnetization rotation; and (4) the long-range magnetostatic interaction energy between magnetic charges on different zigzag wall spine segments. The minimum energy configuration as a function of the wall spine width, the Néel tail transition width and the zigzag angle has been evaluated numerically.

Akinetes of both strains proved to be highly resistant to desiccation, being able to germinate, in the presence of either N2 or nitrate as nitrogen source, with a germination frequency of more than 90% after seven years of storage in a dried state. The first cell division occurred after 8-10 h of incubation, thereafter the germlings of the two strains followed a different pattern of cell differentiation. Heterocysts were first noted, in a terminal position, at 16-18 h in three-celled germlings of C. capsulata and at 21-24 h in C. rippkae, when germlings were at least seven cells in length. Akinetes of both species possessed, on a per cell basis, almost identical amounts of all photosynthetic pigments but, under nitrogen fixing conditions, photosynthetic activity (oxygen evolution) was detected only after new proteins had been synthesized, before a functional heterocyst was developed and while total nitrogen remained constant. With energy provided by aerobic respiration, a wide range of intracellular amino acids characteristic of proteins was utilised to sustain the new protein synthesis. The end of this biosynthetic activity coincided with the timing of the first cell division. From this stage on, no changes in protein concentration occurred until mature heterocysts were developed. In the presence of nitrate, no significant changes in the major germination events were observed. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Akinete; Akinete germination; Cell differentiation; Cyanobacteria; Cyanospira; Extreme environments; Heterocyst","aerobic metabolism; article; cell differentiation; cell division; cyanobacterium; desiccation; energy resource; germination; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028124488

These have shown potential as a diet alternative suitable for supplementing algae as sources of essential fatty acids and other lipids in the culture of marine suspension-feeders such as oysters. The preparation technique is fast, not labour intensive and uses inexpensive raw materials. The method is by sonication of a mixture of fish oil, soy lecithin, vegetable oil and vitamin E in the ratio 50:20:29:1 (w/w/w/w). Fish oil was also successfully replaced with a concentrate of n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, thereby increasing the amount of the essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA). The microspheres have a log-normal particle size distribution of approximately 1 to 20 μm, which is in the range accepted by adult bivalves. With minor modifications, the size of the particles could be adjusted to match the food of other developmental stages of bivalves. Actual analysis for lipid class composition revealed that more than 75% (w/w) of the mass was energy-rich fish oil triacylglycerides or ethyl esters of essential fatty acids with a polyunsaturated fatty acid content of up to 64% (w/w). Microspheres were stable in recirculating seawater with temperatures of up to 21°C. The oxidation stability of stock emulsions was assessed over a storage period of 8 days and oxidation products measured as anisidine values did not increase. Bacterial growth was also not a problem over 8 days of storage. The water quality of a recirculating system was not degraded by the microspheres. Particle concentrations were in the range of 1.8-1.9×108 ml-1 for stock emulsions, which could be diluted to any desired dispersion in the culture media. To test the ingestion and digestion processes under laboratory conditions, fluorescent beads were encapsulated into the microspheres and fed to adult oysters together with algal cultures. Oysters were able to ingest and digest the microspheres in a concentration of 50% of the total particles supplied as an algal-microsphere mixed diet. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001134180

The experiment has been simulated using the most recent version of the FLUKA code which includes a very accurate treatment of bremsstrahlung. In spite of the considerable uncertainties on the experimental value of the pressure, it has been found that the computed results are in satisfactory agreement with the results of the measurements.

The structures, sizes, and charges of the silver clusters are sensitive to the conditions of synthesis and to the structures of the zeolite hosts. The sodalite cages in zeolite A have near Oh symmetry which favors the formation of hexasilver clusters in completely Ag+-exchanged zeolite A. Generally, these hexasilver clusters are stabilized by coordination to silver cations at 6-ring centers. The mechanism for silver reduction is attributed to the self oxidation of framework oxygen (decomposition of the Ag2O component of the zeolite composition). Reduction by hydrogen leads first to cluster formation and then to the aggregation of silver atoms on the external surface of zeolites. In partially Ag+-exchanged zeolite A, trisilver or tetrasilver clusters can form in sodalite cavities. At very low silver content, weakly bound Ag0 is found. In reduced faujasites, a linear trisilver cluster, extending from a sodalite cavity through a D6R to another sodalite cavity, is the most favored species. The silvers at the centers of D6R's are the first to be reduced in vacuum dehydration. Near octahedral, nearly closest-packed hexasilver clusters might be present in the sodalite cavities. More intense reduction causes larger silver clusters to form. The largest possible silver cluster in the sodalite cavity of faujasite is projected to be a distorted cube coordinated to eight Ag+ ions: four in D6R's, and four in surrounding large cavities. X-ray diffraction, ESR, far-IR, MAS-NMR, reflectance-transmittance spectroscopy, and quantum calculation have all proven to be very powerful methods for research into cluster formation in zeolites. EXAFS is able to provide information about local short-range interactions. Yet inconsistencies, often difficult to resolve, and probably based largely on variations in samples and in sample preparation procedures, remain. Silver clusters are very light sensitive. They may find use as photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, as is being tried in Calzaferri's group, and as optical materials according to Ozin's proposals. The synthesis of hexasilver in 83 % of the large cavities of zeolite A suggests that full occupancy is within reach. Zeolites containing clusters are very hopeful candidates for new information storage or optical materials. Future research on the formation and structure of silver clusters in zeolites should focus on the hydrated forms of silver zeolite because this may lead to direct information on water splitting or chlorine evolution from sea water.

Bacteria-phytoplankton interactions are suggested to influence phytoplankton aggregation and its timing. It is also hypothesized that, within aggregates, hydrolytic ectoenzyme activity, together with condensation reactions between the hydrolysis products, produce molecular species which are not readily degraded by pelagic bacteria. Accumulation of a reservoir of such slow-to-degrade dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is proposed to be a carbon flux and energy buffer, which moderates the response of bacteria to the dramatic variations in primary production in the Arabian Sea. Use of the slow-to-degrade DOC pool during the intermonsoon could temporarily render the Arabian Sea net-heterotrophic and a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Stored DOC is also suggested to balance the observed deficit between mesopelagic carbon demand and the sinking particulate organic carbon supply. Knowledge of the significance of bacteria in carbon storage and cycling in the Arabian Sea is needed to understand the response of the ocean's biogeochemical state to strong physical forcing and climate change. © 1994 Indian Academy of Sciences.","aggregation; Bacteria; dissolved organic carbon; ectoenzymes; particulate organic carbon; sinking flux","bacteria; nutrient cycling; organic carbon; particulate flux; Arabian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028604717

The intensity of the produced positrons is to exceed that of any other existing source by orders of magnitude. The instantaneous intensity is to be 103 to 106 times higher yet. Fast positrons are to be produced in pulses of time duration ≈ 1 ns to 10 ps. Slow positron pulses of order ≲ 100 ps are expected. The phase space density of positrons at production will be in excess of what can be achieved by other methods. The IPS is to consist of 1) an undulator (usually a micropole undulator, i.e. an undulator with submillimeter period) in which gamma rays in the MeV range will be generated by electron beams circulating in a storage ring; 2) a heavy metal target, in which e+ e- pairs will be produced by the generated gamma rays; 3) moderators to thermalize the produced positrons; and 4) a transport system through which the slow positrons will move. Spinoff benefits provided by the suggested device include the following: The equipment may be used to create (or destroy) nuclear isotopes in a controlled manner (i.e. without producing unwanted species); to produce (or destroy) in a controlled way chemical elements; to produce well collimated intense photon beams in the multi 100 MeV range for nuclear physics research, with intensities many orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved today; to generate intense bursts of neutrons; to supply fast positrons produced at high intensities (1016 to 1017 s-1) and within a small transverse phase space, to future high energy colliders, thereby perhaps even eliminating the need for damping rings. © 1994.",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Electron beams; Gamma rays; Linear accelerators; Magnetostatics; Photons; Storage rings; Targets; Thermodynamic stability; Electron positron pair production; Intense Positron Source; Micropoles; Undulators; Elementary particle sources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028452668

Temperature and time strongly act on polymers properties owing to their viscoelastic nature. Knowledge of the dynamic moduli and properties of polymeric materials is indispensable for the design of this materials. At the same time, the influence of the temperature on polymers behaviour may be studied once the activation energy is known. In this paper the different dynamic moduli and activation energy are measured using a Perkin Elmer DMA 7. The relationships between the dynamic mechanical properties and the molecular weight of the polymers make possible the calculation of the molecular weight.

A large part of the thermal dissipation was variable. The yield of this variable thermal emission depended on the redox state of the Photosystem. It increased with the measuring modulated light intensity coinciding with the gradual closure of the reaction centers. Thermal deactivation was maximal when the reaction centers were closed by a saturating illumination. Extrapolation of the data at zero light intensity indicated that the yield of non-variable thermal emission represented about 37% of the maximal emission. The presence of methylviologen as artificial electron acceptor decreased the yield of variable thermal emission whereas inhibition following heat stress treatments increased it. The significance of the variable and non-variable components of thermal dissipation is discussed and the measured energy storage is suggested to originate from the reduction of the plastoquinone pool during cyclic electron transport around Photosystem I. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","electron transport; photoacoustie spectroscopy; Photosystem I; plastoquinone; thermal dissipation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028041799

The proposed systems are constituted of two donors (D) and acceptor (A), or one donor and two acceptors, juxtaposed in DAD or ADA architectures. Our proposals take advantage of the possibility of donor-acceptor complexes to exhibit either complete or partial charge transfer. The first system we propose has an essentially neutral ground state. However, the potential energy surface (PES) presents two degenerated minima associated with a partial charge transfer between the donor and one of the two acceptor molecules (Aδ-Dδ+1 A and ADδ+ Aδ-). Systems presenting a complete charge transfer give rise to two stable, weakly coupled, and degenerate ionic electronic states, A- A+ A and AD+ A- for an ADA architecture and D+ A -D and DA -D+ for a DAD In these cases, the two forms differ by both their intramolecular geometries and the relative positions of their constituents. It seems rather difficult to conceive such bistable molecular systems using closed-shell molecules, while a donor radical and a closed-shell acceptor or an acceptor radical and closed-shell donor can generate very stable ionic states. It is assumed that the relative positions of the donor and acceptor molecules can be fixed using chemical bridges constituted of rigid or flexible ligands. The writing and reading processes are discussed for each system as well as the information stability when a large number of bits are juxtaposed on a surface. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344485291

For example, the modulus of elasticity of the NITINOL tubes increases about threefold as the alloy undergoes its martensitic phase transformation. Deflection of the tube off the unbuckled shape, due to high internal flow velocities and elastic instabilities, triggers an active control system which activates the shape memory effect to increase the flexural rigidity of the tubes and bring them back to their original undeflected shape. A mathematical model is developed to describe the fundamentals governing the operation of this class of actively controlled NITINOL tubes while conveying fluids. The model describes the interaction between the fluid flow, the elastic behavior of the tubes and the thermal activation of the shape memory effect. The predictions of the model are validated experimentally using a 0.58 m long NITINOL-55 tube that has outer diameter of 2.134 mm and inner diameter of 1.778 mm. The effect of varying the activation strategy of the shape memory effect on the critical flow velocity, at which flow-induced instabilities occur, is determined theoretically and experimentally. It is shown that the shape memory controller can significantly increase these critical flow velocities as it stiffens the tubes by virtue of the strain energy imparted by the shape recovery process. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated also by its speed of response as it brings the unstable tubes back to their undeflected shape while conveying fluids at velocities equal to their uncontrolled critical velocities. Close agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The results presented suggest the potential of the shape memory controller as a viable means for enhancing the elastic stability of tubes conveying fluids. © 1994 SPIE.

For this study, samples were synthesized over a wider range of ion concentrations as well as more frequent intervals than in the previous studies. Deconvolutions were performed on the loss tangent data. The glassy moduli of the ionomers were found to be independent of the ion content. There were discontinuities in the plots of the slopes of the storage moduli, peak heights, peak positions, and widths at the half-height of the loss tangent peaks as well as of the activation energies for the glass transitions as a function of ion content. These discontinuities suggest that two morphological changes are involved in the present ionomer system. The first, at 4–6 mol % of ions, involves the formation of a dominant or a continuous phase of the ion-rich or cluster regions and is interpreted as being associated with the percolation threshold (see below). The second, at ~12–14 mol % of ions, possibly involves the disappearance of continuity of the unclustered “phase”; between 4 and 12 mol %, two cocontinuous “phases” are probably encountered. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms for the ionomers between 8 and 14 mol % of ions show two glass transition temperatures (Tg). A linear relation is observed between these two Tgs and the positions of the E″ peaks at 0.3 Hz obtained from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) measurements. In terms of filler concepts, the Guth equation is applicable in the range of low volume fractions of clusters (&lt;0.3), but a minor modification extends the applicability to 0.45. Application of the Halpin-Tsai equation for regular systems to the present ionomer at low ion content suggests that the system consists of more or less spherical (at opposed to linear or lamellar) clusters dispersed in the matrix phase as filler particles. The mechanical properties of ionomers were also interpreted in terms of percolation concepts. At the percolation threshold, i.e., at ∼5 mol % of ions, the critical exponent and the critical volume fraction of clusters were found to be 1.31 and 0.64, respectively. The value of the critical exponent is in the range of “universal” values for conductivity percolation, but the critical volume fraction is much higher than those for most other systems. This is explained in terms of the difference between the nonuniformity of properties of the clusters of the present system and the uniformity of properties in usual percolating species. Finally, a novel approach is used to estimate the size of a sodium carboxylate ion pair, which is found to be 45 × 10−3 nm3. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The results are supportive of previous work that indicated that endothermic dehydration and melting of the nitrates take place prior to the occurrence of exothermic reactions, which begin about 300 °C. The DXRD resultsshow that a major reaction set at these temperatures is the occurrence of a series reaction which produces sodium cyanate, NaCNO, as an intermediate in a mildly exothermic first step. In the presence of gaseous oxygen, NaCNO subsequently reacts exothermally andat a faster rate to form metal oxides. Measurements of the rate of this reaction are used to estimate the heat release, and comparisons of this with heat-transfer rates from a hypothetical “hot spot” show that, even in a worse case scenario, the heat-transfer rates are approximately eight times higher than the rate of energy releasefrom the exothermic reactions. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

It is frequently desired to select from these conformers a smaller, representative sample for subsequent modeling studies or storage in a structural database. An obvious approach to this problem is to generate all conformations and then use cluster analysis to divide the structures into families from which the representative sample can be derived. Both the conformational search and the cluster analysis can be computationally demanding. Here we describe an alternative yet equivalent approach which can directly generate a molecule's “most different” conformations. The method combines the improved leader cluster algorithm and the A search method. In this direct clustering search, the lowest energy conformation is first determined using the A algorithm, as we have described before (Leach, A. R.; Prout, K. J. Comput. Chem. 1990,11,1193–1205). The second conformation to be generated is the one which is “most different” from this structure. Subsequent structures span the conformational space in accordance with the improved leader clustering method. We also describe a variant on this algorithm that can directly identify the two conformations corresponding to the maximum and minimum distances between a specific pair of atoms. Such an algorithm has potential applications in the derivation of distance screens for searching “three-dimensional” databases. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Rising vacuolar chloride concentrations induced increases in the levels of nitrate, acetate and phosphate inward currents. These currents, evoked at physiological vacuolar potentials, showed a linear relationship with the concentration of vacuolar chloride between 6 and 100 m m. Single channel currents revealed that rises in vacuolar chloride increased the frequency and probability of channel openings at a given tonoplast potential by reducing the mean closed time of the anion channel. In addition, there was an increase in the gating charge for the channel and a decrease in the free-energy favoring the transition of the channel from the closed to the open state. Vacuolar chloride had a very different effect on malate currents. Increasing chloride concentrations resulted in decreased frequency and open probability of the channel openings, a decrease in the gating charge and an increase in the mean closed time of the channel. Our results support the role for vacuolar chloride concentrations regulating the influx of anions into the vacuole, in addition to osmoregulation. The activation of channel activity by chloride will provide a pathway for the storage of nutrients, such as nitrate and phosphate into the vacuole, while the reduction of the malate currents will allow the use of malate for mitochondrial oxidation and cytoplasmic pH control. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Anion channels; Beet vacuoles; Chloride regulation; Inward currents; Patch clamp; Tonoplast","anion channel; chloride; article; cell vacuole; nonhuman; patch clamp; plant; tonoplast; Cell Membrane; Cells, Cultured; Chloride Channels; Chlorides; Ion Channel Gating; Ion Channels; Ion Pumps; Ion Transport; Malates; Membrane Potentials; Nitrates; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vacuoles; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028291672

All reliability data to date has used capacitors focusing on fundamental materials behavior and not on product performance. This paper will discuss the reliability of the FM1608S 64K and FM1208S 4K FRAM memories. In particular, fatigue performance out to 10″ readwrite cycles and retention performance out to 10 years will be presented. Short and long term retention behavior has been studied on product that has received over 10” readlwrite fatigue cycles. Short term retention is defined as the ability of the circuit to maintain a data state with no power applied for one second at 80°C. This test ensures the ferroelectric capacitor structure is storing the charge and not being influenced by the underlying CMOS refresh characteristics of the 2T/2C dynamic RAM cell design. Long term retention is defined as the ability of the circuit to maintain a data state with no power applied after having been stored at an elevated temperature (100°C to 150°C) for more than 1.ooO hours. This will be shown to translate into use conditions well in excess of 10 years. The effect of voltage and temperature on fatigue readwrite cycles has also been characterized and will be presented. Elevated temperature bakes were developed to remove defect populations from production 4K and 64K material. Subsequently, detailed activation energy experiments were done at tempcratures ranging from 80°C to 200°C for more than 2.000 hours. An Arrhenius model was fit to the screened population.

In the future attention should be focused on nuclear-power centers patterned after the Industrial Association ""Mayak"" (RT-1 plant, Complex 300, BN-800) with reliable nonproliferation of weapons plutonium.

In our approach we used homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells from strain 129/Sv. Using targeting constructs based on strain 129/Sv isogenic DNA we managed to ablate the essential exons of the B-CK and M-CK genes at reasonably high frequencies. ES clones with fully disrupted B-CK and two types of M-CK gene mutations, a null (M-CK-) and leaky (M-CK1) mutation, were used to generate chimaeric mutant mice via injection in strain C57BL/6 derived blastocysts. Chimaeras with the B-CK null mutation have no overt abnormalities but failed to transmit the mutation to their offspring. For the M-CK- and M-CK1 mutations successful transmission was achieved and heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice were bred. Animals deficient in MM-CK are phenotypically normal but lack muscular burst activity. Fluxes through the CK reaction in skeletal muscle are highly impaired and fast fibres show adaptation in cellular architecture and storage of glycogen.

Application of pressure up to 2.4 kbar caused dissociation of vicilin subunits, as revealed by (1) size-exclusion FPLC of pressurized samples, (2) fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a dansyl-vicilin conjugate under pressure, and (3) quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of vicilin. Pressure dissociation data were well described by a model for dissociation of a trimer. This enabled calculation of the standard molar volume change of association (ΔV°) and the equilibrium dissociation constant at atmospheric pressure (Ko); at pH 10 these were found to be ΔV° = 146 mL/mol and Ko = 2.2 × 10−15 M2, respectively, corresponding to C1/2 (the concentration of protein at 50% dissociation at atmospheric pressure) = 18 nM and a stabilization free energy of −19.6 kcal/mol for the oligomer. Vicilin exhibited an anomalously low dependence on protein concentration for pressure dissociation. This appeared related to conformational changes in the dissociated subunits, which caused a loss of ca. 5 kcal/mol in the free energy of association and to structural/energetic heterogeneity in the population of oligomers. Pressure dissociation was markedly pH-dependent, with a stabilization free energy loss of 3.4 kcal/mol upon raising pH from 9 to 10. Circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence lifetime measurements at atmospheric pressure showed that the structure of vicilin was largely unaffected by pH in the range investigated. These results suggest that the effect of pH may involve deprotonation of lysine residues participating in salt bridges between vicilin subunits. Pressure dissociation of vicilin was significantly inhibited by addition of salts (NaCl, KCl, LiCl) or glycerol. Dissociation curves obtained in the presence of salts enabled calculation of the free energies of stabilization (ranging from ca. −1.2 to −2.4 kcal/mol) of the vicilin oligomers by these cosolvents. The similar effects of salts or glycerol suggest a common mechanism of stabilization of the oligomer involving exclusion of the cosolvents from the protein interface and preferential hydration of the protein. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

(1991) Photosynth Res 29: 87-96), where modulated photothermal radiometry (PTR) was used to measure energy storage (ES) in intact leaves as a function of P700 redox state, we report here on simultaneous ES and fluorescence measurements, which characterize the state of PS II. PTR monitors the conversion of modulated light into heat by measuring the modulated infra-red radiation emitted from the sample. The ratio [PTR+-PTR-]/PTR+, where PTR indicates the PTR signal and the subscripts +,- indicate the presence or absence of saturating background light, is used to quantitate ES. We searched carefully for the right conditions where the background light does not introduce a significant rise in the leaf temperature, which influences the PTR signal as such, otherwise the above ratio deviates from the true ES. Under such conditions, ES and the fluorescence parameters, F (momentary fluorescence level) Fm′ (fluorescence of fully reduced PS II reaction centers) were measured during the induction phase of photosynthesis and in the steady state. ES and the parameter γ=(Fm′-F)/Fm′, considered by Genty et al. ((1989) Biochim Biophys Acta 990: 87-92) to reflect the yield of PS II, had similar kinetics during the induction phase. Both reached a final maximum plateau after about 4-5 min. of illumination. In different experiments, where the measuring light intensities varied, γ was approximately linearly related to ES. This linear relationship was found in the same way also in steady-state measurements, where these parameters varied by using different background light intensities. Extrapolation to an ES value of zero indicates a finite non-zero value of γ. A possible explanation for this may be found in the existence an electron transport cycle around PS II which does not store energy in the range corresponding to the modulation frequency used (ca. 3.6 Hz). © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","infra-red; quantum yield of PS II; temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028010691

These laser drivers must be capable of delivering ultra-violet (UV) optical pulses having energies of the order of 5 MJ to cryogenic deuterium-tritium (D/T) ICF targets. The current requirements for laser ICF target irradiation specify the laser wavelength, λ ∼ 250 nm, pulse duration, τp ∼ 6 ns, bandwidth, Δλ ∼ 0.1 nm, polarization state, etc. Excimer lasers are a leading candidate to fill these demanding ICF driver requirements. However, since excimer lasers are not storage lasers, the excimer laser pulse duration, τpp, is determined primarily by the length of the excitation pulse delivered to the excimer laser amplifier. Pulsed power associated with efficiently generating excimer laser pulses has a time constant, τpp, which falls in the range, 30 τp &lt; τpp &lt; 100 τp. As a consequence, pulse compression is needed to convert the long excimer laser pulses to pulses of duration τp. These main ICF driver pulses require, in addition, longer, lower power precursor pulses delivered to the ICF target before the arrival of the main pulse. Although both linear and non-linear optical (NLO) pulse compression techniques have been developed, computer simulations have shown that a ""chirped,"" self-seeded, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pulse compressor cell using SF6 at a density, ρ ∼ 1 amagat can efficiently compress krypton fluoride (KrF) laser pulses at λ = 248 nm. In order to avoid the generation of output pulses substantially shorter than τp, the optical power in the chirped input SBS ""seed"" beams was ramped. Compressed pulse conversion efficiences of up to 68% were calculated for output pulse durations of τp ∼ 6 ns. Techniques for generating a variety of temporally complex output pulse shapes are discussed. © 1994 SPIE.

The volume changes occurring in a thin layer of photosynthetic suspension during the first microsecond following a monochromatic laser flash (3 ns duration) are detected by a piezoelectric ceramic. These volume changes result from two components of opposite signs: (1) thermal expansion due to the release of heat in the medium, and (2) contraction occurring in the neighbourhood of the charged photoproducts. The expansion signal measures the thermal losses in the light-conversion process. Under weak flash excitation, the difference between the amounts of heat released by an active and an inactive sample measures the energy stored by the photoreactions. As the contraction signal is also linearly related to the number of flash-induced charge separations, the overall volume change, when compared between the active and inactive states of the sample, gives a relative measure of the quantum yield. In the spectral range investigated (630-705 nm), the quantum yield is practically independent of wavelength in purified PS I and in PS II (BBY) particles. In spinach chloroplasts, a depression of the quantum yield in the absorption region of LHC II suggests that a significant fraction of the light quanta absorbed by LHC II are not transferred to open reaction centres. In intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with closed PS II reaction centres, the quantum yield spectrum of the PS I centres was compared in state I and state II. Upon transition from state I to state II, a large proportion of the quanta absorbed by the PS II antenna was found to be transferred towards PS I reaction centres. When measured at two different temperatures, the overall volume change can be deconvoluted in its two components (expansion and contraction), and the absolute value of energy storage calculated. In purified PS I and in PS II (BBY) particles, this value was found close to 1 eV per absorbed quantum, which is approximately the energy required for the formation of the radical pairs P700+(FA,FB)- and Z+Q- A. © 1994.","Excitation transfer; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Quantum efficiency; State transition","acoustics; article; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phototrophic bacterium; priority journal; spectroscopy; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Photobacteria; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028231471

In 1990, the rights to a technology that originated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was licensed by a small, U.S. based, technology development company. This technology provides a method for nucleating the crystallization of undercooled liquid materials and is applied to solid/liquid phase change materials used for thermal energy storage. The undercooling tendency of some phase change materials permits long term storage of the latent heat of transition; a characteristic that can be put to practical use in many ways. The nucleating method discovered principally by Mr. David K. Benson at NR.EL enables reliable, repeatable, on.demand release of the stored heat. Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc., obtained the exclusive licensing rights to the technology after identifying a number of commercial applications which could be developed using this invention. An internally funded effort to prove feasibility led to two product-oriented, Government funded projects. Funded by the U.S. Army, the first project is the development of a portable, non-powered food wanning device for serving meals to soldiers in the field. The second project is being funded by the National Institutes of Health for development of a heat therapy device for relief from rheumatoid arthritis discomfort in the hands and other affected joints. Both of these heating devices are portable, reusable heat pack products that can be regenerated in a microwave oven or in boiling water. The knowledge developed during these two projects will be applied to many other related products. Applications in support of natural and manmade disaster relief include food warming heat packs for food service to victims and rescue workers in sustained blackout conditions, and heat pack wanning blankets for emergency medical situations in which patients are in traumatic shock and the onset of hypothermia is imminent. © 1993 SPIE.",,"Disaster prevention; Diseases; Emergency services; Heat storage; Commercial applications; Disaster relief operations; Government laboratories; National Institutes of Health; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Natural and man-made disasters; Technology assessments; Technology development; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076471611

This technique can be formalized in a very general way and can be also deduced by meta-mathernatical arguments. A further development of the same technique can be applied at level of learning procedure to introduce in such a way the complete notion of ""dynamic perceptron"". From the experimental standpoint, we show two applications of the ""dynamic perceptron"" in particle track recognition in high-energy accelerators. Firstly, we show the amazing improvement of performances that can be obtained in a perceptron architecture with classical learning by adding our ""dynamic"" pre-processing technique, already introduced last year in another paper presented at this Conference. Secondly, we show the first results of this technique extended also at the level of learning procedure always applied to the problem of particle track recognition.

A promising formulation approach for the strongly hydrophobic ZnPc is to embed the molecule in liposomes. CGP 55847 is such a liposomal ZnPc formulation. As liposome suspensions are not thermodynamically stable, they have to be lyophilised for storage. It is of prime importance to know the stability of the liposomes with respect to the lyophilisation process as well as the residence time of the drug in the liposomes. In order to determine these parameters, a liposome population labelled with a fluorescent marker was mixed with the drug-carrying liposomes. If the distance between the marker molecule and the drug is sufficiently small, the marker transfers its electronic excitation energy to the drug (energy transfer). We found that the extent of energy transfer increased with time when the two populations were mixed. From this data, we could conclude that approximately one quarter of the drug molecules was only loosely bound to the liposomes and exchanged between them with a relaxation time of about 15 min. Energy transfer measurements before and after the lyophilisation process revealed that the liposomes were stable when suspended in a 10% lactose solution, i.e. no fusion of liposomes took place. In aqueous solution, however, lyophilisation induced fusion of liposomes to a small extent with a concomitant increase in size. © 1994 SPIE.

Precise measurements of the spot motions from Debrecen and Tokyo white-light pictures are used to understand the fragmentation of the main sunspot group with time. This fragmentation leads to a continuous restructuring of the magnetic field pattern while rapid changes are evidenced due to fast new flux emergence (magnetograms of MFSC, Huairou). The first process leads to a shearing of the field lines along which there is energy storage; the second one is the trigger which causes the release of energy by creating a complex topology.

Thiamine is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and the generation of energy. Depending on age and calorie intake, 1-1.5mg/day are required with a 50% increase during pregnancy and lactation. Fever and increased muscular activity will also increase thiamine requirements (storage in muscles is limited, and reserves are quickly depleted). The sources of thiamine are meat, the outer layer of cereal grains and pulses, nuts, and leafy vegetables. The vitamin is lost during milling and processing and during excessive cooking. Beri-beri takes 2 forms: wet beri-beri which has a high output biventricular failure with edema associated with profound peripheral vasodilation and tachycardia (this also occurs in an acute fulminating form known as shoshin beri-beri) and dry beri-beri with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy with taxia, weakness, paraesthesia, and patchy sensory loss with areflexia. In this form, foot and/or wrist drop may occur. Thiamine deficiency can also produce Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis characterized by vomiting, horizontal nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, memory loss, and confabulation. Wet beri-beri is a medical emergency treated by intravenous administration of thiamine for several days. 38 patients (27 men and 11 women) were identified with beri-beri in urban Banjul in the Gambia. 14 had wet beri-beri, 11 a mixed presentation, and 13 dry beri-beri. Most of the patients were disabled for many months. Risk factors were pregnancy, alcohol consumption, fever, exercise, diabetes, and dysentery. 4 of the patients died (2 were in the last trimester of pregnancy). The staple diet in urban areas of the Gambia is imported, polished white rice in a groundnut- or oil-based sauce with fish and vegetables such as peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Meat is too expensive for the urban poor, and fruit and vegetable consumption is highly seasonal and income-dependent. There is little chance that this diet will be changed for the 46% of the population who live in urban areas.

The scheduling method develops optimal daily hydro schedules, processing `Optimization of daily hydro schedule on certain conditions', `Evaluation through a Simulation', and `Revision of the conditions for the optimization based on the result of the simulation', repeatedly. In the optimization, the water stored in each storage is assigned repeatedly to the most valuable combination of time, outflow route, and generation level to develop the schedule. Next, the schedule is simulated and then evaluated. If the plan violates the operational constraints, the values of the combinations mentioned above are compensated by the reduced gradient of the objective function and the rules obtained from the well-experienced operators, and the optimization is done again under the new conditions. This approach requires fewer rules than the fully knowledge-based ones, and brings not only less cost and less duration to develop the scheduling system but also better hydro schedules.",,"Constraint theory; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Hydroelectric power plants; Optimization; Scheduling; Daily hydro scheduling system; Expertise; Kansai Electric Power; Multichain hydro power system; Problem space search; Control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028387301

They had access to feed from 05.15 to 09.00 and from 13.00 to 16.30 and were milked at 06.15 and 15.30. The milk was analysed for urea with a FIA technique. There was a significant diurnal variation in milk urea. The highest values were found 3–5 h after the beginning of the morning feeding and the lowest values (down to 60% of the max. values) during late night. Within 1 h after the start of the morning feeding the urea values had increased significantly, but they had decreased within the same time after the start of the afternoon feeding. Since there was a pronounced diurnal variation in the milk fat content, the urea concentration was also recalculated to concentration in the water phase of the milk. It was higher in that phase, but the pattern of the diurnal variation was not changed significantly. However, analyses on milk with a very high fat content may give misleading results. There were no important differences in the milk urea concentration of different udder quarters. When calculated as concentration in the water phase of the milk, no differences in urea concentration were found between the beginning and the end of milking. The analytical method had a good precision (coefficient of variation max. 3%). The milk urea concentration was not changed significantly after storage during 10 days at 4°C when no preservative was added; but after 17 days the milk had turned sour and the urea value had increased. When a preservative (bronopole) was added the urea concentration remained unchanged during 17 days. Deepfreezing did not influence the urea concentration. © 1994, The Author(s).","dairy cows; FIA-technique; milk components; milk profile test; milk urea","antiinfective agent; bronopol; lipid; preservative; propanediol derivative; urea; animal; article; cattle; chemistry; circadian rhythm; cryopreservation; drug effect; female; food preservation; lactation; milk; rabbit; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Cattle; Circadian Rhythm; Cryopreservation; Female; Food Preservation; Lactation; Lipids; Milk; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical; Propylene Glycols; Rabbits; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028190168

The reasons for this are not understood. This paper focuses on time and energy constraints while foraging to illustrate the relationship between efficiency and rate-maximizing strategies and develops models that provide a simple framework to analyze foraging strategies in two distinct foraging contexts. We assume that while capturing and ingesting food for their own use (which we term feeding), foragers behave so as to maximize the total net daily energetic gain. When gathering food for others or for storage (which we term provisioning), we assume that foragers behave so as to maximize the total daily delivery, subject to meeting their own energetic requirements. In feeding contexts, the behavior maximizing total net daily gain also maximizes efficiency when daily intake is limited by the assimilation capacity. In contrast, when time available to forage sets the limit to gross intake, the behavior maximizing total net daily gain also maximizes rate. In provisioning contexts, when daily delivery is constrained by the energy needed to power self-feeding, maximizing efficiency ensures the highest total daily delivery. When time needed to recoup energetic expenditure limits total delivery, a low self-feeding rate relative to the rate of energy expenditure favors efficient strategies. However, as the rate of self-feeding increases, foraging behavior deviates from efficiency maximization in the direction predicted by rate maximization. Experimental manipulations of the rate of self-feeding in provisioning contexts could be a powerful tool to explore the relationship between rate and efficiency-maximizing behavior. © 1994 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.","Efficiency; Energy gain; Foraging strategies; Provisioning","energetics; feeding; optimal foraging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028178668

Forty kidney allografts were studied using University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (n=20), Euro-Collins (EC) solution (n=12), and modified EC solution with mannitol (M;n=8). No significant differences were found between the three solutions studied with regard to ATP, ADP, or AMP changes. The mean ATP level (nmol/mg prot±SEM) at the end of preservation in the UW group was 2.7±0.3 nmol/mg, in the EC group 3.8±0.7 nmol/mg, and in the M group 2.3±0.4 nmol/mg. ATP 30 min after reperfusion in the UW, EC, and M groups was 5.7±0.8 nmol/mg, 6.4±1.0 nmol/mg, and 4.6±0.5 nmol/mg, respectively. However, an important difference appeared in the catabolic products determined. Kidneys perfused with UW solution had a significantly higher level of adenosine (2.6±0.6 nmol/mg), inosine (11.8±2.2 nmol/mg), and hypoxanthine (18.1±2.1 nmol/mg) at hypoxanthine of cold storage than those perfused with EC (0.4±0.1 nmol/mg, 2.0±0.8 nmol/mg, and 7.1±1.4 nmol/mg) and M solutions (0.2±0.05 nmol/mg, 0.5±0.1 nmol/mg, and 5.2±0.6 nmol/mg; P<0.05). These levels returned to initial values 30 min postreperfusion and there were no differences with the EC or M solution groups at that time. Thus, the adenosine present in UW solution does not appear to be useful in recovering the adenine nucleotide pool at reperfusion. Moreover, it produces a marked increase in degradation products.

The in-vivo cyclic pathway was characterized by investigating the effects of various chemicals on energy storage. Participation of plastoquinone and ferredoxin in the cyclic electron flow was confirmed by the complete suppression of energy storage in the presence of the plastoquinol antagonist 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) and the ferredoxin inhibitors/competitors methylviologen, phenylmercuric acetate and p-benzoquinone. Two alternative electron cycles are demonstrated to operate in vivo. One cycle is sensitive to antimycin A, myxothiazol and 2-(n-heptyl)-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) and is catalyzed by ferredoxin which reduces plastoquinone through a route involving cytochrome b6 and its protonmotive Q-cycle. The other cycle is unaffected by the above-mentioned inhibitors but is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an inhibitor of the ferredoxin-NADP reductase, and 2′-monophosphoadenosine-5′-diphosphoribose (PADR), an analogue of NADP, showing that the electron recycling was mediated by NADPH. Possibly, electrons enter the plastoquinone pool through the action of a NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, which is insensitive to classical inhibitors of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. Loss of energy storage by photosystem-I-driven cyclic electron transfer in farred light was observed only when antimycin A, myxothiazol or HQNO was used in combination with NEM or PADR. Analysis of the light-intensity dependence and the rate of in-vivo cyclic electron transfer in the presence of various inhibitors indicates that the NADPH-dependent electron-cycle is the preferential cyclic pathway in Chlamydomonas cells illuminated with far-red light. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Chlamydomonas; Cyclic electron transport; Photoacoustics; Photosystem I",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028110631

ATP and PCr levels were measured by fluorimetric analysis in freeze-clamped biopsies of soleus, extensor digitorum longus, and gastrocnemius muscles of the rat after storage in a freezer at -70°C as (i) intact wet muscle, (ii) freeze-dried muscle, and (iii) an extract of freeze-dried muscle. Assays were performed within 24 h of taking the biopsy and after variable periods of storage from 1 to 4 weeks. The data for the gastrocnemius muscles were compared with those obtained, in the same rat, by in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy. In the biopsies, the ATP levels were stable irrespective of the duration or method of storage. The PCr levels fell by 13-16% compared with the values obtained from the assay done within 24 h of taking the biopsy, irrespective of the method of storage, but could be corrected in the freeze-dried stored muscle by expressing the data in relation to the total creatine levels. The fluorimetrically measured PCr, in whole muscle extracts of the gastrocnemius, assayed within 24 h, were comparable to those obtained from 31P NMR spectroscopy.

A., Baker, G. M., and Dilley, R. A. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 764, 160-169), which comprises about 50% of the total thylakoid protein. The concept we have in mind is that several membrane proteins cooperate to shield a localized proton diffusion pathway from direct contact with the lumen, thus providing a physical barrier to H+ equilibration between the sequestered domains and the lumen. A barely mutant, chlorina f2, that lacks Chl b and does not accumulate some of the LHCII proteins, was tested for its capacity to carry out localized-proton gradient-dependent ATP formation. Two previously developed assays permit clear discrimination between localized and delocalized {Mathematical expression} gradient-driven ATP formation. Those assays include the effect of a permeable buffer, pyridine, on the number of single-turnover flashes needed to reach the energetic threshold for ATP formation and the more recently developed assay for lumen pH using 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonic acid as a lumenally loaded pH-sensitive fluorescent probe. By those two criteria, the wild-type barley thylakoids revealed either a localized or a delocalized energy coupling mode under low- or high-salt storage conditions, respectively. Addition of Ca++ to the high-salt storage medium caused those thylakoids to maintain a localized energy-coupling response, as previously observed for pea thylakoids. In contrast, the chlorina f2 mutant thylakoids had an active delocalized energy coupling activity but did not show localized {Mathematical expression} energy coupling under any conditions, and added Ca++ to the thylakoid storage medium did not alter the delocalized energy coupling mode. One interpretation of the results is that the absence of the LHCII polypeptides produces a ""leaky"" pathway for protons which allows the {Mathematical expression} gradient to equilibrate with the lumen under all conditions. Another interpretation is possible but seems less likely, that being that the absence of the LHCII polypeptides in some way causes the proposed Ca++ -gated H+ flux site on the membrane sector (CF0) of the energy coupling complex to lose its gating function. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","ATP formation; localized energy coupling; proton gradients; Thylakoid proteins","adenosine triphosphate; membrane protein; article; energy transfer; nonhuman; ph; plant; proton transport; thylakoid membrane; Adenosine Triphosphate; Chloroplasts; Energy Metabolism; Hordeum; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Membrane Proteins; Mutagenesis; Photosynthetic Reaction Center, Plant; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028203910

The determination of the DE above 0.4 keV was based on an energy dispersive measurement of the undispersed calculable radiation emitted from the storage ring, which is a primary radiation standard. A new method based on the measurement of the detector photocurrent for a known monochromatic spectral photon flux was used to measure the DE down to 60 eV. We have introduced a model for the absolute DE including all parts of the response function of a Si(Li) detector which expresses the DE only as an absorption effect in the gold contact and contamination layers. The agreement between the measured efficiency and the model calculation is better than 2%. A model that allows lineshapes from 0.1 keV upwards to be simulated and which agrees well with our measurements in the range up to 5 keV is presented. © 1994.",,"Detectors; Emission spectroscopy; Ion sources; Radiation counters; Simulation; Detector response calculation; Electron storage ring; Radionuclide standards; Vanishing charge collection; Windowless detector; Character recognition equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028196512

Br was adsorbed on hydrofluoric-acid(HF)-etched silicon surfaces from a weak bromine-methanol solution. Initial coverages of Br obtained on Si(111) and Si(100) surfaces were 0.62 and 0.72 monolayers, respectively. On the (111) surface, immediately after sample preparation, the Br 3p3 2 and 3p1 2 XPS peaks appear at 182.9 and 187.5 eV, respectively. After a storage time of 45 h in ambient air these peaks show a chemical shift of 1.2 eV towards higher binding energy, which is attributed to the formation of the Si-O-Br complex species. Some of these features are not observed for the Si(100) surface, indicating that the chemical state of Br on the (100) surface is different from that on the (111) surface. As HF etching is involved in the sample preparation, there is also adsorbed fluorine on the surface. On the (111) surface, immediately after sample preparation, a F1s peak appears at 685.1 eV with a small shoulder at 687.5 eV. These are attributed to F chemisorption at different sites. The F 1s chemical shift, upon storage in ambient air, also suggests formation of the Si-O-F species. The Br and F desorption rates and the oxide growth rates are, in general, higher for the (100) than for the (111) surfaces. © 1994.",,"Adsorption; Bromine; Chemisorption; Complexation; Desorption; Etching; Oxygen; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Specimen preparation; Surfaces; X ray spectroscopy; Chemical shift; Hydrofluoric acid etching; Oxide growth; Semiconductor surface; Surface reconstruction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray standing wave; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028259244

When compared to batteries, the CDL capacitor is much less energy dense, however the power density is orders of magnitude better. As a result, CDL-battery combinations present an interesting pulse power system with many potential applications. Due to the nature of the CDL, it is inherently a low voltage device. The applications of the CDL can be tailored to auxiliary energy and burst mode storages which require fast charge/discharge cycles. Typical of the applications envisioned are power system backup, directed energy weapons concepts, electric automobiles, and electric actuators.

While fluorescence can be readily measured, the detection of thermal deactivation processes can be achieved by the photoacoustic technique. In that case, the pressure wave generated by the thermal deactivations in a sample irradiated with modulated light is detected by a sensitive microphone. The relationships between the yield of fluorescence and thermal emissions measured simultaneously were analyzed by using a spinach photosystem II (PSII)-enriched preparation. It is shown that the quenching of fluorescence due to the photochemical activity of the preparations (photochemical quenching) increases in proportion to the fraction of thermal deactivations that is not immediately released as heat but is stored in photochemical intermediates (energy-storage yield) as the intensity of the photoacoustic modulated measuring beam (35 Hz) is decreased. Maximal levels of fluorescence and thermal emissions were both decreased in similar proportions upon photoreduction of pheophytin (Pheo), the primary acceptor of PSII. The variable components of fluorescence and thermal emissions were strongly decreased upon depletion of Mn from the Mn complex that catalyzes water oxidation and were recovered proportionally during reconstitution with Mn2+ at various Mn2+/reaction center ratios. Finally, depletion of Mn from the Mn complex together with the Fe of the Q(A)-Fe-Q(B) complex that is composed of the secondary quinone acceptors of PSII resulted in an increased initial level of fluorescence F(o) and in the loss of the variable components of fluorescence and thermal emissions. The initial F(o) and the variable components could be partially recovered by reconstitution of both donor and acceptor sides with Mn2+, Co2+, HCO3/- and plastoquinone. It is concluded that the photochemical fluorescence quenching is correlated with a simultaneous 'quenching' of a variable component of thermal emission. It is proposed that the measured component of variable thermal emission is related to the decay of the pair [P680+ Pheo-]. The suggestion is also made that a bicarbonate-induced protonation of reduced Q(A) or Q(B) or conformational change in the PSII complex, or both, adds an additional entropic factor to the variable thermal emission component.","Mn; photoacoustic spectroscopy; photosynthesis; plastoquinone; variable fluorescence","chlorophyll; manganese; article; chloroplast; conformational transition; entropy; fluorescence; nonhuman; photosystem ii; priority journal; spinach; Bicarbonates; Cell-Free System; Chlorophyll; Chloroplasts; In Vitro; Iron; Manganese; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthetic Reaction Center, Plant; Plants; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028049250

We explored the adequacy of existing specifications for M85 and Ed85 by studying fuel effects on cold starting and vapor flammability, and fuel contaminant effects on materials compatibility and filter plugging. These studies demonstrated deficiencies in existing specifications. Therefore, we developed General Motors specifications for M85 and Ed85 to improve vehicle performance and durability. Key features include a Cold Starting Performance Index to improve wintertime starting, a conductivity and chloride ion specification to reduce corrosion, and a particulate contamination limit to reduce filter plugging. As part of an agreement with the California Energy Commission, General Motors (GM) developed the Chevrolet Lumina Variable Fuel Vehicle (VFV) to operate on any mixture of methanol and gasoline up to M85 (85 percent by volume methanol). Subsequently, due to requests by the states of Wisconsin and Illinois and by the Federal Government, GM developed a version of the Lumina VFV to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends up to 85 percent by volume denatured ethanol (E d85). (Ethanol is denatured by addition of hydrocarbons at a concentration of about 5 percent by volume.) Currently, GM has sold about 1700 methanol VFVs and about 400 ethanol VFVs. Most of the methanol VFVs are located in California and most of the ethanol VFVs are in the Midwest. Fuel quality is of prime importance for acceptable performance and durability for VFV customers. Methanol and ethanol fuels are inherently lower in volatility than gasoline fuels and are easily contaminated during manufacture, storage, and distribution. As indicated in the DOE publication, ""Fuel Alcohol Formulations"" [1], the formulation and purity of methanol and ethanol fuel can affect vapor flammability, cold starting performance, and corrosion.

Electric/hybrid vehicles present a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and improve system efficiency on urban start and stop cycles. A proliferation of approaches exist, and the challenge is to find the optimal system which will balance the technical vision and commercial feasibility.

The current paper revisits the subject 12 years later. In 1981, energy concerns were dominant, and coal-based synthetic fuels were viewed as viable alternatives to petroleum and natural gas, which were predicted to become scarce and very expensive. Today, environmental issues are crucial and global warming concerns will probably limit the future use of coal, and petroleum and natural gas are cheaper than they were in 1981. The paper examines advances in hydrogen production, distribution, on-board storage and use as an automotive fuel in internal combustion engines (ICE) and fuel cell electric vehicles. It also considers tailpipe and overall CO2 emissions. Hydrogen ICE vehicles are less attractive than competing battery electric vehicles and natural gas ICE vehicles. Fuel cell vehicles are theoretically more attractive, but face technical challenges which will bar them as a prospect for automotive applications before 2010 at the earliest.

These results were achieved on a 1993, 2.2 liter vehicle. The success of this system is due to rapid heat up of the catalyzed surface areas of both the heater and light-off converter. The energy added to the exhaust from both the heater and the light-off is then efficiently transferred to the main converter. In addition, the impact of power and energy on NMHC levels was determined. The Ultra-Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) standard was also achieved with uncatalyzed heaters and on a 1990, 3.8 L vehicle. The new California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards require a significant reduction in tail pipe emissions compared to current standards. One of the biggest challenges is achieving the non-methane organic gases (NMOG) level for the LEV and ULEV standards. Many strategies have been studied to achieve lower cold start tail pipe hydrocarbon emissions such as electrically heated catalysts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18), hydrocarbon storage devices (19,20), light-off converters (21), and exhaust gas ignitors (22).

The solar dynamic power system would operate using the suns thermal input during the lunar day and would continue to operate during the lunar night using the thermal energy stored within the cavity. The experiment modeled in a lunar thermal energy storage concept by applying a heat flux to the surface of simulated lunar soil equivalent to what a primary and secondary solar concentrator could produce with a concentration ratio of 2000:1. The experiment was designed to determine if the surface layer of the lunar soil could be melted using the equivalent heat flux from a radiative heating element mounted above the simulated lunar soil. If a melt occurred, the melt characteristic including the formation shape and amount of the soil melted was to be evaluated. Other objectives of the experiment included studying the effects of re-melting the soil after the molten cavity solidifies, and generating a temperature profile throughout the soil as the heat cycle was applied. The experiment successfully generated a cavity within the surface layer of the simulated soil. This report describes the experiment in detail and highlights the results.

New battery technologies will provide a significant improvement but all-electric vehicles will still tend to be heavy, costly, and severely limited in range compared with their combustion-engined counterparts. Despite these inherent disadvantages, there is a huge impetus for electric car development because of the pollution disadvantages of the combustion engine. Given the weight/cost/range problems of purely electric cars, it is desirable to develop hybrid cars which have the capability of operating as zero-emission electric cars in urban areas and which use a small internal combustion engine to extend the operating range. The internal combustion engine and its fuel are far lighter, cheaper, and more effective at extending range than carrying enough battery capacity to give an all-electric vehicle a suitable range. The U.S. Department of Energy, Ford, and SAE organized a student design competition to highlight the possibilities of hybrid electric cars. The University of Alberta, along with 29 other North American university teams, spent eighteen months developing and building safe, practical, road-licensed cars with hybrid electric drive systems.

With respect to the automobile industry, the team is planning to design, build and test a NASP technology demonstration automobile engine with revolutionary characteristics such as, high efficiency, low emissions, high temperature capability, higher power and lighter weight. The IPT, which is charged with lowering the cost and increasing the performance of future hypersonic systems, believes that everyday usage of the NASP technologies in applications such as the automotive industry will ensure cheaper, ready availability at a later date. The purpose of this paper is to outline the NASP interest in technology transfer, describe the NASP technologies and capabilities are applicable to the automotive industry, describe the NASP Joint Program Office (JPO) reasoning for choosing the automotive industry, and outline the NASP technology demonstration automobile engine project. Technology transfer is defined by AFMC/ST as the dissemination of technology to applications outside of the government. Transfer can be contrasted with transition which is dissemination of technology to applications within the government. The NASP program became interested in technology transfer and transition in 1989. The reasoning being threefold: (1) to lower the costs of existing and future systems, (2) to increase the performance of existing and future systems, at a lower risk to the developing agency, and (3) to keep the research and development base strong. Technology transfer lowers the costs of existing and future systems by exploiting commercial markets. These markets are characterized by higher volumes than the general government system application. Volume tends to increase learning and amortize fixed costs more evenly. Additionally, the commercial application provides test data that may be useful to the government application. As the commercial venture operates in the marketplace, the spin-off technology might be enhanced to account for competition. All of which could eventually spin-back to the government in a more useful fashion. Technology transfer provides a similar advantage to performance as it does to cost. By generating useful alternate applications of the NASP technology, the IPT is facilitating the development of higher performing government systems. This is accomplished predominantly through the different requirements of commercial products. These new requirements, though rarely more demanding than the government application, may analyze or task the technology in a variety of ways. Again, all of this is potentially useful information to the government developing agency. Finally, NASP technology transfer serves to make additional use of the research and development infrastructure, especially in lean economic times. Successful cultivation of commercial applications of government capabilities serves to preserve facilities and engineering talent and expertise. Research and development capabilities can not be resurrected in an on-demand basis, and generally take several years to develop. Useful alternate applications of these government tools will ensure their readiness when they are called upon again by the government. The materials science area of NASP technology applications has been extremely successful. There have been many advances in metal alloys including TIMETAL™ 21S Titanium, Gamma Titanium Aluminide, and Aluminum-Beryllium (AlBeMet™). Development has also occurred with titanium and titanium aluminide metal matrix composites, thermo set/thermo plastic materials, and metallic coatings. This material was developed for use in NASP metal matrix composites and it is 100 times more corrosion resistant than ""standard"" aircraft titanium. This advance in characteristics was achieved without sacrificing the high strength and temperature capabilities of other current alloys. TIMETAL™ 21S has many benefits which make it highly adaptable to a variety of industries. As stated earlier, this particular material exhibits a very high corrosion resistance, while at the same time maintaining an impressive strength-to-weight ratio. The material possesses a better cold and warm formability than conventional titanium alloys and is also strip producible, meaning it can be economically rolled to a foil. TIMETAL™ 21S use is anticipated in the oil industry. One application is to use this material in piping for sour oil and gas wells. Because of the attractive anti-corrosion properties of this titanium alloy, it is expected to withstand the corrosive sulfuric acid gases found in sour wells. Test pipes for these wells have already been produced. Another significant advantage of TIMETAL™ 21S, is that at nearly half the weight of ""ordinary"" titanium, a deeper well can be drilled. Depths of 30,000 feet are now achievable (versus 20,000 feet for current steel-clad pipe), and give access to a greater number of oil and natural gas sources available for tapping. The lightweight advantage also allows the use of a larger diameter pipe and enables the flow rate to be increased by up to 50 percent. Another application which has great potential for TIMETAL ™ 21S is its use in platform bolts for offshore drilling structures. The nickel-based superalloy bolts currently in use on these oil platforms require a biannual replacement weighing 2 million pounds. The labor cost to replace these bolts is one of the major expenses of this process. The corrosion resistance of this metal would substantially extend the life of the platform bolts and reduce the maintenance cost of the platforms. There is a potential 100 million pound market for the platforms in the North Sea alone. TIMETAL™ 21S is baselined into the nacelles for the upcoming Boeing-777, replacing the superalloys currently being used, to prevent corrosion hazards associated with various leaks. The lightweight characteristics of the titanium will also enable a potential weight savings of 850 pounds per engine. In terms of dollar amount savings, a Life Cycle Cost savings of more than $3-5 million per aircraft has been projected, as well as a fleet savings of potentially a half billion dollars. The potential also exists for TIMETAL™ 21S to be used in the medical field as human implant material for applications such as prosthetic joints, pacemaker components, and orthopedic wire. This application would allow up to 30 to 50 percent fewer surgical procedures. The titanium alloy's elasticity is closer to that of human bones and would provide a more natural joint for the recipient. Heat exchanger requirements for the NASP have sparked a renewed interest in a beryllium alloy not used since the 1960s when production was ceased by the original manufacturer. NASP requirements have not only improved the characteristics of this material, resulting in a much better manufacturing process, but also significantly improved its characterization data base, enabling it to be looked at for commercial applications. The new NASP-developed alloy is trademarked AlBeMet ™ 160. Some benefits of this material include both high strength and low density. AlBeMet™ 160 has been demonstrated to have excellent thermal conductivity which will enhance the component life. AlBeMet™ 160 has already demonstrated its capability to produce both commercial and government spin-offs. The major spin-off to date is in the area of computer technology. A rotary actuator for a high-performance computer disk drive is being manufactured with this material because of its attractive physical properties. AlBeMet™ 160 provides a lighter, stiffer, and thinner disk drive actuator arm than those made in the past with other materials. The overall benefits of this new actuator include a more rapid access time to data stored on the hard disks, as well as me capability of doubling the density through more precise arm placement. Firm orders have already occurred, with a potential market for this application in excess of $100M. This shows the initial investment of $657,000 made by the NASP program to have a return on investment of over 200 to 1. NASP research lead to the application of Martin Marietta XD™ process (the synthesis of composites with in situ precipitation of reinforcements) to the production of gamma titanium aluminide. This process enables lower cost and much higher strength uniformity compared to other composites. It is important to note that only button size elements existed before NASP was involved, but now castings of up to 10,000 lbs are possible. NASP assistance also contributed to the application of the XD™ process to other titanium aluminides. Small-engine impeller test pieces have already been manufactured with gamma titanium for use in gas-turbine engine and automotive turbochargers. © 1993 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Actuator disks; Aircraft engines; Automobile engines; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Beryllium alloys; Bolts; Characterization; Commerce; Corrosion prevention; Corrosion resistance; Cost accounting; Costs; Digital storage; Disks (machine components); Drilling platforms; Fighter aircraft; Gas turbines; High strength alloys; Hypersonic vehicles; Investments; Joint prostheses; Life cycle; Matrix algebra; Metallic matrix composites; Metals; Natural gas well drilling; Nickel alloys; Offshore drilling; Offshore gas fields; Offshore gas well production; Offshore gas wells; Offshore oil wells; Polymer matrix composites; Research laboratories; Strength of materials; Superalloys; Technology transfer; Thermal conductivity; Titanium castings; Wages; Anti-corrosion property; Automotive turbochargers; Gamma-titanium aluminide; High performance computers; High-temperature capability; Nickel- based superalloys; Research and development; Strength to weight ratio; Titanium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072410558

To verify klystron performance, we have developed an automated test system using data-acquisition and control programs based on Lab VIEW™, a program that readily interfaces with both the high-power transmitter's programmable logic controller and the GPIB interface test equipment. The automated test system also provides extensive analysis, improved data storage and processing, and documentation of the test conditions. This approach allows one to develop and operate a complex test system using an iconic-programming system. Three automated tests were developed and performed on the high-power klystron: swept-frequency, power-transfer, and voltage standing wave ration (VSWR) at several operating conditions. This paper describes the hardware used to test the klystrons, presents an example of the test data, provides block diagrams of the software used in the test stand, and characterizes all the capabilities for the automated test system. This test facility is being used by the GTA program to fully characterize the klystron amplifiers before they are placed into accelerator service, verify the factory acceptance tests, and determine optimal operating conditions for power levels below saturation. Currently, we are moving the test stand to the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) where we will test many klystrons used in their accelerator. These klystrons have been in operation for twenty years. Some of the amplifiers have been rebuilt and other amplifiers are in process of being retuned or decommissioned. The test stand will allow one to characterize the klystrons before and after they have been rebuilt. © 1994 EEE.",,"Automation; Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy transfer; Equipment testing; Klystrons; Microwave tubes; Software testing; Test facilities; Automated test systems; Factory acceptance tests; High power klystron; Iconic programming; Klystron amplifiers; Operating condition; Optimal operating conditions; Voltage standing wave ration; Acceptance tests",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063521686

This concept is now widely used and appreciated, however, improvements to the complexity and losses of the dual conversion and to the relatively high harmonic content of the AC input current is possible.

The design of compliant mechanisms in industry is currently accomplished by expensive trial and error methods. This paper introduces a method to aid in the design of a class of compliant mechanisms wherein the flexible sections (flexural pivots) are small in length compared to the relatively rigid sections.

The study is based on a model that, although simplified, takes full account of the physics of the phase-change process that takes place in the LHSS during charge and discharge. The model characterizes an LHSS with only two parameters and four operating temperatures. This simplicity allows a detailed study of the unit. Two different situations are analyzed. The first is an LHSS in which the phase-change material (PCM) is stored in a single container. The second is an LHSS with many small cells containing the phase-change material. The simplified model presented in this paper is successful in describing the effects of the physics of the phasechange process on the performance of LHSSs. Optimum efficiencies and phase change temperatures in the LHSSs related to the inlet temperature of the charge fluid are obtained based on exergy analysis. The results also indicate that the insulating effect of the solid layer during the discharge process reduces both the exergetic efficiency and the storage capacity of the unit.

Special emphasis is made on consideration of possible using of COIL as a pump source for solid-state lasers. It based on the fact that the second harmonic of the COIL radiation coincides with pump bands of some efficient. laser materials viz. Orystal-Is doped ions Cr3+.

The apparent power S in unbalanced systems may be higher than the active power P, however, despite of the lack of any oscillation of instantaneous power, since the direction of energy flow may not change with the load unbalance. The unbalanced power of a resistive unbalanced load cannot occur as a consequence of power oscillation since such a load does not have any capability of energy storage.

Without the hydraulic fluid as an available heat sink, the thermal management of electrical actuators, especially the motor, becomes a critical issue. The challenge in integrating electromechanical actuators into an airframe and providing adequate cooling for ail mission segments is to provide a passive, lightweight and rugged heat transfer mechanism between the actuator motor and available heat sinks such as the aircraft structure or skin. The short duty cycles and transient nature of actuator heat loads makes the use of sensible and latent thermal energy storage attractive. A two-phase thermosyphon cooler coupled to a phase change material (PCM) was built to demonstrate a concept for cooling a 26 kW actuator motor. A 3M Corporation Fluorinert®*, FC-75, was used as the working fluid to transfer heat to the phase change material, acetamide. The PCM was contained in alternating layers of a plate-fin compact heat exchanger core. This structure provided both good thermal access to the PCM and a means to prevent its migration during liquid-solid cycles. It also provided the flow path for the vapor to rise to the condenser. For this demonstration, upper and lower oil cooled heat exchangers were available as the heat sinks for the thermosyphon condenser. The oil temperature and flow rate to these finned coolers could be controlled to simulate aircraft heat sinks. Sight glasses on the containment vessel allowed for the visualization of two-phase bubbly or slug flow when present in testing. The test article was mounted on a one-axis articulating fixture to enable testing in different attitudes. Preliminary transient test results are being used to validate the analytical thermal model. Future testing and data analysis will provide insights and guidelines for aircraft application. Key parameters in the preliminary tests are the condenser oil flow rate, the fluid fill level, the transient cycle period and the test article orientation. At the 50 percent power condition the peak motor temperature was within 50°C of the heat sink, showing good source to sink thermal coupling by the thermosyphon and conductive links. Testing shows that the PCM material provides additional useful thermal inertia during the melting process. Preliminary thermal time constants and other transient response characteristics are available from the test results. Heat load magnitude, heat load input profile, sink temperature, cooler orientation, and PCM mass will be parameters in future tests. Also, the motor will be mounted on a drive line for operation underloaded conditions. © 1994 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Inc.

First, the adequate fuzzy control rules of an SMES for the model power system is derived. Then, to alleviate the dependence of the fuzzy control on the operating condition and the fault, a method is proposed which adjusts the fuzzy parameter according to the operating condition and the fault using a neural network.

Since a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) unit with a self‐commutated converter is capable of controlling both the active (P) and reactive (Q) power simultaneously and quickly, increasing attention has been focused recently on power system stabilization by SMES control. This paper describes the effects of SMES control on the damping of power oscillations. By examining the case of a single generator connected to an infinite bus through both theoretical analyses and experimental tests (performed with a SMES unit with maximum stored energy of 16 kJ and an artificial model system), the difference in the effects between P and Q control of SMES is clarified as follows: In the case of P control, as the SMES unit is placed closer to the terminal of the generator, the power oscillations will decay more rapidly. In the case of Q control, it is most effective to install the SMES unit near the midpoint of the system. By comparing the P control with Q control, the former is more effective than the latter based on the conditions that the SMES unit location and the control gain are the same.

It also examines the energy requirements and heat balance in exercising marsupials. Marsupials have mass.specific metabolic rates that lie at the lower end of the mammalian range but this is not reflected in locomotory energetics as quadrupedal marsupials fit the predictive model derived from placentals. The group that does not conform to the model contains the larger hopping macropods in which an independence between metabolic rate and hopping speed is achieved on treadmills at most speeds by the storage of elastic strain energy in tendons. This yields a saving of up to 50% of the energy that would be otherwise used for locomotion. The carriage of pouch young appears to reduce the maximum running speed in quadrupedal marsupials but may be cost.neutral in hopping species. Respiration is entrained to the step cycle in wallabies by means of a visceral piston, but no entrainment of the cardiac cycle has been observed. The consequences of these phenomena are discussed.

Storage rings were first proposed as an efficient means of producing intense high-energy particle beams by G. K. O'Neill in 1956. The milestone demonstrations of the importance of this invention came with the operation of the ISR device at CERN in 1971, a 2 km long vacuum vessel which operated at 10–12 Torr and the SPEAR electron-positron collider at Stanford in 1972. These achievements required development of new materials, materials processing techniques, vacuum components, and vacuum instrumentation. UHV development continues through the present design efforts for the 27 km LHC ring at CERN, and numerous high intensity synchrotron light sources worldwide. A similar progression in UHV development preceded the operation of the present generation of large tokamaks built to demonstrate the scientific feasibility of magnetic fusion energy: The JET device in Europe (U.K.), the JT-60 in Japan, and TFTR at Princeton. Development efforts in UHV compatible first-wall materials, efficient vessel conditioning procedures, and high capacity pumps are essential for the operation of these devices and continue to be active areas of research for the next generation of fusion demonstration devices. © 1994, American Vacuum Society.

Although that fat body cycles of adult reproducing females are similar to those of males, the magnitude of lipid storage in these females was considerably greater. Adult females showing early vitellogenic activity and significantly larger fat bodies than non-reproductive females. Seasonal liver mass changes paralleled the fat body cycles in all classes. Fat body stores appear to be used by all classes for winter and early spring nutrition.

Several practical design considerations for energy recovery in multi-legged walking machines, where a stance phase prevents the immediate recovery of energy from one step to the next, are investigated.

The specific enzymatic activity of HRP adsorbed on different surfaces was assumed to be an indication of the extent of its conformational alterations on the surfaces. The surfaces studied were poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and tetrachloroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene glow discharge-treated PET, abbreviated as TCE/PET and TFE/PET. All surfaces were characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and liquid contact angles in air. HRP adsorbs more strongly onto the two discharge-treated surfaces than onto the untreated polymers, as evidenced by the lower amount of HRP eluted by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) from the treated polymers. For example, seventy percent of the HRP adsorbed on TCE/PET or TFE/PET remains on the surface after overnight elution with a 1% solution of SDS. In contrast, untreated PET and PTFE each retains only c. 20% of the absorbed enzyme. The enzymatic activity of HRP adsorbed on the different surfaces was studied using hydrogen peroxide (H202) as the substrate. HRP adsorbed on the higher energy surfaces, PET and TCE/PET, retains significantly more activity than the HRP adsorbed on the lower energy surfaces, PTFE and TFE/PET which appear to destroy rapidly almost all of the activity of HRP after it adsorbs. HRP adsorbed on TCE/PET is relatively more stable over time than HRP adsorbed on PET or free HRP in solution. (For example, only 45% of the specific enzymatic activity of HRP adsorbed on TCE/PET was lost after 3 h of storage in phosphate buffer at 37°C, while 70% of that adsorbed on PET was lost.) In summary, when HRP is adsorbed on TCE/PET, it is very tightly bound, and yet it maintains a significant fraction of its initial specific activity and also retains this activity for 3 h in phosphate buffer at 37°C. Thus, tenacious physical adsorption of proteins such as enzymes on TCE glow discharge-treated surfaces may have potential as a new method of immobilization of such molecules, for uses in biosensors, diagnostics, bioseparations, cell culture and bioreactors. © Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.","Adsorbed proteins; Enzyme immobilization; Horseradish peroxidase; Radio frequency glow discharge; Surface modification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947405488

This paper describes low voltage experiments which use a standard compact Spiral Generator design to replace the charging device in order to reduce both size and weight. TWO load configurations were tested to determine the feasibility of using the Spiral Generator to produce devices of interest to the Phillips Laboratory. In the first configuration, the Spiral Generator is used to drive a Guillemin Type-A PFN. In the second configuration, the Spiral Generator was operated with a low inductance switch to produce nanosecond wide pulses. Previously, Spiral Generators were of limited use when applied to high energy storage systems because of the Spiral's enormous size requirements. This paper describes the theoretical design of a Spiral Generator that eliminates this problem. This new design will allow for fabrication of compact high energy Spiral Generators. © 1994 IEEE.

In this model, polarization of the medium is related to trapping of electrical charges in the lattice. This allows the storage of high amount of energy (5eV or more per charge) which, when dissipated, can lead to transfer to the phonon bath, creation of defects, exoemission or even fracture. During friction of dielectrical materials, electrical charges and sites of trapping are created. Therefore, the space charge physics can be applied to explain some aspects of the tribological behavior of materials such as ceramics or polymeres.

IAC-8 was harvested in five different times, two previous (R7 and R8) and two subsequent (C1 and C2) to the usual commercial harvest time (H). The seeds were air dried at normal ambient temperature before storage. Those with 15% moisture could be kept for only three months. Those with 12% moisture were kept for six months. Initial characterization of the seeds revealed the least oil content in seeds from the harvest of R8. In addition, the sample R8 had the least acidity and the oil had better storage properties regarding peroxide value. During storage a general increase in acidity has been observed in the oil from seeds from all the samples and at the two moisture levels. Peroxide value of the oil decreased after three months of storage, except for R8 oils, and were even lower in the 15% moisture seeds. Spectrophotometric absorption in the ultraviolet range indicated the formation of conjugated double bonds as the period of storage increased, independently of the harvest time and seed moisture. There was little change in the iodine values of any of the samples during the storage period.

And it's almost small enough for the TeV beams envisioned for the next generation of electronpositron colliders. (See the article by Jonathan Wurtele on page 33.) Linear colliders, in which collisions must all happen in a single pass, require much tighter focal spots than do storage rings, where the beams pass through each other again and again.

Environmental and political imperatives around the world highlight the increasingly urgent need for a new, affordable, and efficient source of drinking water. To meet this demand, Advanced Distillation Technology (ADTech) has designed an ultra-efficient vacuum vapor compression distillation (VVCD) system for the production of fresh water from seawater. The energy demand of ADTech's all-electric VVCD system is less than half that of competing technologies and is ideal for coupling with the full array of alternative energy sources, including fuel cells, nuclear, sea wave, solar, and wind. Fuel cells offer unique synergy when combined with desalination because the output is not only electricity, but also hot water and air which can be captured to increase the efficiency of the integrated system. Recent technological triumphs made by H Power Corporation of New Jersey eliminate the historical problem of hydrogen storage and make fuel cells a particularly well suited power source for desalination. H Power's total energy module (TEM) implements their proprietary hydrogen storage technology. By integrating the VVCO with TEM, a robust, silent, and autonomous water-power system that produces negligible emissions is possible. A demonstration model of the VVCD system will begin a 6-month tour in early 1995, with operation planned in Monterey, California; Darnmam, Saudi Arabia; and Rarat, Morocco to verify performance and energy efficiency. The dramatic results are expected to create opportunities for new installations as well as replacements around the world for customers seeking to meet growing demand for water with maximum efficiency and minimum environmental degradation. If there is substantial international interest in a system integrating VVCD and fuel cell technology, ADTech and H Power are interested in developing a project to demonstrate this new water-power combination. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949152905

The mechanical and magnetoquasistatic fields are written in terms of the defined displacement and momentum states, and Galerkin's method is used to reticulate the distributed systems into discrete power-based representations. Using these EBG descriptions, the energy storage, dissipation and external sources for the distributed systems are reticulated as multiport elements with associated power bonds. The EBG junction structures connecting the power bonds to these multiport elements are established for the mechanical and magnetoquasistatic energy modes by enforcing power balance principles. The coupling effects of the distributed electromechanical systems are also consistently reticulated into a power-based multi-energetic, multiport IC element to connect the two junction structures. The energy stored in this IC element is contributed to simultaneously by the electromechanically-induced distributed forces and currents. The power flows associated with these forces and currents are directed to each energetic domain to satisfy the power balance relations. The overall EBG network reticulation provides a unified way to model nonuniform mechanical and magnetoquasistatic fields in distributed electromechanical systems. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949152822

We present a new algorithm that greatly facilitates this computation. It yields exact values for expansion coefficients, with less roundoff error than the best alternative method. Our algorithm is formulated completely in terms of tensor arithmetic, which makes it easier to extend to systems with more than three degrees of freedom and to excited states, simplifies the development of computer codes, simplifies memory management, and makes it well suited for implementation on parallel computer architectures. We formulate the algorithm for the calculation of energy eigenvalues, wave functions, and expectation values for an arbitrary many-body system and give estimates of storage and computational costs. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449007903

Hulburt Center for Space Research, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375, United States","Half a century ago, it was established that the temperature of the ""quiescent"" solar corona is ≈ 106 K (∼ 100 eV). Wave theories have been used to explain the means by which the Sun keeps the corona about 200 times hotter than the 5000 K (≈ 0.5 eV) photosphere. In recent years, it has been suggested that a mechanism other than wave dissipation heats the ""quiescent"" corona and other transient phenomena that occur in the upper solar atmosphere. It is postulated by some that the solar upper atmosphere is heated by small bursts of energy resulting from magnetic reconnection. In this paper, the plasma properties of the upper solar atmosphere, a domain that, when flares are included, encompasses about three orders of magnitude in temperature (3 × 104-3 × 10 7 K) and four orders of magnitude in electron density (3 × 108-3 × 1012 cm-3), are described. It is shown that conventional scenarios based on magnetic reconnections may not adequately explain the observed plasma properties of the solar upper atmosphere. However, a model, consisting of electric currents flowing along magnetic field lines may have a better chance simulating the observed properties. For quiescent solar upper atmosphere phenomena, constant currents are needed to simulate the observations, while for flares, currents supplied by an exponentially decaying storage media are required. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449000675

It was found that the amount of sulfate formed by oxidation of iron sulfide in the feed coal increased during weathering causing the acidification of the produced CWM. Hydrophilic functional groups on the coal surface were thus increased resulting in a decrease of “free water,” which is needed for a good fluidity.

Active exhalation compresses the bony scale jacket; inhalation occurs when the scale jacket recoils to its original shape. Exhalation and loading of the integument are powered by contraction of striated muscle in the lung walls. The integument of polypterid fishes consists of interlocking rhomboid scales held together by collagen fibre strands. The scales imbricate with bevelled edges, so that when the fish is at rest, its integument is circular in cross‐section and the overlapping scale edges are parallel. During exhalation, the hemicircular shape of the ventral integument is deformed, and the scales rotate slightly. As the overlapping scale edges become non parallel, the scales act as tiny levers to stretch the collagen fibres between them. When the fish opens its glottis to inhale, the stretched collagen fibres return to their rest lengths and pull the scale jacket back into a circular shape, sucking air into the lungs.

It was suggested that converging of the flow path of particles in a hopper leads to the change of bulk density of flowing particles, where by particles in a hopper flow intermittently. On the basis of microscopic behaviour of flowing particles observed by the simulation, a flow model was derived to analyse the flow of particles in a conical hopper. The values and fluctuation of dynamic pressure acting on the wall during the flow of particles in a bin-hopper system were estimated and the generation mechanism of over pressure during flowing of particles was also presented on the basis of the model. © 1994, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

In conventional magnetic recording, a magnetic head flying very close to the disc surface alters the polarization of the magnetic field at the disc surface to write and/or erase information on the disc. An optical disc is a multilayered medium consisting of a thick glass substrate on which many layers of different materials are sputtered. Only one of these layers serves as a recording medium and it is initially magnetized uniformly in one direction. To write on this disc, the initial magnetic field is altered by focusing light from a laser source with high numerical aperture (NA) lens to heat the magnetic medium beyond its Curie point, the temperature at which the magnetic medium loses its magnetization. This domain with zero magnetization is subsequently magnetized in the reversed direction by using an induction magnet. All these processes take place while the disc is rotating at a very high speed with respect to the laser. In this paper, we examine optical imaging and transient heat transfer problems to study the writing process. We first make use of the vector diffraction theory to calculate energy distribution on the disc surface and then use this energy distribution as a source for the heat transfer problem. We examine writing with lenses of various NA and consider various optical effects such as 'fill factors' and obscuration, mechanical effects such as the thermal properties of the disc material, and writing conditions. Results pertinent to the design of the disc medium, the optical elements, the mechanical components, and the development of the write algorithm are discussed. We also discuss the quality of the written spots and the resulting data densities during a typical write sequence. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242319154

There is no sound evidence to support a causal relationship between excess caloric intake and development of obesity, yet virtually all outpatient treatments for obesity are based on strategies to reduce caloric intake. The programs subsequently fail at long-term weight control, while at the same time exposing participants to substantial psychological and physiological dangers. It is time for a new paradigm in weight management that focuses primarily on reducing the percentage of calories in the diet from fat, and on increasing the level of physical activity. It has been shown that many individuals can lose weight at a satisfactory rate (one pound per week) by combining physical activity with a change in the composition of the diet that involves less fat.

This paper addresses the design considerations for integrating a 5 inch ETC gun and two 60mm ETC guns aboard a naval surface combatant. The proposed architecture for the power system utilizes a power take‐off arrangement from the main propulsion drivetrain to provide the necessary prime power. The projected mission profiles of each gun system and the resultant prime power requirements are derived. The extraction of prime power from the ship's propulsion system, power conversion, conditioning and control techniques, power transmission throughout the ship, pulse forming and energy storage requirements, system grounding and safety, and thermal management issues are then discussed.

The lagoon transport system is examined as a series of processes that distribute fine-grained sediment between sources and sinks. The processes cycle sediment from one part of a lagoon to another with small amounts being added intermittently from diverse sources to balance amounts removed from the system or that go into storage. Residual transport of fine suspended sediment is regulated by tidal pumping, shear transport or time-flow asymmetry. During transport and recycling, fine particles are modified by aggregation, break-up and reforming. After deposition, benthic fauna further modify the sediment by changing its stability, geotechnical properties, and erosion resistance. Additionally, wind waves winnow fines from shoals thus modifying textural characteristics, while tidal mechanisms have selective effects on the particle composition and size distributions. Lagoon sinks incorporate a number of fill components reflecting multiple sources and fluctuations in energy dissipation interacting on the sediment supply. Climate mainly influences the source material and the sediment character of intertidal zones. Although sediments are extensively modified, recycled and reworked, especially by storms, lagoons primarily function as net sediment sinks in which the accumulation rates adjust to submergence. Sediment processes are a crucial link to understanding the fate of materials in lagoons since they modulate the chemical reactivity and biological productivity of lagoons.

It has, however, been used in conjunction with the widely applied stedCH4 reforming process when the H2CO ratio of the product gas is required to be less than that generated by steam reforming alone. In certain potential applications (e.g. energy storage and transmission) CO2/CH4 reforming has a number of advantages over steam reforming, and is likely to become an increasingly important industrial reaction in the future. This chapter reviews the current status of research on the development of catalysts and reactor technology for CO2/CH4 reforming. It also outlines the current and future applications for CO2/CH4 reforming with particular emphasis on its impact on future energy conversion technologies and implications for achieving reductions in Greenhouse Gas emissions. © 1994, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology.

A strong peak at around 20-eV electron energy was observed in addition to a peak at nearly zero energy. Their shapes are very similar to corresponding ones on HeH+. The relative strengths of these peaks, however, are quite different between HeH+ and HeD+, which is clear evidence of isotope effect. By mixing O2 gas into the helium hydride ion source, it was confirmed that the peaks originate from the ground state of molecular ions. The dissociation energy for the low-energy peak was about 1 eV. This implies that the dissociation of the low-energy component occurs primarily to He+H*(n=2), although the possibility of some branching to n=1 cannot be excluded. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041360993

The bearings offered good vertical and lateral stability. A metallic flywheel disk, ø 190 mm x 30 mm, was safely rotated at speeds up to 15000 rpm. The disk was driven by a 3 phase synchronous homopolar motor/generator. Maximum energy capacity was 3.8 Wh, maximum power was 1.5 KW. The dynamic behavior of the prototype was tested, characterized and evaluated with respect to axial and lateral stiffness, decay torques (bearing drag), vibrational modes and critical speeds. The bearings supports a maximum weight of 65 N at zero gap, axial and lateral stiffness at 1 mm gap were 440 N/cm and 130 N/cm, respectively. Spin down experiments were performed to investigate the energy efficiency of the system. The decay rate was found to depend upon background pressure in the vacuum chamber and upon the gap width in the bearing. At a background pressure of 5x10-4 Torr, the coefficient of friction (drag-to-lift ratio) was measured to be 0.000009 at low speeds for 6 mm gap width in the bearing. Our results indicate that further refinement of this technology will allow operation of higly efficient superconducting flywheels in the kWh range. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040928229

The resin systems, viz, diglycidyl ether of furfuraldehydecarbonohydrazone (DGFCH), diglycidyl ether of furfuraldehydethiocarbonohydrazone (DGFTCH), and tetraglycidyl ether of vanillinthiocarbonohydrazone (TGVTCH) with the curative, diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), taken in stoichiometric amounts have been examined. The curing exotherm could be resolved from the decomposition exotherm qualitatively using DTA‐TG analysis. The DMA has been carried out in both the dynamic and isothermal mode to follow the curing process of the systems DGFCH/DDM and TGVTCH/DDM. The storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex viscosity (η) and creep factor (tan δ) were measured simultaneously. The crossover point of G′ and G″, taken as the gelation point in isothermal runs, was determined to obtain time to gelation at that temperature. The isothermal runs at different temperatures have been used to calculate activation energy of the curing process up to gelation. For the difunctional resin DGFTCH, the activation energy value was found to be 18.7 kcal/mol. The thermomechanical analysis (TMA) has been used to find the glass transition (Tg0, and melt transition (Tm) temperatures. The cured tetrafunctional TGVTCH/DDM system as expected, has higher Tg than those of the two difunctional resin systems. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The early stage of this process takes place with a high bioconversion rate and high yield. These values then decrease as a result of germination and growth the biocatalyst. An optimization strategy for the process would thus be to improve the characteristics of this first period, i.e., increase its duration and the reaction rate. An increase in duration is evidenced in two cases: (I) under oxygen limitation: and (ii) when the spore content in the medium is less than 107 spores/mL. These conditions give insufficient overall bioconversion rates: better optimization should be achieved without oxygen limitation and with high spore content. Characterization of the first period by material and bioenergetic balances suggests that an increase in the ethanol content of the medium, which acts as an energy source and a permeabilizer, and the use of specific inhibitor of the Krebs cycle, may be a way to further improve the biocatalyst performance and stability. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The as-grown crystals were slightly colored. Electron microprobe, XPS and X-ray diffraction showed no deviation from stoichiometry, within the limits of detection. The photoluminescence spectra of as-grown SrS crystals showed a broad band emission centered at around 630 nm, its excitation peak being at 290 nm - in close agreement with the band gap energy of about 4.3 eV. Upon annealing in a sulfur and selenium atmosphere, respectively, the crystals turned completely black. After heat treating of these crystals at elevated temperature, the original color of the as-grown crystals returned. However, annealing of the as-grown crystals in an argon atmosphere at 2000°C in an arc image furnace resulted in colorless crystals. The coloration of the as-grown crystals may result from carbon incorporation during growth. The PVT-grown crystals were remarkably stable with respect to an ambient air atmosphere. After several months open storage, no signs of degradation were observed, polished surfaces stayed mirror-like. Only after heat-treating of as-grown crystals in air for 16 h at 600°C, a thin oxygen containing surface layer was found.

Application of the first law of thermodynamics on the system under investigation incorporated the different processes of heat transfer between the ambient, the outer shield, storage tanks, and the vent gas. Performing a mass balance on the overall system and combining it with the first law resulted in a simultaneous time-and-space dependent, non-linear integral-differential system of equations. The rate of entropy production for the system under transient and steady state conditions is also presented. A computer model of the novel cryogenic storage system was set up to determine the optimum thermal design parameters. It was shown that utilizing the vent vapor as a heat-absorbing medium reduced the boiloff rate of the system by a factor of five. Further, using the vent gas to intercept heat on a cooled shield reduced the boiloff rate of the system by 11 percent. Also, various amounts of insulation material were studied with regard to their effect on the boiloff rate of the system. As expected, an increase in the amount of insulation material reduced the boiloff rate of the system. An optimum thickness was found for each specific amount of insulation material. © 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

These discussions however started already more than 25 years ago and up to now hydrogen has failed to achieve a major breakthrough towards wider application as energy storage medium in civil markets. The main reason is that other fuels are cheaper and very well implemented in our daily life. A study has been performed at Deutsche Aerospace in order to evaluate the boundary conditions, either political or economical, which would give hydrogen the necessary push, i.e. advantage over conventional fuels. The main goal of this study was to identify critical influence factors and specific start-up scenarios which would allow an economical and practically realistic use of hydrogen as fuel and energy medium in certain niche markets outside the space industry. Method and major results of this study are presented in detail in the paper. Certain niche markets could be identified, where with little initial governmental support, either by funding, tax laws or legislation, hydrogen can compete with conventional fuels. This however requires a scenario where a lot of small actions have to be taken by a high variety of institutions and industries which today are not interconnected with each other, i.e. it requires a new cooperative and proactive network between e.g. energy utilities, car industries, those who have a sound experience with hydrogen (space industry, chemical industry) and last but certaintly not least the government.

The addition of an energy storage system to provide continuous thrust, however, would substantially increase the specific mass of the power plant, also with the result of increasing the trip time. To examine the tradeoffs of using an energy storage system, the mass penalty factor, defined as the ratio between the specific masses of a continuous thrust versus an intermittent thrust vehicle, is introduced. The delivery rate. defined as the ratio of payload fraction to trip time, is used as a measure of vehicle performance.

Box 30436, Yanbou Al Sinaiyah 21477, Saudi Arabia","Photovoltaic (PV) powered pumping systems are relatively simple and reliable, hence they are applied worldwide. Two conventional techniques are curently in use; the first is the directly coupled technique where a PV array is directly coupled to a d.c. motor-pump group, and the second is the battery buffered PV pumping system where a battery is connected across the array to feed the d.c. motor driving a pump. Recently, a third system is proposed to make use of the advantages of the previously mentioned conventional systems. It is the switched mode PV powered pumping system. The switched mode PV powered pumping system couples the pumping system to the PV array directly when the storage battery is fully charged as explained in Ref. [5]. The objective of such a system is the maximum utilization of available solar radiation to minimize the cost per pumped cubic meter from a given water depth. For a given location, four main parameters affect the design of this system; (1) d.c. motor-pump group parameters, (2) PV array size, (3) battery storage size and (4) water storage tank size. The system designer has to determine the previously mentioned four parameters so that the minimum cost per pumped cubic meter is achieved. It is found that some factors are more effective in reducing the cost than others. The PV array size is the predominant factor, while the battery storage and water tank sizes have relatively less effect. The system installation cost is considered in the detailed economic analysis discussed in this work. © 1994.","Photovoltaic; Pumping; Simulation and design","Costs; DC motors; Electric energy storage; Installation; Pumps; Simulation; Solar cell arrays; Solar radiation; Motor pump group parameters; Photovoltaic powered pumping system; Storage batteries; Switched mode; Solar equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028753083

We consider processes which occur in a finite time and with equipment of finite dimension. These processes include separation processes and are found in hydraulic systems, heat and mass exchangers, thermal networks, energy convertors, energy recovery units, storage systems, chemical reactors, and chemical plants. Our analysis is based on the condition that in order to make the results of thermodynamic analyses qualitatively closer to those following from economics it is the thermodynamic cost optimum, not the maximum of thermodynamic efficiency, which must be preserved for prescribed process requirements. Our outlook is that, in view of the uncertainty, variability and incompleteness of economic data, thermodynamic costs may be useful until an exact economic analysis can be made.

From an analysis of data available in the literature, it is shown that sulphide capacity is directly proportional to the activity of the basic oxide in the melt, within the uncertainty of experimental data. A single parameter is sufficient to describe the sulphide capacity of a binary slag system under isothermal and isobaric conditions. The correlation indicates that the activity coefficient of the sulphide ion or the neutral base metal sulphide dissolved in the melt is independent of composition in pseudobinary melts within experimental uncertainty. Structural variations in the melt with composition do not seem to affect the activity coefficient of the sulphide. A modified sulphide capacity function is defined which makes the treatment more elegant and greatly simplifies data storage and retrieval.

The films were prepared in a unique PECVD system that uses a controllable mixture of two frequencies (450 KHz and 13.56 MHz) to excite the plasma. The TCE and BEM were determined by neasuring the temperature dependence of the stress of identically deposited films on two substrates having different expansion coefficients. The TCE data are well behaved and relatively straightforward to understand. Silicon-rich carbide films and nitride films with x near 0.5 had TCE values near those of crystalline Si and Si3N4 respectively. However, their moduli were much smaller than the bulk values. For x = 0.5, the carbide and nitride films had BEM values of about 125 GPa while the bulk values are 865 GPa and 482 GPa respectively. Effects of frequency mixing on the hardness of a series of carbide films were determined, using a nonoindenter system and films deposited with a fixed SiH4: CH4 flow rate ratio and temperature. Such effects were quite pronounced in that raising the high frequency component from 15% to 85% reduced the hardness from 28 to 12 GPa. These findings and an explanation for their origins will be discussed, together with a few technological examples showing the use of such films as passivants. For example, dual layers of a-SixC1-x: H/a-SixN1-x: H have been used to protect the resistor structure in thermal ink jet printheads and, as such, are subjected to intensive thermal stress cycles. Thus one can predict that some carbide layers (having certain values of TCE, BEM and thickness) will have an excessive stored energy and thus delaminate during device operation. In another example, such carbide films could be attractive for coating magnetic storage media and recording head structures. Carbide films can have hardnesses comparable with that of a-C: H films but could, in principle, be tailored to a specific slider surface to minimize wear. © 1994.",,"Coatings-Ceramic; Deposition; Plasma; Silicion Carbide/Nitride; Carbides; Chemical vapor deposition; Elasticity; Film preparation; Hardness; Nitrides; Plasma applications; Silicon compounds; Stresses; Substrates; Thermal effects; Thermal expansion; Frequency mixing effects; Mixed frequency plasma processes; Nanoindenter system; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028746994

Metal deposition at the interface can provide the necessary electrocatalysis for chemical reactions. In photoelectrochemical devices they are driven by the minority charge carriers produced upon illumination. To avoid a simultaneous increase of the majority carrier transfer - the loss current which decreases the efficiency of the photon energy conversion device - a new way of metallizing semiconductor surfaces has been developed. By depositing colloidal metal particles onto semiconductor surfaces, well defined Multiple Nano Contacts (MNCs) are prepared. The surface modification by MNCs changes the catalytic properties of the semiconductor surface dramatically with negligible disturbance of the semiconductor surface energetics. This has been verified here performing electrochemical experiments with gold MNCs of different sizes (6 - 100 nm) deposited on- pGaAs electrodes. For comparison, sub monolayers of gold deposited from gold ion solutions were investigated. They show that for a comparable metal surface area exposed to the electrolyte the majority carrier loss currents are reduced by about 5 orders of magnitude if the electrodes were metallized by depositing MNCs. These results can be understood on the basis of the thermionic emission model for meta~semiconductor devices combined with the electrochemical model for charge transfer processes at metal electrodes. Using the new technique, the particle sizes and the MNC density can be varied independently of each other which is not possible with ordinary metallization procedures. © 1994 by the authors.

However, the life increase has also been determined to be valid for high depth of discharge missions using the Hughes designed nickel hydrogen cells for 80% depth of discharge for fifteen years or more in geosynchronous orbit. Recent development of electric ion propulsion systems has also increased the requirements for battery power. In order to propose use of 26% KOH for geosynchronous applications, it was necessary to completely characterize the cells. Testing included initial capacity, storage, charge efficiency vs charge rate and temperature, cold temperature tolerance to-1O°C, trickle charge efficiency, and self-discharge characterization. Results showed that the performance differences between 31% KOH and 26% KOH are minimal, and that the 26% KOH cells can be used to replace 31% KOH cells on Hughes geosynchronous spacecraft without change to either the battery or spacecraft configuration. In addition, data for long term real time synchronous testing has been reviewed, and an additional four cells with 26% KOH electrolyte have been placed in an accelerated synchronous test.

A motor failure can result in the shutdown of a generating unit or production line, or require that redundant plant be utilized to circumvent the problem. One major cause of failures is breakdown of the turn insulation leading to puncture of the groundwall. Early detection of interturn shorts during motor operation would eliminate consequential damage to adjacent coils and the stator core reducing repair costs and motor outage time. In addition to the benefits gained from early detection of turn insulation breakdown, significant advantages would accrue by locating the faulted coil within the stator winding. Fault location would not only increase the speed of the repair, but would also permit more optimal scheduling of the repair outage. This work was successful in practically implementing a theory to predict changes in the axial leakage flux resulting from stator winding interturn shorts and in developing an algorithm to locate the position of the faulted coil. An experimental setup consisting of a 200 hp motor loaded by a generator was used to validate this theory. Suitable transducers were developed and installed on this motor.

Unfortunately, there are two errors in this analysis technique. The biomechanical model used assumed a rigid foot articulating around the ankle and there was no accounting for energy storage or dissipation and recovery in the viscoelastic material of the cosmetic cover. The first purpose of this paper is to propose a rigorous technique for the calculation of the net energy efficiency that could be used for any articulated or nonarticulated ankle-foot prosthesis. The second purpose is to quantify the amount of energy stored or dissipated and then recovered in order to discriminate between different ankle-foot prostheses. The SACH, Seattle, Flex-foot, and Golden-Ankle ankle-foot prostheses were evaluated on the same amputee, while walking at his natural cadence. The power entering and leaving the distal end of the prosthetic leg was calculated as the sum of the translational (force-velocity product) and rotational (moment-angular velocity product). All ankle-foot prostheses showed the same distal power pattern. After initial contact, a large energy storage was observed in the cushioned heel, which was followed by some energy recovery. Then, during mid and late stance, another period of storage or dissipation and recovery was observed. Even the SACH foot should be considered an energy storing foot prosthesis since it's cosmetic material was seen to be capable of recovering energy. The balance between the rate of change of foot mechanical energy and the foot powers showed that the new technique takes into account the energy stored or dissipated and then recovered within the compliant material and flexing keel. The new analysis technique can be used by prosthetic designers to assess any type of ankle-foot prostheses. Criteria for ankle-foot prosthesis selection should include, not only the net mechanical efficiency for both rearfoot and forefoot sections, but also the total energy recovered by the ankle-foot prostheses. © 1994 IEEE",,"Biomechanics; Calculations; Efficiency; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Errors; Handicapped persons; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Ankle foot prostheses; Cosmetic cover; Energy recovery; Mechanical efficiency; Mechanical energy; Viscoelastic material; Prosthetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028740045

In order to highlight this versatility, we present the modelisation of the transient response of the modelled engine to a power change. Two different power control systems are compared: dead volume variation by variable angle swashplate and mean pressure variation by fluid flow from a gas storage vessel to the engine or inversely. It is known that unsuitable temporal torque evolutions can be obtained with this latter system. This phenomenon appears very clearly in the simulation results.

The system recovers the heat generated by the space cooling and refrigeration counters utilized in the summer season. During the summer months, this excess heat is used for charging a heat store (borehole unit), and during the winter season, the heats extracted from the borehole unit and solar thermal energy collected by the solar collector are used to heat the high-story buildings. Then, the winter cold energy is stored and utilized for cold energy source in the summer. The thermal performance including transient isotherms in the borehole unit, long-term variation of average temperature of the unit for charging and discharging processes was clarified in detail. Moreover, effects of CO2 reduction by the proposed system on urban warming were suggested. In particular, maximum possible contribution of the solar energy was assessed and discussed in the paper. © 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

We visualize such EMBs (electro-mechanical batteries) as being modular in character, with small (1-5 kwh) modules being used for power-conditioning and for vehicular use, and paralleled 25 kwh modules being used for bulk storage, i.e., load-leveling, applications. In a funded program at the Laboratory two fractional kwh, 200 kW (design peak power) modules have been constructed and subjected to shake-down testing. Their design for high peak power was prompted by awareness of a particular commercial need, as a component in a power-line conditioning device. In addition to such stationary applications, the high power capability of our EMB designs makes them attractive for use in hybridelectric vehicles. Important elements of the LLNL program include the development of passive magnetic bearings and the application of new high-efficiency permanent magnet arrays to an ironless generatorlmotor. Use of these particular elements, together with a multiring, design for the flywheel rotor, is particularly conducive to a systemic approach to the design of an EMB module.

One of the principal problems encountered in the evolution of such vehicles has been the development of suitable power systems. The onboard power and energy storage requirements are almost entirely dependent on vehicular performance. In many applications, to be cost and mission effective such vehicles must be able to transit large distances (hundreds of kilometres) and stay submerged for tens of hours, maybe several days. These needs represent a challenging task to the power system designer. The powering of an AUV is largely determined by the shape, size and desired speed of the vessel. However, contemporary underwater power systems may take up to a half of the internal space of the vehicle. Thus the size of the power systems is one of the most important factors in the determination of the vehicle's size. This situation represents an iterative loop in the design process. The propulsive power requirements are dependent upon the speed and drag resistance of the vehicle. In turn, the drag is dependent upon the interrelated parameters speed, shape and the nature of the flow over the vehicle. To reduce the drag, but maintain the design speed, the designer can then try to alter the flow regime over the vehicle or the vehicle shape. The latter tactic is the subject of this paper. For the concept reported here it was envisaged that the overall length of an AUV could be changed during its mission by discarding the ""empty"" energy storage sections and hence reducing the drag. Preliminary calculations indicate that the endurance of such an AUV could be increased by 15%. © 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Alternate layering of carbon aerogel wafers and Ni foils with microporous separators is a prospective composite for capacitor applications. An inherent problem exists concerning the formation of a physical bond between the Ni foil and the porous carbon wafer. The bond process temperature must be less than 1050°C, at which point the aerogel begins to degrade. The advantage of a low temperature eutectic in the Ni-Ti alloy system solves this problem. Ti, a carbide former, is readily adherent as a sputter deposited thin film on the carbon wafer. A vacuum bonding process is then used to join the Ni foil and Ti coating through eutectic phase formation. The parameters for successful bonding are examined along with structural characterization of the Ni foil-carbon aerogel wafer interface. A 950°C 30 min heat treatment under high vacuum is found to yield bond failure in the aerogel wafer covering one-third the surface area. © 1994.",,"Aerosols; Carbon; Coating techniques; Eutectics; Heat treatment; Interfaces (materials); Metal foil; Nickel alloys; Sputter deposition; Thin films; Titanium alloys; Vacuum applications; Carbon aerogel wafer; Energy storage devices; Eutectic bonding; Eutectic phase formation; Microporous separators; Nickel foil; Surface; Bonding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028729195

First, the optimal stabilizing control of the SMES power for the model power system is calculated for various power system operating conditions and fault conditions. Then these optimal controls are used as training data for the neural network. The neural network used is a multilayer type with a feedback from the output layer to the input layer.

The difficulty due to the requirement of large storage space which is frequently encountered in the modeling of contoured delamination problems is resolved by using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. One of the advantages of this method is that there is no need to store the fill-in elements in the stiffness matrix decomposition process, which leads to a significant reduction in storage space required, thereby making the numerical analysis of the complicated contoured delamination problem feasible as well as effective. To evaluate the accurateness of the present formulation, numerical algorithm and computer program, free edge stress analyses are performed for a [0/901 cross-ply and a [+ 45], angle-ply laminated plate. Both plates are subjected to an axial tensile strain loading. The present three-dimensional results are found to be in good agreement with those obtained using an alternative quasi-three-dimensional methods. To further demonstrate the applicability of the present development, the strain energy release rate of a [+25/90], graphite-epoxy rectangular laminated plate subjected to tensile strain is studied. Two initial delaminations are assumed to be located in the midspan of the two opposite free edges and also at the middle of the thickness. The delamination contour is assumed to be a straight line segment joined by two circular arcs. The strain energy release rates along the delamination front are calculated using the modified crack closure method. As a step beyond the solution using quasi-3D assumption, the present results show the non-uniform distribution of mode I strain energy release rate G1 along the boundary of the delamination front which fluctuates to a maximum value when approaching both ends at the free edge of the laminate. © 1994, TECHNOMIC PUBLISHING CO., INC.

Since SMES is highly efficient and has a rapid response time, it has a significant technical advantage over other storage technologies. Though the cost per unit of stored energy, $/kWh, for several major components, such as the superconductor and the cryostat, decrease as plant size increases, the amount of structural support that is required to withstand the electromagnetic force is directly proportional to the stored energy. Recognition of this fact led to the proposal of warm- or external-supported SMES, which has been the primary technology researched for the past 20 years. Recently, a team led by Bechtel suggested that cold or self support would be cost effective for SMES plants of intermediate size, i.e., from a few to several hundred MWh. This paper evaluates the cold- or self-supported SMES design to determine if it has sufficient material to withstand the electromagnetic forces. The design is shown to meet a criterion derived from the virial equation.

Under the excitation by soft X-ray SR the 220 nm emission band for BaF2 is broadened, whereas shorter wavelength part of CeF3 and BGO emission spectra increases. For luminescence decay of excitons and crossluminescence the degree of the deviation from the single exponential law depends on the photon energies and increases under soft X-ray excitation as well. These effects are supposed to be due to the interaction of electronic excitations created after the relaxation of deep core holes. Fast intrinsic luminescence was observed for CdI2 and CsPbCl3 under X-ray SR excitation. 500 nm band of CdI2 has characteristic time τ=4.6 ns, whereas 420 nm band of CsPbCl3 shows very fast decay with τ=0.2 ns.",,"Cadmium compounds; Cesium compounds; Composition; Crystals; Electron energy levels; Luminescence; Quenching; Reaction kinetics; Scintillation; Spectroscopy; Synchrotron radiation; Decay kinetics; Dissector technique; Scintillation materials; Spectral composition; Time resolved spectroscopy; Wavelength; X ray excitation energy; X ray synchrotron radiation; Phosphors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028714719

These variations support the statement that fiber treatment with 1,4‐carboxy‐sulphonyl‐diazide, which acts as a bridge between the fiber and the matrix and hence enhances the strength of the interface enabling it to resist greater strain applied to the composite and, as a consequence, yielding greater retention values of the storage modulus, measured longitudinally to preferential fiber orientation, E′L. By means of transversal measurements of the storage modulus, E′T, of these materials it is possible to determine a parameter b, which eventually indicates the degree of matrix–fiber bonding and which is consistently higher for materials filled with surface‐treated fiber. This enhanced phase adhesion is further confirmed by higher equivalent interfacial thickness values, ΔR, which, in addition, vary less with increasing dynamic strain amplitude. Finally dissipated energy variation or mechanical energy loss, Eloss, is studied as a function of fiber content and strain amplitude. Experimental findings show Eloss to increase with fiber content and strain amplitude, when measured at constant strain amplitude ϵ0, and to yield higher values for treated fiber samples. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

In order to compare the Adams 1986 interplanetary solar flare model to a new model proposed by scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL92) we have calculated an array of upset rates using heavy ion and proton data for selected DRAM and SRAM memories and for Actel Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). To make more general comparisons of the models we have produced a set of engineering curves of predicted upset rates versus hypothetical device cross-section parameters. The results show that use of this more realistic, although still conservative, JPL model can have significant benefits for satellite programs, especially those which must operate continuously during solar particle events. The benefits include more flexibility in model choice, a higher level of confidence in the environment, and potential cost savings by the calculation of less pessimistic SEU rates which allow designers to integrate commercial products into their spacecraft design with the use of Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) schemes. © 1994 IEEE",,"Cellular arrays; Computational methods; Energy transfer; Error correction; Error detection; Ions; Logic gates; Mathematical models; Random access storage; Satellites; Solar radiation; Interplanetary satellite programs; Linear energy transfer; Single event upset; Radiation effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028712010

Hovering hummingbirds and insects exhibit the highest mass-specific metabolic rates found in vertebrates and invertebrates, respectively. Both groups of fliers have high mitochondrial volume densities in their locomotor muscles, but these do not exceed 35-40% of the fiber volume, presumably from a need to conserve myofibrils for force generation. A possible adaptation to this constraint is the observed greater packing of the inner mitochondrial membranes than occurs in mammalian mitochondria. Both hummingbirds and insects show higher rates of oxygen consumption per unit volume of mitochondria than do mammals. Additionally, volume-specific mitochondrial oxygen consumption in insects increases as body size decreases, unlike the size-independent pattern in mammals. Aerodynamic analysis of power output during hovering flight strongly suggests that both insects and hummingbirds operate with considerable elastic storage of kinetic energy, thereby decreasing their inertial power requirements. Both groups appear to hover with muscle power output close to 100 W kg -1. Muscle efficiency in hummingbirds is near 10%; in insects, muscle efficiency varies with body size, but at similarly low values. Scaling of efficiency with body size has also been reported in terrestrial mammals, suggesting a possible common mechanism. Both groups of hovering fliers can markedly increase their metabolic power inputs and mechanical power outputs above those required for basic hovering flight. These elite aerial athletes offer considerable insight into the constraints and demands on animal design for maximal aerobic capacity. Additionally, the similarities shown between the different phyla suggest the existence of common mechanisms and limitations in metabolic and mechanical performance. Insects in particular offer a number of advantages in pursuing questions such as the cause of the allometric scaling of muscle efficiency; this scaling can be examined within families, genera, or species with the additional benefit that insect muscles also perform well in vitro. © 1994, Elsevier Ltd.

We examined whether preservation of the pancreas graft by the two-layer method ameliorates rewarming ischemic injury of the graft during vascular anastomosis and also investigated the energy metabolism of the pancreas graft before, during and after rewarming ischemic period. After flushing with cold University of Wisconsin solution (UW), the pancreas grafts were preserved by the two-layer (UW/perfluorochemical [PFC]) method (group 1) or simple cold storage in UW (group 2) for 24-hr and then autotransplanted. In control, the pancreas grafts were flushed out with cold UW and immediately autotransplanted without preservation (group 3). After completion of vascular anastomosis, vascular clamp was not released until 90, 120, or 150 min of rewarming ischemia, including anastomosis time, has elapsed. After 90 min of rewarming ischemia, graft survival rates were 5/5, 100%, 5/5, 100%, and 5/5, 100% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. After 120 min, all the grafts in groups 2 and 3 failed (0/5, 0%, and 0/5, 0%, respectively), however, all the grafts in group 1 survived (5/5, 100%). Even after 150 min, 1 of 3 grafts in group 1 survived (1/3, 33%). After 24 hr preservation, tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total adenine nucleotides (TAN) levels of the grafts in group 1 were about 2-fold the reference values before harvesting and significantly higher compared with group 2(p < 0.05; p < 0.05). After 120 min of rewarming ischemia, tissue ATP levels in group 1 were 84% of the reference values and significantly higher compared with group 2(p < 0.05). TAN levels of group 1 were also significantly higher compared with group 2(p < 0.05). Two hours after reperfusion, ATP and TAN levels in group 1 were significantly higher than group 2(p < 0.05). There were no remarkable difference between group 1 and group 2 concerning adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels. We conclude that the two-layer (UW/PFC) method ameliorates rewarming ischemic injury of the pancreas graft during vascular anastomosis by increasing tissue ATP concentration and TAN levels during preservation and maintaining tissue ATP and TAN levels during vascular anastomosis. Consequently, ATP levels are rapidly recovered after reperfusion and the graft survives.",,"adenosine triphosphate; anastomosis; animal; article; cold; dog; female; heat; ischemia; jugular vein; male; metabolism; methodology; pancreas; pancreas transplantation; reperfusion injury; spleen artery; splenic vein; tissue preservation; vascularization; Adenosine Triphosphate; Anastomosis, Surgical; Animals; Cold; Dogs; Female; Heat; Ischemia; Jugular Veins; Male; Pancreas; Pancreas Transplantation; Reperfusion Injury; Splenic Artery; Splenic Vein; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028685709

The purpose of this study was to examine the difference in energy metabolism between fresh and warm ischemic pancreases during preservation by this method. First, fresh pancreases were preserved with simple cold storage in Euro‐Collins solution (EC; group 1 A), or by the two‐layer method using EC (group 1B), EC with 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP; group 1C), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, or modified EC (ECM; group 1 d), which contained mannitol in place of glucose for 48 h. ATP tissue concentrations in group 1B were significantly higher than in group 1A (7.91 ± 1.21 vs. 1.21 ±0.31 μmol/g dry weight, P < 0.01) but almost equal to group 1d (7.91 ±1.21 vs. 7.59 ±0.97 μmol/g dry weight, NS). DNP (group 1C) caused a significant decrease in tissue ATP levels in group 1A (0.61 ± 0.07 vs. 7.91 ± 1.21 μmol/g dry weight, P<0.01). Second, pancreases subjected to 60 min of warm ischemia were preserved by simple cold storage with EC (group 2 A) or the two‐layer method using EC (group 2B) or EC with adenosine (group 2C) for 24 h. ATP tissue levels in groups 2 A and 2B after preservation were 1.40 ± 0.46 and 1.56 ±0.40 μmol/g dry weight and graft survival rates were 0/5 (0%) and 0/3 (0%), respectively. However, tissue ATP levels in group 2C after preservation were significantly higher compared with the value before preservation (7.23 ± 2.17 vs. 1.90±0.53/g dry weight, P <0.01) and graft survival rate was 4/5, 80%. Other nucleosides, hypoxanthine, inosine, and adenine did not substitute for adenosine. In addition, studies with [2–3 H] adenosine demonstrated that almost all of the adenosine was converted to adenine nucleotides. This study clearly demonstrated that fresh grafts synthesize, ATP mainly via mitochondrial 6xidative phosphorylation using endogenous substrates. However, after significant warm ischemia, pancreases produce ATP mainly via direct phosphorylation of exogenous adenosine during preservation by the two‐layer method.

In this study, we investigated (a) the effect of factors that seemed to have an influence on energy metabolism in the canine pancreas at the tissue ATP level and (b) graft viability during preservation by the two‐layer method. ATP tissue concentration was determined by high‐performance liquid chromatography and graft viability was assessed on the basis of survival rate following autotransplantation. First, the pancreas was harvested from either 72‐h‐fasted (n= 5) or fed dogs (n= 5) and preserved by the two‐layer Euro‐Collins solution (EC)/perfluorochemical (PFC) method for 24 h. All the pancreatic grafts were viable in both fed and fasted groups. There was also no significant difference in ATP tissue concentration between the two groups (7.48 ± 0.55 vs. 7.03 ± 0.74 μmol/g dry weight, NS). Second, the pancreatic grafts subjected to 60 min of warm ischemia were preserved by either the two‐layer (EC/PFC) or (EC + adenosine/PFC) method for 24 h. Without adenosine, ATP tissue concentration did not recover (1.62 ± 0.26 after warm ischemia vs. 1.56 ± 0.40 μmol/g dry weight after preservation, NS) and all the pancreatic grafts failed. However, provision of adenosine led to restoration of ATP tissue levels (1.90 ± 0.53 vs. 7.23 ± 2.17 μmol/g dry weight, P < 0.01) and four of five grafts functioned immediately and maintained normoglycemia after transplantation. These results clearly demonstrated that the nutritional state of the pancreatic graft before procurement had no influence on ATP tissue level as well as graft viability during 24‐h preservation by the two‐layer method. On the other hand, provision of adenosine during 24‐h preservation enhanced ATP synthesis of the pancreatic tissue, thereby improving viability of the ischemically damaged pancreas.

For model validation, a typical battery was incorporated for energy storage in a stand-alone, renewable power supply system and the experimental results were compared with the algorithm predictions.

The tubes were internally cooled below the freezing temperature and became enveloped in ice. The resulting ice shapes, which formed on the outside surfaces of the tubes, were allowed to stabilize, and their impact on the total steady-state rate of energy exchange between the tubes and the flowing water was investigated. Both in-line and staggered tube-bank geometries were considered, with tests conducted in the low to moderate Reynolds number range (Red = 100-2,000) and for cooling-temperature ratio variations of 0.5 &lt; Θ &lt; 8. The ice formations were directly observed and photographed, and the total heat transfer rate for the tube bank was inferred from a simple energy balance on the system. The ice shapes that formed around the tubes were described by one of three distinct categories: ice formutions with no linkage occurring between any adjacent tubes; ice formations with partial linkage of some adjacent tubes; and, for the staggered tube bank, a complete linkage of a majority of the tubes. The experiments showed that the ice formations dramatically affected the convective heat transfer rate of the tube banks (when compared to nonicing tube banks at the same Red) and that the change in heat transfer rate is dependent on the tube-bank geometry. In the no-link category, the ice formations were found to either increase or decrease the tube-bank heat transfer rate depending on the amount of ice-build accumulation, the staggered configuration showing a greater overall rise with Θ than the in-line geometry. Ice linkage between adjacent tubes was found to be detrimental to the heat transfer rate of the staggered bank; however, the same phenomenon on the in-line tube bank did not seriously impede its heat transfer rate. Correlations expressing the heat transfer behavior of both in-line and staggered tube banks with ice formations at steady state have been developed. © 1994.","forced convection; phase-change phenomena; thermal energy storage","Cold; Convective; Heat Transfer; Ice; Tube Arrays; Cooling; Correlation methods; Energy storage; Flow of water; Freezing; Geometry; Heat convection; Ice; Interfaces (materials); Phase transitions; Reynolds number; Thermal effects; Cold tube bundles; Forced convection; Ice formation; Phase change phenomena; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028671790

Sensitivity testing of the candidate parametrizations is thus an important step in model development. Repeated simulations with the full GCM is burdened by both cost and the burial of sensitivity information in large volumes of generated data. Here we propose the use of a simple climate model with a full hydrologic cycle to perform some of the basic sensitivity experiments and thereby reduce the number of experiments for the three-dimensional GCM. The simple climate model is thus used to screen the multitude of possible parameter-sensitivity experiments. This model is derived from the column model of Koster and Eagleson (J. Climate, 3 (6) (1990) 593-606) and it contains the important one-dimensional physical processes of GCMs. The large-scale convergence of heat and moisture for the atmosphere is parametrized; atmospheric dynamics are therefore neglected in that momentum equations are not solved in this simple climate model. In a series of sensitivity experiments, the influence of some land boundary parameters on the partitioning of the atmospheric precipitation and radiative forcing at the land surface are determined. The role of soil texture, soil column discretization and percolation boundary condition at the bottom of the soil column on surface water and energy balance components are investigated using the simple climate model. © 1994.",,"Climatology; Dynamics; Earth atmosphere; Mathematical models; Moisture; Percolation (fluids); Precipitation (meteorology); Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Surface waters; Textures; Three dimensional; Hydrologic cycle; Land surface boundary; Parameterization; Soil column discretization; Hydrology; Climate; Hydrology; Modelling-Mathematical; Soil Effects; atmospheric precipitation; climate model; hydrological cycle; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028670063

It is assumed that the only other factor of significance to annual water balance is a simple process of water storage, and that the relevant storage capacity is the plant-available water-holding capacity of the soil. Under the assumption that precipitation and potential evaporation vary sinusoidally through the year, it is possible to derive an analytic solution of the storage problem, and this yields an expression for the fraction of precipitation that evaporates (and the fraction that runs off) as a function of three dimensionless numbers: the ratio of annual potential evaporation to annual precipitation (index of dryness); an index of the seasonality of the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation; and the ratio of plant-available water-holding capacity to annual precipitation. The solution is applied to the area of the United States east of 105°W, using published information on precipitation, potential evaporation, and plant-available water-holding capacity as inputs, and using an independent analysis of observed river runoff for model evaluation. The model generates an areal mean annual runoff of only 187 mm, which is about 30% less than the observed runoff (263 mm). The discrepancy is suggestive of the importance of runoff-generating mechanisms neglected in the model. These include intraseasonal variability (storminess) of precipitation, spatial variability of storage capacity, and finite infiltration capacity of land. © 1994.",,"Climate; Evaporation; Rainfall; Soil Effects; climate; interseasonal storage; soil water; water balance; Energy storage; Evaporation; Gravitation; Infiltration; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Runoff; Soils; Water levels; Water supply; Annual water balance; Plant available water holding capacity; Soil water; Spatial variability; Water storage; Hydrology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028668851

Since the retention time for CO2 increases rapidly with depth of disposal, from a few years in the mixed layer up to several centuries as the depth increases beyond 1000 m, deep oceans have been considered as potential storage sites for CO2. However, CO2 collection and disposal consumes energy and produces extra CO2. We show that some of this extra CO2 reaches the atmosphere, so that atmospheric concentrations from systems with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from systems without controls. In some circumstances, they do so rapidly, making marine disposal less favorable than direct atmospheric release.

Lake Barco, in north-central Florida, is shallow, with an average depth of 3 m; Lake Five-O, in the Florida panhandle, is considerably deeper, with an average depth of 9.5 m. As a result, the thermal regime and seasonal evaporation rates of the lakes are different. Evaporation from the shallower lake was higher than that from the deeper lake in the winter and spring. In the late summer and autumn, however, the situation is reversed. Evaporation from the shallow lake is directly related to the amount of incoming shortwave radiation because of its limited ability to store energy. The lag in evaporation at the deeper lake is a function of the greater amount of heat that it seasonally stores and releases. The difference in annual evaporation between Lake Barco (151 cm year-1) and Lake Five-O (128 cm year-1) is related to differences in regional climatic conditions between the two sites. Additionally, higher than normal evaporation rates at the two lakes are probably related to drought conditions experienced in north Florida during 1990, which resulted in higher temperatures and more incoming radiation. Monthly evaporation at Lake Barco could usually be estimated within 10% of the energy-budget evaporation using a constant pan coefficient. This lake may be representative of other shallow lakes that do not store considerable heat. Monthly evaporation at Lake Five-O, however, could not be estimated accurately by using an annual pan coefficient because of the large seasonal influence of change in stored heat. Monthly mass-transfer evaporation compared well with energy-budget evaporation at Lake Barco, but did not compare well at Lake Five-O. These errors may also be associated with changes in heat storage. Thus, the thermal regime of the lake must be considered to estimate accurately the seasonal evaporation rates from a deep lake. © 1994.",,"Evaporation; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Surface waters; Deep lakes; Evaporation losses; Rainfall; Thermal regime; Lakes; Evaporation; Lakes; Seepage; energy budget; evaporation loss; lake depth; seepage lake; thermal regime; USA, Florida, Barco Lake; Five-O Lake;; Florida; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028666127

Although several aspects and problems related with the building of IICUs are considered in the specialized literature, lack of communication and discussion of the appropriate issues at the appropriate time is the origin of several errors during the planning and building of IICUs. Standards of IICU for respiratory departments have been proposed by the Working Group 'Rehabilitation and Intensive Care' of the Italian Hospital Pneumologist Society. An ideal IICU should include 4-6 beds for a hospital with more than 500 patients. Alternatively, an IICU should have 1-2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants. IICU should be located in the hospital, integrated with, but well distinguished from, the respiratory department, and with easy accessibility to surgery, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), laboratory, radiodiagnostics, cardiology, etc. No more than two beds should be included per room, and isolation should be necessary only for those patients suffering from communicable or infectious diseases, and also for those patients requiring protective isolation or suffering from disorientation or severe emotional disturbance. Limitation of single roam usage is due also to economic considerations; isolation requiring 50-100% more personnel per bed than an open ward. Individual continuous monitoring should be allowed. Visits and nursing by relatives and/or care-givers should be encouraged, with appropriate spare and facilities. Specific equipment for the IICU (drugs, linen, nursing articles) should be stored in the unit, and a small kitchen and washing room for cleaning and disinfecting certain articles should be considered. It must be remembered that some equipment offers particular storage difficulties, such as mechanical ventilators, mobile X-ray, echography apparatus, defibrillators, infusion pumps, monitors, television sets, etc. To treat the patients effectively, it is necessary to utilize sophisticated equipment, requiring a large amount of energy and other supplies. When planning the IICU one should remember that establishing technical limitations will make conversion to a higher level of care impossible. The purpose of this paper is to report architectural standards for Intermediate Intensive Care Units (IICU) especially aimed at the monitoring and treatment of patients with acute respiratory failure and its sequelae.","Accommodation; Equipment; Intermediate respiratory care unit","conference paper; health care organization; hospital bed; hospital building; intensive care unit; Italy; patient monitoring; respiratory tract disease",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028625657

A pulsed KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm was focused on ablation targets in a vacuum chamber. The laser irradiation energy was estimated to 10 J/cm2. Cr underlayer and Co89Cr7Pt4 films were successively deposited on the Si substrate at a rate of 0.012 nm/pulse. At a substrate temperature lower than 350 °C, an in-plane coercivity of 30 nm thick CoCr7Pt4 film deposited on 50 nm thick Cr underlayer was 50 to approximately 150 Oe showing no significant influence by the substrate heating. The coercivity at 450 °C, however, increased to 800 Oe showing a maximum at this temperature. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the magnetic films formed at lower than 350 °C have fcc-Co phase, while the films deposited at 450 °C had hcp-Co phase with the c-axis oriented parallel to the substrate. At temperatures higher than 450 °C, the coercivity decreased concomitant with a disappearance of the oriented hcp-Co phase. The grain size of the films increased from 10 nm to 20 to approximately 30 nm by increasing the substrate temperature. The increase of coercivity is probably due to annealing effects resulting in the grain growth of Cr underlayer and the phase transformation of the magnetic films to form the hcp-Co phase.",,"Ablation; Annealing; Chromium; Cobalt alloys; Coercive force; Crystallography; Grain size and shape; Magnetic film storage; Magnetic properties; Silicon; Substrates; Thermal effects; Cobalt chromium platinum/chromium thin films; Excimer laser ablation deposition; X ray diffraction; Magnetic thin films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028604154

Using computer reservoir simulation to predict gas storage reservoir performance, we present specific procedures for optimization of gas storage reservoir performance for two different problems. The first is maximizing working gas volume and peak rates for a particular configuration of reservoir, well and surface facilities. We present a simple procedure to determine the maximum performance with a minimal number of simulation runs.

Inflections in the permeability and diffusivity plots versus 1/T(K) provide an indirect indication of the glass transition; these values are in satisfactory agreement with the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) measurements. Both uniaxially drawn and undrawn films were evaluated and the permeability values were correlated with the % crystallinity (determined by wide angle X-ray scattering and DSC) that developed on storage. The incorporation of sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose) in the starches and their subsequent storage at 20°C was related to the process of crystallization. Fructose and glucose, for example, induce an increase in the rate of crystallization but decrease the permeability, diffusivity and solubility, whereas sucrose, by retarding the crystallization, has precisely the contrary effects. The synergistic action of sugars and water in lowering the glass transition (Tg) by plasticizing the potato and rice starch films is explicable in terms of the Couchman-Karasz equation if not complicated by phase separation. The values of the activation energies determined by experiment coincide with those calculated theoretically from given models where the % crystallinity is an important factor, which confirms the significance of crystallinity in the permeability of such films. © 1994.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Crops; Crystallization; Diffusion in solids; Drawing (forming); Films; Food storage; Glass transition; Mathematical models; Mechanical permeability; Solubility; Sugars; Couchman Karasz equation; Crystallinity; Differential scanning calorimetry; Potato starch; Rice starch; Wide angle X ray scattering; Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028603938

The second function is one of renewal where released material is mobilized to become available for the next exploitive phase. That pattern is discontinuous and is dependent on the existence of multistable states.

Here we report on the isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization of dry amorphous indomethacin in the temperature range of 20 °C above and below its Tg. These studies were carried out with two amorphous samples having different degrees of metastability relative to the crystalline state. It was shown that in both samples significant crystallization to the most stable polymorphic form occurred over several days when stored below Tg, and in some cases this process was preceded by the relaxation of one amorphous form to the other. At storage temperatures near to and above Tg the rates of crystallization increased as expected but a second less thermodynamically stable polymorph also appeared with the more stable crystal form. This behavior was explained by the possible relationship between the degree of metastability relative to the crystalline state of each amorphous form and the interfacial energy existing at the respective nucleation sites, in accord with the Ostwald step rule.

Often, in hot regions the outside air is so hot during the day that cooling by ventilation is of no benefit until the evening when the outside air cools. Ventilation can then be beneficial, and can be promoted by a sun-warmed cavity or ‘solar chimney’ added to a building on the sunward side. The cavity may be of any material of high thermal capacity. Heat from the sun is stored within the walls and heats the air within. The cavity is closed at the top and bottom by dampers. These, when opened in the evening, allow the buoyant hot air contained within to rise, drawing cooler outside air into the building. This process continues until the stored energy is consumed. The performance of a typical cavity in inducing ventilation into a house is studied experimentally and theoretically. The measurements are made on a full-scale model under steady-state conditions. Cavity width and air inlet area are important parameters in this study. Measurements are made on the temperature and velocity of the air. Observations on air flow patterns in the room and the cavity are made. A dynamic model is developed based on a finite-difference technique, and used to examine the performance of the cavity in various circumstances. The results show that air movement can be produced by a sun-warmed cavity if the dimensions of inlet and cavity width are kept to certain values, and that thermal comfort can be improved. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Carbon sinks in forests (above and below ground), C02 emissions from deforestation, planting trees for carbon storage, and biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels are some of the key issues which arise. This paper assesses various forestry strategies and examines land availability, forest management, environmental sustainability, social and political factors, infrastructure and organisation, economic feasibility, and ancillary benefits associated with biomass for energy. Halting deforestation is of paramount importance and should have priority above all other options, although it will not be easy to implement for a variety of well known reasons. There is also great potential for reforestation of degraded lands, agroforestry and improved forest management. We conclude biomass energy plantations and other types of energy cropping could be a more effective strategy for carbon mitigation than simply growing trees as a carbon store, particularly on higher productivity lands. Use of the biomass produced as an energy source has the added advantage of a wide range of other environmental, social and economic benefits. The constraints to achieving environmentally-acceptable biomass production are not insurmountable. Rather they should be seen as scientific and entrepreneurial opportunities which will yield numerous advantages in the long term. © 1994.","agroforestry; biomass energy; Biomass energy; C02; environmental sustainability; fossil fuel substitution; land availability; plantation management","Agronomy; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Management; Social aspects; Agroforestry; Deforestation; Environmental sustainability; Forest management; Infrastructure; Political factors; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028593007

We recently showed that, under controlled eucaloric dietary conditions, CS stimulates lipolysis without increasing oxidation of fat and that cessation of CS does not result in a rebound tendency to synthesize or store fat. We asked here whether the ad libitum intake of surplus dietary energy interacts with the metabolic effects of CS or its cessation. Eight male heavy smokers were allowed ad libitum food intake in a metabolic ward, 1 wk in CS phase and 1 wk in non-CS phase, followed by 4 wk of outpatient non-CS and a repeat 7-day study. De novo hepatic lipogenesis (DNL), lipolysis, substrate cycling of free fatty acids (FFA), hepatic glucose production, and energy expenditure were measured by using a multiple stable-isotope infusion protocol and indirect calorimetry. Surplus dietary energy intake (&gt;150% of predicted energy needs) occurred in five of eight subjects (2 subjs &gt; 5,500 kcal/day, 3 subjs &gt; 4,000 kcal/day) with weight gain of 1-4 kg/wk, but with no difference between CS and non-CS phases. Acute CS significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) serum FFA concentrations (58%), FFA flux (63%), and glycerol flux (36%); nonsignificantly increased extra-adipocyte (hepatic) esterification of FFA (125%, P = 0.10) and resting energy expenditure (4.1%, P = 0.22); and did not change adipocyte reesterification of FFA or whole body oxidation of fat. Basal metabolic parameters (after overnight abstention from CS) did not differ between phases. Fractional DNL correlated significantly with excess energy intake (r2 = 0.39) and with percentage of total energy needs provided by carbohydrate (r2 = 0.47). The absence or presence of CS did not affect the increase in fractional DNL in subjects with excess energy intake, however. We conclude that cessation of CS does not result in a rebound tendency to synthesis or storage of fat, even in the presence of positive short-term energy balance, contrary to previous suggestions. Moreover, stimulation of lipolysis by CS does not increase oxidation of fat and thereby protect against fat deposition under conditions of surplus energy intake. The prevention of weight gain after cessation of CS, whether or not nicotine is provided, should focus on energy balance (calorigenesis as well as intake) rather than specific alterations in lipid metabolism.","body weight; energy expenditure; fat synthesis; mass isotopomer distribution analysis; surplus energy intake","fatty acid; adult; article; caloric intake; calorimetry; cigarette smoking; energy expenditure; human; human experiment; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; liver metabolism; male; priority journal; smoking cessation; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028592648

In this paper we present results of cyclic voltammetry and laser flash photolysis experiments which demonstrate that Methylene Blue may function also as a photochemical reductant. Laser flash photolysis studies of Methylene Blue were carried out in aqueous solution at pH 10, in ethanol and in aqueous dispersions of lipid vesicles in the presence of benzoquinol, benzoquinone and the long-chain naphthoquinone Vitamin K1. Both the quinones and the quinol affected the transient of the decay of triplet Methylene Blue to its ground electronic state.

Carbon sinks in forests (above and below ground), CO2 emissions from deforestation, planting trees for carbon storage, and biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels are some of the key issues which arise. Halting deforestation is of paramount importance, but there is also great potential for reforestation of degraded lands, agroforestry and improved forest management. We conclude biomass energy plantations and other types of energy cropping could be a more effective strategy for carbon mitigation than simply growing trees as a carbon store, particularly on higher productivity lands. Use of the biomass produced as an energy source has the added advantage of a wide range of other environmental, social and economic benefits. The constraints to achieving environmentally-acceptable biomass production are not insurmountable. Rather they should be seen as scientific and entrepreneurial opportunities which will yield numerous advantages in the long term. © 1994.","biomass energy; CO2; environmental sustainability; Forest strategies; fossil fuel substitution; land availability","Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Particulate emissions; Biomass energy plantations; Environmental sustainability; Forest strategies; Global carbon balance; Land availability; Biomass; biomass energy; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; forestry; fossil fuel; global carbon balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028563056

P3E 2C6, Canada","Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) is developing a concept for the permanent storage of Canada's nuclear fuel wastes. As of 1992, the concept was based on in-floor emplacement of waste canisters within an engineered repository constructed at depths of 500-1000 m in plutonic rocks of the Canadian Shield. Canadian law requires that the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office (FEARO) undertake a formal review of the concept before AECL proceed with site selection and design. In preparation for this upcoming review, the federal ministry which is responsible for the environment, Environment Canada, commissioned a small panel to undertake an overview of the concept. The sole purpose of the panel's work was to identify issues of potential importance to the safety and acceptability of the storage concept, so that the future review process could be appropriately focused on these key issues. Although fracture mechanics research has made much progress in understanding rock mass failure in terms of fundamental fracture initiation, propagation and interaction processes, there is still no generally accepted method by which to evaluate the actual fracturing response of a real rock mass in situ. Nevertheless, public review of the repository concept must address the issue of potential rock mass fracturing around the underground openings. The challenge is to do so despite the lack of a generally agreed methodology, in a manner which is practical within tight budgetary limits, acceptable in the context of normal engineering practice, and sensible from a fracture mechanics perspective. The key question is whether simple rock engineering analyses, based on conventional stress-strength comparisons, can be used to assess the potential for near-field fracturing of the rock mass. The goal of the work reported in this paper was to undertake a realistic but limited pre-feasibility level engineering evaluation of the potential for near-field fracturing of the rock mass, particularly in the vicinity of the canister emplacement holes. The approach chosen was based on simple parametric modelling using boundary element analyses. Input parameters were selected to reflect a range of conditions appropriate to batholiths of the Canadian Shield. The results, based on conventional rock engineering stress-strength analyses, were evaluated within the context of current fracture mechanics research views and of engineering judgement derived from experience with rock mass fracturing around deep underground openings in the mines of the Canadian Shield. Results indicate that stress concentration effects will cause fracturing beneath the room floors, and experience suggests that rock damage will be mainly in the form of horizontal slabbing. With time, rock damage may extend over the full 5 m depth of the emplacement holes. These findings suggest that the concept of in-floor storage of the waste canisters must undergo detailed critical review before being accepted as an inherent part of the AECL disposal concept. © 1994.",,"Boundary element method; Fracture mechanics; Mathematical models; Mines; Nuclear fuels; Parameter estimation; Radioactive wastes; Strength of materials; Stress analysis; Batholiths; Canadian Shield; In floor waste canister emplacement holes; Near field rock mass fracturing; Nuclear fuel waste repository; Parametric modeling; Rock engineering stress strength analyses; Underground openings; Rock mechanics; Boundary Element Method; canister emplacement hole; Fracture Mechanisms; In Situ Stress; Radioactive Waste; radioactive waste storage; rock fracture; Canada, Canadian Shield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028562312

Although the basic components of the system consisted of available industrial electronic and mechanical products, certain design and application features involved were noteworthy and could be of reference value to those who wish to conduct similar field measurements. The 85-90 response variables in each broiler house were measured every two minutes and stored every 10 minutes into a battery-powered data logger. Outside climatic data were collected similarly with a local weather station. A central PC was linked to the data loggers via a 75 Ωoaxial transmission cable and communication software. Unattended data acquisition was implemented by automatically retrieving data from the data loggers, storing the data on the PC hard drive, and backing them up on floppy disks. Daily body weight of the broilers was monitored with a stand-alone weighing unit in each house. Each weighing unit consisted of two platform electronic load-cell scales. The unit could display up to 10 days of weight readings. Having operated for three years, the system allowed for collection of an enormous amount of valuable data for various investigations that could not have been obtained otherwise from such commercial-scale broiler facilities. The data enabled the researchers to analyze dynamic environmental profiles; dynamic patterns of energy use; projected energy shavings with alternative building structures and ventilation strategies; feeding and drinking behavior of the broilers, and daily growth performance. General maintenance of the measurement system included periodically refilling water reservoirs (once every 3-5 days) of the fan-actuated psychrometers designed to operate in dusty environment; cleaning (and sometimes adjusting) the psychrometers after each flock; occasionally repairing thermocouples broken by the chickens; and replacing data logger batteries about once every four months. Lightning proved to be the major challenge to the reliability of the system, particularly to the analog outputs of the feed weigh bin scales. © 1994.","Data acquisition; Measurement; Poultry housing","Agriculture; Coaxial cables; Computer software; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Floppy disk storage; Hard disk storage; Maintenance; Personal computers; Psychrometers; Reservoirs (water); Thermocouples; Broilers; Chickens; Computerized measurement; Data loggers; Poultry research; Computer applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028547240

The model is based on a mass and energy balance for the gas-filled cavern and on the Bernoulli equation and energy balance for flow in the wellbore. Cavern equations are solved iteratively at successive timesteps, and wellbore equations are solved within an iteration cycle of the cavern equations.

Four types of storage devices are identified: — electrochemical (batteries); — hydrogen; — electromechanical (flywheels); and — molten salt heat storage. A high-speed flywheel with a small permanent magnet motor/generator has more advantages than any of the other systems and might become a real competitor to the internal combustion engine. A flywheel/motor/generator system for automobiles now becomes practical, because of the technological advances in materials, bearings and solid state control circuits. The motor of choice is the squirrel cage induction motor, specially designed for automobile applications. Some of the special design considerations are: high speed (up to 16000 rpm), high breakdown torque, 83% coil pitch, stranded stator copper wire, and special cooling arrangements. The preferred controller for the induction motor is a forced commutated cycloconverter, which transforms a variable voltage/variable frequency source into a controlled variable-voltage/variable-frequency supply. A modulation strategy of the cycloconverter elements will be selected to maintain a unity input displacement factor (power factor) under all conditions of loads voltages and frequencies. The system is similar to that of the existing automobile, if only one motor is used: master controller--eontroller-motor-gears (fixed)-differential-wheels. In case of two motors, the mechanical differential is replaced by an electric one: master controller--controller-motor-gears (fixed)-wheel.

Since the cask is vertically oriented within the storage facility, it is necessary to investigate the tipping-over stability of the cask subjected to seismic load. In this paper, an evaluation method of the seismic response of the cask subjected to earthquake motions is proposed. Firstly, shaking table tests were conducted using a scaled cask model on a reinforced concrete base, considering a similarity law. According to these test results, the characteristics of the tipping-over response of the cask under sinusoidal waves and natural earthquake waves were investigated, and the tipping-over stability of the cask subjected to seismic load was confirmed. Secondly, based on the assumption that the tipping-over behavior could be treated as a two-dimensional problem, the numerical simulations were carried out by means of distinct element method and compared with the experimental results. As a result, the applicability of this code for seismic response of the cask was made clear. © 1994, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

As the Zr content increases, the first hydriding reaction is completed in a shorter time, but the plateau pressure is sloped and decreases. At a composition of x = 0.05, a maximum hydrogen storage capacity is obtained with a enhanced activation property. Upon pressure cycling of the MmNi4.5Al0.5Zr0.5 alloy, the hydrogen storage capacity is decreased by only 8% after 4300 cycles. From the X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDX tests, new second phases are observed at high Zr content above x = 0.1. The major second phase is confirmed to be the ZrNi3 phase. It is considered that the improved activation properties of the MmNi4.5Al0.5Zrx alloys are caused by the strong catalytic effect of ZrNi3 on the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecule. Among the investigated alloy systems, it is suggested that the most suitable alloy is the MmNi4.5Al0.5Zr0.05 as a new hydrogen storage material due to its the large hydrogen storage capacity, the improved activation behavior and the strong resistance to the degradation in the subsequent cyclic operation. © 1994.",,"Chemisorption; Degradation; Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray analysis; Hydriding reaction; Hydrogen storage capacity; Hydrogenation properties; P C isotherm measurement; X ray diffractometry; Hydrogenation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028532890

Changes in surface chemistry and topography as well as depth of fluorination have been examined using Fourier transform infra-red analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X.p.s.), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry. Even very short exposure times caused a large substitution of the hydrogen atoms by fluorine. No change in surface topography was noticed at magnifications of up to 5000 times with the scanning electron microscope (SEM), but AFM showed that fluorination led to an increase of microroughness. The influence of fluorine or fluorine/oxygen concentration, as well as time of treatment and time of storage before adhesive bonding, on adhesion of polypropylene to steel was investigated with a bending peel test. Significant improvement in peel strength was already achieved with minor fluorination intensity. Increase of fluorination intensity did not lead to further improvement in peel strength. Analysis of the fracture surfaces was carried out with the SEM and by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X.p.s. The findings showed that the samples failed cohesively in the polymer or directly beneath the fluorinated layer.

Many different types of AIP systems are being considered, either for integration into new submarines or for retrofitting to existing submarines by the insertion of an additional section or 'plug'. Based on a generic submarine, this paper presents conceptual designs for fuel cell-based AIP plugs that could be retrofitted to an ocean-going conventional submarine of about 3 000 t displacement. The designs are based on solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells that use hydrogen and oxygen as reactants to produce a nominal 100 MWh of electrical energy. Three hydrogen storage methods are considered: metal hydrides; liquid hydrogen, or hydrogen generated from the reforming of methanol. The metal hydride method is mass limited and requires a longer plug than the other two options. The liquid hydrogen and methanol reforming methods are both volume limited and the plug displacement is much greater than the system mass. To maintain neutral buoyancy, considerable ballast has to be added to the plug, or elsewhere in the submarine. Equipped with a 600 kW fuel cell, the generic submarine's maximum speed on fuel cell alone is about 8 knots. The submarine is much harder to detect, because, at speeds below 8 knots, it does not need to snorkel. With a nominal 100 MWh of electrical energy, the submarine's maximum underwater range is increased by a factor of almost five compared with the range of a single battery charge. The maximum endurance is about 14 days. AT speeds greater than the maximum possible with the fuel cell only, the range and endurance of the submarine is increased considerably when the fuel cell and battery are used together. © 1994.",,"Electrolytes; Hydrogen; Methanol; Oxygen; Retrofitting; Ship propulsion; Submarines; Air independent propulsion; Diesel electric submarines; Hydrogen storage methods; Liquid hydrogen; Metal hydrides; Neutral buoyancy; Underwater performance; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028529890

In response to exercise (50 min of swimming), control rats displayed lower heart, gastrocnemius and liver glycogen levels whereas malnourished rats showed low glycogen levels only in the gastrocnemius muscle. Both control and malnourished rats showed high serum glucose and free fatty acid levels after exercise. In conclusion, protein-calorie malnutrition improved muscle glycogen storage but this substrate was broken down to a greater extent in response to exercise. Malnourished rats were able to perform exercise maintaining high blood glucose levels, as observed in control rats, perhaps as a consequence of the elevated availability of circulating free fatty acids.",,"glycogen; plasma protein; adaptation; animal; animal experiment; article; body weight; female; hematocrit; male; metabolism; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; protein calorie malnutrition; rat; Wistar rat; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Blood Proteins; Body Weight; Female; Glycogen; Hematocrit; Male; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Protein-Energy Malnutrition; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028527255

The most commonly used techniques include internal segregation, containment, and incineration. Other common techniques include grinding, shredding, and disinfection, e.g., autoclaving and chemical treatment followed by landfilling. Of all the available technologies for medical waste treatment and disposal, incineration has been found to be the most effective method overall for destroying infectious and toxic material, volume reduction, and weight reduction in the medical waste stream.

Although no acute radiation consequences are to be expected as a rule, the possibility of Solar Particle Events (SPE) associated with relatively high doses of radiation (1 or more Gray) cannot be excluded. It is the responsibility of physicians in charge of the health of astronauts to evaluate before, during and after space flight activities the functional status of haemopoietic cell renewal. Chronic low level exposure of dogs indicate that daily gamma-exposure doses below about 2 cGy are tolerated for several years as far as blood cell concentrations are concerned. However, the stem cell pool may be severely affected. The maintenance of sufficient blood cell counts is possible only through increased cell production to compensate for the radiation inflicted excess cell loss. This behaviour of haemopoietic cell renewal during chronic low level exposure can be simulated by bioengineering models of granulocytopoiesis. It is possible to define a ""turbulence region"" for cell loss rates, below which an prolonged adaptation to increased radiation fields can be expected to be tolerated. On the basis of these experimental results, it is recommended to develop new biological indicators to monitor haemopoietic cell renewal at the level of the stem cell pool using blood stem cells in addition to the determination of cytokine concentrations in the serum (and other novel approaches). To prepare for unexpected haemopoietic effects during prolonged space missions, research should be increased to modify the radiation sensitivity of haemopoietic stem cells (for instance by the application of certain regulatory molecules). In addition, a ""blood stem cell bank"" might be established for the autologous storage of stem cells and for use in space activities keeping them in a radiation protected container. © 1994.",,"aerospace medicine; animal; article; biological model; blood cell; bone marrow; cosmic radiation; dog; gamma radiation; hematopoiesis; human; mathematics; physiology; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation response; rat; solar energy; space flight; Aerospace Medicine; Animals; Blood Cells; Bone Marrow; Cosmic Radiation; Dogs; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Gamma Rays; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Tolerance; Rats; Solar Activity; Space Flight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028521334

The melting front was found to move in the radial direction inward as well as in the axial direction from the top toward the bottom of the phase change material PCM tube. The speed of the melting front is enhanced by a convection heat transfer mechanism in the melted PCM. The heat transfer rate and, consequently, phase transition time can be altered by changing the water inlet temperature to the heat exchanger.

Its power circuit is simple, since it consists of only one converter. It has three legs to provide 103w 220/110 V output without use of a transformer. For switching control, the BESS is decoupled into differential-mode and common-mode subsystems. Each subsystem has its own inner-loop current-forced switching control mechanism; their current commands at various operating modes are generated by outer-loop controllers. The controllers of the differential mode are designed to control the main voltage (220 V) source, while achieving the desired functions of BESS. As to the common-mode subsystem, its controllers are used to maintain the voltage balance of two subcircuits (110 V circuits) when the utility grid fails, and to keep the current in neutral line of utility grid at zero when the utility grid is in normal condition. The operation principle of the proposed BESS and the design of controllers in various operating modes are described in detail. Some experimental results are provided to show the performance of the proposed BESS. © 1994 IEEE",,"Electric control equipment; Electric converters; Electric currents; Electric power factor; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Power supply circuits; Switching functions; Voltage control; Common mode subsystems; Differential mode subsystems; Outer loop controllers; Switching control; Transformerless battery energy storage system; Voltage balance; Electric batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028516977

The coils are cooled indirectly by supercritical helium in a closed forced flow circuit. To obtain low cable temperatures even at high superconductor losses the helium is recooled with intermediate heat exchangers by boil-off from two pools of liquid helium.

Box 30436, Yanbu AL-sinaiyah 21477, Saudi Arabia","Photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems are widely used due to their simplicity, high reliability and low cost. A directly coupled PV pumping system is the most reliable and least cost PV system. However, the d.c. motor-pump group is not working at its optimum operating point. A battery buffered PV pumping system introduces a battery between the PV array and the d.c. motor-pump group to ensure that the motor pump-group is operating at its optimum point. The size of the battery storage depends on the system economics as discussed hereafter. If the battery is fully charged while solar radiation is available, the battery will discharge through the load while the PV array is disconnected. Hence, a power loss takes place. To overcome the above mentioned difficulty, switched mode PV pumping is proposed in this work. When solar radiation is available and the battery is fully charged, the battery is disconnected and the d.c. motor-pump group is directly coupled to the PV array. To avoid excessive operating voltage for the motor, a part of the PV array is switched off to reduce the voltage. As a result, the energy loss is significantly eliminated. Detailed analysis of the proposed system showed that the discharged water increases by about 10%, compared with the conventional battery buffered system. The system transient performance, just after the switching moment, showed that the system returns to steady state in a short period and the system parameters variation lie within 1% of the rated values. © 1994.","Photovoltaic pumping system; Switching of pumping system","Charging (batteries); DC motors; Energy dissipation; Parameter estimation; Pumps; Solar radiation; Switching; Systems analysis; Switching mode photovoltaic pumping system; Photovoltaic cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028499454

The design goals of the accelerometer are to provide strapdown tactical navigation quality acceleration information throughout a 20 g soft launch phase, 1200 g boost phase, and low-g coast phase environment. The accelerometers must be able to provide acceleration measurements accurate enough to provide a navigational accuracy of 0.5 meter CEP at 500 meters. This translates to an accelerometer capable of measuring a 1200 g acceleration with a resolution of 1 milli-g. The AdKEM missile accelerometer and gyro outputs are used for control stability and midcourse guidance. The successful demonstration of this device offers a myriad of opportunities in both the commercial and military arenas. The operational environment and performance characteristics of the AdKEM accelerometer will be presented. This accelerometer is unique in the fact that it must not only survive but successfully operate through the 1200 g acceleration environment, while providing sufficient sensitivity to resolve applied accelerations down to a 1 milli-g level. This large 1.2 x 106 dynamic range is new for tactical missiles, where dynamic ranges of 104 are typical. Strategic missiles and position location applications have required similarly high dynamic ranges; however, this application is unique in acceleration range of milli-g‘s to g's. Other design requirements imposed on this accelerometer for viability in a tactical application are: minimum cost, size, weight and power consumption and survivability over a wide range operating environment. Crystalline quartz vibrating beam technology has been chosen for this accelerometer application to take advantage of solid state device characteristics. A solid state device with inherently digital output characteristics is desirable for strapdown navigation applications because of interface circuitry simplification, potential lower cost, inherent stability and longer storage life. © 1994 IEEE",,"Electronic guidance systems; Inertial navigation systems; Military engineering; Missiles; Product design; Quartz applications; Solid state devices; Advanced Kinetic Energy Missile; Accelerometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028497837

We propose the following triple-layered hybrid neural network: the first synapse is a one-shot associative memory using the modified Kohonen’s adaptive learning algorithm with arbitrary input patterns; the second one is Kosko’s bidirectional associative memory consisting of orthogonal input/output basis vectors such as Walsh series satisfying the strict continuity condition; and finally, the third one is a simple one-shot associative memory with arbitrary output images. A mathematical framework based on the relationship between energy local minima (capacity of the neural net) and noise-free recall is established. The robust capacity conditions of this multilayer associative neural network that lead to forming the local minima of the energy function at the exact training pairs are derived. The chosen strategy not only maximizes the total number of stored images but also completely relaxes any code-dependent conditions of the learning pairs. © 1994 IEEE",,"Adaptive systems; Algorithms; Associative storage; Computer system recovery; Image processing; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Optimization; Spurious signal noise; Storage allocation (computer); System stability; Walsh transforms; Bidirectional associative memory; Data recovery; Energy function; Local minima; Recall; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028494586

Damages to the disk surface due to the collision between the head and disk have been assessed by measuring the degradation of the recorded signals. The results are as follows. When the inertia acting on the head suspension assembly (HSA) exceeds loading force of the head under shock acceleration, the HSA jumps away from the disk surface and springs back. Its movement is the most essential phenomenon. Higher loading force and less equivalent mass of HSA reduce surface damage. The effect of duration of acceleration on damage is not related to the resonance frequency of the disk but to that of HSA in the axial direction. Thin disks contribute to reduce the damage because of energy loss due to their lower rigidity. In order to improve shock-proof performance, it was demonstrated that a glass disk is much more superior to an aluminum disk in terms of shock resistance because of its high hardness. A stopper mechanism has been newly developed to prevent HSA from jumping away. Finally, much higher shock-proof performance has been realized by means of combining the glass disk and stopper mechanism. © 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

In the circumferential direction the loads and variables are approximated by Fourier series. The shell is modelled through shell ring elements including non‐linear behaviour, coupled with isoparametric continuum ring elements and special infinite elements for the soil and isoparametric pressure ring elements for the fluid. Transient loadings like earthquake excitation and the non‐linearities of the shell and the soil require an analysis in the time domain. To reduce the size of the problem, linear parts of the system are condensed by the substructure technique. The soil region is divided into two parts, a near field permitting non‐linearities like plastification or uplifting of the shell, and a far field for the treatment of radiation of energy. The boundary conditions for the shell footing have a strong influence on the distribution of the axial membrane forces and, hence, on the stability limit, which is mostly governed by plastic collapse and caused by the dynamically activated pressure acting on the tank wall.

The Prometheus-L driver is a 4 MJ KrF master oscillator power amplifier laser system designed to operate at a 5.6 Hz repetition rate. Output pulses from the KrF master oscillator are synchronized with the pulsed-power excitation of the KrF power amplifiers and the launching of the inertial fusion energy (IFE) deuterium/tritium targets. The Prometheus-L laser architecture features 960 5 kJ electric discharge KrF power amplifiers pumping 60 crossed stimulated rotational Raman scattering H2 amplifiers serving as beam accumulators. Pulse compression of the 60 accumulator beams is accomplished in 60 chirped, self-seeded SF6 stimulated Brillouin scattering pulse compressors. Grazing incidence metal focusing mirrors minimize back-streaming radiation damage from the target chamber. This architecture permits the laser driver to deliver spectrally broad-band, temporally complex optical pulses in 60 beam lines to implode the direct-drive IFE targets within a 5 m radius target chamber. The Prometheus-H driver is a 7.8 MJ 4 GeV Pb++ heavy ion (HI) inertial fusion energy system designed to operate at a 3.5 He repetition rate. The HI driver design is based on a short, ramped gradient, 5 MeV accelerator, followed by a longer, 2 km constant gradient, single beam linear accelerator operated in a 50 kHz burst mode to generate sequentially 18 4 GeV beamlets. A two-sided irradiation geometry was developed for indirect-drive HI targets.

Reactions were carried out at room temperature (35°C) using stannous octoate as catalyst. Second order rate constants for the uncatalysed reaction of TDI (1 mol) with HTPB (1 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were also determined and an activation energy of 28.2 kJ mol-1 was found in the temperature range of 40-61°C. Eight copolymer compositions based on urethane methacrylate prepolymer and 10, 30, 50 and 70% (w/w) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) were utilized for sheet fabrication. 1% azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) was used as initiator. An increase in the concentration of MMA in the copolymer or an increase in the prepolymer molecular weight resulted in an increase in turbidity and density of sheets. The increased turbidity may be attributed to the immiscibility of components, i.e. hydrocarbon backbone of HTPB and polar urethane methacrylate and methyl methacrylate moieties. An increase in the room temperature tensile strength, Young's modulus and storage modulus and a decrease in elongation was observed with an increase in MMA content or by a decrease in the prepolymer molecular weight.

This model can apply in high-level injection regions before the onset of the Kirk effect. By comparing with those results obtained from Sukuki's low-level injection model, it is observed that a new high-level injection term, proportional to the square of the hole current density, appears in the injected hole concentration in the polycrystalline silicon emitter and this term vanishes in the limit of low-level injection. As bias increases, Jn and Jps of high-level injection model are less than those of the low-level injection model. In addition, for low-level injection model, β, τf, the base transit time τb, the crystalline silicon emitter transit time τse, and the polycrystalline silicon emitter transit time τpe keep constant for all injection region. However, for high-level injection model, β and τb decreases as bias increases, while τse and τpe increase with increasing bias. τf reaches a minimum and then increases.

These concepts enable power plants with inertially confined plasmas to be economically competitive with other energy sources and provide safety and environmental advantages. A KrF driver employs 960 electric discharge laser amplifiers to enhance driver reliability and target illumination with a loss of one or more amplifiers. A non-linear laser architecture uses Raman accumulator cells to combine and enhance the beam quality and stimulated Brillouin scattering cells for beam compression. Optical delay switchyards maximize the utilization of beam energy to provide proper beam pulse forms to the target. Grazing incidence metal mirrors are the final optical elements that employ a high rigidity SiC support structure and graded thickness aluminum reflective surface material to obtain a life-of-plant optical element with a direct line-of-sight to the target within 20 m of the target. Sixty of these laser beamlines symmetrically illuminate the direct-drive target. A performance and economic systems code determined the optimum laser beam energy as 4 MJ corresponding to a target gain of 124. When pulsed at 5.65 Hz, the fusion power is 2807 MW. To reduce the cost of traditional, lengthy, multiple-beam heavy ion drivers, a single-beam LINAC driver with storage rings was adopted. A charge state of two was used to shorten the length and cost of the driver. An ion energy of 4 GeV reduced the number of beams. The LINAC is rapidly pulsed 18 times. Pulses are contained in storage rings and combined to form 2 prepulse and 12 main beams. These are subdivided to illuminate the indirectly driven target from two sides. Triplet coil sets ballistically focus the beams on the outside of the blanket. Channel transport is proposed to deliver the beams in two 6 mm diameter channels to the target. A total beam energy of 7 MJ is delivered to the target to obtain a gain of 103 and fusion power of 1818 MW at 3.54 Hz. A common reactor design is used for the laser and heavy ion beam systems. Low activation SiC material is used for the first wall and blanket systems. The first wall is protected with a thin film of liquid lead that is evaporated by each microexplosion and recondensed between explosions, thus providing protection and vacuum pumping of target debris. A lithium oxide breeder is cooled with low pressure, high temperature helium that minimizes stored energy and improves system safety and activation. The plant Level of Safety Assurance is one, and waste disposal is class C or better. Double-walled steam generators maintain low tritium permeation to the environment. High-temperature helium and first wall lead coolants are used with a 42% efficient, advanced Rankine cycle to deliver a power output of 1000 MW for both plant designs. All systems were optimized to deliver the lowest cost of electricity. © 1994.",,"Brillouin scattering; Electric discharges; Electricity; Helium; Inertial confinement fusion; Laser beams; Light amplifiers; Linear accelerators; Nonlinear optics; Nuclear power plants; Plasma confinement; Tritium; Brillouin scattering cells; Electric discharge laser amplifiers; Inertial fusion energy reactor; Krypton fluoride driver; Optical delay switchyard; Prometheus L; Target illumination; Fusion reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028484217

Such detectors are currently being designed for the future LHC accelerator at CERN in Switzerland.

The present worldwide energy consumption exceeds already the level of 6000 Gigawatt. It is expected to further increase sharply from the rising demand of energy in the developing countries. This implies enhanced depletion of fossil fuel reserves. leading to further aggravation of the environmental pollution exerting adverse effects on the well being of man kind. Adding the dangers arising from the accumulation of plutonium fission products from nuclear reactors, the quality of life on earth is threatened unless renewable energy resources can be developed in the near future. Photovoltaics is expected to make important contributions to identify environmentally friendly solutions of the energy problem. One attractive strategy discussed in this lecture is the development of systems that mimic natural photosynthesis in the conversion solar energy for the fixation of carbon dioxide. The task to be accomplished by these systems is to harvest sun light to produce electricity or drive an uphill chemical reaction, such as the cleavage of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be subsequently employed to reduce carbon dioxide to produce fuels and chemical feed stocks. Learning from the concepts used by green plants we have developed a molecular photovoltaic device whose overall efficiency for solar energy conversion to electricity has already attained 10%.. The system is based on the sensitization of nanocrystalline films by transition metal charge transfer sensitizers. In analogy to photosynthesis, the new chemical solar cell achieves the separation of light absorption and charge carrier transport. Extraordinary yields for the conversion of incident photons into electric current are obtained, exceeding 90% for transition metal complexes within the wavelength range of their absorption band. Conventional photovoltaic cells for solar energy conversion into electricity are solid state devices do not economically compete for base load utility electricity production. The low cost and ease of production of the new nanocrystalline cell should be benefit large scale applications in particular in underdeveloped or developing countries. These regions of the earth benefit from generous sun shine rendering the availability of a cheap solar cell technology important in view of improving the quality of life and preserving natural resources. Quite aside from its intrinsic merits as a photovoltaic device, the nanocrystalline films development opens up a whole number of additional avenues for energy storage ranging from intercalation batteries to the formation of chemical fuels. These nanocrystalline systems will undoubtedly promote the acceptance of renewable energy technologies, not least by setting new standards of convenience and economy. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Crystalline materials; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Photosynthesis; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Carbon dioxide fixation; Nanocrystalline solar cells; Sensitization; Transition metal charge transfer sensitizers; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028482423

Also, because such devices are associated with an energy storage capability, they are often considered within load management by direct device control programs. Finally, they tend to be responsible for persistent system load transients in a cold load pickup situation. Understanding of the above issues can be greatly enhanced with the availability of a computer model of aggregate electric water heating loads. A physically-based such model is presented and its dynamic properties are investigated via numerical simulation under various operating conditions and parameter configurations.

The MT model can absorb 1 Nm3H2 and is composed of an array of 37 tubes interconnected in parallel. In this case, oil is used for heat exchange.

Capacitors were fabricated on natural diamond using an electrochemical cleaning step with a CVD SiO2 dielectric and an optional carbon implantation to create a nonuniform doping profile. Devices were found to function as integrating photodetectors and were evaluated by the spectral dependence of the transient photocapacitance (PC). We discuss a model that distinguishes between the responses due to inversion layer population and that due to bulk trap occupancy changes. Inversion charge generation was observed at all wavelengths investigated and it dominated the PC transient at photon energies above 3 eV. Possible reasons for this result are discussed and analyzed. We could not demonstrate a suitable way to use carbon implantation to form a surface n-type layer in a MIS device without degrading the device IV properties and eliminating the integrating photoresponse observed on non-implanted devices. These results suggest that diamond charge-storage devices can function only if the diamond surface is prepared properly before device fabrication. © 1994 IEEE",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Photodetectors; Semiconducting diamonds; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor doping; Ultraviolet radiation; Vacuum applications; Diamond electronics; Nonuniform doping; Optical characterization; Transient photocapacitance; MIS devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028465527

Major conclusions were that: (1) Annual solar fractions of between 80% and 95% seem to be feasible with a load matching collector used with moderate energy storage, with 80-90% being a likely optimum; (2) CPC reflectors always gave the best annual output performance per unit of mirror area, and the lowest receiver area for situations of constant annual load, regardless of whether the storage is included in the system; (3) Asymmetrical concentrators are more cost-effective for strongly seasonally asymmetrical load patterns; (4) Fixed parabolic systems required much more receiver area than the symmetrical CPC and asymmetrical systems investigated; (5) Cooncentration levels utilizable in fixed systems are higher than previously supposed, with 3.5:1 in an asymmetrical reflector being optimal or nearly optimal for the domestic load pattern used in the study; (6) Using a load matched reflector, the amount of storage required to achieve solar fractions of total thermal energy (space heating, water heating, clothes drying) above 90% in a residence appears to be much lower than previously thought. © 1994.",,"Computer simulation; Reflection; Thermal effects; Evacuated tube solar receiver; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028465393

Here we report a scanner of novel design with an improved optical detection device which gives highly increased spatial resolution (40 μm effective pixel size) and an optimal detection efficiency with a DQE of about 0.9. These properties are comparable to values published on slow-scan CCD cameras. Using subsequent scans of the same IP (which could register an image, an electron diffraction pattern or a parallel EELS recording) a linear dynamic detection range of almost 5 orders of magnitude is possible. We discuss how these properties of the IP scanner system could be utilized in future applications. © 1994.",,"Efficiency; Electron diffraction; Electrons; Image processing; Information retrieval; Microscopic examination; Optical devices; Optical resolving power; Scanning; Digitized image; Image plate scanner; Spatial resolution; Optical systems; article; electron energy loss spectroscopy; electron microscopy; image analysis; optics; scintiscanning; Ips",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028464830

The low temperature a-phase structure of PG is body-centered tetragonal and that of Tris is orthorhombic. The high-temperature phase structure of both compounds is face-centered cubic. Polymorphic changes in the structure occur at 89°C for PG and 135°C for Tris. These compounds are dielectrics at low temperature with conductivities on the order of 1CT8 fT1 cm-1 (at 21°C) and 10–9 fT1 cm-1 (at 25°C), for PG and Tris, respectively. Heating samples from room temperature leads to an initial decrease in a-phase conductivities followed by an increase for both of these compounds as a result of proton hopping. Continuous increases in the conductivity were observed at the transition temperature, with discontinuity evident in the case of PG. The conductivity variations in the a and ‘y-phases have been found to be thermally activated. The activation energies are nearly equal suggesting similar conduction mechanisms and charge carriers. From the relaxation time data, an equation has been obtained for the charge carrier self-diffusion coefficient for the y-phase of PG, just above the transition temperature; D (T) = 0.085e“57,167/RT The conductivity in the ‘y-phases are independent of the frequency in the range of 10 to 103 Hz.

In superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems the postulated design includes baths 20 m high housing superconductive coils. It is of interest to determine how natural circulation evolves in such a bath when a significant number of turns become normal, and what additional heat capacity is afforded by natural circulation. In this paper the circulation velocity resulting from the natural convection process is evaluated. A coupled set of energy, mass and momentum equations is solved in two dimensions. These equations are formulated using the two-fluid model, which describes He II as consisting of two interpenetrating fluids, the normal and superfluid. They are also solved for a one-fluid model treating He ll as a single fluid. The two models are compared to show that the two-fluid model illustrates the existence of a counterflow resulting from the motion of the two fluids with or opposite to the applied heat flux. A well established single-fluid numerical method, the marker and cell (MAC) method, has been adapted to solve the two-fluid equations. Results indicate that natural convection cells in superfluid helium evolve in a fundamentally different way than those in ordinary fluids, because of the counterflow that develops in the presence of temperature gradients. © 1994.","hellum; natural convection; two-fluid model","Cooling; Flow of fluids; Fluids; Helium; Numerical methods; Specific heat; Superconducting magnets; Thermal conductivity; Thermal gradients; Heat flux; Helium bath; High housing superconductive coils; Marker and cell method; Natural circulation; Superconducting magnetic energy storage; Two fluid model; Heat convection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028462821

When the precrack plastic zone exceeds a critical value, crack extension thereafter will be effectively contained within the domain of the plastic zone and result in ductile fracture. Whether a specimen will fail in a ductile mode or a brittle mode is actually already being decided before the onset of crack initiation. The precrack elastic storage energy, total input energy minus hysteresis energy, is the major driving force to strain the crack tip for crack initiation. A higher testing temperature with lower yield stress converts a greater fraction of the input energy into the precrack hysteresis energy and relieves the storage strain energy available for crack initiation. A polycarbonate‐toughening mechanism of incrasing temperature is very similar to the presence of rubber by reducing yield stress and increasing the precrack plasticity. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The model draws on published estimates of the main processes believed to affect the fate of CO2 during this period: chemical weathering, regolith uptake, polar cap formation, and atmospheric escape. Except for escape, the rate at which these processes act is controlled by surface temperatures which we calculate using a modified version of the Gierasch and Toon energy balance model (1973, J. Atmos. Sci. 30, 1502-1508). The modifications account for the change in solar luminosity with time, the greenhouse effect, and a polar and equatorial energy budget. Using published estimates for the main parameters, we find no evolutionary scenario in which CO2 is capable of producing a warm (global mean temperatures &gt;250 K) and wet (surface pressures &gt;30 mbar) early climate, and then evolves to present conditions with ∼7 mbar in the atmosphere, &lt;300 mbar in the regolith, and &lt;5 mbar in the caps. Such scenarios would only exist if the early sun were brighter than standard solar models suggest, if greenhouse gases other than CO2 were present in the early atmosphere, or if the polar albedo were significantly lower than 0.75. However, these scenarios generally require the storage of large amounts of CO2 (&gt;1 bar) in the carbonate reservoir. If the warm and wet early Mars constraint is relaxed, then we find best overall agreement with present day reservoirs for initial CO2 inventories of 0.5-1.0 bar. We also find that the polar caps can have a profound effect on how the system evolves. If the initial amount of CO2 is less than some critical value, then there is not enough heating of the poles to prevent permanent caps from forming. Once formed, these caps control how the system evolves, because they set the surface pressure and, hence, the thermal environment. If the initial amount of CO2 is greater than this critical value, then caps do not form initially, but can form later on, when weathering and escape lower the surface pressure to a point at which polar heating is no longer sufficient to prevent cap formation and the collapse of the climate system. Our modeling suggests this critical initial amount of CO2 is between 1 and 2 bar, but its true value will depend on all factors affecting the polar heat budget. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.",,"carbon dioxide; article; astronomy; atmosphere; chemical model; cold climate; greenhouse effect; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Exobiology; NASA Discipline Number 52-80; NASA Program Exobiology; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Exobiology; NASA Discipline Number 52-80; NASA Program Exobiology; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Cold Climate; Evolution, Planetary; Greenhouse Effect; Mars; Models, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028439688

In this method, the heat transfer in one direction is decoupled from that in the other direction by changing the second partial differential in the direction where the phase change is less dominant to a finite difference form and solving the problem in the other direction with an analytical solution that accounts for the motion of the interface in a phase-change problem. The solution developed in this paper is thus independent of the equations used to represent the interface as well as the conditions imposed on the boundaries. In the present paper, the method has been applied to the tracking of a single melting front formed by different phases assuming equal properties.

If the cold-rolled equiatomic TiNi alloy is subjected to a reversed martensitic transformation (RMT) at temperature &lt; 300°C, the strengthening effect induced by cold-rolling can significantly improve the alloy's characteristic shape memory effect (SME) and pseudoelasticity (PE) by raising the critical shear stress for slip.

This work collates relevant scientific studies to assist in investigation of the possibility of combustion hazards posed by these systems. It is envisaged that it will serve as an initial assessment in an area where industry acknowledges that insufficient information exists. A simple method is presented for characterizing liquid leaks in terms of their potential to atomize, which is considered a necessary condition to give rise to a flammable atmosphere. A cloud of very finely atomized liquid near stoichiometric concentration is shown to be hazardous with regard to a 'low-energy' spark. Empirical formulae for estimating the initial 'average' droplet size and the functional form of the volume of fuel contained in droplets that are less than a particular droplet size for this type of leak give an indication of the nature and potential severity of the hazard. These correlations need to be validated for use outside their ranges of applicability or to be updated. Information collated here facilitates what is likely to be a very conservative assessment of the hazard potential. Identification of areas where there is a dearth of information is just as important, and it is hoped that this paper will provoke further interest leading to improved methodologies for hazard quantification. However, at this stage, it has to be concluded that, even under low pressures, the possibility of creating aerosols that result in flammable systems cannot be eliminated for commonly-handled high-flashpoint liquids. Two practical illustrations, a large-scale study and a real incident, are given to support this conclusion. Finally, in the specific context of area classification, a simple solution to some potentially hazardous aerosol leaks is suggested. © 1994.","area classification; combustion hazard; liquid leaks","Aerosols; Atomization; Codes (standards); Combustion; Flammability; Hazardous materials; Large scale systems; Leakage (fluid); Liquid fuels; Pressure effects; Risk assessment; Storage (materials); Area classification; Combustion hazard; High flashpoint liquids; Liquid leaks; Pressurized atomization; Hazards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028436698

Analyses included effects of conduction in canister walls and solid salt, conduction and free convection in liquid salt, conduction and radiation across salt vapor-filled void regions, and forced convection in the heat engine working fluid. Void shape and location were prescribed based on engineering judgment. The salt phase-change process was modeled using the enthalpy method. Discussion of results focuses on the role of free convection in the liquid salt on canister heat transfer performance. This role is shown to be important for interpreting the relationship between ground-based canister performance (in 1-g) and expected on-orbit performance (in micro-g).

Two features render the proposed approach especially attractive from a computational perspective over conventional fourth order methods. First, the improved (fourth order) accuracy is attained merely by two additional residual evaluations, with no changes in the implementation of the underlying second order method. In particular, no additional storage or extra computations of high order gradients are required. Second, for Hamiltonian systems, the stability properties and possible conservation properties of the underlying second order method, such as energy, momentum and symplectic character, are preserved. The new technique is applied to a number of standard algorithms for elastodynamics, structural and rigid body dynamics. In particular, when applied to the recently proposed (second order accurate) energy-momentum method, this approach results in a fourth order accurate energy, linear and angular momentum conserving algorithm for general Hamiltonian systems. © 1994.",,"Computational methods; Convergence of numerical methods; Dynamics; Elasticity; Structural analysis; Conservation properties; Elastodynamics; Energy momentum method; Fourth order accuracy; Hamiltonian systems; Residual evaluations; Rigid body dynamics; Stability properties; Time stepping algorithms; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028428937

Amorphous Sb100-x-Sex thin films (X = 20 to approximately 65 at%) were deposited on glass plates and Polymethyl-Methacrylate (PMMA) substrate using two-point electron beam deposition and RF magnetron sputtering techniques. The crystallization process of amorphous Sb-Se thin films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An activation energy for the crystallization is estimated by Kissinger's plot and Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (J.M.A) equation. The crystallization temperatures were found to be proportional to the Se concentration (Se≤60 at%) and those of Sb40Se60(Sb2Se3) and Sb67Se33(Sb2Se) films were estimated to be 220 °C and 195 °C respectively by DSC measurements (heated at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min). An activation energy for the crystallization in an Sb67Se33(Sb2Se) film is estimated to be (2.85±0.02)×105 J/mol by Kissinger's plot (from the analysis of the DSC data on the continuous heating) and (2.78±0.02)×105 J/mol by J.M.A equation (from the analysis of the DSC data on the isothermal annealing), and its reaction order is n = 5 to approximately 6 and the frequency factor is ν = 1.61×1029(s-1). It was concluded that the amorphous Sb67Se33(Sb2Se) thin film is sufficiently stable at room temperature for practical use.

Al2O3 composites containing 2-50 mol% TiO2 were produced, which had different oxidizing catalytic activities but nearly the same hardness and thermal conductivity. Activation energy (Ec) for carbon oxidation when it is mixed with the composite was measured to get the oxidizing catalytic activity, and it was found that Ec changed from about 70 kJ/mol for Al2O3 to about 110 kJ/molfor Al2O3 containing 9.1-16.7 mol% TiO2. TiO2 addition increased and decreased Ec. The former was due to segregation of the Ti-Al-O phase at theAl2O3 grain boundary, which could inhibit the catalysis at the Al2O3 grain boundary. The latter was due to the unreacted TiO2 phase, which by itself has high catalytic activity. TiO2-Al2O3 sliders having different Ec were examined in sliding wear against a magnetic disk with a carbon overcoat using a pin-on-disk test system. It was found that wear rate of the carbon overcoat was lower when the slider had a larger Ec, i.e., lower catalytic activity. It was also found that wear particles of the carbon overcoat were likely to be larger with lower catalytic activity. © 1994 ASME.",,"Alumina; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Composite materials; Grain boundaries; Hardness; Oxidation; Segregation (metallography); Thermal conductivity of solids; Titanium dioxide; Wear of materials; Activation energy; Carbon overcoat; Oxidizing catalytic activity; Pin on disk test system; Slider; Magnetic disk storage; Alumina/Titania; Composite Materials; Magnetic Discs; Sliders; Wear Prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028416657

Cows received second-cutting alfalfa hay (20% CP; 40% NDF) from either compressed or standard small rectangular bales at two forage to concentrate ratios (35:65 and 65:35, DM basis). Compressed hay did not affect milk yield, although milk fat content was higher (2.90 vs. 2.68%). Higher concentrate diets increased milk yield (32.2 vs. 28.3 kg/d), lowered milk fat (2.66 vs. 2.91%), and increased milk protein (3.16 vs. 2.99%) and lactose (5.06 vs. 4.99%) with no interaction between concentrate proportion and hay type. Cows fed compressed bales spent less time eating per kilogram of DM and NDF consumed than cows fed standard bales, but rumination time was unaffected by forage processing. For cows fed both types of hay, digestibilities of DM, ADF, and NDF were similar; ruminal liquid outflow rates also were similar, but rate of particulate passage from the reticulorumen was greater for cows receiving compressed hay. Compressing alfalfa hay did not adversely affect forage quality but increased the ease of shipping and handling and minimized storage space requirements. This process may be beneficial when higher milk fat content is desirable or when cows have limited time to consume forage. © 1994, American Dairy Science Association.

The computational method used to solve the present model is discussed briefly. Numerical simulations associated with a 72-m-long tunnel kiln that is used for firing clay bricks were performed. Transient heat conduction in two dimensions in wares and in LBKC were computed. Two oxygen schedules under one firing schedule and three lining brick structures were simulated. The fuel consumption and flow rates of primary air, cooling air, and exhaust flow were investigated under different atmosphere (i.e., oxygen concentration) schedules. The relationship between the fuel consumption and heat storage rate in wares and in LBKC was also studied. The results of the present numerical simulations show that, using the present model, we can predict the following parameters: temperature distributions in wares and in lining bricks and in metal parts of kiln cars; fuel consumption; heat losses; heat storage and heat storage rates in wares, in lining bricks, and in metal parts of kiln cars; gas flow; and exhaust components. The present results disclose that the dynamic characteristic of a tunnel kiln is dominated by the transient heat conduction in wares and in lining bricks.

The paper develops a comprehensive treatment of power flow control using solid-state synchronous voltage sources for shunt compensation, series compensation, and phase angle control. It also describes the unique unified power flow controller that is able to control concurrently or selectively all three network parameters (voltage, impedance, transmission angle) determining power transmission. Comparison of the synchronous voltage source approach with the more conventional compensation method of employing thyristor-switched capacitors and reactors shows its superior performance (including the unmatched capability of using both reactive and real power compensation to counteract dynamic disturbances), uniform applicability, smaller physical size, and potentially lower overall cost. © 1993 IEEE.","AC transmission; energy storage; FACTS; GTO; line compensation; phase-angle regulator; series compensator; static var compensator; synchronous condenser; thyristor","AC ...; Electric power factor correction; Electric power transmission; Energy storage; Phase control; Power control; Thyristors; Dynamic line compensation; Phase angle regulator; Series compensator; Solid state synchronous voltage sources; Synchronous condenser; Unified power flow controller; Electric lines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028405601

Two techniques promise increased range and versatility in accident dosimetry using environmental materials. When fully developed, the techniques will (1) allow determination of the beta plus low energy gamma-ray component of dose by construction of dose vs depth profiles in the outer several millimeters of a sample using TL of ceramic thin sections; and (2) allow direct determination of DX in recent accident situations using the 160°C TL peak of quartz which fades with a half life of approximately 2 weeks at room temperature. The short mean lifetime of this peak allows drainage of the TL signal due to the accrued natural dose, yet retains the signal due to the transient accidental exposure. Collection of samples shortly following an accident with storage at dry ice temperatures should preserve the accident-related signal of the 160°C peak indefinitely. Analysis of quartz samples removed from asphalt (tarmac) indicates that a residual dose as low as 80 mGy may occur in the 160°C TL region due to TL overlap from the 220°C TL peak. This low residual dose means that accident dosimetry using the 160°C TL peak of quartz may be feasible using unfired materials which exhibit trap saturation of the higher temperature TL peaks.",,"Accidents; Ceramic materials; Gamma rays; Numerical methods; Quartz; Storage (materials); Thermoluminescence; Accident dosimetry; Alpha ray; Beta ray; Half life; Trap saturation; Dosimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028405416

Examples of feldspars representative of each major compositional regime of the ternary system are seen to fade, and similarly some are stable. Measured luminescence characteristics (emission spectra, relative luminescence intensities, glow curve shapes) and storage durations at these temperatures do not permit reliable separation of stable signals. In a consequent study to determine if preferential removal of the anomalously fading component by bleaching was possible, the optical bleaching response spectra of selected samples exhibiting representative fading and non-fading behaviour were measured. No preferential bleaching of the anomalous fading component was found, precluding an ""optical wash"" approach for feldspar. These same measurements suggested the IRSL signal originated from one defect type only in all feldspars studied. The ground-to-excited state transition energy was found to be 1.44±0.01 eV (corresponding to ∼861±6 nm) regardless of mineral composition or signal stability. However, the observation of stable IRSL [and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)] from a variety of feldspar species indicates that anomalous fading is not an inherent property of this defect. It was deduced that the anomalous fading mechanism, at least at and above ambient temperatures, is dominated by a quantum-mechanical tunnelling mechanism. As such anomalous fading cannot be circumvented by any current laboratory procedures, monitoring is essential; discovery of significant anomalous fading is a sample rejection criterion. © 1994.",,"Feldspar; Mineralogy; Optical variables measurement; Quantum theory; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray analysis; Anomalous fading; Infrared stimulated luminescence; Optical bleaching response spectra; X ray diffraction; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028404654

The new composite hydrogen storage material in contrast to the native ingredient FeTi, has been found to possess much higher storage capacity and exhibits favourable absorption-desorption kinetics. For Mg-40% FeTi, a storage capacity of ∼3-3.6 wt.% at room temperature (≈27 °C) has been found. This is the highest known capacity exhibited by any hydrogen storage material at ambient conditions.

The ambient condition hydrogenation properties of these composite alloys have been found to be strongly correlated with the structural and microstructural characteristics. Based on the observed structural and microstructural characteristics, the details of hydrogenation behaviour have been outlined in terms of cracking of FeTi matrix on hydrogenation and provision of continued fresh surfaces for hydrogenation of FeTi-Mg, Mg-TiMg eutectic mixtures or FeTi-Mg complexes.

Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in textural attributes between sucrose and polydextrose-aspartame in freshly prepared frozen desserts and few differences after storage (140 d). Polydextrose-aspartame effectively compensated for functional properties that normally are conferred by sucrose and some that are conferred by milk fat. Replacement of milk fat with tapioca dextrin or potato maltodextrin increased coarseness and wateriness and decreased creaminess relative to the control. Perception of chalkiness increased more with increased tapioca dextrin than with increased potato maltodextrin.

These low air flow rates can cause the efficiency of the solar collector to be low and also limit the rate of drying that can be achieved with such systems. Two ways of trying to improve the performance of such dryers are; to use waste fuel to increase the buoyancy forces by heating the air in a chimney attached to the dryer, and to reduce the air gap between the upper transparent cover and the absorber plate in the collector in order to increase heat transfer to the air. This paper, therefore, presents the results of an experimental study in which the effects of heating the air in a chimney fitted to the dryer and the effects of varying the collector gap on the dryer performance have been measured. The tests were done under outdoor conditions in Senegal on two dryers, using four chimney configurations heated with waste sawdust, and using two collectors with air gap heights of 4 and 5 cm. Results indicate that the performance of the dryer can be improved if temperatures in the chimneys are maintained over 50°C above the ambient for more than 4 hrs and if the chimney is at least 2 metres high. Mean drying rates in the dryer can also be improved by reducing the collector air gap height which should not be greater than 4 cm. An order of magnitude analysis which confirmed the overall effect of reducing the collector air gap height is presented. © 1994.",,"Chimneys; Drying; Heated; Solar Power; Energy management; Food preservation; Food storage; Security systems; Wind effects; Food preservatives; Health hazards; Medical problems; Air flow rate; Ambient air temperature; Black chimney; Economic consequences; Open air drying; Air flow rates; Chimney configuration; Grain heating; Solar dryers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028388995

The quantity of ultimate importance is the cost of energy delivered, which has to be optimized along with collector area and storage tank capacity by optimal mixing of conventional energy (by electrical heater or boiler) and non-conventional energy by using solar energy collection devices (hybrid energy analysis). Considering this aspect, a simple techno-economic analysis has been developed with the help of a thermal transient model for finding the technical performance of solar energy systems for calculating the percentage of solar energy contribution for a given consumer hot water demand, at a desired temperature for domestic purposes, using a heat exchanger in the collector loop or without a heat exchanger, and for climatic conditions, as in India. A numerical computation has been done for Indian market conditions and climates, as in Delhi. It has been found that the cost of hybrid energy systems is less than for conventional heating systems. The use of an auxiliary heater inside the storage tank results in wastage of energy due to the larger heat loss from the storage tank because the storage tank is always kept at the desired temperature, and hence, the auxiliary energy consumption is higher. It is observed that the use of an auxiliary heater at the load point is economically feasible. In some areas, where the water quality is bad, it is essential to use a heat exchanger in the collector loop with demineralized water. For very cold climates, the use of an antifreeze solution in the collector loop with a heat exchanger and a separate storage tank is recommended. For forced flow water heating systems used for industrial process heat, the cost of useful energy delivered is 15% higher. © 1994.","Economic modelling; Natural convection; Pressurized and non-pressurized systems; Solar hybrid systems; Techno-economics","Cost accounting; Energy management; Optimization; Power generation; Solar concentrators; Ambient air; Economic modelling; Heat exchanger; Natural convection; Solar hybrid systems; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028388345

The concept of this method has been derived from analysis under the quasi-steady approximation. The prediction should be performed in two separate stages of the solidification process individually. In the first stage -prior to completion of the freezing of phase change material-the similarity function vs. frozen fraction curve can be transformed in accordance with the fact that the heat release fraction is approximately proportional to the frozen fraction. In the second stage after the completion of freezing, where all heat is released as sensible heat, the heat flow rate maintains a linear relation with the heat release fraction.

The frame was designed using finite element analysis with the components of the frame modeled as beam elements. The body, designed to have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, was of graphite/Kevlar/Nomex sandwich construction. Testing was carried out using the three-point bend test to determine the optimal sandwich cross-sectional configuration. The design of the front suspension, the wheel hubs, and the power transmission are also discussed.

Polythiophenes can be both n- and p-doped reversibly and we have tested a number of poly-3-arylthiophenes in order to achieve the best n-doping at thick polymer films. We have found that poly-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-thiophene, in a solution of 1 mol dm-3 tetramethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate in acetonitrile, can be n- and p-doped, both reversibly and to high charge density. Such key properties for high power, energy storage devices have not been demonstrated before with conducting polymer active materials. We propose that the improvement in polymer n-dopability that results from derivitization of thiophene with aryl substituents in the 3-position, is probably achieved thanks to electron transfer from the negatively charged polythiophene backbone to the aryl substituent.

The modern machine is an efficient and adaptable piece of precision engineering, but at the price of increased complexity and cost. The new concept presented here is simpler and, hopefully, cheaper. It exploits the nonlinear expansion of an elastomer ring together with its variable moment of inertia. The combination of elastic and centrifugal energy results in a remarkable energy-speed characteristic that allows the extraction of around 80% of the stored energy for a speed variation of only a few per cent, against a drop of more than 50% for a conventional flywheel. Operating in this optimal mode, the elastomer machine has a lower energy density (∼ 4 Wh kg-1 at best) than its metallic equivalent. However, without allowing for its special characteristics, it is expected that the low cost of, for instance, natural rubber could make the elastomer flywheel competitive with existing machines.

The tracking of the ojbect and the analysis of the motion are discussed for the dynamic images of a nonrigid object with smooth shape, motion and deformation, which is the case in most medical images. This approach is based on an active contour model defined by an energy function in terms of both intra‐ and interframe constraints for the contour of the object. The contour of the target object is extracted and tracked by minimizing the energy function using multiscale dynamic programming and the motion is analyzed. The dynamic programming in multiscale proposed in this paper is to adjust the search neighborhood of the dynamic programming according to the scale. The coarse or fine neighborhood is defined for the coarse and fine scales, respectively, and the nergy is minimized starting from the coarse scale and shifting to the fine scale. By this scheme, a large motion an deformation of the object can be handled. The proposed motion tracking method has been applied successfully to the dynamic image in the “behavioral analysis of a slug aiming at the analysis of the neural mechanism of learning and memory formation in slugs,” as well as to dynamic echocardiographic images. In the first application, the positive maximum of the curvature along the contour is extracted in the motion analysis as a characteristic point invariant to the deformation of the object. Then the shift of that point is traced. By this approach, the rough motion of the object can be estimated.

The model is based on the physical and mathematical properties of the driving point admittance of passive, stable one-port networks. The model parameters, which depend upon the geometry of the waveguide and aperture, are determined from a relatively small number of computed admittances. This computed data is obtained by a full-wave moment method solution and, hence, includes the effects of radiation and energy storage in the near field and the evanescent waveguide modes, The accuracy of the numerical method is demonstrated by comparison with measured values. As an example, the model parameters are determined for the coaxial-line geometry. The accuracy of the model, for both the direct and inverse problem, is verified and a rigorous sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed.

In other words, the energy intake of the obese animal has exceeded at some stage its energy requirement leading to an excessive storage of fat. To overcome such a phenomenon, it is important to define what are the exact energy requirements of dogs and cats. The daily energy requirement of an animal should correspond to the sum of its normal resting energy expenditure, its thermogenesis, and its energy requirement associated with its physical state. The former is affected by intrinsic factors such as body size, body conformation and body composition as well as by environmental parameters (ambient temperature). The latter is affected by the physiological state of the animal (growth, gestation/lactation, ageing) and/or by the amount and type of its activity. The effects of all these factors on the individual energy requirements of dogs and cats will be reviewed here. More scientific information on energy requirements of dogs and cats is clearly necessary to avoid problems of over-or under-feeding. However, there will still be situations where animals become obese because the total energy intake is underestimated. For example, owners often forget to take into account the energy contribution of food eaten outside the regular feeding time. These situations will be discussed because of their importance in the incidence of obesity in pets.","Environmental factors; Growing animals; Obesity; Senior animals; Small animal nutrition","animal food; body composition; body size; caloric intake; cat; conference paper; dog; energy expenditure; environmental parameters; feeding behavior; malnutrition; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; overnutrition; physical activity; physiology; priority journal; thermogenesis; Animal; Cat Diseases; Cats; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Motor Activity; Obesity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028365854

The patterns of lactate and glycerol concentration changed with age. Different initial settings converged to adult values in all groups.

Myoelectric signals from the sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis muscles were amplified over audio speakers to train subjects to relax their musculature. Tolerable levels of bending moments were quite low (less than 10 N m on average for all conditions) given the very large magnitude of bending moment applied to the neck estimated from impact models. Subjects tolerated greater moment and elastic energy storage in the cervical passive tissues during flexion than in both extension and in lateral bending. In addition males were able to tolerate larger applied moments, were stiffer, and stored more energy than females in all loading conditions.

Perhaps hamsters respond to such challenges differently, for example by altering hoarding. In the present experiments, we have begun to question the role of food hoarding in the total energy balance of Siberian hamsters. Therefore, we developed a simulated burrow system, where food was available outside the burrow for consumption and/or hoarding during a 15-h period surrounding the 8-h dark portion of the photocycle. Food hoarding, but not food intake, increased dramatically after 32- and 56-h fasts and was greater following the longer fast. Food-restricted weight-reduced hamsters (80% of ad libitum-fed controls) were refed and given the opportunity to hoard. Initially, when body weights were low, food hoarding was maximal and then decreased gradually to control levels as body weights reached those of the ad libitum-fed controls. Food intake was not affected. Neither hoarding nor food intake was affected by treatment with long-acting protamine zinc insulin, given to enhance the storage of metabolic fuels, at any dose tested. Finally, neither food intake nor hoarding was affected by treatment with the glucose utilization blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose, the fatty acid utilization blocker methyl palmoxirate, or a combination of the two treatments, all at doses that stimulate food intake in laboratory rats. Collectively, these results show that Siberian hamsters respond to food deprivation and restriction by increasing food hoarding but not food intake; however, they do not increase their food hoarding in response to all energetic challenges. These data suggest that hoarding in Siberian hamsters is more responsive to shifts in long-term energy stores (fat) than to short-term fluctuations in metabolic fuel availability. Finally, it should be noted that food intake and food hoarding were dissociated from one another, suggesting different underlying neural/hormonal bases for the behaviors.","body fat; body weight; food intake; metabolic fuels; photoperiodism","deoxyglucose; insulin zinc suspension; isophane insulin; palmoxiric acid methyl ester; animal experiment; article; circadian rhythm; controlled study; diet restriction; energy balance; food deprivation; food intake; glucose utilization; hamster; male; metabolic rate; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; priority journal; weight reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028351829

The goal of the training diet is to provide adequate energy for weight maintenance, and 7-10g of carbohydrate per kg body weight for maximizing glycogen storage. Nutritional needs for competition include eating prior to and after matches. Consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods for energy needs and glycogen resynthesis are key behaviours soccer players need to focus on daily. Qualified dietitians should be on hand to provide personal nutrition counselling, carbohydrate resource lists and education on food labels as simple and quick nutrition education strategies to guide soccer players, their parents, coaches and trainers towards improved food selections.","Carbohydrate resource lists; Food labels; High and low glycaemic foods; Nutrition counselling; Training diet","glycogen; athlete; body weight; carbohydrate intake; competition; conference paper; counseling; dietary intake; dietitian; energy balance; fat intake; fluid intake; food composition; glycogen muscle level; health education; human; nutritional requirement; physical performance; protein intake; training",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028338725

These measurements were performed in a rat liver transplantation model. In a first set of experiments, the time for 50% survival of grafts preserved with UW solution or saline solution was determined. Grafts preserved with UW solution could be cold-stored for 19.9 h and grafted with a 50% success rate. The corresponding figure for saline-preserved grafts was 6.2 h. The energy status and water content of liver grafts preserved with UW solution for 19.9 h and livers preserved with saline solution for 6.2 h were compared. There were significant differences between livers preserved with UW solution and saline solution for ATP (p < 0.01), total adenine nucleotides (p < 0.05), ATP/ADP (p < 0.05) and energy charge levels (p < 0.05). ATP concentrations in the donor livers did not decrease significantly during cold storage when the success rate decreased from 100 to 0% after liver transplantation. The livers preserved with NaCl solution took up water during preservation. In contrast, the water content was reduced slightly in the livers preserved with UW solution and the differences were significant at all times. During cold storage using either the UW solution or saline solution for preservation, there were no significant time-related changes in the water content of the liver graft when the posttransplantation success rate decreased from 100 to 0% after liver transplantation.

Initial exposure to a short photoperiod results in body fat loss that reverses after ~22 wk of short-day exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Siberian hamsters are able to recover body fat after surgical reduction of total lipid stores and if so, whether this ability is photoperiod dependent and fat pad specific. Either the largest pair of internal fat pads, the epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) or one pair of two large external depots, the inguinal (IWAT) fat pads, were removed from male hamsters housed for 22 wk in a long (LD) or short (SD) photoperiod. Retroperitoneal fat pad (RWAT) mass was increased in LD EWAT- and IWAT- lipectomized hamsters. IWAT mass also was increased in the LD EWAT- lipectomized hamsters. Neither SD-lipectomized group compensated for body fat loss in any of the measured fat pads. Increased food intake was not necessary for total body fat recovery, but undereating partially may be responsible for the lack of recovery in SDs. The results of these experiments demonstrate a photoperiod-dependent ability of male Siberian hamsters to regulate total body fat after partial lipectomy. In addition, recovery involves a fat pad- specific compensatory response to partial lipectomy, rather than a general increase in lipid deposition in all fat depots.","adipose tissue; body weight; energy balance; food intake; obesity","fat; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; body fat; body weight; controlled study; energy balance; food intake; lipectomy; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; obesity; Phodopus; photoperiodicity; priority journal; seasonal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028325981

Major innovations have occurred in pulse generators and in lead systems. This may increase ICD use for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Pulse generators now include hybrid pacemaker-defibrillators. Clinical data suggest a need for demand pacing in primary and secondary prevention applications, with antitachycardia pacing being most valuable in the latter group. Atrial leads will allow dual chamber sensing, pacing, and defibrillation. Low energy cardioversion with biphasic shocks can enhance shock efficacy in rapid monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and flutter. Modifications of lead design, biphasic shock waveforms, and optimal thoracic electrode location in axillary or pectoral regions will permit lower energy defibrillation and smaller pulse generators with lower maximum energy outputs of ≤25 joules. Dual chamber sensing will improve detection of atrial flutter or fibrillation. Minimum data storage requirements for tachycardia events in ICDs still need to be defined. Intracardiac electrogram analysis is still in evolution, and better analytic methods are awaited. Lead system development is likely to support generic pacing and defibrillation catheter electrodes for atrial and ventricular application. Advances in thoracic electrode design are in progress, and a variety of intercostal electrodes are being tested. Improvements in lead design with further impact on defibrillation energy requirements have the potential to permit generator miniaturization.

Cyanothece sp. ATCC strain 51142 is an aerobic, unicellular, diazotrophic cyanobacterium that fixes N2 during discrete periods of its cell cycle. When the bacteria are maintained under diurnal light-dark cycles, N2 fixation occurs in the dark. Similar cycling is observed in continuous light, implicating a circadian rhythm. Under N2- fixing conditions, large inclusion granules form between the thylakoid membranes. Maximum granulation, as observed by electron microscopy, occurs before the onset of N2 fixation, and the granules decrease in number during the period of N2 fixation. The granules can be purified from cell homogenates by differential centrifugation. Biochemical analyses of the granules indicate that these structures are primarily carbohydrate, with some protein. Further analyses of the carbohydrate have shown that it is a glucose polymer with some characteristics of glycogen. It is proposed that N2 fixation is driven by energy and reducing power stored in these inclusion granules.

The gains of the proposed auxiliary controller are determined by a pole assignment method where the eigenvalues of the torsional modes are placed at a prespecified position. Eigenvalue analysis and computer simulations of the studied system show that the SMES unit provides adequate damping torque over a wide range of operating conditions.

The post-harvest losses of these commodities in developing countries are very high mainly due to lack of storage and processing facilities. The development of processing facilities close to the growing areas is necessary to reduce the losses. The technology for dehydration of vegetables is either traditional or very advanced. Hence the need for an intermediate level technology was realized and an effort was made to solve this problem by developing a small scale dryer. The dryer was tested with different vegetables (cauliflower, cabbage and onion). At a constant air inflow rate of 0·33 m3/s, it took about 11 h to reduce the percent moisture content dry basis/wet basis from 1260·56 dry basis (92·65 wet basis) to 8·69 (8), 14 h from 1233·33 (92·50) to 8·69 (8) and 12 h from 900 (90) to 8·11 (7·5) with inlet air temperatures of 65, 55 and 56°C respectively for 50 kg batches of cauliflower, cabbage and onion slices. The overall energy utilization efficiencies of the dryer for these vegetables were 30·83, 28·21 and 29·51% respectively. The cost of the dryer was Indian Rs 12000 (US $480) and the estimated costs of processing cauliflower, cabbage and onion slices were Rs 2·16 (US $0·086), Rs 2·76 (US $0·11) and Rs 2·37 (US $0·095) per kg of raw material. © 1993.",,"Crops; Developing countries; Drying; Food processing; Food products; Small capacity vegetable dryer; Dryers (equipment); Allium cepa; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Brassica oleracea var. capitata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028315767

Solar thermal and geothermal energy sources produce only heat and, from heat, electricity. Power plants using solar photovoltaic, wind, tidal and ocean thermal gradients only produce electricity. Solar energy collected as biomass can yield carbon-based chemical fuels that can be handled in the same manner as fossil fuels, but like fossil fuels they are more valuable for other uses and can cause significant pollution. No matter what future combination of these energy sources is adopted there are many important uses for energy that cannot be satisfied with heat, electricity or biomass fuels.

The NE concentration was adjusted to keep the mass-specific metabolic rate (MR) roughly either 100 or 50% above its thermoneutral level. At both doses, no genotype difference in total MR occurred before day 16, but between 16 and 21 days of age, total MR of fa/fa pups was 10% less than that of their Fa/fa littermates. The 21-day-old fa/fa pups had ~ 1 g more body fat than their lean littermates, and this was energetically accounted for to 50-80% by their lower MR and to 10-25% by the reduced growth of their fat-free dry mass. We conclude that factors not dependent on decreased sympathetic outflow trigger the onset of excess fat deposition in the 3rd postnatal wk, even if sympathetic activity was high throughout the previous weeks during which excessive fat deposition is mainly dependent on decreased thermoregulatory thermogenesis.","energy balance; nonshivering thermogenesis; sympathetic nervous system; thermoregulation","adrenergic system; animal experiment; article; energy balance; lipid storage; metabolic rate; nonhuman; nonshivering thermogenesis; obesity; postnatal development; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028312130

Parameters included the effect on growth of corneal cells, retention of metabolic activity of human and rabbit corneas under storage, and the integrity of the endothelium and physiological function of the cornea in vivo. The experiments revealed that β-hydroxybutyrate enhances the growth of all three cell types of rabbit corneas, with an optimal concentration estimated at about 12–15 mM of D, L- racemic mixture. It is more efficient than glucose for elevating the tissue energy charge. When stored in an NaHCO3-free isotonic medium supplemented with β-hydroxybutyrate at 4°C, lactate production and accumulation in the cornea were reduced by &gt;85% and metabolic activity was retained at a markedly high level for at least 11 days, as opposed to about 3 days when stored in McCarey-Kaufraan medium. When β-hydroxybutyrate in a balanced salt solution was infused into the anterior chamber, the cornea performed its physiologic function normally without NaHCO3 and no remarkable postoperational changes in morphology and density of endothelial cells were evident. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that nonlactate-generating metabolites are efficient substrates for donor tissues. No NaHCO3 supplement is needed when β-hydroxybutyrate is used. The solution is therefore stable in pH, and thereby favorable for clinical applications. © 1994 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"3 hydroxybutyric acid; drug metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior eye chamber; article; cat; drug efficacy; experimental model; graft preservation; lactate blood level; male; metabolic balance; nonhuman; organ donor; priority journal; rabbit; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Adenine Nucleotides; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animal; Cell Division; Cornea; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycolysis; Human; Hydroxybutyrates; Kinetics; Lactates; Male; Middle Age; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Rabbits; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors; Tissue Donors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028306976

The hearts, flushed with a cardioplegic solution containing varying concentrations (0-100 nM) of a nucleoside transport inhibitor, S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI), were immersion-stored at 0°C for 9 hr. Function was assessed after 30 min of working reperfusion. Function of unstored fresh hearts served as controls and poststorage recovery is reported as percentage of control function. Poststorage heart rate in all groups returned to control level after reperfusion. Recovery of other functional parameters in the no-NBTI group was as follows: aortic flow (AF), 56.2 ±4.6%; coronary flow (CF), 53.9±3.2%; cardiac output (CO), 55.5±4.0%; systolic pressure, 81.6±2.5%; work, 47.0±4.2%; and coronary vascular resistance (CVR), 157.1±7.8% of control. NBTI improved functional recovery in a dose-dependent fashion; the maximal improvement was seen at a dose of 5 nM, in which the recovery was: AF, 78.1±3.4%; CF, 73.5±4.4%; CO, 76.7±3.6%; work, 70.7± 5.0%; and CVR, 127.5±4.5% of control (P&lt;0.05 vs. no-NBTI). The ADO A1-receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (0.1 μM) blocked the effects of 5 nM NBTI; the recovery of AF, CF, CO, work, and CVR decreased to 62.8±8.0%, 58.3±5.0%, 61.5±3.9%, 54.4±4.5%, and 163.8±12.7% of control, respectively (P&lt;0.05 vs. 5 nM NBTI). Tissue ADO content in 5 nM NBTI hearts at the end of storage was 0.075±0.025 μmol/g dry wt, which was significantly elevated from 0.016±0.004 μmol/g dry wt in no-NBTI hearts. Purine release during initial reperfusion was delayed in 5 nM NBTI hearts, indicating the inhibition of nucleoside transport by NBTI. But NBTI treatment did not improve end-storage or end-reperfusion myocardial ATP. In conclusion, the addition of NBTI to cardioplegic solution enhanced tissue ADO and improved poststorage function of the hypothermically stored rat heart.

Endogenous control of growth proceeds from local actions of growth factors and dependence on nutrient abundance through guidance by growth hormone (GH) and other anabolic hormones to neuroendocrine suppression of growth. Nutrient abundance controls the reparativo growth of lean body mass in adulthood by coupling it to anabolic endocrine reflexes. Growth is blocked when catabolic endocrine reflexes govern energy expenditure. The relationship between exercise intensity and growth is nonlinear. Growth is an intermittent process. Its expression and stimulation are dependent on ultradian and circadian rhythms of energy metabolism and neurohumoral release. High-resistance exercise selectively stimulates growth of the musculoskeletal system through expression of growth factor genes in the challenged tissues and without the GH guidance or abundant nutritional support. Habitual endurance exercise stimulates reparative growth of lean body mass through the neuroendocrine adaptations including increased pulsatile GH secretion. These also facilitate oxidative utilization of storage lipids thereby contributing to the regulation of body composition in adulthood. In the absence of sufficient high-resistance and endurance exercise regulation of adult body mass is impaired: excess LBM is lost during energy deficit, and excess fat accumulates during energy surplus. © 1994 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Anabolic growth hormone; Autocrine; Nutrition; Paracrine","neurohormone; biosynthesis; body growth; body mass; cell stimulation; conference paper; energy balance; energy expenditure; exercise; growth inhibition; growth regulation; human; nutrition; weight reduction; Adaptation, Physiological; Age Factors; Biomechanics; Circadian Rhythm; Embryo and Fetal Development; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Growth; Human; Life Style; Musculoskeletal System; Neurotransmitters; Nutrition; Physical Endurance; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028279584

We hypothesized that the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is the controlling neural site for these responses. We further hypothesized that NPY stimulation at PVN would reduce gene expression for the critical brown fat thermogenic protein, uncoupling protein (UCP), and increase gene expression for the key white fat storage enzyme, LPL. In the first experiment, three groups of rats received injections every 6 h for 24 h (5 injections total) into the PVN: 1) NPY (1 μg/1 μl injection) and ad libitum food; 2) NPY (1 μg/1 μl injection) and food restricted to control intake; 3) saline injection (1 μl) and ad libitum food. Both NPY-treated groups showed significant reductions (P < 0.05) in brown fat UCP mRNA levels and marked stimulation of LPL mRNA levels relative to controls. In the second experiment, four groups of seven rats had NPY injected into the PVN: 0 (vehicle control); 0.1 μg; 0.5 μg; and 1 μg. Injections were made every 6 h for 24 h. There was a dose-related reduction in UCP mRNA produced by the NPY treatment. NPY treatment increased LPL mRNA, but a smooth dosing effect was not evident. The observation that NPY in the PVN can coordinate more than one component of energy metabolism is significant when considered with many reports of responsiveness of NPY activity in the arcuate nucleus-PVN neural circuit to perturbations of energy balance such as fasting and feeding, diabetes, and genetic obesity. Taken together, the observations suggest the presence of a highly organized and comprehensive control element for energy metabolism that reaches far beyond simple appetite control.","appetite; energy expenditure; food intake; neuropeptides; thermogenesis","neuropeptide Y; animal experiment; appetite; article; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; energy metabolism; feeding; food intake; hypothalamus; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thalamus midline nucleus; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028278034

In the experimental conditions used for imaging, detection limits and quantification errors were large and varied as a function of spatial resolution and the range of chemical elements of interest in the image. Applications of this imaging technique in materials science showed that quantitative chemical information is provided by the system and that the use of relative thickness maps and detailed statistical analysis of the spectrum‐image allowed an unbiased interpretation of the images.

Two organs, the liver and intestine, play a particularly important role in corporeal lipid metabolism, and together are responsible for the majority of lipoprotein synthesis and catabolism.

TSD currents were measured over a temperature range of 0-200 °C and the influence of various parameters, such as the poling voltage, rate of heating and effect of electrode materials, were investigated.

The low-temperature peak was considered to be due to an abnormal TSD current, whereas the currents at higher temperatures were normal TSD currents. Activation energies were determined using the low-temperature tail of the TSD curves and were found to be dependent on extrinsic parameters such as the thickness of the sample.

They must be physically based, rather than statistically based, for use under conditions different than those under which they were derived. But they also must match existing conditions for which data exist. A review discloses that existing ice dynamics models do not meet all of these criteria; a new one that does is based here on a prismatic ice pack heat balance, ice growth and temperature constraints, and thermodynamic flux terms from companion water heat balance and storage equations. The prismatic ice model is a good first step to understanding complex geometries and is supportable through the use of lake‐averaged energy fluxes. The ice model is integrated into an existing lake thermodynamics and one‐dimensional heat storage model, and the resulting combination is calibrated for Laurentian Great Lakes applications. Simulation experiments are used to analyze the model's strengths and limitations and to explore its relevance. Comparisons between model output and existing data allow consideration of the ice climatology of the Great Lakes; the climatology description is extended through use of the new model. Promising potential model extensions include spatial extension, additional parameterizations for wind‐ice movement, snow, and albedo, and inclusions of remotely sensed data.

The operation principle is based on the nonlinear transformation of the input image to the corresponding the point attractor of a fully connected neural network. The learning algorithm is the simulated annealing and the energy of the network state is used as its cost function. The computer simulations show its usefulness and that the maximum number of stored images is 150 in the network with 64 neurons. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate an optical implementation of the model using the optoelectronic neurochip. The chip consists of two-dimensional array of variable sensitivity photodetectors with 8×16 elements. The experimental results shows that 3 images of size 8×8 were successfully stored in the system.

The great depths of the world ocean are, however, practically unknown and there is an urgent need to put abyssal benthic laboratories into ""inner space"" in order to study basic phenomena of interest to marine science and climatology as well as man's impact on the oceans. In view of the numerous problems related to global change, as a first step emphasis should first be on the role of the oceans and their inherent processes, which are the focus of such international programmes as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). Multi-disciplinary registration of key events at selected key sites investigating the variability in time and space are of the utmost importance. The same methods and techniques must be used for the study of human impacts on the deep oceans caused by mining of metalliferous resources and by waste disposal as well as in basic studies. However, the investigation of the inner space of our planet has certain requirements. As long-term and large-scale investigations become more and more important, development of automized systems, largely independent from research vessels will be required. This will demand high capacities of energy for all technical functions as well as high storage capacities for data and samples. As a consequence the needs for two different-although overlapping-functional approaches are defined for future deep-sea deployments. (A) A system for long-term registration of the natural variability and long-term monitoring of human impacts: (B) A system for short-term observations and short-time experimentations. This report summarizes their technological demands. The envisioned interdisciplinary technology should deliver information on physical, biological and geochemical processes and their variabilities in the deep oceans. The prospected systems need to have the ability for real time video observation, data transfer and experimental manipulation, as well as sensing and sampling facilities with large storage capacities for long-term deployments. Prospective costs of the described multipurpose abyssal benthic laboratory will presumably exceed the funds for deep-sea research of a single country. A joint European effort could solve this problem and help to manifest a leading role for European marine science in international deep-sea and global change research. © 1994.",,"abyssal laboratory; abyssal zone; anthropogenic impact; benthic laboratory; benthos; deep sea; global change; ocean floor; scientific requirements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028254568

The Geothermal Division of the US Department of Energy has proposed a national R&D initiative involving government, national laboratory, industry, and academic stakeholders to develop less costly ways of penetrating rock.

Units collected into standard PVC containers processed by the traditional method (no buffy coat removal) were used as a control group. The red cell concentrates were suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) and stored 42 days at 2-6 °C. Comparison of the buffy coat depleted red cell concentrates showed that red cell energy and oxygen delivery capacity, as evidenced by ATP and 2,3-DPG values, were slightly better preserved in the BTHC plasticized container, compared to the DEHP container. The red cell membrane, however, was slightly less well preserved, (the hemolysis at day 42 with BTHC ww 0.39%; with DEHP, 0.20%) in this container. The higher ATP levels might lead to a better in vivo recovery of stored red cells. In vivo studies comparing both plastic containers, therefore are indicated in order to determine if these differences have practical significance. A longer holding time of the whole blood at room temperature before processing reduced the hemolysis (42 days stored RCC as 0.26%). Slightly more fibrinopeptide A (FPA) generation and marginally lower pH and 2,3-DPG values were observed in this situation.

In addition, histiotrophe secreted by uterine glands is absorbed by the paraplacental trophoblast. Histiotrophe which is rich in iron is necessary for erythropoiesis in the young embryo. This report is part of a study of the accumulation and metabolism of iron in the endometrium of precisely dated pregnant Tupaia belangeri by application of electron spectroscopy and histochemistry. In the endometrium of tree shrews which had been pregnant at least once, iron-laden granules were present in macrophages and secreting cells of uterine glands. Iron accumulated in the endometrium shortly after parturition, when macrophages phagocytosed erythrocytes at small haematomas 0.2-0.5 mm in diameter. These haematomas arose during parturition after bleeding into the uterine stroma when the placental discs were detached. At 24 h after parturition the following structural consequences of the erythrolysosomal breakdown of phagocytosed erythrocytes could be observed: free cytosolic siderin granules, membrane-bound siderosomes, telolysosomes (some of which contained myelin figures or lipid droplets) and mixed telolysosomes (containing membranous stacks and siderin granules). During the lysosomal degradation of phagocytosed erythrocytes, iron was transferred from haemoglobin into a different macromolecular compound. Electron energy loss spectra detected from inside siderosomes indicated an iron-oxygen compound, and high-power bright field electron micrographs of siderosomes demonstrated the ultrastructural pattern characteristic of ferritin. At about d 12 of a new pregnancy, macrophages containing siderosomes closely approached the bases of secreting cells of endometrial glands. This strongly suggests that iron is transferred from the macrophages to the glandular cells. Within the glandular cells, iron-rich histiotrophe was synthesised and released into the glandular lumen. Within the uterine cavity this histiotrophe was absorbed by the omphalopleure. We suggest that among eutherians, postpartum erythrophagocytosis, the transfer of iron from macrophages to uterine glands, and the paraplacental uptake of iron, represent an ancestral mechanism of iron supply to the embryo.","Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Ferritin; Macrophages; Uterus","ferritin; hemoglobin; iron; siderophore; animal cell; animal tissue; article; birth; cell secretion; electron energy loss spectroscopy; endometrium; erythrophagocytosis; female; hematoma; histochemistry; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; lysosome; macrophage; nonhuman; pregnancy; primate; priority journal; puerperium; Animal; Endometrium; Erythrocytes; Estrus; Female; Histocytochemistry; Iron; Labor, Obstetric; Macrophages; Phagocytosis; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Animal; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tupaiidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028235649

Because dysfunctioning muscle mitochondria may lead to defects of β‐oxidation of fatty acids, we examined the degree of neutral fat accumulation and muscle carnitine levels in the muscle biopsy specimens from 21 patients with AZT‐induced myopathic symptoms of varying severity. Six patients with no AZT fibers had normal endomyofibrillar lipid deposits and muscle carnitine levels; 7 patients with fewer than 5 AZT fibers per field had a mild (+) to moderate (++) increase in lipid droplets, and reduced muscle carnitine levels (3 patients); and 8 patients with more than 5 AZT fibers had severe muscle changes, a ++ to marked (+++) increase in lipid droplets, and reduced muscle carnitine levels (6 patients). Serial sections showed lipid globules often within “cracks” or vacuoles of the abnormal muscle fibers. We conclude that the muscle mitochondrial impairment caused by AZT results in (1) accumulation of lipid within the muscle fibers owing to poor utilization of long‐chain fatty acids, (2) reduction of muscle carnitine levels probably due to decreased carnitine uptake by the muscle, and (3) depletion of energy stores within the muscle fibers. The findings may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of AZT‐induced myopathic symptoms using oral carnitine supplementation.

It stimulates both carbohydrate and fat intakes. Diets rich in either macronutrient are known to induce obesity and to modify feeding behavior. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term ingestion of these diets on hypothalamic NPY in relation with food intake and body weight gain and composition. For this purpose, three groups of weanling Long-Evans rats were fed either a well-balanced diet, a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet (high starch plus 25% sucrose solution), or a high-fat (HF) diet during 14 weeks. Body weight and food intake were recorded during this period. At the end of the experiment, NPY was measured in several microdissected brain areas, and some adipose tissues (AT) depots were sampled. HF rats weighed significantly more than the two other groups (p < 0.02). They were also fattier (+30-50% in AT weights;p < 0.01). Energy intake (EI) of the HC rats was significantly greater than that of the control (+15%; p < 0.02) and HF rats (+34%; p < 0.01) during the week preceding killing. EI of HF rats over the whole experiment was lower than that of the two other groups (p < 0.01). NPY concentrations were lower in the HF and HC rats than in the control rats in two hypothalamic areas only: in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) (-28% (HC vs. control); p < 0.02 and -54% (HF vs. control); p < 0.001) and in the parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (-48% (HF vs. control); p < 0.001). These results indicate that the long-term ingestion of HC and HF diets influences NPY in areas where it is synthesized (ARC) and released (PVN), whereas at short term, the PVN was uniquely concerned as shown by a previous study. These variations in the ARC-PVN axis might be considered to be counterregulatory mechanisms necessary for limiting overconsumption of food as well as fat deposition. © 1994.","Arcuate to paraventricular axis; Carbohydrate; Fat; Food intake; Insulin Blood glucose; Neuropeptide; Obesity; Y","carbohydrate; glucose; insulin; lipid; neuropeptide Y; starch; sucrose; animal experiment; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; article; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; fat intake; feeding behavior; glucose blood level; hypothalamus; insulin blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; newborn; nonhuman; nutrient; obesity; priority journal; rat; thalamus midline nucleus; weight gain; Animal; Comparative Study; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Feeding Behavior; Hypothalamus; Male; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Rats; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028219004

Alcohol addition (A) or isoenergetic substitution (S) caused fat retention by significantly suppressing its oxidation when the alcohol was actively metabolized (0-6 h). However, on protocol S, fat balance was later reestablished due to raised fat oxidation (6-20.5 h) secondary to a relative carbohydrate deficiency. On protocol A, fat balance remained significantly raised. The thermogenic effect of alcohol was similar to that of carbohydrate, providing no evidence for futile cycling. Short-term studies that fail to account for later readjustments of macronutrient balance can be misleading. We conclude that alcohol has a fat-sparing effect similar to that of carbohydrate and will only cause fat gain when consumed in excess of normal energy needs.",,"adult; alcohol consumption; article; calorimetry; energy expenditure; human; human experiment; lipid storage; male; nutrient; obesity; oxidation; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028218950

This voltage is a linear function of absorbed dose. The extent of the linearity region is dependent on the voltage controlled operation during irradiation. Operating two MOSFETS at two different biases simultaneously during irradiation will result in sensitivity (V/Gy) reproducibility better than ±3% over a range in dose of 100 Gy and at a dose per fraction greater than 20X1CT2Gy.

Paired cat corneas, in either Optisol only or Optisol with growth factor(s), were analyzed using ex vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, after storage for 1 week at 4°C. Lysosomal enzyme release into the media at the end of the storage period also was measured fluorometrically. Both epithelial-intact and epithelial-denuded corneal pairs were examined for all conditions. Considering corneas having either intact epithelia or epithelium-denuded corneas, the addition of either growth factor alone to Optisol did not alter the relative corneal concentrations of five of the six phosphatic metabolite spectral bands measured or two metabolic ratios calculated from these bands. Phosphodiesters, however, were significantly lower in corneas stored in Optisol containing both hEGF and insulin (23%) than in corneas stored in Optisol alone (30%). Intracorneal pH was unaffected by the addition of growth factor(s). A significantly higher release of α-glucosidase and α- mannosidase was noted in those corneas stored in Optisol containing both hEGF and insulin. Optisol maintains high-energy phosphate corneal metabolism similar to other CS-based media, K-Sol and Chondroitin Sulfate Corneal Storage Medium (CSM).

Morphometric analysis of the ankle extensors, digital flexors, and digital extensors from 35 quadrupedal species, ranging in body mass from 0.04 to 545 kg, was carried out. Tendon dimensions scale nearly isometrically, as does muscle mass. The negative allometry of muscle fiber length results in positive allometric scaling of muscle cross-sectional areas in all but digital extensors. Maximum muscle forces are predicted to increase allometrically, with mass exponents as high as 0.91 in the plantaris, but nearly isometrically (0.69) in the digital extensors. Thus the maximum amount of stress a tendon may experience in vivo, as indicated by the ratio of muscle and tendon cross-sectional areas, increases with body mass in digital flexors and ankle extensors. Consequently, the capacity for elastic energy storage scales with positive allometry in these tendons but is isometric in the digital extensors, which probably do not function as springs in normal locomotion. These results suggest that the springlike tendons of large mammals can potentially store more elastic strain energy than those of smaller mammals because their disproportionately stronger muscles can impose higher tendon stresses.","biomechanics; locomotion; scaling; strain energy","allometry; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; body mass; flexor tendon; gastrocnemius muscle; hindlimb; locomotion; mammal; morphometrics; muscle; muscle force; nonhuman; plantaris muscle; priority journal; stress strain relationship; tendon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028208615

Hypothyroidism was induced by thyroidectomy. Five days after operation, sham-operated and thyroidectomized rats were anesthetized and cardiac function was assessed. At this time, the plasma levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine had fallen by eightfold and threefold, respectively, in thyroidectomized rats compared with the values in sham-operated rats. In vivo pump function was assessed by measuring mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and stroke volume index: all were reduced by thyroidectomy (respectively 95 ± 5 mm Hg, 22 ± 2 ml/min/100 gm body weight, and 67 ± 7 μl/beat/100 gm body weight versus 112 ± 4 mm Hg, 35 ± 1 ml/min/100 gm body weight and 85 ± 4 μl/beat/100 gm body weight in the sham-operated group; p &lt; 0.05 in each instance). Systemic vascular resistance index was higher in thyroidectomized than in sham-operated rats (4.4 ± 0.4 versus 3.1 ± 0.2 mm Hg/ml/min/100 gm body weight; p &lt; 0.05). In vivo indices of contractile function were also reduced by thyroidectomy: maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development fell by almost 50% (5190 ± 790 versus 9600 ± 900 mm Hg/sec; p &lt; 0.05) and left ventricular developed pressure and heart rate also fell (respectively 92 ± 8 mm Hg and 340 beats/min versus 129 ± 6 mm Hg and 398 ± 6 beats/min; p &lt; 0.05 in each instance). After excision, hearts were blood-perfused and ex vivo function assessed with intraventricular balloons. Systolic and diastolic functions were significantly impaired in the thyroidectomized group and the myocardial Na+- K+-adenosinetriphosphatase activity was reduced from a control value of 8.3 ± 0.3 to 5.8 ± 0.4 mean integrated extinction x 100. The hearts were then subjected to 2 minutes of cardioplegic infusion, 6 hours of hypothermic (4° C) ischemia, and 40 minutes of reperfusion. In control hearts, left ventricular developed pressure (at an end-diastolic pressure of 8 mm Hg) recovered to 76% of its preischemic value (131 ± 8 versus 173 ± 8 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.05); in hearts from thyroidectomized rats, left ventricular developed pressure recovered to 81% of its preischemic value (110 ± 8 versus 136 ± 12 mm Hg; p = not significant), an absolute value that was not significantly different from that in the sham-operated group. Diastolic function recovered to the same extent in both groups. Myocardial high-energy phosphate content was unaffected by thyroidectomy and was depleted to a similar extent in both sham-operated and thyroidectomized groups by hypothermic ischemia.

Such heat pumps can contribute to energy conservation if waste heat from thermal systems, for example from a cogeneration system, is used to power them because they can operate with low levels of thermal energy. One of the main problems with adsorption heat pumps is that large heat transfer areas are required because of the small thermal conductivity of the adsorbent bed which is composed of solid adsorbent particles. This causes problems related to the performance, cost, and scale of such heat pumps. Tube plate reactors (both adsorber and desorber) have been proposed to solve these problems. The fins on the tube plate of these reactors are intended to enhance heat transfer and COP, and such reactors could be more compact than others. In addition, in order to adjust batch time and to deal with load fluctuation, heat storage capacity is increased by making the adsorbent bed thicker. To design heat pumps which fulfill these potentials, the mechanism of heat transfer at the adsorbent bed must be formulated. The authors believe the diameter of the adsorbent particles is important, and we conducted adsorption and desorption experiments with various kinds of adsorbent beds made with different sizes of adsorbent particles. This paper reports on these experiments. The concept of equivalent thermal conductivity λ is defined, and is obtained through the experiment data and simulations for each adsorbent bed. Conclusions on the most appropriate size of adsorbent particles and equivalent thermal conductivity λ are presented. A thermal design of a reactor is also performed, and finally the effect of the fin pitch and bed thickness on COP and the projected area estimated to be required for heat transfer are discussed quantitatively.",,"Adsorbents; Chemical reactors; Fins (heat exchange); Heat transfer; Particles (particulate matter); Refrigerants; Refrigerators; Silica gel; Thermal conductivity; Tubes (components); Water; Zeolites; Adsorbent beds; Adsorbent particles; Adsorption heat pumps; Adsorption refrigerators; Coefficient of performance; Equivalent thermal conductivity; Heat storage capacity; Tube plate adsorption reactors; Water-silica gel pair; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028201956

Heat is stored mostly by means of the latent heat of phase change of the medium. The temperature of the medium remains more or less constant during the phase transition. A large number of materials have been identified for low, intermediate, and high operating temperatures for application as latent thermal energy storage media. In the present paper a method for characterization of alkanes (C1,-C100) and paraffin waxes for application as the low-temperature (298-323 K) phase change energy storage medium is introduced. A computational technique is introduced by which the alkanes and paraffin waxes could be evaluated, and possibly upgraded, as the phase change energy storage media. It is demonstrated that the family of n-alkanes has a large spectrum of latent heats, melting points, densities, and specific heats so that the heat storage designer has a good choice of n-alkanes as storage materials for any particular low-temperature thermal energy storage application. As an example of the proposed method, a particular paraffin wax for which appropriate experimental data are available is analyzed and the results of the analysis are presented. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Alkanes; Energy storage medium; Paraffin waxes","Characterization; Computational methods; Density (specific gravity); Materials testing; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Renewable energy resources; Specific heat of solids; Phase change energy storage medium; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028201554

Box 30436, Yanbu AL-sinaiyah 21477, Saudi Arabia","Photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems are widely used due to their simplicity, high reliability and low cost. A directly-coupled PV pumping system is the most reliable and least-cost PV system. The d.c. motor-pump group is not, however, working at its optimum operating point. A battery buffered PV pumping system introduces a battery between the PV array and the d.c. motor-pump group to ensure that the motor-pump group is operating at its optimum point. The size of the battery storage depends on system economics. If the battery is fully charged while solar radiation is available, the battery will discharge through the load while the PV array is disconnected. Hence, a power loss takes place. To overcome the above mentioned difficulty, a switched mode PV pumping is proposed. When solar radiation is available and the battery is fully charged, the battery is disconnected and the d.c. motor-pump group is directly coupled to the PV array. To avoid excessive operating voltage for the motor, a part of the PV array is switched off to reduce the voltage. As a result, the energy loss is significantly eliminated. Detailed analysis of the proposed system shows that the discharged water increases by about 10% when compared with a conventional battery-buffered system. The system transient performance just after the switching moment shows that the system returns to a steady state in short period. The variations in the system parameters lie within 1% of the rated values. © 1994.",,"Charging (batteries); DC motors; Electric energy storage; Solar radiation; Systems analysis; Transients; Switched mode photovoltaic (PV) pumping system; Photovoltaic cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028197863

The effects of different weather conditions and share of PV/wind energy production on system design are investigated. Overall electricity costs are calculated for different financial parameters. Electricity costs depend strongly on intensity and profile of weather and type of converter, which makes a careful investigation of the optimal mixture of PV/wind power necessary.

A highenergy propellant is developed by heat transfer from a phase-change material (Si) to a low-density gas (H2) through a concentric cylinder heat exchanger. The phase-change material is heated by a radioisotope (PoGd) over a period of time which is significantly longer than the firing time. It is shown that such an engine can most efficiently operate just above and just below a propellant flow regime defined by gradual flow transition in the heat exchanger. Two designs are developed to illustrate each distinct operating scenario. A 10-N engine utilizing laminar flow is shown to be an attractive alternative to chemical and electric systems for the maneuvering of a vehicle in the vicinity of a larger space structure. A 450-N engine utilizing primarily turbulent heat transfer is shown to be an alternative to other systems for orbit transfer. Rapid cooling of the thermal storage material in the entrance region of the heat exchanger, which can be mitigated by varying the flow area or increasing the length of the engine, is a primary limitation on an engine utilizing thermal storage. © 1993 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Engines; Gases; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Orbital transfer; Performance; Propellants; Radioisotopes; Silicon; Spacecraft power supplies; Flow transition; Heat source; Phase change material; Propellant flow regime; Space propulsion system; Thermal energy; Spacecraft propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028195459

Each microsystem will, as before, contain 9 channels with 15-16 bits dynamic range using 10-bit AD converters sampled every 15 ns. The function is accomplished by using a non-linear amplifier in front of the ADC to compress high amplitude signals, reversing the transformation to obtain overall linearity in a look-up table after the digitisation. The direct first-level trigger output for digitally filtered energy data is equipped with pulse recognition capability. The main data flow enters a pipeline memory from which relevant portions are extracted to second and third-level triggers via an adaptive 7-tap digital filter.

The storms were applied every 24 hours at a constant rain intensity of 70 mm·h-1. The soil parameters studied were random roughness, bulk density, and total porosity. After 875 mm of rainfall, random roughness degraded to constant values of 3.7, 1.5, and 0.8 cm below the initial values for the ploughed, harrowed, and rolled treatments, respectively. Bulk density increased by 0.16, 0.26, 0.15, and 0.08 g·cm-3, while total porosity decreased by 0.08, 0.13, 0.07, and 0.03 cm3·cm-3 for the ploughed, harrowed, rolled, and untilled treatments, respectively. Ploughing produced a rough surface that withstood rainfall energy while harrowing, and rolling produced smoother and less resistant surfaces. The results showed that, under rainfall conditions similar to those studied here, a ploughed soil is likely to maintain high water storage capacity on the surface without appreciable runoff or soil loss while overtillage may have deleterious effects on both soil and water conservation. Regression equations to predict changes in surface roughness, bulk density, and total porosity due to rainfall were developed. The equations can be incorporated in soil water balance and hydrological models for cultivated fields. © 1994.","Rainfall, effect on soil surface; Soil surface properties; Soil surface roughness; Tillage, effect on soil surface","Hapludalf; rainfall simulation; soil physical property; soil surface roughness; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028180676

The scheme is designed as a software package which can be run as part of an atmospheric model or a stand-alone model. For the physical and biological model backgrounds we have chosen so a ""sandwich"" representation of single layer approach. The model has seven prognostic variables: temperature for the canopy vegetation, temperature for both the ground cover and soil surface; two interception water stores (one for canopy and one for the ground cover); and three soil moisture storage variables. All these variables fully determine: mass, energy and momentum transfer across the lower part of atmosphere. The net radiation absorbed by the canopy is partitioned into sensible, latent heat and storage terms. From these equations temperature for both the ground cover and soil surface is solved by an implicit scheme. The soil model part is designed as a three-layer isothermal model which is used to describe the vertical transfer of water in the soil. The energy terms in the energy balance equation are calculated using resistance representation. For the foregoing calculations we completed aerodynamic characteristics in accordance with ""K-theory"". Then, these values are used in the calculation of three aerodynamic resistances for transfer of heat and moisture from the canopy to reference height. In parameterization of evapotranspiration the three surface resistances are calculated. Finally, the performance of the designed scheme is tested in one point by time integrations using real data. The set used for 18 August 1988 at the experimental site in De Sinderhoeve (The Netherlands) was a part of flux measurements over maize field. However, for more general conclusion about quality of scheme additional tests with the high quality data sets are needed. © 1994.","Atmospheric models; energy exchanges; Environmental modeling; Land-air parameterization; Mass","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Computer aided analysis; Computer simulation; Computer software; Evapotranspiration; Atmospheric model; Biophysical scheme; Canopy vegetation; Energy balance equation; Resistance representation; Software package UNICOS; Soil moisture; Earth atmosphere; atmospheric model; biophysical scheme",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028174760

Prior energy-dependent calcium sequestration was found to be necessary for subsequent release of calcium by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(2,4,5)P3) could release calcium equally well from permeabilised E. histolytica with similar EC50 (concentration which produced half maximal release) values for calcium release. Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated calcium release occurred from a vesicular store, was sensitive to prior treatment by heparin and was attenuated by prior addition of a lower concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3. cAMP failed to influence inositol trisphosphate induced calcium release, indicating the absence of control mechanisms through cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. GTP neither induced calcium release nor could potentiate inositol trisphosphate mediated calcium mobilisation. A saturating concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 could release 50% of radiolabelled calcium sequestered by energy-dependent mechanisms in E. histolytica. The energy-dependent calcium sequestration was inhibited by vanadate and the calcium antagonist Diltiazem but not by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), suggesting the involvement of an endoplasmic reticulum-like structure in calcium storage. Binding studies showed specific association of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to crude membrane fractions of E. histolytica, which was significantly inhibited by heparin in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 (concentration which produced half-maximal inhibition) values for displacement of radiolabelled Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding by unlabelled Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(2,4,5)P3 were estimated to be 0.99 μM for both isomers.

Tests were conducted with various organic acids or acid salts (formic acid, citric acid, humic acids, sodium citrate and sodium formate) at different concentrations and at pH values ranging from 3 to 9. The leachates were submitted to ICP-AES analysis, and the alteration films on the glass specimens were examined by SEM (equipped with an energy-dispersive chemical analysis systm) and XRD. Results are discussed for the following areas. Effect of pH: different mechanisms are involved at pH 2.5 and pH 9, but in both cases, the R7T7 glass dissolution kinetics are always controlled by a surface reaction mechanism. The most significant effects of the organic acids on the glass dissolution kinetics were observed at pH 3, which was not unexpected. Nature of the acid (or acid salt): this is an essential parameter. Formic acid (monoacid) and sodium formate had no effect on the initial glass dissolution rate nor on the nature of the alteration film; conversely, citric acid (triacid) and sodium citrate significantly affected glass dissolution. The role of citric acid in the surface reaction mechanism has been demonstrated experimentally at pH 2.5; it is also known to favor that extraction of Si (directly or indirectly) and Zr and probably of Fe. The humic acids are strong catalysts of the R7T7 glass dissolution reaction. The conclusions drawn from these observations corroborate other published findings, suggesting that the catalytic effect is appreciable only for species with at least two carboxylic acid functions. Effect of concentration: the effect of the concentration was observed at basic pH values in the presence of sodium citrate and humic acids. This parameter may thus be quantified and incorporated in the glass dissolution kinetic law. © 1994.",,"dissolution; glass; organic acid; radioactive waste storage; Carboxylic acids; Catalysts; Chemical variables control; Corrosion; Glass; Iron; Organic acids; pH effects; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon; Zirconium; Aqueous corrosion; Citric acid; Concentration effect; Dissolution kinetics; Glass dissolution kinetic law; Humic acid; Leachate; Nuclear glass; Surface reaction mechanism; X ray diffraction; Dissolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028167298

Thus, a marked improvement has been achieved in optimizing energy flow among multiple diesel units. Further, the simulation model has been applied to a practical wind-diesel system in Denmark that includes multiple diesel units, and the simulation results have provided valuable insight into the design and operation features of wind-diesel systems.",,"Computer simulation; Control equipment; Diesel engines; Electric generators; Electric load dispatching; Fuel consumption; Mathematical models; Optimization; State assignment; Systems analysis; Energy flow; Wind diesel systems; Wind turbines; Simulation Model; Wind/Diesel Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028166585

The Underground Research Laboratory excavated in a pluton of the Canadian Shield provides a unique opportunity to study these effects. Three biofilms kept moist by seepage through fractures in granitic rock faces of the Underground Research Laboratory have been examined. The biofilms contained a variety of gram- negative and gram-positive morphotypes held together by an organic extracellular matrix. Nutrient levels in the groundwater were low, but energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy has shown biogeochemical immobilization of several elements in the biofilms; some of these elements were concentrated from extremely dilute environmental concentrations, and all elements were chemically complexed together to form amorphous or crystalline fine-grained minerals. These were seen by transmission electron microscopy to be both associated with the surfaces of the bacteria and scattered throughout the extracellular matrix, suggesting their de novo development through bacterial surface-mediated nucleation. The biofilm consortia are thought to concentrate elements both by passive sorption and by energy metabolism. By Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, one of the biofilms showed that iron was both oxidized and precipitated as ferrihydrite or hematite aerobically and reduced and precipitated as siderite anaerobically. We believe that some Archean banded-iron formations could have been formed in a manner similar to this, as it would explain the deposition of hematite and siderite in close proximity.

The material flows are driven by energy, determined by an ecological potential, defined as an energy density by analogy with electrical potential difference. Ecosystem processes define corresponding bondgraph processes to be connected as subsystems according to the interconnection topology of the ecosystem. Input-output transfer functions for processes may be obtained through theoretical analysis, empirical or time-series methods, or by some other method. The dynamic response of an ecosystem to changing inputs is included by incorporating storage and delay processes with associated state variables available as a measure of the quality of an ecological system.

Previous work on the economics of gray jay scatter-hoarding behavior was based on the assumption that the jays maximize the rate at which they store food energy; alternative currencies were not considered. Here we develop and test models based on two currencies, net rate (net recoverable energy stored per unit time) and efficiency (recoverable energy stored per unit energy expended). Our experiment involved providing gray jays with two options. After collecting a single food item upon arrival at a feeding apparatus, a jay could wait for two additional food items to become (simultaneously) available and then transport all three items for storage in scattered arboreal sites. Alternatively, the jay could immediately transport the single item to a storage site and return to the source repeatedly for additional single-item loads. By incrementally increasing the amount of time jays were required to wait for multipleitem loads, we were able to determine how long jays would wait before switching from multiple- to single-item caching trips. In contrast with the finding in a variety of species that efficiency-maximization models provide a better account of foraging behavior, the net rate-maximization model was a better predictor of the jays' switching point than was the efficiency-maximization model (Figs. 2 and 3). We discuss these conflicting results in the context of recent theory that describes the conditions favoring rate- versus efficiency-maximizing behavior (Ydenberg et al. 1994). © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Foraging theory; Gray jays; Hoarding; Rate maximization","grey jay; optimal foraging; scatter hoarding; Perisoreus canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163608

Because of its greater relevance to dryland soils, and its better correlation with field soil behaviour, wetting with high energy rain (HER) was used to wet samples and cause aggregate breakdown. The water-stable size fraction considered was that &lt;0-125 mm, with the proportion of particles &lt;0-125 mm referred to as P125. To study interactions between wetting method and tillage management, several other wetting methods were applied to some or all of the eight soils. These other methods were immersion (IMM), wetting by rainfall of low energy (LER) or under tension (TENS). Where fallow management treatments significantly reduced P125 under HER wetting, those reductions were generally small, and likely to increase steady infiltration rates of high energy rain into bare soil by only 2-6 mm h-1. In contrast, steady infiltration rates could be increased by 15-42 mm h-1 if those same soil surfaces were completely covered by stubble so that they received low energy rain. At least under Queensland conditions, retention of crop residues to protect soils from drop impact is therefore likely to be of much greater importance in improving water storage during fallows than any improvement in soil aggregation under ‘improved’ fallow management practices. Effects of fallow management and cropping history on P125 under HER varied across the sites. Three out of four virgin soils were more stable than corresponding cropped soils; stubble retention improved stability to HER wetting on three out of four sites where it was tested, and direct drill or reductions in tillage frequency improved stability at two out of eight sites. IMM showed responses to treatments that, for some soils, differed greatly from those obtained using HER. Neither LER nor TENS appeared useful, as LER gave occasional inconsistent results, and TENS caused little aggregate breakdown for most soils. © 1994, CSIRO.

From statistical analyses of images and location preferences, researchers have claimed that possible significant economic losses could potentially accompany the siting of HLW facilities. However, several paradoxes, or self‐contradictory statements, apparently exist between the responses expressed in surveys and the actual economic and demographic behavior evidenced in the marketplace.

Total photochemical activity remains the same in both state 1 and state 2 between 580 and 700 nm, but it is lower in state 2 between 400 and 580 nm. Both PSI and PSII activities change significantly during the state transition due to the migration of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex of PSII (LHCII). In the action spectra of PSI and PSII, peak positions vary depending on the association or dissociation of LHCII, except for the peak at 470 nm in the PSII spectrum. PSII activity is about 3 times higher than or equal to PSI in state 1 or state 2, respectively, over most of the spectrum except in the blue and far-red regions. At 470 nm, PSII activity is 8 or 1.6 times higher than PSI in state 1 or state 2, respectively. The amplitude of LHCII coupling-induced change is the same in both PSI and PSII between 580 and 700 nm, but it is less in PSI than in PSII between 400 and 580 nm, which explains the lower photochemical activity of the leaf in state 2 than in state 1.

Using simple circuit simulation software, details of the expected power requirements and performance have been evaluated for peak operating currents of up to 1000 A. The circuits evaluated were of a 7th order design incorporating a 110 μH gradient coil operating at fundamental frequencies between 800 Hz and 2000 Hz. Results indicate that the simpler circuit design is not necessarily the most efficient. In addition, by suitable modification of the input waveform algorithm, it can be shown that the shape of the resonant gradient waveform may be varied entirely under software control from triangular to trapezoidal, the minimum ramptime being specified by the highest harmonic accommodated in the circuit. The energy storage, non-dissipative nature of the circuit design also means that the gradient ramptime is effectively independent of amplifier power capabilities, making a fast rise trapezoidal waveform as easy to implement as either triangular or sinusoidal waveforms. Using the approach outlined above, trapezoidal gradient modulation at peak current amplitudes in excess of 320 A and risetimes less than 60 μs have been easily produced in this laboratory for use in echo-planar imaging and for investigations into ways of optimising gradient performance before the onset of peripheral nerve stimulation. © 1993.","EPI; Fast MRI; Gradient generation","article; diagnostic imaging; image enhancement; nerve stimulation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; waveform; Echo-Planar Imaging; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028144264

The differentiating cells possess rapid and efficient calcium buffering and sequestration systems which enable them to restrict changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration temporally and spatially during their chemotactic reaction and allow the continuous accumulation of Ca2+ during development. In order to identify and to characterize calcium storage compartments, we analyzed the element content of amoebae at three consecutive stages of differentiation. Determination of the element distribution was done using energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of freeze-dried cryosections of rapid-frozen cells. Amoebae were frozen in the vegetative and aggregation-competent state and after formation of aggregates. Aggregation-competent as well as aggregated cells contained mass dense granules with large amounts of calcium together with phosphorous and either potassium or magnesium: in aggregation-competent cells calcium was colocalized with potassium, whereas in aggregated cells the mass dense granules contained calcium and magnesium. Although mass dense granules were also present in undifferentiated, vegetative cells, they contained only low amounts of phosphorous and potassium together with little Ca and Mg. We conclude that during their differentiation D. discoideum cells use an intracellular storage compartment to sequester Ca and other cations constantly throughout development. © 1994.",,"calcium; magnesium; phosphorus; potassium; animal tissue; article; calcium cell level; cell aggregation; cell differentiation; cell granule; cell organelle; cellular distribution; Dictyostelium discoideum; electron probe microanalysis; freeze drying; nonhuman; priority journal; storage; X ray microanalysis; Animalia; Dictyostelium discoideum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028142542

The design goals of the accelerometer are to provide strapdown tactical navigation quality acceleration information throughout a 20 g soft launch phase, 1200 g boost phase, and low-g coast phase environment. The accelerometers must be able to provide acceleration measurements accurate enough to provide a navigational accuracy of 0.5 meter CEP at 500 meters. This translates to an accelerometer capable of measuring a 1200 g acceleration with a resolution of 1 milli-g. The AdKEM missile accelerometer and gyro outputs are used for control stability and midcourse guidance. The successful demonstration of this device offers a myriad of opportunities in both the commercial and military arenas. The operational environment and performance characteristics of the AdKEM accelerometer will be presented. This accelerometer is unique in the fact that it must not only survive but successfully operate through the 1200 g acceleration environment, while providing sufficient sensitivity to resolve applied accelerations down to a 1 milli-g level. This large 1.2×106 dynamic range is new for tactical missiles, where dynamic ranges of 104 are typical. Strategic missiles and position location applications have required similarly high dynamic ranges; however, this application is unique in acceleration range of milli-g's to g's. Other design requirements imposed on this accelerometer for viability in a tactical application are: minimum cost, size, weight and power consumption and survivability over a wide range operating environment. Crystalline quartz vibrating beam technology has been chosen for this accelerometer application to take advantage of solid state device characteristics. A solid state device with inherently digital output characteristics is desirable for strapdown navigation applications because of interface circuitry simplification, potential lower cost, inherent stability and longer storage life.",,"Acceleration measurement; Electronic guidance systems; Inertial navigation systems; Launching; Military applications; Missiles; Navigation; Performance; Solid state devices; System stability; Units of measurement; Advanced kinetic energy missile; Crystalline quartz vibrating beam technology; Inertial guidance; Inertial instruments; Inertial measurement unit; Line of sight; Solid state accelerometer; Accelerometers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028121939

In the light, bisulphite was found to be more toxic than the other two, sulphate being the least toxic of all. Interestingly, the vitality index, Rrd, measured as the ratio of the modulated fluorescence decrease (Fd) to the steady‐state fluorescence (Fs), which indicates the efficiency of the whole photosynthetic activity, was more affected than the total photosynthetic energy storage (PES) of PSII and PSI during linear and cyclic electron transport, and Fv/Fm (PSII activity). The severity of the damage appeared to be a function of light intensity. Bisulphite treatment in darkness resulted in a dramatic decrease in Rrd, a moderate decrease in PES and a marginal decrease in Fv/Fm. As for sulphite, the effect was negligible with a tendency for enhanced activity. It is inferred that the Calvin cycle is a good candidate for the primary site of bisulphite and sulphite action. Recovery of activity, especially at the Rrd level, obtained in the presence of ascorbate, glutathione and L‐cysteine, indicated a contribution of O2 free radicals to the observed inhibition of the photosynthetic activity in the light.

In DSC thermograms, the glassy NP exhibited an en-dothermic peak at 48°C representing the glass transition of NP, an exothermic peak at 105°C for the crystallization to a metastable form of NP (Form B), an exothermic peak at 125°C for the polymorphic transition of Form B to a stable form of NP (Form A), and an endothermic peak at 171°C for the melting of Form A. The powder X-ray diffractogram of Form B was apparently different from that of Form A. In the presence of HP-β-CyD, the exothermic peak at 125°C for the Form B to A transition disappeared and a new en-dothermic peak appeared at 163°C. This new peak was ascribed to the melting of Form B, and the conversion of Form B to Form A was significantly suppressed in HP-β-CyD matrix. Upon storage at 60°C, the glassy NP was converted to Form A with an activation energy of 18 kcal/mol. The apparent dissolution rate of the NP/HP-β-CyD (molar ratio 1:1) increased in the order of glassy NP < Form A < Form B, because the glassy NP was readily converted to Form A upon contact with water, resulting in a lower dissolution rate. The present data suggest that HP-β-CyD is useful for the preparation of a fast dissolving form of metastable NP through glassy NP. © 1994, Plenum Publishing Corporation.

We used a newly developed microwave energy-assisted aldehyde fixation method to prepare purified rat peritoneal mast cells for the postembedding immunogold ultrastructural localization of TNF-α. These fixation methods were superior to chemical fixation alone in preserving both the ultrastructural morphology and immunoreactive TNF-α in rat mast cells. The percent of TNF-α-positive mast cells in samples prepared with microwave-assisted fixation in low (84%) and standard (81%) glutaraldehyde concentrations exceeded that for low (56%) and standard (15%) glutaraldehyde concentrations without the assistance of microwave energy. TNF-α was identified in the large storage granules of rat mast cells. The percent of positive granules in microwave-assisted standard (44%) and low (40%) glutaraldehyde samples was considerably higher than the percent of positive granules in standard (5%) and low (10%) glutaraldehyde-fixed samples without microwave assistance. This location of TNF-α in rat peritoneal mast cells suggests that this cytokine can use the regulated secretory route(s) for release from appropriately stimulated rat mast cells into the microenvironment. © 1994.","cachectin; Cytokine; inflammation; secretion","glutaraldehyde; gold; paraformaldehyde; tumor necrosis factor alpha; tumor necrosis factor antibody; animal cell; article; cell granule; cell ultrastructure; cellular distribution; controlled study; immunogold staining; male; microwave radiation; nonhuman; peritoneum mast cell; priority journal; rat; tissue fixation; Animal; Cytoplasmic Granules; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mast Cells; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Microwaves; Peritoneal Cavity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tissue Fixation; Tumor Necrosis Factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028111896

The photoref ractive effect appears in materials that exhibit an electric-field-dependent refractive index and that are photosensitive, such that the spatial distribution of photogenerated charge carriers is modified on irradiation with light. The diffraction pattern formed by the interference of two coherent light beams within such a material generates a non-uniform internal electric field that in turn modulates the refractive index. The resulting refractive-index pattern forms a grating that can diffract light and thereby give rise to two-beam coupling, whereby one of the writing beams gains energy at the expense of the other - a property that can be exploited in photonic devices. Although the best photorefractive materials currently available are inorganic crystals such as LiNbO3, there is considerable interest in the development of photorefractive polymers 2-8, owing to their structural flexibility, ease of processing and lower cost. We describe here a polymer composite with excellent photorefractive properties. We have achieved a diffraction efficiency approaching 100% and a net two-beam coupling gain of more than 200 cm-1, making these polymeric materials suitable for immediate application in areas such as dynamic holographic storage and optical information processing1. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028108672

Recent evidence described in this review suggests that the effects of this adrenal hormone are mediated through two steroid receptor subtypes, the type I mineralocorticoid receptor and the type II glucocorticoid receptor. These receptors, which have different affinities for CORT, respond to different levels of circulating hormone. They mediate distinct effects of the steroid, which can be distinguished by the specific nutrient ingested and by the particular period of the circadian cycle. Under normal physiological conditions, the type I receptor is tonically activated, either by low basal levels of circulating CORT (0.5–2 μg%) normally available across the circadian cycle or possibly by the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. This type I activation is required for the maintenance of fat ingestion and fat deposition that occurs during most meals of the feeding cycle. In contrast, the type II receptor is phasically activated by moderate levels of CORT (2–10 μg%) normally reached during the circadian peak. Activation of this receptor is required for the natural surge in carbohydrate ingestion and metabolism that is essential at the onset of the active feeding cycle when the body's glycogen stores are at their nadir, and gluconeogenesis is needed to maintain blood glucose levels. This receptor is also activated during periods of increased energy requirements, such as, after exercise and food restriction, when CORT levels rise further (>10 μg%) and when its catabolic effects on fat and protein stores predominate to provide additional substrates for glucose homeostasis. These functions of CORT on fat and carbohydrate balance are mediated, in part, by type I and type II receptors located within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, which is known to have key functions in controlling nutrient intake and metabolism, as well as circulating CORT levels. Moreover, the type II receptors within this nucleus, in addition to the arcuate nucleus, may interact positively with the peptide, neuropeptide Y, and the catecholamine, norepinephrine, both of which act to enhance natural carbohydrate feeding and CORT release at the onset of the natural feeding cycle. Thus, under normal conditions, endogenous CORT has a primary function in controlling nutrient ingestion and metabolism over the natural circadian cycle, through the coordinated action of the type I and type II steroid receptor systems. Through this action, CORT has impact on total caloric intake and body weight gain over the long term. Moreover, under conditions of obesity, diabetes and food restriction, steroid receptor function is greatly disturbed in association with chronic high circulating levels of CORT and abnormal glucose homeostasis. These disturbances in steroid action, along with dysfunction in brain neurochemical processes, very possibly contribute to the maintenance of hyperphagia and body weight gain in obese and diabetic states.

Consumers are demanding fast charging times, increased battery lifetime, and fuel gauge capabilities. All of these demands require that the state of charge within a battery be known. One of the present methods employed to determine state of charge is to fully discharge the battery prior to charging it, then put in a fixed, preset amount of charge into the battery. The problems with this method are that the charge time is increased, the temperature effects of the battery are ignored, and the scheme wastes energy. Another method used to determine the state of charge is to monitor the voltage of the battery. However, this method alone is not a good indicator of battery energy, since both NiMH and NiCd batteries have voltage-versus-energy curves that are essentially flat. This paper presents a more effective method of determining the state of charge in secondary cell batteries. A NiMH battery is used as our test vehicle, since it is one of the more difficult batteries to determine state of charge. This method monitors the battery's temperature, voltage, and discharge/charge rate. A microcontroller then manipulates the information, using look-up tables to determine the state of charge. This technique can be used for both charge and discharge, without having to completely discharge the battery before each charging cycle. Also, by modifying the look-up tables, this technique can be employed in many other battery technologies, and is not limited to NiMH.",,"Charging (batteries); Electric charge; Electric control equipment; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Fuel gages; Monitoring; Personal computers; Service life; Table lookup; Temperature control; Voltage control; Battery charger; Battery lifetime; Battery operated electronics; Charging cycle; Charging times; Microcontroller; Nickel metal hydride batteries; State of charge indication; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028101704

In the 3.3V mode, a word line boost circuit is enabled, the input buffer trip points are modified, and the read path circuits are reconfigured for optimum performance. This memory uses the host computer 12V supply to minimize flash media cost and maximize flash media performance. The device contains an advanced user interface that allows the host to queue up to three commands for execution by the write state machine, designed to allow erase to be interrupted so a program operation can be executed. Two 256B page buffers improve write performance and reduce host overhead. Wafer yields are improved by including redundant row pairs and columns. These page buffers are interleaved between the WSM and UI, allowing the host to load one page buffer through the UI while the WSM programs data into the array from the other. When the WSM completes program operations from one page buffer, it immediately begins operations on the second, returning the first to the host to be refilled with data. This maximizes WSM activity and minimizes demands on the host. Internally, the algorithm for programming data from the page buffer amortizes time and energy-consuming voltage transitions across the entire data stream being programmed into the array.

It has been deduced that, with a horizontal-axis coiled, finned-type, heat exchanger-immersed in the traditional domestic hot-water tank-for extracting heat from the tank Nu(±0·04) = 0·28 Ra0·29 for 100 &lt; Ra &lt; 1500. where Nu and Ra are the mean Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers, respectively, for the freely-convecting flow in the tank. Among the design conclusions are: 1. (i) The optimal value of the ratio of height-to-diameter for the thermal store lies between 3 and 4. This is a compromise between achieving the improvements associated with (a) having a high degree of stratification (e.g. resulting from the use of a tall tank) and so facilitating rapid heat removal, and (b) minimising the surface area (and hence the rate of wild heat loss from the store). 2. (ii) Preferably, the walls of the thermal store should be made of a low-thermal-conductivity material and, provided mechanical integrity can be assured, only be of small thickness, thereby enhancing the degree of stratification achieved in the store. 3. (iii) An approximate value for the optimal thickness of thermal insulant applied to the tank, in order to minimise the wild heat losses through the tank's walls, can be calculated. Thus, for a typical insulant, it is recommended that a thickness of more than three times that traditionally used on domestic hot-water tanks be applied. 4. (iv) The use of a horizontal plate, located near the middle of the store, can lead to small increases in the rate of useful heat recovery from the store. © 1994.",,"Boilers; Energy conservation; Heat storage; Space heating; thermal insulation; Heat recovery; Optimal insulation; Residential heating; Water tanks; Hot water heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028098306

Second generation power plant designs, employing molten-salt and volumetric-air receivers, were assessed at the size of 30 and 100 MWe. The study developed a common guideline and use data from previous system tests and studies. The levelized-energy costs for the second generation plants were estimated and found to be competitive with costs from fossil-fueled power plants. Potential for further cost reductions exists if technical improvements can be introduced successfully in the long term. Additionally, the study presents results of plant reliability and uncertainty analyses. Mid- and long term technical potentials are described, as well as recommendations for the R&amp;D activities needed to reach the goal of large-scale commercialization. The results of this study have already helped direct research in the US and Europe. For example, the favorable potential for these technologies has led to the Solar Two molten-salt project in the US and the TSA volumetric receiver test in Spain. In addition, early analysis conducted within this study indicated that an advanced thermal storage medium was necessary to achieve favorable economics for the air plant. This led to the design of the thermal storage system currently being tested in Spain. In summary, each of the investigated receiver technologies has mid- and long-term potential for improving plant performance and reducing capital and energy costs (resulting in less than 10 cts/kWh given excellent insolation conditions) in an environmentally sage way and largely independent of fossil-fuel prices. Each central receiver technology described in the study has enough potential to justify its continued development.",,"Costs; Heat storage; Solar absorbers; Solar equipment; Solar power plants; Central receiver power plants; Molten salt receivers; Thermal storage system; Volumetric air receivers; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028096334

To avoid excessive operating voltage for the motor, a part of the PV array is switched off to reduce the voltage. As a result, the energy loss is significantly eliminated.

The algorithm is based on a dynamic program formulation which takes advantage of the time-of-use discount for electricity and storage capacities of reservoirs which serve the system. With the program, pump schedules may be generated which have been shown to result in energy savings that average to 15 percent of the historical unoptimized cost. To optimize pumping, it is necessary to track the time variation of demand in the system. In a typical system, water demand is spatially distributed. A practical approach to estimating zonal demand is by taking a mass balance between the pumping rates in and out of a pump-reservoir-pump module and using the changes in reservoir storage to estimate the water demand for the area served by the reservoir. Telemetered data is needed to get real-time information on pumping rates and reservoir levels. The program uses this information to determine the pump schedule.

The most commonly used techniques include internal segregation, containment, and incineration. Other common techniques include grinding, shredding, and disinfection, e.g., autoclaving and chemical treatment followed by landfilling. Of all the available technologies for medical waste treatment and disposal, incineration has been found to be the most effective method overall for destroying infectious and toxic material, volume reduction, and weight reduction in the medical waste stream. Incineration destroys the broadest variety of medical waste constituents and can recover energy from the medical waste stream.

Expanding demand for portable power resulted in a comparable demand to get the most charge for the dollar. Since charge can be restored by using secondary cells, the consumer often elects to amortize expensive battery pack cost over several years of service. The common in-production and in-development secondary battery chemistries that are most commonly employed include: sealed lead-acid (SLA), nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel/metal-hydride (NiMH), Li-ion, Li-polymer, and zinc-air (from Brodd, Reference 1). In this setting, optimal battery life in terms of charge duration, number of charge cycles, and storage lifetime or self-discharge have become the primary battery parameters of the trade. All of these parameters are measured relative to time and cost-per-Ah. Once we know which factors are important, it is equally critical to find the best method to measure these parameters with the appropriate accuracy, i.e., fuel gauging. Several products using different fundamental techniques have been introduced in the market that monitor batteries and give them smarts.

By different culture conditions for R. gelationsus and pasteurization of carbohydrate-rich cells, we were able to feed the ciliate with food mixtures of different carbohydrate content. Dry mass yields of the ciliate reached a maximum with mixtures of 80% carbohydrate-rich pasteurized cells plus 20% carbohydratepoor living cells. In the absence of degradable carbohydrate, energy metabolism depended on protein as substrate. Utilization of protein was incomplete, large amounts were converted into soluble compounds that accumulated in the culture medium.

This factor underscores the need for the development of reliable methods for predicting graft performance and thus ensuring optimal clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to describe the link between myocardial metabolism evaluated throughout preservation with the use of phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ventricular contractility after reperfusion. Thirteen pig hearts were excised and preserved from 3 to 12 hours with clinical techniques. During preservation the hearts underwent phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After reperfusion, left ventricular contractility was evaluated with an isolated heart model undergoing isovolumetric contraction. Throughout storage, β-adenosine triphosphate remained stable and intracellular pH and phosphocreatine decreased exponentially, whereas inorganic phosphate increased exponentially. Intracellular pH, phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphates measured at the onset of preservation, and intracellular pH and phosphocreatine measured at the end of preservation correlated significantly with the left ventricular contractility after reperfusion. We conclude that the metabolic state of myocardium at excision is especially important and that phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance evaluation of the heart during preservation appears to provide reliable indexes for predicting subsequent ventricular contractility after reperfusion.",,"adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; phosphate; adolescent; animal tissue; article; cell ph; heart left ventricle contractility; heart muscle metabolism; heart muscle reperfusion; heart preservation; induced hypothermia; nonhuman; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; swine; Animal; Bicarbonates; Calcium Chloride; Cardioplegic Solutions; Energy Metabolism; Heart Transplantation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypothermia, Induced; Magnesium; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardium; Organ Preservation; Phosphates; Potassium Chloride; Sodium Chloride; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Swine; Ventricular Function, Left",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028075389

Food intake, body weight and water balance indices were recorded on a weekly or daily basis. Over the 15-wk period, rats fed the experimental diet diverged into two groups differing in the rate of body weight gain. Animals were labeled as 'gainers' or 'resisters' depending on their susceptibility to obesity. Following the dietary period, rats were decapitated and trunk blood was collected for glucose and insulin measurements. Gainers consumed slightly more energy than resisters over the experimental period (P < 0.05), but due to greater fecal energy loss, absorbed energy did not differ. Hence gainers became obese without significantly altered energy retention. Urinary creatinine, urea nitrogen and water balance were not different between the groups and consequently could not explain body weight differences. Further, gainers had significantly greater plasma glucose concentration than controls, indicating a potential for these animals to become diabetic. Results suggest metabolic differences must account for the divergence in weight gain observed in the two groups.

An exponential increase in mortality with low temperatures occurs. Chilling tolerance (Tch) at 4 or 0°C was 6.3 days or 37.91 h for 50% survival (LT50), respectively, while the cold-shock tolerance (LT50 of Tcs) at -7°C was only 1.5 h. The increase in cold-shock tolerance (Tcs) at -7°C by acclimation at 4, or 0°C was rapid: the LT50 increased about 50% with only 2 h of treatment in comparison with the highest LT50 obtained by acclimation. An equilibrium point (Teq), the optimal acclimation time for maximal survival of chilling and/or cold-shock, was calculated from the survival data of experiments designed to assess Tch and Tcs. The Teq was found to be the half time of the acclimation period which resulted in 90% mortality at the chilling temperature (LT90 of Tch). Selection for tolerance to cold-shock or chilling over several generations resulted in a significant increase in Tcs or Tch, respectively. Higher contents of glycogen and total proteins were observed in the cold selected lines than in the control line. Exposure to chilling temperatures eventually depleted the energy reserves, but the highest concentrations of triacylglycerols and proteins were observed at the acclimation time with the highest Tcs. This suggests that systemic regulation in these energetic reserves may be an important part of the cold-hardening mechanisms to cope with the fluctuations of low temperatures causing cold-shock or chilling injury. © 1994.","Chilling injury; Cold-shock; Drosophila melanogaster; Energy storage; Genetic selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028066078

The leachability of regulated metals is affected by waste composition, its combustion history, and handling methods. Samples of mixed flyash and bottom ash were analyzed in accordance with the extraction procedure (EP) toxicity test at a waste-to-energy facility in 1982 and found to exhibit highly variable concentrations of lead and cadmium. This variability was found to be caused by flyash deposits, containing high concentrations of these volatile metals, which were periodically released during boiler cleaning. Analysis of extracts from flyash samples taken from six boiler and ESP hoppers showed substantial differences in metals concentrations from each hopper. Particle size analysis of flyash from each hopper revealed a relationship between the amount of extractable heavy metals and fine particulate. Leaching tests of flyash revealed the relationship between extracted lead and cadmium and the pH of the leachate, and the sensitivity of lead to low and high pH values. Analysis of samples taken from borings of the on-site ash residue storage pile showed that EP extractable metals concentrations were reduced far below regulatory levels after several years of exposure to natural rain. Graphical representations of data are shown to be useful tools for interpretation of data. Statistical analysis is used to evaluate the variability of lead and cadmium in extracts, and to determine the 90% upper confidence limit (UCL) in accordance with EPA procedures. The cyclical cleaning of the boiler created difficulties in obtaining representative samples and accurate estimates of EP toxicity results. The time at which samples were collected during a shift greatly influenced the results of sampling.",,"Cadmium; Combustion; Composition effects; Data reduction; Extraction; Fly ash; Graphic methods; Lead; Metals; Particle size analysis; pH; Toxicity; Ash residue; Bottom ash; Leachability; Municipal waste; Toxicity test; Variability; Waste composition; Leaching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028058402

School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, United States","Background: Left ventricular (LV) twist, the longitudinal gradient of circumferential rotation about the LV long axis, may play an important role in the storage of potential energy at end systole and its subsequent release as elastic recoil during early diastole; however, the effects of load and inotropic state on LV systolic twist and diastolic untwist in human subjects have not previously been characterized. Methods and Results: Six cardiac transplant recipients with 12 implanted radiopaque midwall LV myocardial markers were studied 1 year after transplantation. Biplane cinefluoroscopic marker images and LV pressure were recorded during control conditions and after afterload augmentation (methoxamine, 5 to 10 μg · kg-1 · min- 1), inotropic stimulation (dobutamine, 5 μg · kg-1 · min-1), and preload augmentation (volume loading with normal saline). Systolic twist dynamics were assessed by maximum twist (T(max)[rad/cm]), peak negative twist rate (-dT/dt(min)[rad · cm-1 · s-1]), and the slope of the twist normalized-ejection fraction relation (T-nEFR, M(sys)[rad/cm]) during systole. Diastolic untwist was assessed by the peak positive untwist rate (+dT/dt(max) [rad · cm-1 · s-1]) and the slopes (rad/cm) of the T-nEFR during early diastole (M(ear-dia)) and mid diastole (M(mid-dia)). Compared with control values, LV pressure and volume loading had no significant effect on T(max), -dT/dt(min), or M(sys); however, inotropic stimulation significantly increased all parameters describing systolic twist (T(max); - 0.10±0.03 versus -0.06±0.02 rad/cm, P&lt;.001; -dT/dt(min): -0.72±0.19 versus -0.44±0.22 rad · cm-1 · s-1, P&lt;.001; M(sys): -0.10±0.03 versus - 0.06±0.01 rad/cm, P&lt;.001). Pressure loading had no effect on early diastolic untwisting; however, dobutamine significantly increased M(ear-dia) (- 0.24±0.06 versus -0.13±0.04 rad/cm, P&lt;.0001) and +dT/dt(max) (0.78±0.24 versus 0.45±0.16 rad · cm-1 · s-1, P&lt;.001). Conversely, volume loading significantly decreased M(ear-dia) (-0.08±0.04 versus -0.13±0.04 rad/cm, P&lt;.05): M(ear-dia) correlated directly with LV contractile state (as assessed as maximum dP/dt, r=.60, P&lt;.0001) and inversely with end-systolic volume (r=- .87, P&lt;.0001) but was unrelated to stroke volume (r=.08, P=.30) or LV afterload (estimated as effective arterial elastance, r=.08, P=.29). M(mid- dia) did not change during any intervention. Conclusions: In conscious human transplant patients, (1) pressure and volume loading do not affect systolic LV twist; (2) dobutamine augments systolic twist and early diastolic untwisting, suggesting more end-systolic potential energy storage and early diastolic elastic recoil with enhanced inotropic state; (3) volume loading decreases early diastolic untwisting, possibly reflecting diminished recoil forces after preload augmentation associated with larger end-systolic volumes (ESV); and (4) M(ear-dia) correlates strongly with ESV (in an inverse fashion), and less strongly, but directly, with LV dP/dt(max).","diastolic filling; left ventricle; mechanics; twist","adolescent; adult; article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; female; functional anatomy; heart hemodynamics; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle size; heart left ventricle volume; heart movement; heart transplantation; human; human cell; human tissue; inotropism; male; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028047663

Insulin promotes a variety of anabolic enzymatic pathways and inhibits many catabolic enzymatic pathways involved in energy storage, as well as in synthesis of structural tissue proteins.

Insulin mediates all of its effects by initially binding and activating its specific cell-surface receptor. Conformational changes induced by insulin binding lead to activation of intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase.

A brief review of various bivariate exponential distributions is first given and an argument is presented for selection of the most appropriate model for earthquake hazard assessment. Dependency between the intensity and the time between the earthquakes in a given region is investigated. It is shown that ignoring the dependency (when it exists) results in, respectively, overestimation and underestimation of seismic hazard according to whether earthquakes occur as quasi-periodic (rhythmic) quakes or in clusters. Several examples using real data are given to provide further illustration of the application of the model. © 1994.",,"Earthquakes; Energy storage; Estimation; Hazards; Mathematical models; Probability; Statistical methods; Bivariate exponential distribution; Earthquake hazard assessment; Seismic gap hypothesis; Seismic hazard; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028016747

Employing symbolic operators, multi parameter gauges are introduced to enable individual partition level functional fits of domain decomposed problems. Such gauges are metered by a global minimization of the appropriate energy norm. To remove functional discontinuities on subdomain interfaces, successive applications of a partitioned steepest descent algorithm are employed as a smoothing step. The combination of partitioned initialization and iterative smoothing lead to a robust algorithmic pairing which can provide very accurate starting values for very large simulations. If successively iterated in a series of initialization—steepest descent smoothing cycles, the combined scheme can yield converged results in less iterations than the PCG. This is illustrated by a variety of benchmark examples which demonstrate the sensitivity of the scheme to partitioning, operator type and geometric topology. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper provides an analysis of electric space heating measurements from a project carried out by the Building Services Research and Information Association (BSRIA), and from a separate study by the Building Research Energy Conservation Support Unit (BRECSU) funded by the Energy Efficiency Office. The analysis is based on data from 24 dwellings located in Scotland and Southern England from the BSRIA study and 17 dwellings located in the West Midlands from the BRECSU study. Heating systems comprised a mixture of storage and direct heaters. The consumption of on-peak and off-peak electricity was recorded on a fortnightly basis for a period of a year or more. Despite differences in tenure and system design, the results of the two studies are consistent. Based on these results the following conclusions can be drawn: the amount of electricity consumed at off-peak rates is primarily determined by the size and number of storage heaters installed and not by the design heat loss; for dwellings having electric storage heaters with charge capacities within 90-150% of the value recommended in the DOM 8 design guidelines, the percentage of electricity used at off-peak rates is at most 86%, and may be as low as 79% (taking the use of supplementary portable electric heaters into account); for dwellings which have heater capacities of 90% or less of the recommended values the average off-peak percentage is only between 49% and 69%; the measured electrical consumptions are consistent with levels expected for partial dwelling heating (e.g. when some rooms are heated for much less than nine hours a day). This suggests the proportion of consumption at off-peak rates for space heating established from this analysis are only appropriate for partial dwelling heating. The proportion of off-peak electricity required for whole dwelling heating is likely to be lower. © 1994, Sage Publications.

Haynes 188 containment canisters with a high thermal emittance (ε) are desired for radiating heat away from local hot spots, improving the heating distribution, which will in turn improve canister service life. In addition to needing a high emittance, the surface needs to be durable in an elevated temperature, high vacuum (APEQ 830°C, &lt;10-7 torr) environment for an extended time period. Thirty-five Haynes 188 samples were exposed to 14 different types of surface modification techniques for emittance and vacuum heat treatment (VHT) durability enhancement evaluation. Optical properties were obtained for the modified surfaces. Emittance enhanced samples were exposed to VHT for up to 2692 hours at 827°C and ≤10-6 torr with integral thermal cycling. Optical properties were taken intermittently during exposure, and after final VHT exposure. The various surface modification treatment increased the emittance of pristine Haynes 188 from 0.11 up to 0.86. Seven different surface modification techniques were found to provide surfaces which met the SD GTD receiver VHT durability requirement (ε≥ 0.70 after 1000 hrs) Of the 7 surface treatments, 2 were found to display excellent VHT durability: an alumina based (AB) coating (ε=0.85 after 2695 VHT hrs). and a zirconia based coating (ε=0.86 after 2024.3 VHT hrs). The alumina based coating was chosen for the ε enhancement surface modification technique for the SD GTD receiver. Details of the performance and vacuum heat treatment durability of this coating and other Haynes 188 emittance surface modification techniques are discussed.

A diagram of this computational environment is shown in Fig. 1. The primary computational resource, a Thinking Machines Corp. 1024-node CM-5 with 32 Gbyte of memory and four 800-Mbit/s high-performance parallel-interface (HIPPI) channels is used by several applications to model complex physical processes. One of these applications, a state-of-the-art global ocean model, generates several hundred gigabytes of data during a long simulation. Global ocean models must run for several decades of simulated time because of the physical properties of the ocean. These calculations typically require hundreds of hours on the world's fastest supercomputers and consequently do not generate data at gigabit-per-second rates. The results of these calculations is a multigigabyte file containing the time- and space-dependent values of various physical properties, such as temperature and velocity. These results are typically visualized on a high-resolution frame buffer driven at gigabit-per-second rates. A fast disk system is used to store the data and to stream it to the frame buffer. Moving data from mass storage to a frame buffer at near gigabit-per-second rates motivated the design of a new file-system architecture. This architecture eliminates the traditional mainframe bottleneck between the disk storage devices and the network by attaching the storage devices directly to the network. We have achieved rates of 60 Mbit/s from a RAID disk array to a frame buffer system attached to a HIPPI-based network. Gigabit-per-second networks are permitting new approaches to file system architectures and visualization systems.

Monte Carlo calculations and experimental measurements were used to characterize how the scatter and primary fluences at the detector plane were influenced by scattering geometry and the energy spectrum of the incident beam. The calculated scatter fluences were differentiated according to photon energy and scattering process. Scatter fractions were measured on a medical linear accelerator (Clinac 2100c, 6 MV) for a typical imaging geometry using an ionization chamber and a silicon diode. After correction for the energy dependence of the chamber and diode, the scatter fractions generated by the Monte Carlo simulations were found to be in excellent agreement with the measured results. In order to estimate the effect of scatter on image quality, the scatter and primary signals (i.e., energy deposited) produced in five different types of portal imaging detectors (lead plate/film, storage phosphor alone, lead plate/storage phosphor, Compton recoil-electron detector, and a copper plate/Gd202S phosphor) were calculated. The results show that, for a specified geometry, the scatter fraction can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the sensitivity of the imaging detector to low-energy (1 MeV) scattered radiation. For a common portal imaging detector (copper plate/Gd202S phosphor), the scattered radiation (i) reduced contrast by much as 50% for a fixed display-contrast system, and (ii) decreased the differential-signal-to-noise ratio (DSNR) by 10%-20% for a quantum-noise-limited portal imaging system. For currently available TV-camera-based portal imaging systems, which have variable display contrast, the reduction in DSNR depends on the light collection efficiency and the noise characteristics of the TV camera. Overall, these results show that scattered radiation can reduce contrast significantly in portal films while deteriorating image quality only moderately in on-line systems. © 1994, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Twelve normal-weight postobese women (PO) and 12 closely matched controls were given the test meal after a 2-day carbohydrate- rich weight-maintenance diet (58 E% carbohydrate). Whereas the thermic effect of the meals was similar in the two groups, postprandial fat oxidation was 2.5 times more suppressed in PO compared with controls (P < 0.05). A similarly enhanced suppression of arterialized plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids was seen postprandially in PO (P < 0.05), possibly due to a more marked suppression of epinephrine and a reduced glucagon response in PO than in controls. Moreover, the postprandial plasma triglyceride response was attenuated and only amounted to 43% of that in controls (P < 0.05). This may be explained by a more pronounced increase in gastric inhibitory polypeptide in PO, giving rise to a higher adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. No other differences were found in plasma substrates and hormones or in subjective appetite scores. In conclusion, a metabolic and hormonal pattern favoring lipid storage was observed in postobese subjects after a high-fat meal.","catecholamine; energy expenditure; fat and carbohydrate oxidation; gastric inhibitory peptide; glucagon; plasma lipids; safety","adrenalin; carbohydrate; fat; fatty acid; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon; lipoprotein lipase; triacylglycerol; adrenalin blood level; adult; appetite; article; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; female; glucagon blood level; hormone response; human; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; obesity; postprandial state; priority journal; triacylglycerol blood level",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028008203

A total of 35 samples, differing in variety (early, mid and late season type), total nitrogen supply (40–60 kg N per ha, 90–120 kg N per ha, 180–190 kg N per ha), time of harvest (early, mid and late) and cultivation year (1990 and 1991), were evaluated. The nutritive value of each of the 35 carrot samples was determined in trials with rats. Of the chemical components analysed, protein content exhibited the largest variation (46–101 g kg−1 DM). The late season variety had the highest protein content and the early season variety the lowest. The protein content increased with nitrogen fertilisation. The protein digestibility increased together with the protein content, probably due to a larger proportion of the protein being deposited as storage protein. The protein increment was accompanied by a significant drop in essential amino acids (g per 16 g N). The energy content was low (165–173 MJ kg−1 DM). However, the energy digestibility was high (76.2–88.8%) due to a large proportion of soluble fibre in the dietary fibre fraction. The content of Cd and Pb was below what is considered as acceptable levels.

The sequence by which kidneys functioning near the limits of “critical perfusion pressures” develop parenchymal injury is not well understood. We studied poststenotic renal pressures, glomerular volume, and renal function in conscious rats using an aortic coarct model during antihypertensive therapy with sodium restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition over 4 weeks. These were compared with acute reduction of renal pressures using aortic ligation. Both models reduced poststenotic pressures to 50 to 60 mm Hg. Total aortic ligation produced tubular necrosis and glomerular collapse with 40-fold elevated urinary N-acetyl-glucosaminidase excretion. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition reduced renal blood flow by 30% without evident disruption in tubular function, reflected by low fractional excretion of sodium levels and normal excretion of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. The glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction were reduced. These results indicate that gradual reduction of renal perfusion pressure produces functional and morphologic consequences different from those observed with acute ischemic injury. Mechanisms by which chronic renal perfusion deficits produce tissue injury are reviewed and may include disruption of vascular regulation, energy storage molecules, cellular ion gradients, free radical generation, and disruption of cytoskeletal configuration and repair mechanisms. Further study of the pathways of chronic renal parenchymal injury beyond arterial stenosis is essential to achieve rational intervention and revascularization in humans. © 1994, National Kidney Foundation.

Resting measurements were made, followed by a hyperinsulinaemic (100 mU/m2/min) euglycaemic clamp (4.5 mmol/l). The subjects were six healthy, obese subjects (mean body mass index before weight loss 37.0 ± 1.7 kg/m2 and after weight loss 31.4 ± 2.3 kg/m2). The following measurements were made: indirect calorimetry, blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow, plasma catecholamines, plasma deuterated glucose turnover before and during a glucose clamp. Glucose disposal during the clamp increased from 2.53 ± 0.40 to 3.31 ± 0.42 mmol/min after weight loss (P &lt; 0.01). Glucose-induced thermogenesis rose from 0.15 ± 0.09 to 0.50 ± 0.12 kJ/min (P &lt; 0.05). The apparent cost of glucose storage was not significantly different from zero prior to weight loss, but increased to 11.0 ± 2.2% after weight loss. In response to the clamp endogenous glucose production was suppressed by 66 ± 7% initially and this was not affected by weight loss. Weight loss was accompanied by increased peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose-induced thermogenesis, but it did not affect hepatic insulin sensitivity.","Glucose clamp; Glucose turnover; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Weight loss","catecholamine; glucose; insulin; adult; article; blood pressure; body mass; calorimetry; cardiovascular response; catecholamine blood level; clinical article; controlled study; female; forearm blood flow; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose clamp technique; glucose metabolism; heart rate; human; insulin sensitivity; male; metabolism; obesity; priority journal; thermogenesis; weight reduction; Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Body Temperature Regulation; Calorimetry; Cardiovascular Physiology; Catecholamines; Energy Metabolism; Epinephrine; Female; Glucose Clamp Technique; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Human; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Obesity; Respiration; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027998212

Throughout the year, several size classes of eggs were observed, and spawning was seen to occur twice. A major spawning occurred in May leaving the gonad completely empty in June. A minor spawning is also thought to have occurred between the November and December sampling periods. These spawnings do not seem to correlate with the classical environmental factors often associated with gametogenesis and spawning, namely temperature and chlorophyll a levels. The energy for gametogenesis seems to be obtained from the transfer of metabolites to the oocytes via specialized follicle cells. These metabolites are believed to be of heterosynthetic origin. An inverse relationship exists between the thickness of the follicle cell epithelium and the occupancy level of the gametes. During periods of gonadal proliferation, these cells represent the nutritive cells of the gonad, but during periods of non-proliferation they make up a somatic tissue used for metabolite storage until conditions are adequate for gonadal development. © 1994, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

If a decrease in this storage is due to an inadequate oxygen supply- to-demand ratio, improving the perfusion should restore it. Therefore, in anesthetized endotoxemic rats we studied organ perfusion and the storage of high-energy phosphates of heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle and measured the effects of improving cardiac output (CO) and organ blood flow with cardiostimulatory drugs [dopexamine (DX) and dobutamine (DB)]. Endotoxin (Escherichia coli O127.B8, 8 mg/kg) was infused from 0 to 60 min in three groups of anesthetized rats: one untreated (saline only) group (ES; n = 10), and two groups in which we infused DX (3 x 10-8 mol · kg-1 · min-1; n = 10) or DB (10-7 mol · kg-1 · min-1; n = 8) from 60 to 135 min. A fourth group served as time-matched controls (C; n = 8). Organ blood flows at 0 and 135 min (end of experiment) were measured with radioactive microspheres. In biopsies (at 135 min) we measured lactate, ATP, and CrP concentrations. Endotoxemia decreased CO (45% at 135 min; P &lt; 0.05), which could be restored by DX and DB. Myocardial and skeletal muscle blood flow and ATP did not differ in the groups at 135 min. Hepatic and renal blood flow decreased in the ES group 44 and 52%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); DX restored the fall of hepatic and DB of renal blood flow. Tissue lactate concentration followed serum lactate levels; low in C, high in ES, and intermediate in DB and DX groups. High-energy phosphate content suffered during endotoxemia: in heart and skeletal muscle CrP, and in liver and kidney ATP and CrP, had decreased; DB and DX restored CrP in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney; moreover, DX improved ATP in liver and kidney. Our results indicate that endotoxin administration resulted in a dissociation between tissue blood flow and ATP and CrP, which was not identical in the tissues studied.","cardiostimulatory drugs; dobutamine therapy; dopexamine therapy; regional blood flow; tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate concentration; tissue creatine phosphate concentration; tissue lactate concentration","adenosine triphosphate; cerium 141; creatine phosphate; dobutamine; dopexamine; lactic acid; nobelium; ruthenium; scandium 46; sodium chloride; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; endotoxemia; glucose blood level; heart muscle blood flow; heart output; hemodynamics; hypovolemic shock; intravenous drug administration; kidney blood flow; lactate blood level; liver blood flow; male; microcirculation; nonhuman; organ blood flow; priority journal; radioactivity; rat; skeletal muscle; tissue oxygenation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027995085

Furthermore, 4-week treatment with saline or the TRH-analogue posatireline was performed. The muscular concentration of the following metabolites related to the energy metabolism was evaluated: glycogen, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; citrate, a-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate; aspartate, glutamate, alanine; ammonia; ATP, ADP, AMP, creative phosphate; energy charge potential. Furthermore the maximum rate of the following muscular enzymes was evaluated: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; total NADH cytochrome c reductase; cytochrome oxidase. The age-related decrease in muscular glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate and alanine concentrations and increase in citrate concentration were consistent with the age-related decreased hexokinase and increased citrate synthase activities. Ageing was characterized by a decrease in muscular creative phosphate concentration, while the energy mediators and the energy charge potential were unchanged.

The most common application of silicides in state of the art CMOS processes is to use them as a conducting layer that can withstand high temperature processes and that has a significantly lower sheet resistivity than doped mono or poly crystalline silicon. Besides their role as a temperature stable conductor silicides have further interesting properties when using them as a diffusion source for impurities to generate shallow junctions, or as an alternative gate material with a work function in the middle of the silicon band gap.

The thermogenic, metabolic and cardiovascular responses to a 90 min infusion of adrenaline were measured. The subjects were eleven obese subjects (Body Mass Index 36.0 ± 1.2 kg/m2) and 10 non-obese subjects (Body Mass Index 21.9 ± 0.7 kg/m2). Metabolic rate, heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, plasma palmitate turnover and oxidation were measured. Thermogenic responses to adrenaline were similar in the lean and obese groups (14.4 ± 1.6 and 15.1 ± 1.6 J/min/kg fat free mass respectively). Of the cardiovascular variables measured, only the increase in forearm blood flow during adrenaline infusion differed between lean and obese, being 3.9 ± 0.5 and 1.9 ± 0.3 ml/min/100 ml forearm respectively. Basal plasma palmitate turnover rates were lower in the obese when expressed per unit fat mass (2.32 ± 0.17 and 7.61 ± 1.20 μmol/min/kg fat mass respectively). Basal plasma palmitate oxidation rates were higher in the obese when expressed per unit fat free mass (1.53 ± 0.19 and 0.82 ± 0.12 μmol/min/kg fat free mass respectively). In response to adrenaline palmitate turnover increased similarly in both groups, but plasma palmitate oxidation rates fell in the obese whilst they were unchanged in the lean. In the basal state the obese do not appear to have a defect in fat oxidation, but their response to infused adrenaline may favour fat storage over oxidation. No thermogenic defect was shown in the obese.","Adrenaline infusion; Obesity; Palmitate oxidation; Palmitate turnover; Sympathetic nervous system; Thermogenesis","adrenalin; adrenergic receptor; palmitic acid; adrenergic system; adult; article; blood level; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular response; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; female; forearm blood flow; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; metabolic rate; metabolism; normal human; obesity; priority journal; thermogenesis; Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Body Temperature Regulation; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Epinephrine; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Forearm; Glycerol; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Human; Hydroxybutyrates; Infusions, Intravenous; Insulin; Lactates; Male; Norepinephrine; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitates; Regional Blood Flow; Respiration; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027985777

Relatively small amounts of energy depositing in the coils of superconducting magnets can result in a “quench,” the irreversible transition to the normal resistive state. The quench limit of superconducting magnets, therefore, constrains local beam loss throughout the injection, acceleration, and storage cycles to extremely low levels. From a practical standpoint, it follows that there is essentially no prompt radiation in most regions due to normal operations. The design of shielding is, therefore, principally driven by the consequences of a single pulse fault at full energy in one of the two storage rings. Since there are no regulatory requirements or guidance documents that prescribe radiological performance goals for this situation, the RHIC Project has proposed a scheme to classify the various areas of the RHIC complex based on Design Basis Accident faults. The criteria is then compared to existing regulatory requirements and guidance recommendations. © 1994 Health Physics Society Pergamon Press plc.","Accelerators; Exposure; Radiation; Regulations; Safety standards","acceleration; article; etiology; heavy ion radiation; magnet; nuclear accident; personnel radiation monitoring; priority journal; radiation beam; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation hazard; safety; standard; synchrotron; Equipment Design; Ions; Particle Accelerators; Radiation Protection; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027982817

In both solutions, concentrations of ATP and ADP as well as the energy charge decreased substantially while AMP concentrations increased within the first hours of preservation. In UW solution, the total adenine nucleotide pool (TAN) was found to remain approximately constant during 24h of cold ischemia, whereas in Ringer's it decreased after 12 h.

In a cross-sectional design we measured 24-h substrate oxidations on a standardized diet in 38 overweight or obese and 35 nonobese women. Fat oxidation (g/d) was mainly a function of total energy requirements (r = 0.71, P < 0.0001). To account for this we used for further analysis oxidative fat energy (%), a counterpart to dietary fat energy (%). After differences in fat energy of consumed food (%), age, and 24-h energy balance were adjusted for, obese women had higher oxidative fat energy than did nonobese women [40.2% (37.8-42.6) vs 36.0% (33.6-38.5), P < 0.02]. Adjusted oxidative fat energy (%) increased with increasing size of fat mass (r = 0.31, P < 0.01). This relation suggests that a 10-kg change in fat mass may be caused by a change in dietary fat energy of ≥ 1.6% (0.4-2.7%). The study supports the concept that in susceptible individuals the expansion of fat stores is a prerequisite to increase the oxidative fat energy to an amount commensurate with a high percentage of dietary fat energy.",,"fat; adaptation; adult; article; body fat; controlled study; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; female; human; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; major clinical study; obesity; respiratory quotient; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027979143

A hemispheric transducer transmitted an ultrasonic pulse that was detected by a linear array transducer after propagation through an abdominal wall section. the array was translated in the elevation direction to collect data over a two-dimensional aperture. Differences in arrival time and energy level between the measured waveforms and calculated references that account for geometric delay and spreading were found. Plots of waveforms compensated for geometric path, maps of time delay differences and energy level fluctuations, and statistics derived from these for water paths and tissue paths characterize the measurement system and describe the time delay differences and energy level fluctuations caused by 14 different human abdominal wall specimens. Repeated measurements using the same specimens show that individual tissue path measurements are reproducible, the results depend on specimen position, and frozen storage of a specimen for three months does not appear to alter the time delay differences and energy level fluctuations produced by the specimen. Comparison of measurements at room and body temperature indicates that appreciably higher time delay differences occur at body temperature while energy level fluctuations and time delay difference patterns are less affected. for the 14 different abdominal wall specimens, the rms time delay differences and energy level fluctuations have average values of 43.0 ns and 3.30 dB, respectively, and the associated correlation lengths of the time delay differences and energy level fluctuations are 7.90 and 2.28 mm, respectively. The spatial patterns of time delay difference and energy level fluctuation in the reception plane appear largely uncorrelated, although some background variations in energy level fluctuation are similar to features in time delay difference maps.

The high energy expenditure is largely due to the increased fat-free mass. The failure to find a positive relationship between reported energy intake and body size reflects a greater under-reporting of calorie intake among obese individuals. Obesity, therefore, develops as a consequence of a chronic imbalance between intake and expenditure, although the cause of this is not apparent from the energy balance equation. However, this equation can be dissected into its component nutrient balance equations because net de novo lipogenesis is negligible in free-living humans. Fat calories are handled very differently from non-fat calories. Non-fat nutrient oxidation rates rise and fall to match the fluctuations in non-fat intake so that non-fat calorie balance is actively maintained. In contrast, changes in fat intake do not acutely affect fat oxidation but are matched by changes in storage. Therefore, within the fat balance equation there is ample scope for a chronic imbalance between fat intake and oxidation. Also, there is some evidence that carbohydrate balance may be an important signal for hunger and satiety. These concepts imply that, under free-living, ad libitum eating conditions, changes in nutrient intake composition (e.g. an increased proportion of fat in the diet) or changes in nutrient oxidation composition (e.g. a decrease in the proportion of fat oxidized) will lead to body weight change (in these cases, to weight gain). Considering obesity as a consequence of normal physiology (with its normal variation between individuals) in a 'pathological' environment (high fat diet, low exercise) offers an important perspective for explaining the interpopulation and interindividual differences in obesity and for formulating treatment and prevention options. Low energy expenditure (relative to body size), high respiratory quotient and insulin sensitivity have been shown to be predictors of weight gain, although upon gaining weight these metabolic factors tend to 'normalize'. Metabolic responses to underfeeding or overfeeding are largely predictable from the changes in calorie intake and changes in body composition, but some adaptive changes may occur. © 1994 Baillière Tindall.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data on basal metabolic rate and fat deposition in 360 pregnancies from 10 studies in a wide range of nutritional settings was performed. RESULTS: The energy costs of pregnancy varied widely between different communities: maintenance costs from -45 to +210 MJ, fat deposition from -23 to +267 MJ, and total energy costs from -20 to +523 MJ. Total costs were correlated with prepregnancy fatness (r = 0.80, p < 0.01) and pregnancy weight gain (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). Marginally nourished women conserved energy by suppressing metabolic rate and by gaining little fat. CONCLUSIONS: The energy needs of pregnancy are modulated over a wide range in response to maternal energy status. This may be an important means of protecting fetal growth. © 1994, Mosby-Year Book, Inc..

The three enzymes form a complex inside the lysosome, and the neuraminidase and β‐galactosidase deficiencies are secondary to CARB L deficiency. Sequence similarity and common enzymological properties suggest that the protomeric tertiary structure of CARB L is conserved within a family of serine carboxypeptidases which includes the yeast carboxypeptidase Y, killer expression I gene product and several plant carboxypeptidases. We used this homology to build a model of the CARB L structure based on the recently published X‐ray atomic coordinates of the wheat carboxypeptidase II (CPDW‐II) which shares 32% primary structure identity with CARB L. Small insertions and deletions were accommodated into the model structure by energy minimization using the DREIDING II force field. The Cα atomic‐coordinates of the final CARB L model have a RMS shift of 1.01 Å compared to the corresponding conserved residues in the CPDW‐II template structure. The correct orientation of the homologous catalytic triad residues Ser150, His429 and Asp392, the potential energy calculations and the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophillic residues in the structure all support the validity of the CARB L model. Most missense mutations identified in galactosialidosis patients were located in secondary structural elements except for the Tyr211→Asn mutation which is in a loop. The other mutant residues have their side chains deeply buried in the central β‐sheet of the model structure except for the Phe412→Val mutation which is located in the dimer interface. The predicted effects of specific mutations on CARB L structural stability correlates well with recently published transient expression studies of mutant CARB L (Shimmoto, M. et al., J. Clin.

Results show that for each energy fluence, the beam intensity decreases from the center to the outside rim of the beam. A plot of beam intensity versus the radius of the treatment field approaches a truncated normal distribution with a full width at half‐maximum of 4.7–4.8 mm.

Magnesium deficiency can contribute to both cardiac dysrhythmia and heart failure, especially in clinical settings of acute myocardial ischemia, digoxin toxicity, or Torsades de pointes, associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Magnesium deficiency may accompany potassium deficiency, in which case the potassium deficit can be difficult to correct unless magnesium is also repleted. The clinical consequences of magnesium depletion are probably under-appreciated because serum magnesium levels may not reflect intracellular magnesium loss.

Clinical problems in the use of megavoltage imaging include limited field of view, loss of information at the field edge due to penumbra effects, degradation of the image by bowel gas, and difficulties in the detection of soft tissue-air interfaces. Possible solutions to these problems are discussed. The imaging system has been used to assess the random errors occurring during routine para-aortic nodal irradiation.

In the CNS, iron is a key component of systems responsible for myelination and the synthesis of several neurotransmitters. In this study the spatial and temporal pattern of iron and its regulatory proteins transferrin and ferritin are quantitatively examined in the rat CNS during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life and in adults and aged animals. The midbrain, the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellum-pons are examined independently. Iron, transferrin, and ferritin concentrations are highest in all three brain regions at birth and decrease in each region to minimum levels during the third postnatal week. The decrease in levels of iron, transferrin, and ferritin is most pronounced in the cerebellum-pons and cortex and least in the midbrain. From postnatal day 17, iron (total iron content) and ferritin levels increase throughout the life-time of the rat. In contrast, transferrin levels remain fairly constant in each brain region after postnatal day 24. The midbrain region, which includes the iron-rich regions such as the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and red nucleus, has the least change in iron with development, has the highest level of ferritin during development, and consistently has the highest level of transferrin at all ages. These observations are consistent with reports that iron is important for normal motor function. Transferrin did not increase after postnatal day 24 in the three brain regions examined despite increasing amounts of iron, which implies a decrease in iron mobility in the aged rats, a finding that is consistent with observations of human brain tissue. The data reported in this study demonstrate that iron acquisition and mobilization systems in the CNS are established early in development and that the overall pattern of acquisition among brain regions is similar. These data offer support and insight into established concepts that a sufficient iron supply is critical for normal neurological development.","Aging; Development; Iron; Metal neurotoxicity; Neuroglia; Oxidative damage","ferritin; iron; transferrin; animal tissue; article; brain cortex; brain development; brain level; iron storage; mesencephalon; newborn; nonhuman; pons; postnatal development; priority journal; protein localization; rat; tissue distribution; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027932255

Oral administration of EGb 761 (100 mg/kg/day) for 5 days to Wistar rats caused an increase in the in vitro uptake of glucose by erythrocytes, especially in high‐glucose (13.32 mM) medium, an effect that was associated with an increase in intracellular energy metabolism and reflected as a significant reduction in free glucose concentration. In contrast, the lactate concentration of the erythrocytes and lactate release to the bathing medium were not modified. Conversion of glucose into glycogen was significantly increased in the erythrocytes of EGb 761‐treated animals. Taken together, these findings indicate that in vivo administration of EGb 761 exerts an action favoring the transformation of glucose into glycogen, its storage form. Oral administration of the EGb 761 constituent bilobalide (4 or 8 mg/kg/day) for 5 days caused similar changes in the uptake of glucose and its conversion into glycogen.

In 1992, the Plant's mission was changed to decommissioning, decontamination, and environmental restoration. In order to support this new mission, the safety analysis for Building 707 required rebaselining of the risk of resuming thermal stabilization of pyrophoric forms of plutonium by electrical heating in an air environment, as well as other activities to support the building in a standby and interim storage mode. An Safety Analysis Review Team was established to assess the new mission risks. The Review Team was comprised of safety analysis experts, including subcontractors such as Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation and Science Applications International Corporation who previously rebaselined the safety analyses for Buildings 707 and 559 for resumption of plutonium production operations. The general approach for assessing the new mission was to update the safety analysis that rebaselined risks from fires, explosions, spills, criticalities, and seismic events for the previous production mission. Accident scenarios were reviewed for applicability to the new mission and risk dominant scenarios were identified. Event tree analyses of the risk dominant scenarios were modified to establish accident sequence frequencies for the new mission. Radiological source terms were revised to reflect the quantities of plutonium at risk for the new mission. While the total amount of plutonium metal is reduced due to the mission change, the amount of plutonium oxide powder is expected to be greater. Radiological consequences and risks were analyzed with the MELCOR Accident Consequence Code System (MACCS) computer code for the dose to the maximum offsite individual and the latent cancer fatality risks to the population within 10 and 50 miles. Risk information was presented in terms of mean risk estimates and risk curves. A comparison of risks was then made to the NUREG-1150 risk curves from severe accident analysis of power reactors and to the Department of Energy SEN-35-91 quantitative safety goals (i.e., less than 0.1% prompt fatalities and less than 0.1% latent cancer fatalities). Also, a comparison was made to the expected number of fatalities caused by commercial and residential building collapses due to the seismic event itself in populated areas around the Rocky Flats Plant.",,"Accident prevention; Accidents; Codes (symbols); Computer aided analysis; Estimation; Failure analysis; Nuclear power plants; Personnel; Plutonium; Reactor startup; Risks; Thermodynamic stability; Mean risk estimates; Plutonium thermal stabilization; Risk curves; Safety analysis; Subcontractors; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027929815

The designs are similar to previous receivers having axial distribution of concentrated solar input flux, but differ in utilizing axial conduction in the storage material for attenuation of the solar flux `signal', and in having convective heat removal at the base of the receiver. One-dimensional, time-dependent heat transfer equations are formulated for the storage material temperature field, including radiative losses to the environment, and a general heat exchange effectiveness boundary condition at the base. The orbital periodic input solar flux is represented as the sum of steady and oscillating components, with the steady component solved numerically subject to specified receiver thermal efficiency. For the oscillating components the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is applied, and the complex transfer function of the receiver is obtained and evaluated as a filter for the input flux spectrum. Inverse transformation, result in the amplitudes and mode shapes of the oscillating temperatures. By adjustment of design parameters, the amplitude of the oscillating component of the outlet gas temperature is limited to an acceptable magnitude. The overall result of the investigation is the dependence of the receiver M*c product (mass times specific heat) on the conduction transfer units, which leads to lower weight designs than comparable previous single- and two-phase designs, when all constraints are included. As these designs also offer improvements in cost reduction and reliability they warrant further detailed investigation.",,"Algorithms; Design; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Solar equipment; Fast Fourier transforms; Radiative losses; Solar dynamic receivers; Solar flux; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027928087

To avoid reionization in the bending magnet before reaching the detector, the n=81 population was transferred to a state well below the reionization threshold by a Ti:sapphire laser.

With a plane capillary, this may allow detection of infrared radiation at a microwatt level.

The nature of movement and function of the sacroiliac joints is obscure. I hypothesize that these joints function as part of the lumbosacroiliac complex, and act as self-compensating force-couples to balance forces of gravity, weight-loading, inertia, rotation, acceleration and deceleration. These forces are accommodated in variations in tensile ligamentous stress that is translated into compressive forces in the sacroiliac joints, which increases friction and stability, and allows increased weight-loading without shearing. This also allows storage of energy in the form of increased tensile ligamentous stress without injury to the joint. The joints appear to have both a transverse and an oblique axis, the location of which is dependent upon the moment of the applied forces, which may vary and change the location and direction of the axis. Dysfunction may occur with an anterior displacement of the line of gravity if anterior pelvic support fails to maintain self-bracing and friction. The resulting lesion may mimic disc dysfunction or give the impression of a multifactorial etiology and prevents normal function of the force couple. © 1994 Maney Publishing.","Innominate bones; Pathomechanics; Sacroiliac joints; Self-bracing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007827475

It turns out that starting from ordered tetragonal CoV, mechanical milling generates atomic disorder during the early stage of milling and transforms the material to an amorphous state after continued milling. The magnetization at 4·2 K of CoV increases continuously with increasing milling time in the early stage of milling and it tends to become constant after continued milling. The results obtained by DSC analyses give detailed and precise information about the process of structural changes. In the DSC scans of CoV milled for various periods up to 20 h, exothermic heat effects corresponding to the atomic reordering process of the disordered compound and to the growth of small crystallites are observed. Starting from the sample milled for 40 h, an exothermic heat effect due to crystallization of the amorphous phase is detected. This effect develops rapidly upon further milling. After prolonged periods of milling, all physical parameters measured in the present investigation tend to become constant and amorphization is completed. Since, during heating of the ball-milled samples, the heat released in the atomic reordering and in the grain growth are comparable, it is concluded that both atomic disorder and grain boundaries are the important sources of energy storage during the ball-milling and eventually induce amorphization of crystalline CoV. © 1994.","amorphization; atomic disorder; ball-milling; crystallization; intermetallic compound",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004541624

In the present paper two case-studies are described in which energy storage is calculated to evaluate work load. In the first case-study job-rotation, a change of the temporal characteristics of the work load appears to cause a decrease of the energy stored and hence of the risk of damage. In a case-study on lifting it is shown that the effect of a reduction of the intensity of the work load (i.e. a reduction of the mass lifted), can be offset by changes of the frequency or duration of lifting. These adverse effects of the change in frequency or duration are not adequately reflected in the NIOSH lifting guidelines. It is concluded that temporal characteristics have to be considered when evaluating work load and that the calculation of energy storage in the motion segment can be used to this end. © 1994.","Biomechanics; Compression; Ergonomics; Job-rotation; Lifting; Low back pain; Motion segment; Strength",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001675630

The purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of the role played by electron-donating species in zeolites in general, with specific applications to materials that have been suggested as storage matrices for radioactive materials. The effect of the intercalated species (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) on the electronic structure of the zeolite is presented on the basis of an analysis of the total and projected density of states, Mulliken charges, and charge density differences. The results of those analyses indicate that, relative to a charge neutral atomic state, the Group IA species donate an electron to the zeolite lattice and interact most strongly with the s and p atomic states of oxygen as the species are moved through the lattice. In addition, estimates of the self-diffusion constants of Na, K, Rb, and Cs based upon a one-dimensional diffusion model parameterized from the ab initio total energy data will be presented. We find that the estimated self-diffusion rate decreased markedly with increasing cation size, and that the diffusion rate of Cs was essentially zero in bulk pollucite. The cationic charge is unchanged as the species moves through the lattice. This indicates that model potentials based upon an ionic interpretation of the Group IA species may be reasonable. © 1994 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001230353

The approach is essentially the same as in part I of this series of papers and consists of representing the microstructure by a discrete two-dimensional lattice. The crystallographic orientation of each lattice element and its neighbours determines the position of grain boundaries and their energies. Hot deformation is modelled by adding recrystallization nuclei and stored energy continuously with time. Nucleation of recrystallization is modelled by introducing a three-site nucleus and is represented by two generic types of model: Either random nucleation or preferential nucleation in regions of high stored energy. An energy-storage-rate schedule was used to model both work hardening and dynamic recovery of metals by way of a stage III work-hardening law. The novel approach taken in this paper was to model a non-uniform deformation substructure by using a mean cell size L and a mean distance R between cell-wall dislocations. Experimental evidence suggests that both L and R are inversely proportional to the deformation stress. These observations were used to develop a phenomenological expression for heterogeneous distribution of the stored energy used in the simulations. The observed dependencies of the evolution of stress and mean grain size with strain were similar to those obtained with the use of a homogeneous stored-energy distribution. However, the relations obtained between transient and steady-state parameters show distinct differences and demonstrate that any realistic model of dynamic recrystallization must account for the presence of the dislocation substructure. Finally, the kinetics of dynamic recrystallization in the simulations were shown to be sensitive to the rate of deformation and to be consistent with experimental observations. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001129483

It is found that the magnetization at 4.2 K increases continuously with increasing milling time in ferromagnetic Ni3Sn2 and Fe3Ge2. In contrast, in ferrimagnetic Mn3Sn2 it decreases. The unit-cell volume of both Mn3Sn2 and Fe3Ge2 continuously increases. These results are explained well in terms of a special type of atomic disorder: redistribution of transition-metal atoms over two different types of transition-metal sites, induced by ball milling. Exothermic heat effects corresponding to atomic reordering are observed in the DSC scans of Mn3Sn2 and Fe3Ge2 as well as Ni3Sn2 after various periods of milling. The heat evolved in the atomic reordering process increases gradually with milling time. After long-time milling all physical parameters tend to become constant. After prolonged periods of milling, a phase transformation in Ni3Sn2 from the orthorhombic-structure low-temperature phase (LTP) to the hexagonal-structure high-temperature phase (HTP) is observed accompanied by a sharp increase in magnetization. Mn3Sn2 and Fe3Ge2 remain in the hexagonal structure. The exothermic heat effect corresponding to the phase restoration of the ball-milled metastable HTP to the original equilibrium LTP is evident from DSC scans of Ni3Sn2 after long milling periods. The occurrence of the ball-milling-induced phase transformation in Ni3Sn2 is also confirmed by a comparison of the ball-milled phase to the high-temperature phase obtained by rapid quenching. The excellent agreement of all experimental results obtained by different techniques proves that by mechanical milling well-defined metastable states are generated in these B8-like compounds and that atomic disorder is the main source of energy storage during ball milling of intermetallic compounds. The particular type of atomic disorder in these B8-like compounds cannot be obtained by rapid quenching from high temperatures. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001017695

The ions were selected on a charge-to-mass ratio basis before capture. Photons emitted in magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole transitions from levels with lifetimes exceeding 5 ms were selected by wavelength and recorded vs ion storage time in the trap. Also, ions were counted after ejection following a preselected storage time in the trap, using a microchannel plate detector. These signals were studied as a function of the pressure of typical residual gases. Extrapolation to zero pressure enabled the extraction of the lifetimes of metastable levels from four different configurations of the type ns2npk with n=2 or 3 and k=3, 4, or 5. Our experimental results are (Ar2+, 3s23p4 1S0)=159.79.7-38.4 ms, (Ar3+, 3s23p3 2P3/2)=24373-79 ms, (Ar9+, 2s22p5 2P1/2)=8.530.24-0.17 ms, and (Ar10+, 2s22p4 3P1)=14.81.1-0.48 ms. Both statistical errors and a possible error associated with a systematic correction are given for each measurement. These results are compared with the predictions of theoretical calculations, many previously untested. The basis of the measurement technique is discussed in some detail. The technique is expected to be applicable to ions in a large range of charge states from a variety of low-energy ion sources, and to levels with transitions from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet or soft-x-ray range. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000030452

Recombination rates were investigated as He+ ions interacted with free electrons in the electron-cooler section of an ion storage ring. The ion beam was cooled prior to recombination, resulting in enhanced energy resolution. Fits to the 2l2l resonances yielded transverse and longitudinal temperatures of kT=0.15 eV and kT=0.8×10-4 eV, respectively. The resulting peak widths are approximately 0.3-eV full width at half maximum. The measured integrated cross sections are in qualitative agreement with calculated resonance strengths. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000018231
