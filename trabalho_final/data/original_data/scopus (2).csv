Mass spectra and decay angular distributions are compared with the predictions of a dual-reggeized Deck model. Strong decay angular correlations are observed in all cases. Pronounced structures observed in the differential cross sections of the coherent diffractive processes for small produced masses are interpreted in terms of constructive interference between the single- and double-scattering terms in a Glauber analysis.

A natural indicator of the polarized state is provided by the pigments of the photosynthetic apparatus, in particular, the carotenoids the absorption spectra of which change in the electric field. Polarization is due to change in the position and orientation of the various charged groups and may be fixed at low temperature (- 120 °C). On thawing the sample this altered state relaxes to the initial and in the external measuring circuit the current of the thermaldepolarization is recorded. The dependence of the current on the degree of hydration, the chemical modification and the thermal treatment of the preparations indicates the participation of the macromolecular components in the formation of the polarized state. In lightadapted samples the degree of polarization rises, which may indicate the presence of conformational rearrangements in the course of the primary photoreactions.

One approach to the photolysis of water involves the mediation of two photosystems in the generation of reduced and oxidised species that are the active components in the decomposition of water2,3. However, homogeneous (aqueous) solutions of these components suffer from the basic limitation that the reducing and oxidising agents can react with each other and thus no net reaction can be observed. Several kinds of synthetic 'photosynthetic membranes' have been suggested as a means of separating the two redox units and overcoming these fundamental difficulties3. Recently, photo-sensitised electron transfer across vesicle walls has been demonstrated and suggested as a means for generating oxidising and reducing agents in separate water compartments4. We report here a photochemical electron transfer across the interface of a water-in-toluene microemulsion, and propose this system as a model for the separation of oxidised and reduced species. It is well known that surfactant molecules aggregate to reversed micelles in organic solvents5. Reversed micelles entrap water to form 'water pools' in a continuous oil phase. The proposed general model for the compartmentalisation of two water phases and its utilisation in the photolysis of water is shown in Fig. 1. © 1979 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849163849

Stereo-EM of thin sections (0.10 to 0.25 μm thick) stained with uranyl and lead revealed the three-dimensional arrangement of 25 nm chromatin fibers on the tangential surfaces of nuclei. Use of the Bernhard staining procedure in combination with stereo-EM permitted a three-dimensional view of the interchromatin spaces and channels leading to the nuclear pores, and of cytoplsmic polyribosomes. With either staining technique we frequently encountered in the cytoplasm clusters and paracrystalline arrays of electron-dense granules with granule diameters approximately 1/2 that of monomer ribosomes. These granules were highly electron-dense in unstained specimens and have been identified as intracellular ferritin on the basis of the similarity of their ultrastructural morphology to that of horse spleen ferritin and their high content of iron as determined by EDX. The possibility that these granules represent toxic products of phenylhydrazine treatment (Heinz bodies) is considered unlikely, since we have demonstrated in this study that Heinz bodies cannot be visualized in unstained preparations, do not reveal the same granular structure, and do not contain significant amounts of iron above background.

Suckling fa/fa rats, bred from heterozygous parents, were detected by sizing fat cells obtained from an inguinal fat pad biopsy. Cell hypertrophy was observed in fa/fa rats, compared to Fa/- littermates of the same sex, as soon as 5-7 days after birth. Prediction of fa/fa genotype at this age by this method was assessed using a series of 80 pups and proved to be totally successful. The identity of the 'predicted' obese pups was confirmed morphologically at 6 weeks of age. Food (milk) intake was estimated from water turnover rates determined on 86 pups aged 2-8 days using tritiated water.

The model makes use of the likelihood that a negatively charged amino acid forms a salt bridge with the positively charged nitrogen of the retinylic chromophore. The photochemical event is a cis-trans isomerization in visual pigments and a trans-cis isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin, which in each case cleaves the salt bridge and thus separates charge in the interior of the protein. The authors propose that this is how the energy of a photon is transduced into chemical free energy of the primary photoproduct. The use of photoisomerization of a flexible chromophore to achieve charge separation provides a general mechanism which may be applicable to other systems. The authors' model explains many of the fundamental properties of visual pigments and their photoproducts. First, the extraordinarily low rate of thermally populating the ground state of the primary photoproduct, as determined from psychophysical and electrophysiological measurements, is seen as resulting from the large barrier to thermal isomerization about a double bond, perhaps enhanced by electrostatic attraction in the salt bridge. Second, the increase in energy and the spectral red shift that characterize the primary photochemical events are natural consequences of the separation of charge. Proton-dependent processes detected with picosecond techniques are proposed to be ground-state relaxation processes following the primary photochemical event. Finally, the charged groups of the salt bridge, repositioned by photoisomerization, provide a simple mechanism for vectorial proton translocation in bacteriorhodopsin.",,"bacteriorhodopsin; proton; rhodopsin; visual pigment; biological model; photoisomerization; visual system; Bacteriorhodopsins; Carotenoids; Energy Transfer; Isomerism; Photochemistry; Retinal Pigments; Rhodopsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009643868

The postcopulatory behavior of the damselfly Calopteryx maculata (De Beauvois) (Odonata: Calopterygidae) was studied in field populations to determine the adaptive significance of guarding of ovipositing females by males. Of particular interest was an explanation for the guarding of ovipositing nonmates by males. A promiscuous mating system and the large variation in mating success (Table 1) among territorial males indicated that sexual selection may have been a significant factor in the evolution of C. maculata postcopulatory behavior. 2. Territorial males defend ovipositing mates by chasing and displaying toward conspecific males attempting takeovers. Guarded mates averaged 12-15 min of undisturbed oviposition while unguarded females averaged only 1-2 min of oviposition prior to disturbance by males. Postcopulatory guarding is advantageous to both sexes because it allows undisturbed oviposition. 3. During mating, 88%-100% of the sperm stored by a female from a previous mating was removed by a male before he transferred his own sperm to her storage organs. Given this potential for sperm displacement, postcopulatory guarding is advantageous to the guarding male since it assures him of fertilizing a substantial number of eggs prior to a subsequent mating by his mate. 4. The duration of guarding (interval between matings) for males was 10-15 min. It did not differ significantly between two populations in on year. Guarding duration did not significantly change with (a) time of day, (b) time devoted to defensive behavior, (c) female arrival rate, and (d) presence of absence of an ovipositing female (Table 2). 5. Males frequently guarded females with which they did not mate. Nonmates were guarded only when the male was simultaneously guarding a mate or had recently mated. These nonmates deposited eggs fertilized by rival males. Their presence did not significantly increase the time and energy expended by guarding males but did attract additional females (Table 3). However, these additional females did not lead to an increase in mating frequency for the guarding male. 6. Three factors appeared to limit the ability of guarding males to exclude or attempt matings with arriving nonmates: (a) a lack of individual recognition, (b) a risk of losing a previous mate while failing to copulate with an arriving female, and (c) a probable physiologic limit to mating frequency. These limitations in male postcopulatory behavior were exploited by females. 7. Some males were not territorial. While appearing less effective at obtaining mates, they devoted no time and energy to defending territories or mates. Because of sperm displacement, their reproductive success depended upon the ability of their mates to exploit the limitations in guarding behavior of territorial males. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001361542

High power silicon controlled rectifiers are used to switch the National Magnet Laboratory dc generators on and off into a liquid N2 cooled, low impedance high field magnet so that high fields can be generated for a period of time approaching 1 sec. These transient “quasistatic fields” involve times which are intermediate between the usual pulsed field operation of milliseconds or less and the more limited field range produced by dc techniques. Each of the four specially designed low internal impedance dc generators can produce as much as 8 MJ/sec on a 5 sec transient mode of operation, which is sufficient to project development of magnets producing quasistatic fields approaching 40 tesla. The present switching arrangement can furnish between 0.5 and 10 megajoules for intervals between 0.1 and 2 seconds using 2 generators operating in parallel and drawing energy from the 84 ton flywheel attached to the generator set. Details of the switching hardware can be found in Ref. 1. Several liquid nitrogen precooled magnets have been tested at various field levels. The inner bores generally were 2 cm i.d. The copper conductor cross section and coil dimension determined the current, field and time at high fields. Square cross-section wire, multilayer coils were made as single sections for the lower current, lower field regime. Pancakes connected in parallel provide lower impedance and allow higher current magnets and higher fields. Other winding configurations use tape-wound, rectangular cross-section wire, or Bitter-plate type magnets. Fields above 30 T were generated on a quasistatic basis with such magnets.

Defibrillation involves the application of a short pulse of electric current (4-10ms) through the chest of the patient; it has been demonstrated that the required energy is a function of the patient's weight. A knowledge of the performance of a defibrillator is essential; front panel meters, although calibrated in joules, read capacitor voltage only, and a loss of capacitance is not easily detected in use. We have had personal experience of this loss on several occasions. Commercial defibrillator testers employ analogue circuitry and are no more reliable in calibration than defibrillators themselves.

It gives an absolute digital readout of the energy delivered into a standard 50 Ω load, the peak defibrillating voltage, and the rise time of the defibrillator output wave.

Primarily because of its large extent and volume, the rock surrounding an underground oil storage depot constitutes an excellent insulating layer. Consequently, heat losses from an underground storage depot are often considerably less than those from an aboveground facility. The large heat storage capacity of the rock means that the heat requirements for the depot will be largest during the first year of operation, approaching a steady state of about one-fourth the initial level in subsequent years. Heat requirements are independent of temperature variations aboveground, which, in combination with the rock's heat storage capacity, reduces the need for reserve heat capacity in case of operational disturbances.

A thermal model for buildings equipped with roof ponds and movable insulating covers as proposed in the sky-therm process has been developed. The thermal behaviour of a building has been simulated to study the influence of such parameters as the heat capacity, depth of water in the pond, roof thickness and its thermal conductivity, air infiltration rates etc. Experiments have been carried out to check which of the several commonly used empirical relations for the sky temperature is valid. A simple technique for measuring air infiltration has been developed. It has been found that even for the most severe cooling requirement in Bangalore (for April), sky-therm cooling alone is adequate to maintain a temperature below 28°C. In places where the requirements are more demanding, it may be necessary to augment sky-therm with evaporative cooling. © 1979 Indian Academy of Sciences.","building; nocturnal cooling; passive air conditioning; sericulture; Sky-therm; thermal analysis","AIR CONDITIONING; ENERGY UTILIZATION; SKY-THERM COOLING; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018515028

It is shown that processes involving photolysis (photoprocessing) of interstellar grains are important during most of their lifetime even including the time they spend in dense clouds. A laboratory designed to simulate the interstellar conditions is described. This is the first time such a laboratory has been able to provide results which may be directly scaled to the astrophysical situations involving interstellar grains and their environment. The evolution of grain analogs is followed by observing the infrared absorption spectra of photolyzed samples of ices deposited at 10 K. The creation and storage of radicals and the production of molecules occur as a result of reactions within the solid. A large number of molecules and radicals observed in the interstellar gas appear in the irradiated ices. Energy released during warm-up is seen from visible luminescence and inferred from vapor pressure enhancement which occurs during warming of photolyzed samples relative to unphotolyzed samples. The evolution of a grain and its role as a source as well as a sink of molecules is pictured as a statistical process within dense clouds. The gradual accretion on and photolysis of an individual grain provides the stored chemical energy the release of which is sporadically triggered by relatively mild events (such as low velocity grain-grain collisions) to produce the impulsive heating needed to eject or evaporate a portion of the grain mantle. An extremely complex and rather refractory substance possessing the infrared signatures of amino groups and carboxylic acid groups and having a maximum mass of 514 amu has been produced at a rate corresponding to a mass conversion rate of interstellar grains of between 2% and 20% in 107 yr. The shape and position of the astronomically observed 3.1 μm band is duplicated in the laboratory and is shown to be a natural consequence of the processing of grain mantles. © 1979 D.

This dry process has been used in the laboratory for several years and is now finding acceptance in the production of bubble memory devices and MOS circuitry. This paper will review the important characteristics of ion beam etching and comment on the state of the art in mass production equipment. The main difference between ion beam etching and conventional sputter etching is the use of a directed ion beam and a work chamber at a relatively low pressure. These differences produce four chief advantages. First, the low pressure results in less contamination and poisoning and, second, the directed beam permits control of the etching profile. Third, one can independently select the ion current, voltage, and pressure for reproducible results over a wide range of values. Fourth, the net charge of the positive ions can be balanced by low energy electrons, allowing the etching of any insulator or conductor. An organic or metal mask is utilized to pattern the material being etched. Typical removal rates in large batch processes range from 300 to 400 Å/min.

A comparison is made of vegetation types that employ water received from (1) natural precipitation and (2) irrigation. Forest lands are compared to corn cultivated by conventional tillage and no tillage methods. The forest canopy generally has a lower surface albedo, greater surface roughness, higher transpiration rates, and increased water storage than the bare soil, mulched, and vegetated surfaces of a corn field. No tillage cultivation reduces wind and water erosion, lowers soil temperatures, and improves water retention compared to standard tillage used on corn fields. Irrigated agriculture has replaced much of the drought resistant vegetation of the Central Valley of California. The energy and water budgets of irrigated crops grown in the semi-arid climate of the Central Valley and irrigated by flood or sprinkler methods exhibit microclimates in which evapotranspiration dominates the energy and mass fluxes. Drip irrigation methods, by contrast, have reduced water losses compared to flood and sprinkler methods. The drip system supplies metered amounts of water to the base of each plant; low soil evaporation and improved water supply to the growing plant results from this method. The latent heat flux is reduced over that found in fields irrigated by flooding or spraying.

Examples of key projects in which significant progress has been made recently are media for thermal energy storage, hydrides and containment materials for chemical energy storage, composite materials for flywheels, high current conductors for superconducting magnetic energy storage, and a multitude of new materials for batteries and other electrochemical devices. Special emphasis is now being given to storage components for electric and hybrid vehicles. Batteries with flywheels for regenerative braking offer attractive options for power systems and emerging opportunities for materials R&D specialists. © 1979 American Society for Metals.",,"ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018481504

The mean molecular weight of the irradiated CN samples has been determined through measuring changes in viscosity of CN solutions in ethyl acetate of different concentrations. An empirical formula for calculating the change in the mean molecular weight of CN after being irradiated with fission neutrons, and to doses over the range 0.6-104 Rad, has been proposed and found to fit the experimental data within ±6.3%. The effect of neutron energies on the induced changes in the mean molecular weight of CN has been studied.

Exposure of the frost-treated minerals to liquid H2O produced a sudden drop in pH and resulted in the production of copious O2(g) (as much as ~ 1020 molecules g-1). Exposure of frost-treated samples to 5 ml of 0.1M HCOONa solution resulted in the rapid oxidation of up to 43% of the formate to CO2(g). These reactions were qualitatively similar to the chemical activity observed during the active cycles of the Viking lander Gas Exchange and Labeled Release Biology experiments. Attempts to identify the oxidant by chemical indicators were inconclusive, but they tentatively suggested that chemisorbed hydrogen peroxide may have formed. The formation of chemisorbed peroxide could be explained as a byproduct of the chemical reduction of the mineral. The following model was proposed. Hc was incorporated into the mineral from surface frost. This would have left behind a residual of excess OH-(ads) (relative to surface H+). Electrons were then stripped from the surface OH-(ads) (due to the large repulsive potential between neighboring OH-(ads)) and incorporated into the crystal to restore charge balance and produce a chemical reduction of the mineral. The resultant surface hydroxyl radicals could then have combined to form the more stable chemisorbed hydrogen peroxide species. While the chemisorbed peroxide should be relatively stable at low temperatures, it should tend to decay to O(ads) + H2O(g) at higher temperatures with an activation energy of ≳ 34 kcal mole-1. This is consistent with the long-term storage and sterilization behavior of the Viking soil oxidants. It is possible that as little as 0.1-1% frost-weathered material in the Martian soil could have produced the unusual chemical activity that occurred during the Viking Gas Exchange and Labeled Release experiments. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.","Chemisorption; Frost; Mars; Peroxide; Soil; Viking; Weathering","metal; oxygen; peroxide; water; article; chemistry; freezing; gas; gas chromatography; kinetics; microclimate; Chemistry; Chromatography, Gas; Extraterrestrial Environment; Freezing; Gases; Kinetics; Metals; Oxygen; Peroxides; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018587951

The donors employed were N-methylphenothiazine (MPTH) and N, N-dimethyl-5, 1 1-dihydroindolo[3, 2-b]carbazole (DI). Laser photolysis, steady-state illumination, and fluorescence techniques were used to investigate the photoredox processes. The transfer of an electron from the excited donor inside the micelle to the counterion occurs so rapidly that it cannot be resolved kinetically by nanosecond laser techniques. In the case of DI, the reactive excited state was found to be the first excited singlet state whose lifetime in the Cu2+ micelles is 1.2 X 10-9 s. The cuprous ion formed in the photoredox process escapes from the micelle into the bulk solution before back transfer of electrons to D+ can occur. There it may be used for a second redox reaction with a negative ion or a zwitterion. In such a system, the back reaction between reduced acceptor ion and oxidized donor is prevented by the micellar surface potential allowing for storage of light energy. The dynamics of excited-state interaction with micellar counterions was investigated also in aggregates with Co2+ and Ni2+ counterion atmospheres, respectively. © 1979, American Chemical Society.

Binding to mouse serum and to human serum albumin was measured by equilibrium dialysis, and the changes in binding free energy were correlated with RM values. Brain-blood partition of the esters did not change parallel with their serum binding. An indirect correlation exists between flM of the esters and oxazepam brain accrual. Brain-blood concentration ratios of oxazepam prove that hydrolysis precedes brain penetration and hydrophobicity might primarily influence the hydrolysis rate.

SoCal Gas, like other major gas distribution utilities, has undergone a dramatic change during the past decade. Since the late 1960's the supply of gas nationwide has not been sufficient to meet the demand for this premium fuel. Thf3fact has caused a redirection by many of the nation's gas companies, including SoCal Gas, to concentrate more effort in obtaining new supplies of gaseous fuels. These include natural gas from traditional sources; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and synthetic natural gas (SNG) from coal, tar sands, solid waste, liquid waste, biomass, and liquid petroleum feedstocks. The excellent potential for nonconventional gas supplies' providing a significant amount of energy in the future has opened up a new frontier for engineers in the energy field. At SoCal Gas, we actively participate in or monitor other companies' efforts in virtually all areas of the gaseous energy field.

The raw approach uses an oscillating or dynamic shear rate rather than a steady shear rate which allows the determination of the rheology of highly viscous, cross-linked gels accurately with a variation between measurements of less than 5 percent. An accurate and reproducible method of determining fluid properties is necessary for both fracturing treatment design in the field and fluid development and optimization in the laboratory. The coaxial cylinder and capillary-type viscometers in general use throughout the industry are adequate for uncross-linked fluids but are less than adequate for cross-linked, high viscosity fluids. Fracturing fluids of all types can be measured using a dynamic viscometer. There is a wealth of information available from dynamic measurements that cannot be derived from steady shear measurements. As an example, both the elastic storage modulus and the viscous-loss modulus can be measured. These parameters are related to the amount of energy stored elastically and lost through viscous heating., respectively, both are related to the pumping pressure. The instrument that will be described is also capable of accurately determining yield stresses, normal forces and viscosities of prop laden fluids. In this paper, the relationship between steady shear and dynamic viscosity data for several common fracturing fluids will be established. Data for cross-linked fluids will be presented as well as data for sand laden fluids. © Copyright 1979, American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers.

Factors investigated included in situ stresses, rock structure, strength, deformability, and deformations produced by rockbursts. The orientation and magnitude of in situ stresses in the granite at shallow depths are controlled by sheeting fractures and tectonic joints. Stress magnitudes were three times as high at a mountain location in massive rock as in an adjacent valley underlain by more closely sheeted rock. The sheeting process expended energy derived from residual paleostresses (the predominant component of the in situ stress field), resulting in rock-stress magnitudes that are controlled by the volume of unfractured rock in which the measurement was made. The chemical effects of water may facilitate destressing and fracturing. Stress orientations below levels of sheeting and alteration in granite and gneiss are more consistent with the tectonic framework of the area (right-lateral strike-slip faulting) than are stresses at shallower depths. The inference that the least principal stress is normal to sheet surfaces was supported by hydrofracture measurements. Fracturing associated with a severe rockburst on Mount Waldo in the late 19th century was compared with the laboratory rockburst model of Holzhausen (1977). In both cases, channels cut normal to vertical walls, which were parallel to the maximum horizontal stress component, caused failure by concentrating applied stresses at the tips of flaws. The fractures propagated unstably, roughly normal to the channels. In the laboratory model, development of through-going fractures was preceded by localized crushing of the rock, which produced features similar to those observed at Mount Waldo. © 1979 USRMS.

Previous numerical creep models which are capable of such predictions are reviewed in some depth and the differences in their behavior under both increasing and decreasing loads are noted. Different forms of flow rule are investigated and a creep model is presented which is capable of reproducing acceptable deformation behavior for all types of loading. The characteristics of the model are that it reproduces both transient and steady state creep and when unloaded recovers not only the small elastic deformations, but also some portion of the creep deformation. This creep model is incorporated into a finite element program and the behavior of an ellipsoidal cavity for a CAES scheme, in which the material properties are temperature dependent, was analyzed for both thermal and mechanical loading conditions. The results indicated a steady state creep closure after an initial transient response. The present data is assessed as being inadequate for the complete development of a constitutive model for salt.

To minimize the possibility of product contamination, a large percentage of that waste water is sent directly to factory drains and sewer systems without being recycled and in many cases the thermal energy contained by the waste streams also goes unreclaimed and is lost from further use.

This demand of computer time is the main disadvantage of time marching methods and all the development work is therefore directed towards an increase of the convergence speed. In order to evaluate their potential, several finite difference schemes for time marching methods were applied to the calculation of one dimensional, inviscid, transonic flow with shock through a convergent-divergent channel. This work was carried out preliminary to the development of two and three dimensional calculation methods for the inviscid, transonic flow through turbomachinery blade rows. Therefore, only explicit finite difference schemes which are easy to program and require a minimum of computer memory storage were investigated. More specifically, the author investigates the performance of the corrected viscosity scheme, which is said to be very adequate for time marching calculations. Other means of improving the convergence speed of a particular finite difference scheme are also discussed. The conclusions of this one dimensional investigation are then applied on the calculation of the inviscid, blade to blade flow in a transonic turbine cascade using a finite volume (or control volume) discretization method to discretize the flow domain. The results are compared with results obtained by Couston using a similar method, showing that the computer time can be reduced by half without affecting the accuracy, using the constant total enthalpy relation instead of the energy equation and using a simple bitrapezoidal element instead of the hexagonal element.

The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the structural stability of the old mine workings in conjunction with a proposed new deeper mine level during the use of the facility for the long-term storage of crude oil under the Federal Energy Administration’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program. The scope of the work involved laboratory testing of the strength and deformational characteristics of the rock salt; determination of a minimum web (or sill) thickness between the old workings (within which crude oil would be stored) and a proposed new mine level development below; and assessment of the effects of crude oil emplacement and withdrawal on the mine stability, as related to both the old workings and the proposed new mine level development. The finite element results, wherein use was made of the strength and deformation properties of the salt from the laboratory tests, indicated that a minimum sill thickness of 90 m (300 ft) should be maintained between the old mine workings and the new level development. Furthermore, the emplacement and withdrawl of crude oil from the old workings will have little influence on pillar and sill stabilities for the entire mine, including the proposed lower level development. The only noticeable effect could, perhaps, be obtained in the creep rate due to changing stress conditions. © 1979 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024599014

The purpose of the evaluation was to confirm the suitability of the underground facility for the long-term storage of crude oil under the Federal Energy Administration's Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program. The Weeks Island mine, currently operated by the Morton Salt Company, is located in a salt dome on the Culf Coast south of New Iberia, Louisiana. The mine has two levels of workings, at depths of approximately 185 and 246 m (600 and 800 ft) with development by the roomand-pillar mining technique. Geologic features of interest within the mine include zones of vertical banding and folding, shear zones, and blowouts. Field testing indicated that the salt mass is, for all intents and purposes, impermeable. Brine and oil leaks and gas seeps were examined and thought to be localized phenomena that did not affect mine stability and should not affect crude oil containment. The 23-m-(75-ft-) high pillars are generally intact with minor to severe spatting, generally in older areas of the mine. The mine roof exhibits no signs of distress or failure. Based on the overall results of the geotechnical and rock mechanics evaluations, the existing salt mine facility at Weeks Island was certified as suitable for the long-term storage of crude oil. © 1979 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024557334

This non-linear and time dependent climate system is formulated as a gradient system of a potential. It can be analysed without explicit time integration according to catastrophe theory, so that the resilience of the system due to changes of the external parameters and due to variations of the state variable can be determined. Both feedbacks combined lead to three equilibria, the stable interglacial being bounded by two unstable solutions, beyond which initial temperature values tend towards the ‘deep freeze’ or ‘desert heat’. External parameter changes can lead to structural instability occurring at fold lines, which meet at the cusp catastrophe. Outside the fold and cusp catastrophes only unstable equilibria appear from which initial temperature values tend towards ‘desert heat’ or ‘deep freeze’ situations. © 1979, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023353381

Difference of respiratory quality was studied between undeveloped dormant seeds and five months old nondormant seeds to tests by checking the effect of an un-coupler (2, 4-dinitrophenol) in oxidative phosphorylation scheme. It was clarified that there was no relation between the high oxygen absorption of the dormant seed and energy production. This fact suggested that the high oxygen absorption by dormant seed was not related with respiration. 2. Changes of the RNA content and amylase activity were continuously measured for six months during the storage period. The both values were gradually increased. The highest values were observed at the fifth month. Therefore, the endosperm of Bupleurum falcatum seeds might be physiologically immature at the time shedding, and it might be gradually matured as the after-ripening is progressed during the storage period. 3.

This derives from the ability of the flywheel to perform the functions of d-c to a-c inversion and optimal impedance matching between the PV arrays and the load in addition to providing energy storage.

The closed-cycle engine operates at essentially constant speed and turbine inlet temperature, and power capability is a function of pressure level. The gas management system compresses and stores excess argon working fluid during load removal and injects on demand in response to load application. The system consists of a low, medium and high pressure storage accumulator, piston-type motor-driven compressor, valving and electronic control unit for sequencing the accumulators. Peak storage pressures at minimum power (10kw) are 765, 1076, and 1517 kPa (111, 156, and 220 psia). The engine and control system were run for a total of 57 hr over numerous transients of varying duration and range. Operation was characterized by quick response, smooth switching, and effective control. During load removal, the compressor required up to 3 min. to reduce full inventory to minimum power while turbine bypass valves allowed immediate engine response without excessive overspeed. Manually adjustable inject orifices allowed system response to closely follow load applications of 15 sec to 3 min. Compression heating in the accumulators during charging tended to elevate the switch points slightly, altering the storage capacities after repeated transients.

And a common question is - when will photovoltaics be economical for residential use? Phoenix, Arizona, was chosen as the site to evaluate the economics of photovoltaic application to an energy conservative home (7109 kwh/yr). The analysis shows that a large summer load exists - which is what the utility company has been telling us for years. With such a load profile, optimum tilt angle of the solar array is 10 deg from the horizontal facing south (of interest in design of the roof structure). Peak power loads can be most economically handled with an auxiliary power source - either by power from the utility grid or from a gasoline generator. The auxiliary source woufd handle 18 percent of the load in June, 34 percent in July, and 24 percent in August. For the remainder of the year, power would be supplied 99 percent by the solar array. The need to handle peak loads with auxiliary power considerably reduces the solar energy storage problem in 1979. However, auxiliary power and energy storage in 1989 becomes a major part of the cost when grid power is not available. Cost per kwh for PV power in 1989 is projected at 2.8¢ when using utility grid backup and 11¢ when using generator backup.

In a small shore-based pilot plant on the north shore of St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands, the technical feasibility of Artificial Upwelling mariculture has been demonstrated. Its economic potential is now under evaluation. The plant protein yield per unit surface area achieved in St. Croix is 8.1 tons/hectare/year. At current market prices, the gross sales value of the meat which can be obtained from a given volume of deep sea water pumped to the surface is considerably greater than that of the energy which can be generated from the same volume of deep water, according to OTEC power systems presently under consideration in the United States.

This nonlinear and time‐dependent climate system is formulated as a gradient system of a potential. It can be analysed without explicit time integration according to catastrophe theory, so that the resilience of the system, due to changes of the external parameters and due to variations of the state variable, can be determined. For the ice‐albedo or the greenhouse feedback alone, two equilibrium solutions appear: the stable ones are attractors, characterizing the present day interglacial; the unstable ones define a lower or an upper bound, respectively, for temperature changes to be absorbed by the systems. Beyond thresholds of external parameters (fold catastrophes) no equilibria exist, so that the systems attain the states of ‘deep freeze’ and ‘desert heat’, respectively. The two feedbacks combined lead to three equilibria, the stable interglacial being bounded by two unstable solutions, beyond which initial temperature values tend towards the ‘deep freeze’ or ‘desert heat’. External parameter changes can lead to structural instability occurring at fold lines, which meet at the cusp catastrophe. Outside the fold and cusp catastrophes only unstable equilibria appear, from which initial temperature values tend towards ‘desert heat’ or ‘deep freeze’ situations.

However, root respiration was also cyanide‐resistant when a tap root was present, indicating that the alternative pathway was still present. A decreased rate of root respiration coincided with an increase of the content of storage carbohydrates, mainly in the tap root. The level of reducing sugars was constant throughout the experimental period, and it was concluded that the activity of the alternative oxidative pathway was significant in oxidation of sugars that could not be utilized for purposes like energy production, the formation of intermediates for growth or for storage. Root respiration decreased after the formation of a tap root. This decrease could neither be attributed to a gradual disappearance of the alternative chain, nor to a decreased level of reducing sugars. No differences in respiratory metabolism between the two subspecies have been observed, suggesting that a high activity of the alternative oxidative pathway is not significant in adaptation of the present two subspecies to relatively nutrient‐rich or poor soils.

A high root growth respiration (i.e. the amount of oxygen consumed for synthesis of a given weight of root material) implied a high maintenance respiration rate (i.e. the amount of oxygen consumed per unit of time and dry weight, but not connected with growth). High values of both components reflect a low efficiency of root respiratory processes. The efficiency of root respiration, as determined by the values for root growth respiration and root maintenance respiration rate could not be demonstrated to be of advantage in adaptation to soil conditions, as e.g. nitrogen content, moisture content and pH. It is concluded that (he degree of ‘wasteful utilization of sugars’ in roots, i.e. such consumption of sugars as cannot be related to structural growth, storage of carbohydrates or maintenance processes, depends on imbalance of transport of sugars from the shoot to the roots with utilization of sugars for synthesis of root material. The results are discussed in relation to Brouwer's explanation for the equilibrium between the growth of shoots and of roots. Root growth rate in the present species appears limited by a factor produced in the shoot under light conditions, and which factor is distinct from carbohydrates. The evidence presented shows that relatively inefficient root respiration does not imply a low growth rate. In regulation of plant growth the growth rate itself and also the shoot to‐root ratio may be more important than the regulation of the efficiency of energy metabolism.

The functions show that peak water demand by the crop is in the immediate post-anthesis period and that sunflower is capable of restricting its water use when some 70% of the maximum available water remains in the root zone. With the aid of these functions, weekly estimates were made of the water use of thirteen commercial sunflower crops in northern New South Wales. Estimated water use ranged from 150 to 320 mrn and water use efficiencies from 1.9 to 10.5 kg seed mm-1 water used. Highest yields and water use efficiencies were associated with a combination of high total water supply (soil water at sowing plus rainfall during growth of 380 mm or more) high water use (220 mm or more) and low evaporative demand (below 780 mm of pan evaporation). Based on the water use characteristics of the crop the optimal sowing time in most areas is mid summer. However, spring sowings may be preferable for winter rainfall areas where soil water storage capacity is high and there is only a small component of summer rain.

The working line system includes the closed orbit dipoles, the quadrupole trim, sextupoles, octapoles, decapoles and duodecapoles. These are the magnets in the standard subunits of the Brookhaven National Laboratory Intersecting Storage Ring Accelerator “ISABELLE”. There have been 14 full size single layer dipole prototypes 4.25 to 4.75 m long constructed. There have been two 1.5 m long full size quadrupoles built. A one meter double layer dipole was built in order to obtain high field = 6.0 T data. A subunit of the original 200 X 200 GeV version of the ISABELLE lattice was assembled to study systems operation. (ISABELLE now has the design goal of 400 X 400 GeV.1) This subunit utilized the proposed ISABELLE form of refrigeration, namely “high pressure helium gas forced flow”. The array composed of two dipoles and a quadrupole with auxiliary working line and correction coil systems was serially connected both electrically and cryogenically. One of the major design goals, that of the magnets being protected by the ability to absorb their own energy, proved to be attainable. This is accomplished without external intervention, i.e. external extraction or driving the magnets normal by an active external circuit. This simply means the magnets L/R time constants during a quench are short enough to prevent thermal damage or run away. There are two series of prototypes. The first one is the so-called “standard” which will become the ring magnets for “ISABELLE” when the machine design is frozen. The second is that in which various characteristics and/or limits of various parameters are explored. Various parameters such as maximum ramp rate and other &amp; dependent phenomena are bracketed even though the present standard parameters are workable. There has also been obtained in the last two years operational data on four large (25 cm cold aperture, 2.5 m long) pool boiling dipoles.

The natural energies which can be utilized for passive cooling are: &#x02022; - nocturnal longwave outgoing radiation &#x02022; - night convection &#x02022; - water evaporation. Combinations of these cooling sources are also possible, such as combining convective and evaporative nocturnal cooling or combining nocturnal longwave radiant initial cooling of air with subsequent super-cooling or water evaporation. The applicability of the various natural cooling sources (besides solar energy) depends greatly upon the climatic conditions prevailing in summer at night in a given region, and in particular on the dry and wet bulb temperatures of the nights in summer. This is because the low level to which a thermal storage system can be cooled is close to the dry or wet bulb temperatures at night, for convective or evaporative cooling, respectively.

Since the power station will occupy a position in the geostationary orbit and will use radio frequency spectrum for transmission of energy to Earth, the relative benefits of space solar power and space communications should be considered. The resource allocation of orbit-spectrum to a power station requires a sacrifice from space communications as they both utilize similar limited resources. The power station is to energy what communication is to information. While the cost of energy is going up, the cost of information processing, storage, sharing and transmission is decreasing. Also, increased means of communication are used as a measure of energy conservation. With the advent of computer communication and the Large Scale Integrated (LSI) microprocessors, the technique of multiple access, message switching and satellite switching can be cost-effectively combined. The computer-satellite communication will allow information resource sharing among large numbers of users besides the conventional application of space communications. Since space communication means work effectively in many other areas where ultimate energy use and conservation is possible, the space solar power will not be able to compete or substitute on the basis of equality and social benefits. But, as the transmission technology is similar for both areas, the R & D effort for solar power will certainly increase efficiency and reduce cost for space communications. © 1979.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249153075

In view of increased future needs, intensive R & D efforts leading to full-scale installations aim to provide water from unconventional sources. Flood catchment and aquifer recharge, sewage renovation by combined biological/physicochemical treatment, including direct solar energy utilisation, are undertaken concomitantly with a multi-pronged desalination effort, including operation of MSF, MED and RO for brackish/seawater, R & D in improved membranes, ED and other energy-conserving processes.

The temperature increases in these small rooms were estimated to be similar to the worst conditions that might exist in commercial freezer warehouses. Diurnal fluctuations were much smaller within the packages, particularly in the densely filled products located in the centre of the lots. All three time-temperature indicators provided an approximate history of storage conditions. Compared to storage at a constant -24°C (-11°F), shutting down power at night yielded 8% saving in energy consumption, which increased to 23% when temperature was brought down to -21°C (-6°F), and to near 30% when temperatures were reduced to -18°C (0°F) only. Weight losses increased from 0.28% in the first chamber to 0.68% in the last chamber. Pouches lost much less weight than cartons, and internal packages less than those on the edge of the lots. Frost formation (in-package desiccation) increased from -24°C to -18°C (11°F to 0°F), and was more severe in the pouches than in the cartons. Clumping was reduced in all treatments with storage time. Sensory quality changes and ascorbic acid were reduced similarly, but the poorest treatment, the last chamber, lost at most half a grade score and up to 10% ascorbic acid. Total solids showed little relation to treatments. It was tentatively concluded, depending on energy cost and availability, that -20°C to -18°C (-4°F to 0°F), overnight, might be the optimal storage condition for cartons, while pouches might be economically stored at -18°C to -16°C (0°F to 3°F) if for no longer than 6 months. © 1978.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249149341

Liveweight gains of 10 pigs per treatment from 65 to 86 kg on diets containing effluents from unwilted and wilted crops and on the control diet were 753, 715 and 719 ± 16.8 g/day, respectively, and in the same order feed conversion ratios (corrected to dry matter content of the control diet) were 2.94, 3.10 and 3.07 ± 0.075. None of these differences were significant. There were no significant differences in killing-out yield, in hardness of subcutaneous back-fat when measured by a penetrometer or in abnormal odour rating of subcutaneous back-fat. Formalin at levels of 1 and 2 ml/l and formic acid at levels of 1, 2 and 6 ml/l were added as potential preservatives to 1000 ml quantities of freshly collected silage effluent, which was then stored at 23°C. The 2 ml/l level of formalin and 6 ml/l level of formic acid prevented mould growth for 26 and 19 days, respectively. Freshly collected effluent was stored for 3.5, 14, 28, 56, 112 and 240 days after treatment, with formalin at the rate of 3 ml/l, and used in a pig-feeding trial. Pigs were fed either on a control all-meal diet or an equal dry matter intake of 150 g/kg effluent DM and 850 g/kg meal DM. A total of 120 animals were individually penned and fed twice daily on the experimental diets from 33 kg to slaughter at 82 kg liveweight. Overall mean liveweight gains for effluent and control diets were 646 and 656 ± 7.5 g/day, respectively, and the corresponding feed conversion ratios (DM basis) were 2.69 and 2.64 ± 0.030, neither of the differences being significant. Animal performance did not deteriorate with increasing period of effluent storage. No significant differences were found in carcase lean, back-fat thickness nor hardness of back-fat. A digestibility study was carried out on freshly collected effluent from another source. The level of dietary inclusion was equal to that in the previous experiments and the digestibility of dry matter was 0.831 and 0.819, and of nitrogen 0.822 and 0.827 for the control and effluent diets, respectively. A value of 11.4 MJ/kg dry matter was calculated by difference for the digestible energy of this effluent.

The scope for further development will be discussed together with the problems that delay it. Base-load liquefaction plants have already achieved a high level of efficiency and reliability, and the possibility of major improvement has become small. Present technical interest centres on the practicability of offshore liquefaction, including the problems of liquefaction on a floating barge, floating storage and flexible pipeline systems for LNG transfers. Land-based LNG storage systems have developed greatly, especially in Japan, where important strides have also been made in utilising the 'cold' available from re-evaporation. Whilst significant developments have been made with both above-ground and in-ground storage the present preferences appear to lie with a compromise solution involving an insulated tank partially submerged in the ground, the excavated earth being mounded around the tank up to the level of the tank top. There are now fleets of ocean-going tankers for LNG, and a few are laid-up awaiting charter. The largest has a capacity in excess of 130 000 m3. Several different insulation systems are employed, the criteria being cost, evaporation losses and safety. Much attention is being devoted to the elimination of hazards which could arise with shipping accidents. Other uses of LNG are relevant to energy conservation on a smaller scale. These include peak-shaving plants, the enrichment of lean natural gas, satellite stations and diurnal storage. © 1979.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249143202

The plant is composed of three systems: 1. Desalination system. Multistage flash evaporation plant with 10m3/d production capacity, 5.0 in performance ratio and 10 stages. 2. Solar energy captation. Composed of one low temperature subsystem of double pipe flat collectors with 670m2 of effective captation surface, and a high temperature subsystem composed of parabolic concentrators with 320m2 of captation surface. 3. Storage of energy. System designed with such capacity which allows continuous operation of desalination unit. The poject is separated into two phases. The first includes the design manufacturing and tests for the three systems. The second phase comprises the installation and integration of the systems which compose the plant, the start-up operation and evaluation of plant performance.

Box X, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, United States","Most salt hydrates, especially those proposed for thermal-energy-storage applications, melt incongruently. In static systems, this property often leads to differences between the enthalpy of fusion and enthalpy of solidification. By means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), these differences have been determined for several salt hydrates. For Na2SO4 · 10 H2O, the enthalpy of solidification at or near the peritectic temperature is never more than 60% of the enthalpy of fusion; further cooling leads to a second phase transition at a temperature corresponding to eutectic melting of mixtures of ice and this hydrate. This asymmetrical melting and freezing behavior of Na2SO4 · 10 H2O decreases its potential as an energy-storing medium and also limits its usefulness for temperature calibration of DSC instruments. Sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate, Na4P2O7 · 10 H2O, although in some ways a higher temperature analog of Na2SO4 · 10 H2O, exhibited a smaller discrepancy between the enthalpies of fusion and of solidification; its relatively high transition temperature permits a more rapid solidification reaction than is the case for Na2SO4 · 10 H2O. For Mg(NO3)2 · 6 H2O, a congruently melting compound, the magnitude of ΔH of crystallization equalled ΔH of fusion, even when supercooling occurred; a solid-state transition at 73°C, with ΔH = 2.9 cal g-1, was detected for this hydrate. MgCl2 · 6 H2O, which melts almost congruently, exhibited no disparity between ΔH of crystallization and ΔH of fusion. CuSO4 · 5 H2O and Na2B4O7 · 10 H2O exhibited marked disparities. Na2B4O7 · 10 H2O formed metastable Na2B4O7sd 5 H2O at the phase transition; this was derived from the transition temperature and verified by relating the observed ΔH of transition to heats of hydration. Peritectic solidification of hydrates can be viewed as a dual process: crystallization from the liquid solution and reaction of the lower hydrate (or anhydrate) with the solution; where ΔH of solidification appears to be less in magnitude than the ΔH of fusion, the difference can be attributed to slower reaction rate between solution and the lower hydrate. New or previously unreported values for ΔH of fusion obtained in this study were, in cal g-1: Mg(NO3)2 · 6 H2O, 36; Na4P2O7 · 10 H2O, 59; CuSO4 · 5 H2O, 32; Na2B4O7 · 10 H2O, 33. © 1979.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4244003901

The theoretical input are the asymptotic expansions for the vacuum polarization functions of vector and axial vector currents in the euclidean region as given by QCD. Since our method allows straightforward inclusion of (as yet uncalculated) higher order terms in αs, there is the potential of making high precision tests of QCD even with experiments at rather moderate energies. We argue, therefore, that it may be very worthwhile to pursue experiments at e+e- storage rings below the J/Ψ resonance and to measure the branching ratios for the decays of the τ-lepton with high accuracy. In the latter case we can also get information on the behaviour of the weak axial vector current which should be very interesting in connection with chiral symmetry breaking. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250258759

After a storage period of 51 days, 55,345 m3 of water were produced from the confined aquifer. Throughout the experiment, which lasted approximately 6 months, groundwater temperatures were recorded at six depths in each of 10 observation wells, and hydraulic heads were recorded in five observation wells. In order to prevent errors due to thermal convection, most of the observation wells recording temperature had to be backfilled with sand. During the 41‐day production period, the temperature of the produced water varied from 55° to 33°C, and 65% of the injected thermal energy was recovered. At no time was an appreciable amount of free thermal convection observed in the storage formation. The dominant heat dissipation mechanisms appeared to be hydrodynamic thermal dispersion and possible mixing of cold and hot water induced by clogging and unclogging of the injection‐production well. On the basis of laboratory and field studies, it was concluded that clogging of the injection well, which constituted the major technical problem during the experiment, was caused by the freshwater‐sensitive nature of the storage aquifer. Due to the relatively low concentration of cations in the supply water, clay particles would swell, disperse, and migrate until they became trapped in the relatively small pores connecting the larger pores. Surging the pump and back washing the injection well would dislodge the clogging particles and temporarily improve the storage formation permeability. The phenomenon seems largely independent of temperature because it was reproduced in the laboratory with unheated water. It may, however, depend on pore velocity. Future research should be directed toward procedures for selecting storage aquifers that will have minimal susceptibility to clogging and other geochemical problems. Procedures for overcoming such difficulties are needed also because clogging and related phenomena will be more the rule than the exception. Designing an aquifer thermal storage system for maximum energy recovery would involve selecting an appropriate aquifer, analyzing the effects of hydrodynamic thermal dispersion and thermal convection if it is predicted to occur, anticipating geochemical problems, designing the optimum supply‐injection‐production well configuration and injecting a sufficiently large volume of heated water to realize economies of scale related to increasing volume‐surface area ratio.

The hitherto proposed criteria for the qualification of an abiotic photochemical system are, however, mostly of a qualitative nature, so a mutal comparison of the systems is not precise enough. In this article it is shown how a useful correlation on the basis of time‐independent experimental data can be achieved and how, from the viewpoint of photochemistry, a comparative classification of known reactions is possible. The following reactions are compared: the [2 + 2]‐photocycloadditions of norbornadiene, dimethyl 2,3‐norbornadienedicarboxylate, and dicyclopentadienone, the photoisomerization of trans‐ to cis‐diacetylindigo, the photodissociation of nitrosyl chloride as well as a photocatalytic redox reaction. The quantity of material required and storage efficiency are by far the most favorable in the case of trans‐diacetylindigo. The main disadvantage of the latter however, is that the energy‐rich cis‐from rapidly reverts to the stable trans‐form at elevated temperatures.

The conditions for efficient hydrogen production and the influence of the concentration of the components have been investigated; the metal complexes act as catalysts with high turnover numbers; excess bipyridine facilitates the reaction. The process contains two catalytic cycles: a ruthenium cycle and a rhodium cycle. The Ru cycle involves oxidative quenching of the *Ru(bipy) 32+ excited state by Rh(bipy) 33+ forming Ru(bipy) 33+ which is converted back to Ru(bipy) 32+ by oxidation of the electron donor TEOA, which is thus consumed. The Rh cycle comprises a complicated set of transformations of the initial Rh(bipy) 33+ complex. The reduced rhodium complex formed in the quenching process undergoes a series of transformations involving the Rh(bipy) 2+ complex and hydridorhodium‐bipyridine species, from which hydrogen is generated by reaction with the protons of water. In view of the storage of two electrons in the reduced rhodium species, the process is formally a dielectronic water reduction. The properties and eventual participation of [Rh(III)(bipy)2LL′]n+(L,L′ = H2O, OH−) species are investigated. It is concluded that at neutral pH in presence of excess bipyridine, the cycle involving regeneration of the Rh(bipy) 33+ complex is predominant. A number of experiments have been performed with modified systems. Hydrogen evolution is observed with other photosensitizers (like proflavin), other relay species (like Rh(dimethylbipy) 33+ or Co(II)‐bipyridine complexes), other donor species, or in absence of the platinum catalyst. It also occurs in absence of photosensitizer by sunlight of UV. irradiation of Rh(bipy) 33+ or by visible light irradiation of iridium (III)‐bibyridine complexes. These systems deserve further investigations. The present photochemical hydrogen generating system represents the reductive component of a complete water splitting process. Its role in solar energy conversion and in photochemical fuel production is discussed. Copyright © 1979 Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2742518955

For binding energy ∼ 11.5 eV with respect to the top of the valence band, Eν, four valence-band density-of-states peaks have been found for SnS2 and five each for PbI2 and BiI3. In the energy region extending from the vacuum level to ∼ 14 eV above it the photoelectron spectra exhibit six conduction-band density-of-states peaks for SnS2 and PbI2 and four for BiI3. A theoretical analysis of the results shows that in all three materials the anion p states give the main contribution to the valence band and the cation p states to the bottom of the conduction band. The transfer of electrons from cation p states to anion p states leaves two filled s states in each cation which also contribute to the valence-band spectrum. For SnS2 these states have been found ∼ 7.4 eV below Eν, while for PbI2 and BiI3 they combine to some extent with anion (s-p) hybrid orbitals, giving a shallow occupied state with antibonding character as well as a bonding state deep in the valence band. More details about the wave-function symmetry have been provided by photon-polarization effects and by spectra taken in a normal-emission geometry. Little dispersion of the normal emission energydistribution-curves peaks with respect to photon energy variation was observed, and this indicates that the interlayer interactions are weaker here than in the tetrahedrally coordinated III-VI compounds. © 1979 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26144480508

The study directed particular emphasis toward the turbine system of the plant. Water-compensated mined caverns, aquifer reservoirs, and constant-volume salt caverns were considered as possible air storage reservoirs. Plant performance is presented in terms of five parameters: specific air flow rate, heat rate, storage volume, compression rate, and overall plant efficiency. The capital and operating costs of the plant as a function of the turbomachinery options and reservoir type are also presented. Design variables are the reservoir pressure and inlet gas temperatures to the turbines.

Because chlorpromazine inhibits a number of other 'chemiosmotic' energy-coupling systems, the effect of the drug on some bioenergetic processes in chromaffin-granule membranes was explored. The chromaffin granule membranes possess an electrogenic proton-translocating adenosine 5'-triphosphatase which generates an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent membrane potential. This potential is abolished by relatively high concentrations of chlorpromazine. At these concentrations, adrenaline uptake is also inhibited whereas adenosine 5'-triphosphatase activity is not affected. An ATP-dependent enhancement of the fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate is inhibited by very low concentrations of chlorpromazine. The fluorescence enhancement is caused by increased binding of the fluorophor to the membrane; chlorpromazine reduces this binding and does not affect the quantum yield of the membrane-bound fluorophore. At these lower drug concentrations, neither adrenaline uptake nor the adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent membrane potential are affected. These results suggest that chlorpromazine inhibits catecholamine transport by dissipating the membrane potential (uncoupling) and not by competitively inhibiting the catecholamine translocator. Because the enhancement of the fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphate is sensitive to low chlorpromazine concentrations, it may be useful in studying subtle effects of the drug on membrane structure. © 1979.",,"8 anilino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; adrenalin; chlorpromazine; radioisotope; adrenalin h 3; cell membrane transport; chromaffin granule; drug analysis; drug interaction; endocrine system; fluorescence; in vitro study; membrane permeability; membrane potential; preliminary communication; theoretical study; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates; Animal; Biological Transport; Chlorpromazine; Chromaffin Granules; Chromaffin System; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epinephrine; Intracellular Membranes; Kinetics; Membrane Potentials; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018773346

Simple, noncorrosive, systems that operate at reasonably low temperatures are rare. The use of the heat of adsorption of moisture on zeolite molecular sieves is discussed here. The advantages of zeolites are high heats of adsorption (as much as 80 kJ mol-1), large maximum adsorption capacity (0.2-0.3 kg H2O/kg adsorbent) and easy control of the store following from control of heat output by regulations of flows of moist air. The disadvantages are the relatively high upper temperature required to utilize maximal storage capacities (up to 250°C) and cost. There is reason to project falling cost. Zeolite storage is compared favourably with respect to capacity to water, stone, and heat of phase change systems. Compared to salt hydrates, acid solution, and salt solutions any capacity advantage is supplemented by low corrosion and opportunity for long term storage. Zeolites are compared favourably to alternative absorbent materials; alumina, charcoal, and silica gel.

A major problem in utilizing inductive energy sources with sufficient output power for such beams and plasmas is the development of an opening switch. In some instances, repetitive pulse output is required, so that switches must open repeatedly at a frequency determined by the needs of the experiment. If only a small number of pulses is needed, then use of one switch per pulse in the train becomes a practical method for generating pulse trains with peak power determined by the performance of individual switches. Formation of pulse trains with peak pulse power in the range of 109 to 1010 W was studied.

Our results indicate that (a) the intrinsic kinetic rate capability of the hydrogen photoapparatus in green algae can keep pace with the incidence rate of light quanta, even in full sunlight; (b) the photogenerated electrons for hydrogen production probably lie in the mainstream of the electron transport chain of photosynthesis. These results have been obtained by performing the first measurements on the turnover times and pool sizes of photosynthetic hydrogen production. For the three species of green algae studied, the turnover times range from 0.1 to 3 ms. The turnover time for photosynthetic hydrogen production is, therefore, comparable to that for oxygen production. Rapid multiple flash experiments have been performed which indicate that the immediate source of reductant for photosynthetic hydrogen production is derived from a pool of 5-20 equivalents, depending on the alga. This pool is probably the plastoquinone pool linking the two photosystems of photosynthesis. © 1979.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; SOLAR ENERGY; ENERGY CONVERSION; PHOTREACTIONS; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018737641

In this work we propose a new passive system employing a ""transwall"", which is a partially transparent thermal storage wall placed adjacent to a window admitting solar energy. Part of the solar energy is absorbed within the transwall, and the remaining part is transmitted to the interior of the room. The transwall is architecturally more attractive than the completely absorbing Trombe wall, since it admits light to the room and allows the occupants to see out through the window without glare and overheating problems of direct gain systems. Calculations using thermal network models and based on reasonable assumptions for relative comparisons have been used to compare thermal performance of transwall, Trombe wall, and direct gain systems. The analysis shows that the transwall system can be expected to have thermal performance very close to or exceeding the other systems, depending on how effectively convective heat transfer is quenched in the thermal storage medium. The important question of visual clarity for the transwall system has been evaluated for a prototype by photographing a scene with and without optical transmission through the structure. Optical distortion is minimal in the transwall transmission photograph. © 1979.",,"BUILDINGS - Space Heating; ENERGY STORAGE - Mathematical Models; SOLAR ENERGY; PASSIVE SOLAR HEATING; TRANSWALL; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018731355

Observations of reflectance at different latitude zones are portrayed as functions of insolation magnitude, its spatial gradient and variation in time during the year. Assuming heat transport and storage terms remain the same as today, conservation demands a radiant emittance (and corresponding surface temperature) which balances the energy equation. Sensitivity studies are performed to determine mean surface temperature changes associated with variations in obliquity, eccentricity, and longitude of perihelion of the Earth's orbit. Time series of temperature changes between 40 and 70oN are presented for a period form 500,000 yr before present to 100,000 yr after present. Maximum oscillations of temperature occur for obital conditions of larger eccentricity, and for longitudes of perihelion at 135o (warmest) and 270o (coldest) in the absence of positive feedback mechanisms. Periods of glacial build-up favor orbit conditions of larger eccentricity. In addition the range of the obliquity cycle may be an important factor in long-term temperature variations of the Earth. -Author",,"Earth atmosphere system; model; sensitivity studies; temperature changes; time series",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018725952

To explain and anticipate the data obtainable from prevailing soil-water-plant systems, an incremental model is devised in which various sectors present in the system are viewed as a series of discrete 'compartments' between which material and energy flow. Each compartment is to represent one of the main parameters encountered and their relations are assumed to be characterized by constant-coefficient linear differential equations. Presently, various coefficients that appear in the governing equations of a computerized version of this model are determined for alfalfa cultivation. The results indicate the balance and inter-relation of all the elements involved, and lead to the prediction of biomass energy yield per unit farm area, efficiency of photosynthetic conversion, and the cycling of the main nutrients.

The livers were perfused with 1 mM-[114C]palmitate and with 0.10 mM- or 80 mM-ethanol. The oxidation and esterification of palmitate was measured. Two subcellular pools of triacylglycerol were separated; one contained triacylglycerol from cytoplasmic lipid droplets and the other contained triacylglycerol from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In the presence of ethanol, liver from rats fed on the high-fat diet esterified about 70% of the [1-14C]palmitate taken up compared with 90% in liver from rats fed chow (containing 11% fat on the basis of energy content). Compared with chow diet the high-fat diet did not potentiate the effect of ethanol on storage of [1-14C]palmitate in hepatic triacylglycerol.

A general expression for the capacity factor of such a facility is derived through which the ratio of the actual annual electrical output to the maximum mean annual output without demand, generating and downtime reductions, and storage losses can be determined. A general expression for a solar availability factor is also obtained which measures the ratio of the maximum mean annual output of the solar facility to that of a conventional fuel-fired plant of the same installed capacity generating at full capacity continuously for a year. An expression for the fraction of the total electrical output supplied by the solar facility is also derived. The analysis takes full account of the daily and seasonal cycles of solar radiation and its intermittent stochastic character. All results are given for a unit area of solar collector and are thus independent of the size of the facility. The capital cost of solar-electric facilities is expressed in dollars for each kWh per yr of electrical output rather than dollars per kW of installed capacity as is customary for conventional electric generating plants. This cost in turn is divided among three components: for solar-electric generation, for nonsolar auxiliary power, and for storage.

The water budget indicates that precipitation, discharge, runoff, and evaporation dominate the water balance in seasonal succession, each associated with an appropriate minimum or maximum in the lake water storage. The annual energy budget is dominated by the net radiation and evaporation terms with 93% of the radiation input used to evaporate water. The seasonal energy budget indicates that (1) energy storage is in phase with the radiation input and is a dominant term in the periods November–January and May–July, (2) evaporation reaches a maximum value in the fall, 3 months after the radiation maximum, (3) upward transfer of sensible heat from the lake surface reaches a maximum another 3 months later, in the winter, and (4) the sensible heat flux is downward in late spring and early summer, indicating stable stratification in the atmospheric surface layer over the lake during this period, a result of possible significance to air quality in the Tahoe basin. The energy storage and sensible heat transfer terms show large fluctuations in the fall which may be associated with large‐scale meteorological events during a season in which energy is trapped in the surface waters by stable stratification in the thermocline layer.

The energy loss is then divided into two components: the boundary friction loss and the turbulent mixing loss. The turbulent mixing loss is found to be of the same order of magnitude as the boundary friction loss evaluated by Manning's formula. The loss coefficient is derived as a function of the ratio of lateral to total flow rate. An energy transfer process from the main channel flow to the lateral inflow or vice versa, which is implicit in the one‐dimensional flow analysis, can be analyzed by means of the turbulent mixing loss coefficients.

Bacterial killing involves increased activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt, oxygen utilization and the generation of toxic products of oxygen. Chemotaxis is probably a contractile process involving myosin and actin filaments and possibly ATP as a source of energy. Thus, maintainance of ATP may be important in granulocyte preservation. During storage at 1 to 6 C of granulocytes collected by continuous and intermittent flow centrifuge leukapheresis, both CTR and ATP decreased approximately 33 per cent. Decreases in CTR and ATP were 12 and 10 per cent respectively when cells were stored at 20 to 24 C. Further decreases in CTR and ATP occurred between 24 and 48 hours of storage, although levels of both were higher in cells stored at 20 to 24 C compared with those stored at 1 to 6 C. When the results from all storage conditions were combined, the overall coefficient of correlation between CTR and ATP was 0.71 (p < .05).

Ineffective utilisation may result in a wasted resource or pollution from improper storage and disposal. About 100 million metric tons of manure (dry basis) were estimated to have been voided by livestock and poultry in the US in 1974. About 47% was produced by beef cattle on range, 23% by dairy cattle and 12% by hogs. The estimated amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium voided with the manure were 3·7, 0·9 and 2·2 million metric tons, respectively. Significant changes often occur in the amounts of manure and nutrients after voiding, when considering different lengths storage time and different types of waste handling system. The quantity of manure in 1974 decreased about 11% to 90 million metric tons as a result of these losses. Nitrogen decreased to 2·4 million tons. Approximately half the manure was estimated to have been produced in areas where economic collection was feasible. The remainder was voided by animals on range and pastureland. In 2260 counties of the United States in 1974, at least 50% of the manure was produced by one commodity. In almost 70% of those counties, beef cattle on pasture or range produced the majority of the manure. Considering only the manure which is economically recoverable, in about 56% of the 2168 counties dairy cattle were the major contributor, followed by feeder cattle, hogs and broilers in decreasing order of importance.

The functional solubilized protein has been incorporated into liposomes after removal of the detergent either by gel filtration or by dialysis. Reserpine-sensitive accumulation against a concentration gradient is achieved by artifically imposing a pH gradient across the membrane. In the reconstituted system adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) serves as an energy source only at higher detergent concentrations. The proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) is solubilized in parallel with the increasing efficiency of ATP as an energy source. Several criteria are proposed to distinguish between carrier-mediated (reserpine sensitive) and unmediated transport in the reconstituted system. The reserpine-sensitive process shows affinity and specificity toward biogenic amines similar to that of the native system. The results presented in this communication provide further support for the contention that concentrative uptake in biogenic amine storage vesicles is driven by a transmembrane pH gradient, which, in the native system, is generated by a proton-translocating ATPase.

A new similarity rule is presented in this paper to make the solution of such problems possible. The similarity rule applies to problems in which sensible heat. contributions are much smaller than latent heat contributions, and the heat flux distribution on the surface of the phase change substance is more or less uniform. After a derivation of the similarity rule is given, it is verified by application to some problems arising in latent heat storage for which finite-difference computations have been performed previously. The similarity rule is easy to apply, and greatly reduces the effort needed in analysing phase change problems.

Two relaxation processes at 347° and 423°K are observed having activation energies of 0.36 ± 0.02 and 0.66 ± 0.02 eV, and relaxation times at 300°K of 4.19 × 10s and 0.86 × 106 sec, respectively. The magnitude of the maximum current corresponding to the 347 °K peak and the charge associated with it increase linearly with the poling field. It is associated with the deorientation of the aligned dipoles involving the acetate/hydroxyl groups. The peak at 423°K is attributed to the release of trapped electrons/holes. The increase in the activation energy associated with the peak at 423°K and the shift in its position toward higher temperatures with increase in the poling time and temperature suggest that the peak at 423°K is associated with a distribution of relaxation times. © 1979, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The Ti samples were prepared by evaporation under UHV conditions and exposed to hydrogen at pressures 5 × 10-8 - 1 × 10-5 Torr. The absorption kinetics is characterized by three reaction regions. For H/Ti ratios ≲ 0.3 (region I) the sticking coefficient decreases monotonically from an initial sticking coefficient on the clean surface of 0.17. In region II (0.3 ≲ H/Ti ≲ 1.8) the absorption rate is almost constant. When the hydrogen gas is removed, desorption of H2 is observed and the desorption kinetics is well described by a simple associative desorption model. The desorption rate and the total amount of desorbing H2 is increasing with increasing pressure during the H2 exposure, but are relatively insensitive to the H/Ti atom ratio in region II. Only a small fraction of the total hydrogen content in the sample desorbs. A kinetic model is proposed for region II where it is assumed that a surface hydride many atomic layers thick is formed on the sample surface during reaction in region I. The observed desorption is attributed to a decrease in the hydrogen binding energy in the hydride when the H/Ti ratio approaches two. The rate limiting steps in the model are surface adsorption and desorption and diffusion over the surface hydride-bulk interface. In region III the absorption rate decreases and ceases when TiH2 is formed. Addition of monolayer amounts of CO or O2 strongly influences the absorption and desorption kinetics. Oxidation of partly hydrided samples virtually passivates the surface against further hydrogen absorption, but addition of small amounts of Ti on top of the oxide results in a recovery of the absorption capability. The oxide obviously strongly reduces the hydrogen dissociation rate but does not act as a diffusion barrier for atomic hydrogen. © 1979.",,"CHEMICAL REACTIONS - Reaction Kinetics; HYDROGEN FUELS - Storage; TITANIUM COMPOUNDS; HYDROGEN INORGANIC COMPOUNDS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018543804

The worst-case condition is taken to be a bubble of reversed magnetization in an otherwise saturated medium, written by applying current to a stationary recording head. A leading and a trailing transition are formed, creating a large demagnetizing field opposing the head field. Although the leading transition is commonly thought to be unimportant in saturation writing, its demagnetizing field can significantly hamper the writing of the trailing transition. First, self-consistent numerical calculation shows the characteristics of the bubble and its associated fields. Then the bubble is approximated analytically by a biquadratic form, and the demagnetizing field at the bubble center is compared with the field necessary to saturate the medium. A rapid loss of overwrite ability with decreasing gap-length is demonstrated. The importance of including image fields for thin-film heads is discussed. Graphical representations are given for the minimum gap-length necessary for overwrite.

The flowing liquid electrolyte system uses the large thermal mass of a storage tank of electrolyte to store the energy which is dissipated through a heat exchanger after the high-power run. The electrolyte starting temperature, flow rate, and allowable temperature rise determine the maximum average power into the load; the external and internal spacings and flow uniformity determine the maximum peak power; the flow rate and storage volume determine maximum running time. The load assembly consists of two parallel glass pipes 10.2 cm in diameter and 15.25 cm long. The active volume in each pipe is 6.35 cm long and is contained between electrodes 8.9 cm in diameter, The two sections of the load are electrically in parallel and flowing in series, putting both flow connections at ground potential, The major problem was getting the internal flow pattern uniform to eliminate local boiling and arcing across the bubbles while keeping the pressure drop low and flow high. The calculated inductance of the load assembly in 11 nH, and the structure lends itself to coaxial connections which reduce the overall inductance still further. Material compatibility with the electrolyte will be discussed.

During the storage time, the triode operates with a depressed collector voltage. A high-energy current pulse is obtained when the triode is switched from a high-perveance state to a low-perveance one. In this paper, the circuit model for the beam generator was expanded to take into account grid capacitance and beam loss. Computer results based on the new circuit model predict a train of sinusoidal-like pulses in the triode output when the grid is suddenly connected to a portion of the storage inductor. An electron-beam generator, capable of producing a train of megavolt pulses at high currents, is predicted.

Relatively rapid reductions have been implemented in areas dominated by social habits. Significant gains are noted in the transportation and space-conditioning sectors. Following innovative marketing, a number of passive (solar) retrofit procedures has been found to yield effective potentials for significant energy-conservation gains in the residential sector. Examples are ceiling insulation to reduce energy requirements for space-conditioning, fenestration devices for windows to reduce air-conditioning loads during hot summer months, and insulation retrofits on inadequately insulated water heaters. Over the long term, the major challenge in the residential sector concerns the design, construction, and marketing of energy-efficient homes. These will utilize far less energy, on the average, than is currently needed, without requiring major changes in the lifestyles of inhabitants. Systems studies allowing for technological innovation (e.g. solar water heating and solar-space conditioning for multiple-family aggregates, walls with thermal storage, use of improved materials and designs) and removal of obstacles (e.g. zoning restrictions, outdated building codes, difficulties for proper financing) present outstanding challenges to designers, municipal planners, and politicians alike. Innovation in industrial production is more clearly defined than in the residential sector and will be facilitated by (a) educating consumers on the importance of life-cycle costing in making intelligent choices in the capital-goods market and (b) by marginal pricing of energy supplies. Optimized economic evaluations from the consumer's and manufacturer's points of view are currently widely introduced and should play important roles in defining the long-term acceptabilities of more energy-efficient appliances, vehicles, and other products. In many cases (e.g. cogeneration, district heating), market penetration will be delayed because of existing excess capacity (as in the electric utility sector) or current availability of alternative techniques that will remain less costly than better new technologies when life-cycle costing is properly done. Delays in the introduction of improved technologies will generally be minimized by allowing fuel-price escalation to recover marginal costs. Inventions and innovations in technologies that are not motivated by energy-conservation goals (e.g. introduction of new generations of motor vehicles, aircraft, entertainment facilities such as color TVs, stereo systems, and video-tapes) have played dominant roles in improving what many people view as their standard of living. These inventions and innovations have been responsible for rapidly escalating energy-use rates. In developing future scenarios for energy conservation, it is important to allow room for important inventions not yet conceived or not yet available (e.g. personal electric vehicles) and for the corresponding radical changes in energyuse patterns that may accompany their introduction. Without this provision, the most benign energy-conservation scenarios may not justifiably be viewed as maintaining or augmenting the quality of life. The concluding remarks briefly address life-cycle costing and the relations between per capita income and energy use in different countries. © 1979.",,"BUILDINGS - Energy Conservation; ENERGY UTILIZATION; INDUSTRIAL PLANTS - Energy Conservation; TECHNOLOGY - Energy Conservation; ENERGY CONSERVATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018533999

Like the Astron, the principle of magnetic induction is used to obtain a linear accelerator. The modular accelerating cavities form essentially a 1:1 transformer and the change in flux in the ferrite core induces an axial electric field for the acceleration of electrons. Since the total energy storage for the ETA is much greater than the requirement for Astron, the power system, the capacitor bank, and the modulator charging system all had to be modified to provide an overall regulation of 0.1 percent.

About 20 TW of wind energy flows poleward annually, over land in temperate latitudes, in the 500 m deep atmospheric boundary layer. An average 500 GW of electricity could be generated by massive exploitation of the U.S. Great Plains wind field. There are, however, large fluctuations in available wind power. There are frequent 20% variations in annual supply; annual periodicity brings most wind power during the spring; there are storm cycles; and there is a diurnal cycle. Gusts and turbulence also require filtering to meet normal power requirements. Several schemes are evolving to tame this erratic wind power supply. Modern technology is refining horizontal-axis turbines of a wide size range. Progress is also being made toward producing an economical vertical-axis turbine. Standards for turbine performance evaluation and installation site selection are now being developed. Yet it will be a few years before proven systems can significantly affect national energy supplies. Eventually, mass-produced WECS may cost $1000 per installed, rated kW, but the wind does not often flow at turbine-rated speed. With some storage or filtering, problems with wind variability may be overcome. Then WECS electricity production may be as economical as other electric generators.

The ammonia concentration was low (1–7 mg./100 ml.) and the urea concentration corresponded with the plasma level (40 mg./100 ml.). There was no indication of microbial protein digestion in the murine forestomach. To study the storage function of the forestomach, blood glucose and liver glycogen were measured during the 4 hr after food intake. A slight rise was observed in rats where the forestomach had been removed, while no change was observed in healthy rats. The kinetics of gastric emptying were investigated in rats and mice, with and without forestomach. In both, the relationship follows a linear function. It seems that the quantity of chyme delivered to the duodenum is independent of the degree of stomach filling and corresponds to the animal's actual energy requirements.

Der Vormagen bei Ratte und Maus, ein Futterspeicher ohne bakterielle Proteinverdauung Im Vormagen der Muriden finden sich keine Anzeichen für eine dort stattfindende mikrobielle Proteinverdauung. Ein, zwei und drei Stunden nach der Futteraufnahme entspricht die Aminosäurenzusammensetzung des Mageninhaltes bei gesunden und bei Ratten mit exstirpiertem Magen unverändert der des Futters. Die Ammoniakkonzentration des Mageninhaltes bleibt niedrig (1–7 mg / 100 ml), seine Harnstoffkonzentration entpsricht der des Plasmas (40 mg/ 100 ml). Bei gesunden Ratten konnte bis zu vier Stunden postprandial nur ein unauffälliger Anstieg des Glukose‐ und Leberglycogenpools beobachtet werden. Dagegen war bei Ratten nach Exstirpation der Vormägen die Auffüllung dieser postprandialen Energiespeicher deutlicher. Bei gesunden Ratten und Mäusen und solchen nach Exstirpation der Vormägen folgt die Magenentleerung nach spontaner Futteraufnahme einer linearen Funktion. Es wird für die Muriden vermutet, daß bei ihnen unabhängig vom Füllungszustand des Magens dem Duodenum kontinuierlich eine Futtermenge zufließt, die dem aktuellen Energiebedarf der Tiere entspricht. Der Vormagen der Muriden wird in erster Linie als Speicher energietragender Futterbestandteile aufgefaßt. Le renflement sus‐diaphragmatique de l'oesophage chez le rat et la souris, un dépôt d'aliment sans digestion bactérienne des protéines Il n'y a pas eu d'indices concernant les signes d'une digestion bactérienne des protéines dans le renflement sus‐diaphragmatique de l'oesophage chez des Muridae. La composition en acides aminés du contenu stomacal n'a pas été modifiée une, deux et trois heures après la prise de l'aliment aussi bien chez des rats sains que chez ceux dont l'estomac avait été enlevé. La concentration de l'ammoniaque du contenu stomacal reste faible (1–7 mg / 100 ml) et sa concentration en urée correspond à celle du plasma (40 mg / 100 ml). Seule une augmentation peu marquée des pools glucose et glycogène du foie ont été observés jusqu'à 4 heures après la prise de l'aliment chez des rats sains. L'augmentation de cette épargne d'énergie post‐alimentaire fut par contre plus nette chez des rats après ablation du renflement sus‐diaphragmatique de l'oesophage. Le vide stomacal après une alimentation spontanée suit une fonction linéaire chez les rats et souris sains ainsi que chez les animaux avec ablation. On soupçonne chez les Muridae qu'une quantité d'aliment passe continuellement dans le Duodenum indépendamment de l'état de remplissage de l'estomac, quantité correspondant au besoin d'énergie du moment des animaux. Le renflement sus‐diaphragmatique de l'oesophage des Muridae est en premier lieu un dépôt d'éléments énergétiques de l'aliment. El anteestómago en rata y ratón, un almacén de pienso sin digestión proteica bacteriana No se hallan signos en el anteestómago de los múridos de que en el mismo se lleve a cabo una digestión bacteriana de la proteína. Una, dos y tres horas después de la ingestión de comida corresponde la composición de los aminoácidos del contenido estomacal en los sanos y en las ratas con estómago extirpado de forma invariada a la del pienso. Permanece baja la concentración de amoníaco en el contenido estomacal (1–7 mg. / 100 ml.), correspondiendo su concentración de urea a la del plasma sanguíneo (40 mg. / 100 ml.). En ratas sanas solo se pudo observar hasta cuatro horas postprandiales un incremento inaparente del fondo común de glucosa y glucógeno hepático. Sin embargo, el recebo de estos depósitos postprandiales de energiá era mucho más manifiesto en las ratas tras extirpación de los anteestómagos.

Three orientations of the fibres are considered in relation to the incident wave: longitudinal, transverse and random. Solutions for the latter case are based on the random superpositioning of the other two cases. The main assumptions are a low volume concentration of the filler so that adjacent strain fields do not interact and a wave length much greater than the diameter of a fibre. Theoretical predictions have been verified by experiments with glass fibre reinforced polypropylene over the frequency range 40-1200 Hz. The effect of fibre length has been investigated.

The residual signal effect increases with time and temperature of storage after recording. The effect varies with the FeO content of the ϒ-Fe2O3 particles, and is a maximum at an FeO content of about 10 percent by weight. An explanation is presented of the phenomenon in terms of migration of cation vacancies from the interior of a magnetic domain to a domain wall in a magnetized ϒ-Fe2O3 particle thereby decreasing the free energy of the system. This sets up concentration gradients of Fe2+ ions in regions of domain walls which remain after demagnetization of the tape and results in some residual magnetization. Reasonable agreement is obtained between calculated and observed residual magnetic effects as a function of FeO content.

In addition, they may provide benefits to the distribution systems by reducing capacity requirements, improving reliability, and lowering losses. This paper offers a consistent, unifying methodology for evaluating the impact of Dispersible Supply-side Storage and Generation (DSSG) on distribution systems. The evaluation method and models developed compare the distribution systems expanded with and without DSG, using a consistent set of planning and operating criteria. The effects of DSSG outages probabilities, diseconomies of scale, and loss savings are explicitly treated. Most importantly, the method also takes into account the contributions of DSSG to the bulk supply system when they are planned and operated for distribution system needs. To obtain a global DSSG impact on a utility system the results derived from this methodology can readily be combined with the impact of the technologies assessed from a bulk supply perspective undertaken in other studies. This assessment methodology would be suitable for use by most utilities since it is based on extant utility planning procedures and data base, and practical assessment calculations. Several important findings emerged from the methodology development and application to assessing unconventional firm DSSG technologies for two utilities. The distribution capacity and reliability benefits are highly site-dependent, with significant benefits achievable in special cases. Potentially higher production cost and DSSG capital cost may be incurred, in addition to increased backup generating capacity requirement for energy-limited dispersed storage devices; since operating DSSG to realize distribution benefits may depart from supply system economic dispatch principles. The study points to the importance of caution and comprehensive assessment before implementing DSSG in the distribution system on a large scale. Further research on extending the methodology and application to address the impact of dispersed intermittent generation is being undertaken.

The effects of low interest loans and National Energy Act (NBA) income tax credits are examined. With natural gas as the alternative fuel, the passive designs evaluated here offer more promise than the active system. This is true with or without inclusion of incentives, although either incentive option enhances economic performance. The passive designs evaluated in this paper are economically competitive against the electric resistance alternative in all but a few states. Moreover, on a life cycle cost basis, these designs are feasible today. Although the optimal solar fractions are generally low, passive designs offer the opportunity to incorporate solar heating into a new home at costs much less than their active counterparts. This is because there are no discernible fixed costs, thereby allowing a simple movement from zero to 100% solar when evaluating economic feasibility. When both active and passive design are shown to be cost competitive against alternative fuels, higher solar fractions will be associated with the active systems. This is principally due to the substantial fixed cost component of active systems, which forces one to achieve a given solar fraction before economic feasibility can be shown. © 1979.",,"COST ACCOUNTING - Applications; ENERGY POLICY - United States; ENERGY STORAGE - Applications; ACTIVE SOLAR HEATING; PASSIVE SOLAR HEATING; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018509957

Each bundle of tubes is considered in three distinct regimes: presolidification, solidification, postsolidification. The model developed thus far has been used to predict the time response of the wall panel in satisfactory agreement with the actual performance. The simulation helped to establish the important system parameters. © 1979.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION - Applications; HEAT TRANSFER - Walls; MATERIALS - Thermal Properties; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; SOLAR HOT-AIR SYSTEMS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018509639

Recognizing the particular sensitivity of solar systems to cost, the economic aspect of the problem was treated by a comprehensive present-value life-cycle cost analysis. In the development of the method, a numerical sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the relative effects of all relevant independent variables (within their pertinent ranges) on piping and tank heat transfer coefficient values. For the acceptable error limits of ± 14% for pipes and ± 19% for tanks, it was found that one may assume that only the nominal pipe diameter (or tank diameter), the thermal conductivity of the insulation, and the insulation's thickness have an effect on the overall heat transfer coefficient. Based on this result, design graphs and tables are presented which can be used to determine the optimal insulation thickness and type, total annual heat losses, present-value annual costs of insulation and lost heat, and overall insulation R-values. The use of the method is illustrated by calculating all the above quantities for all piping and storage tanks for the University of Pennsylvania SolaRow House. The present method provided insulation thicknesses slightly greater than those obtained by the ETI technique. A major conclusion of the study is that the cost of insulation in solar systems is not insignificant (e.g., ~15% in SolaRow), and that heat losses through insulation could amount to an important percentage of the useful solar energy collected (e.g., 24% in SolaRow). This re-emphasizes the need for a careful design of insulation in solar systems. © 1979.",,"HEAT INSULATING MATERIALS - Thermal Conductivity; HEAT TRANSFER - Analysis; OPTIMIZATION - Applications; PIPE - Thermal Conductivity; TANKS - Heat Losses; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018507741

In this manner, high signal-to-noise ratios can be achieved, even for measurements in noisy environments and for low-power test signals. Pseudo random noise has also been used successfully as the test signal in the “integrated-impulse” method of measuring sound decay and reverberation time. Thus, the need to radiate a short pulse of high peak energy for impulse type measurements is completely avoided. Improvements in signal-to-noise ratios are equal to the period length of the pseudorandom noise, typically 40 dB in room acoustical applications. The necessary digital processing to realize these gains in signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy of response can be performed on available minicomputers. Apart from maximum-length sequences, another type of periodic binary sequency, called the “Legendre sequence, ” can be used as a test signal. Like maximum-length sequences, Legendre sequences have flat power spectra, but their discrete Fourier components have only two phase angles (~±90°), thus simplifying their digital representation (for storage and transmission). In fact, the discrete Fourier transform of a Legendre sequence is equal (within a constant factor) to the sequence itselfl Legendre sequences exist for all period lengths equal to a prime number of the form 4k 1, where k is an integer.

After a common solid-liquid interface is formed around the cylinders, natural convection circulation around each cylinder interacts strongly with the other two cylinders.

This paper discusses the interaction between battery requirements, in particular for vehicle propulsion, and electrochemical and constructional factors. It is argued that the energy obtainable at a given load is limited by saturation of the surface layers of cathode particles with cations, and that the time before saturation occurs is determined by diffusion of cations and electrons into the host lattice. Expressions are developed for plane, cylindrical, and spherical particles, giving the relation between battery load and the amount of cathode material utilized before saturation. The particle shape and a; single parameter Q is used to describe cathode performance. Q is the ratio between discharge time at 100% utilization of the cathode at the given load, and the time constant for diffusion through the cathode particles. This description is extended to cover short peak loads characteristic of vehicle propulsion. On the basis of estimated parameters for the Li/TiS2 couple with LiClO4-propylene-carbonate electrolyte the properties of plane cathodes or cathodes consisting of few layers of particles are examined in relation to traction requirements. In this context limiting currents in the electrolyte phase are discussed, and a relation between the maximal allowed values for particle size and electrode spacing is derived. For nonporous electrodes the limiting factor is cathode surface saturation. A qualitative discussion of porous cathodes indicates that the cathode thickness, and thus the over-all specific energy, is limited by cation transport in the pore electrolyte when the cation diffusion coefficient in the solid exceeds 10-10 cm2 sec-1. On the basis of an approximate relation between cathode thickness and electrode spacing the specific energy for the Li/TiS2 system with organic electrolyte is estimated to be 120150 W-hr/kg in agreement with published values. © 1979, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Recent analytical and experimental work indicates that considerable improvement in the specific power of GDLs can be achieved. Performance analyses have been carried out for three advanced GDL concepts: the bipropellant GDL (BDGL), the advanced fuel-rich GDL (AGDL), and the screen mixing GDL (SMGDL). The results of these projections have been corroborated by small-scale experiments in the MSNW shock-tube GDL simulator. Small signal gains of 1%/cm and available energy of 20 kJ/lb have been measured in typical BGDL mixtures. Excess oxygen produced in the BGDL has been shown to interact vibrationally in a manner detrimental to performance. A BGDL should be able to deliver 12-13 kJ/lb from a well-designed optical cavity. The excess oxygen is eliminated in the advanced fuel-rich GDL; however, a large fraction of the available energy is carried by CO. Available energies near 40 kJ/lb and small signal gains of 0.6%/cm have been measured in typical AGDL mixtures. The storage of available energy in CO was found to be particularly sensitive to the amount of H2O in the mixture. Performance calculations show that an AGDL device should be able to produce a specific output power of 18 to 20 kJ/lb. The screen mixing GDL relieves the limitations on stagnation temperature and pressure, inherent to the premixed GDL, allowing greater efficiency and specific power and, at the same time, demonstrates beam quality potential equivalent to that of the existing GDL. This concept has been experimentally demonstrated in a small-scale device. A preliminary fuels identification and characterization program has been completed. Performance calculations now predict that extracted specific powers of 30 kJ/lb should be possible from a well-designed screen mixing GDL. These advanced GDL concepts indicate that substantially improved performance is possible while retaining the inherent simplicity and reliability of conventional GDLs. © 1979 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,"LASERS, GAS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018504420

The energy available in fibre components is usually the most limiting factor in waste quality for biodegradation procedures-feeding to ruminants, controlled methanogenesis, single cell protein production. It is contended that wastes of high quality can be obtained by selecting dietary ingredients having favourable characteristics in relation to fibre components, although more information is still required on the content and nature of fibre components in common dietary ingredients. A secondary factor in waste quality is the mineral content. Although high levels of minerals may not depress the biodegradability, the reduce the overall efficiency of utilisation procedures. The management of wastes between voiding and utilisation results in a lowering of quality. Consideration needs to be given to management procedures so as to reduce nutrient losses as far as possible.

Results are presented showing that fresh, precycled cells easily attain the target specification (40-50 W h dm-3) at temperatures at and above room temperature. Charge acceptance falls sharply at sub-zero temperatures however, and energy density reduces to critical levels below -20° C. The charging characteristics and ability to achieve target performance at -30° C depends markedly on cell origin and the permissibility of allowing some cell venting during the charge. The low temperature limitations can be overcome by means of low wattage heating coils on the cells. Internal temperatures of C and D/2 cells can be raised to 20° C within a few minutes by employing very modest temperature gradients and with heater volumes no greater than the manufacturers label and sleeve. Although the picture is optimistic for fresh precycled cells, major problems are anticipated with stored cells, particularly at temperature extremes, unless steps can be taken to prevent or erase storage effects. © 1979 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,"NICKEL-CADMIUM CELLS; ELECTRIC BATTERIES, SECONDARY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018490971

It is located in deepwater, which can easily accommodate the LNG tankers, and it is convenient to Southern Natural Gas Co.'s existing pipeline which is just 13 miles away. The site has ample acreage for more than adequate separation between components of the facility. The safety philosophy employed by Southern Energy was developed by Energy Analysis Inc. This philosophy consists of three basic parts: prevention, detection, and control. The Elba Island terminal was designed with emphasis on prevention. The concept was believed to be very important by those who participated in the Elba Island project. A quality assurance program especially geared toward the concept of accident prevention was employed. Should an accident occur at the facility, early detection and response will reduce any potential hazards to a minimum. To detect an accident, a wide variety of sensors are used throughout the plant. If an accident occurs it will be controlled by two separate and distinct systems. The first system, referred to as the passive system, controls any unlikely spills of LNG by controlling where the liquid travels. The second system, referred to as the active system, consists of high-expansion foam generators and fixed dry-chemical units which can be activated manually or by the sensors mentioned earlier.Safety was the basic consideration in the design of Southern Energy Co. 's LNG import terminal at Elba Island, about 10 miles upstream from the mouth of the Savannah River. The terminal has three storage tanks, each of which can store 400,000 bbls of LNG. Nine 125,000 cu m tankers supply the terminal from Algeria.

On the one hand this creates new material problems, such as corrosion of the photoactive material, while on the other hand the demand for lattice match is replaced by that of rapid kinetics of the electrochemical reactions occuring in the cell. Photocorrosion is dependent on the rate of reaction between light-generated charge carriers and solution species, as well as the rate of removal of reacted solution species from the electrode surface. The occurrence of more than one stable valence state in the semiconductor of the photoelectrode can prevent photocorrosion. Exchange of surface ions with the solution may create a dynamic equilibrium which can lead to effective stabilization of certain photoelectrodes. The substrate material of the photoelectrode should act as a poor electrocatalytic material for the reverse of the photogenerated reaction and its contact with the semiconductor material should be ohmic and physically coherent. The counter-electrode must be kinetically rapid for the reverse of the photogenerated reaction, which may cause complications if even small quantities of electrocatalyst reach the photoelectrode from the counter-electrode. If a storage system is added to the photo-electrochemical system its electrochemical as well as chemical properties have to be carefully matched to that of the photoconverting system. When chemicals are produced instead of electrical energy, the energy difference between the bandgap of the semiconductor and the photopotential obtained can be utilized to overcome overpotentials. This is of special importance for photodiodes, where appreciable overpotentials for dark reactions can prevent side-reactions and recombination, while the photoreaction has sufficient energy available for overcoming these overpotentials. Photodiodes and photocatalysts are conceptually close to each other, their difference being defined by the energetic requirements of the chemical reaction. While the combination of energy production, energy storage and the production of chemicals into one device creates many technical problems, it may turn out to be more economical in the end as has been shown to be true for parallel cases in chemical technology. © 1979.",,"ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SOLAR CELLS - Energy Storage; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018482208

Because the magnet operates from 0–18 kG, it should also produce undulator radiation (UR). Since the wiggler influences storage ring operation in both single beam and colliding beam modes, measurements were made of tune changes, emittance changes and energy spreads which are compared to predictions.1 Significant improvements in luminosity for high energy physics experiments were observed. The ability to do x-ray experiments easily that were not previously feasible at low electron beam energies and currents has also been demonstrated.

An alternative for achieving both high level performance and operational simplicity is through the use of high frequency bunches. A scheme that could be used in operating the ISABELLE facility is outlined. High-luminosity is obtained with low average current and tight bunching. The bunched mode is natural for achieving flexibility in energy variation. With sufficiently high bunch frequency, the total number of events per colliding bunch can be kept down to a value on the order of unity. The advantages of bunched operation cover the areas of current accumulation, beam loss, aperture utilization, bean handling (e.g., debunching, rebunching, and beam extraction) and synchrotron radiation. Other relevant topics are stability against growing coherent beam oscillations, the beam-beam interaction, and the rf heating induced in the vacuum chamber.

Due to the small dipole moment the energy of the neutron is limited to a few 10–6 eV in spite of the high field in the superconducting magnet of 1 m diameter. In many respects the beam dynamics are similar to a storage ring for charged particles. The basic field configuration is a sextupole field superimposed of a strong decapole term in order to overcome imperfaction resonances by a non harmonic potential. As only neutrons in one spin state are confined, care has to be taken to avoid spin flips. The neutrons are injected by a totally reflecting mirror system which can be removed out of the confinement region. Neutrons were detected up to a storage time of 45 min. Their number decreases according to their lifetime (t1/2=10.6 min) due to radioactive decay.

Linear correction is presently achieved with one set of 36 F sextupoles and another set of 36 D sextupoles, regularly placed around the machine circumference. This lumped sextupole distribution induces non-linear variations of the machine tune with Ap/p. These higher order effects which are also encountered in large electron machines cannot actually be corrected in the SPS, where they are well observable at least up to second order. Analytic calculation of the non-linear chromaticity, using Fourier expansions of the lattice functions, as well as computer simulation with the AGS program closely agree with the measurements performed at various energies. For the same reason, the transition energy depends upon the momentum deviation Δp/p of the beam, which can lead to losses when beams with large Δp/p are accelerated through transition, since no correct phase-junp timing can be found for all particles. Measurements of this effect in the presence of different chromatic corrections are presented and also compared with the predictions of the analytic calculations and of the computer evaluations with the AGS program.

Various situations arise in the heating regime, depending on whether the conversion reaction is controlled by thermal conduction, reactant diffusion, reactant convection, or thermal convection where no distinct separation exists between the various cases. Some guidelines emerge for evaluating safe storage conditions for coal or char where the criterion of safety has to be specified for different materials, probably as a maximum safe temperature and maximum time of storage. © 1979.",,"COAL STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018478427

However, for the special case of single-interface transformations in single crystals of the parent phase, elastic strain energy is not generated because the transformational shape change takes place freely without surrounding constraints. The temperature (T0) of zero-change in chemical free energy can then be bracketed unambiguously between the interface-advance temperature on cooling and the interface-reverse temperature on heating. Also, by means of calorimetric measurements, the chemical enthalpy, entropy and free-energy changes can be determined. Concomitantly, the frictional resistance can be estimated from the hysteresis between the interface-advance and interface-reverse temperatures; the frictional energy turns out to be approximately 5% of the chemical enthalpy change. In multiple-interface transformations, the cooling and heating transformation curves are altered in form and depressed to lower temperatures due to the storage of elastic strain energy, and there is a corresponding effect on the measured thermodynamic quantities, e.g. as a function of decreasing grain size. Such differences relative to the single-interface results permit evaluation of the stored elastic strain energy; it amounts to about 15% of the chemical enthalpy change. © 1979.",,"COPPER METALLURGY - Transformations; COPPER ALUMINUM NICKEL ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018468348

Time–temperature superpositioning was used to generate master curves of each type of data for a reference temperature of 260°C. This procedure required five different empirical shift factors for each material. These shift factors show large differences between PPO resin and HIPS and exhibited large deviations from the WLF equation with universal constants. This result suggests that the temperature dependence of the relaxation processes in PPO resin is significantly different from the temperature dependence of HIPS relaxations. Flow activation energies computed from the viscosity data for PPO resin are much higher and more shear sensitive than those calculated for HIPS. The computed relaxation spectra clearly display the effect of long‐time relaxation mechanisms associated with PPO molecules when compared to HIPS. The 35–65 blend exhibits general rheological compatibility with material parameters and responses intermediate between PPO resin and HIPS. This result is indicative of a high degree of segmental mixing for the two components in the blend.

For individual cases we have to decide between primary cells, secondary cells, and fuel cells. Primary cells provide power needs for up to a few weeks and also serve as spare (reserve) batteries. Since 1960 the advanced alkaline silver oxide-zinc batteries have been developed with a specific energy of 350 W h/kg, and during the last ten years the non-aqueous lithium battery has become a potential competitor with a specific energy of 450 W h/kg. Secondary batteries will in the future continue to be the most important electrochemical energy source. We can distinguish between first (conventional), second (new) and third (non-aqueous) generations. At present, the classical NiOOH/Cd battery is the only rechargeable system for use with solar cells in missions requiring long life (5 - 10 years). Among the new systems, the best appears to be the hermetically sealed NiOOH/H2 battery. We expect a high-cycle life ({slanted equal to or greater-than} 10 000) and high energy density (up to 65 W h/kg). It will probably be introduced around the year 1980. All the non-aqueous lithium and sodium storage systems are still under development either in the single cell or the laboratory prototype stage. For projects involving manned space flights the direct H2/O2 fuel cell will continue to be in wide practical use. At present the power density is 50 - 70 W/kg and the maintenance-free lifetime for alkaline systems is 2 000 - 3 000 hours. © 1979.",,"ELECTRIC BATTERIES - Applications; SPACECRAFT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018441788

With either metallocene, the data accurately fit a body centered orthorhombic unit cell. A structural model consistent with the observations is proposed, based on a simple shift of alternate FeOCl layers by one-half unit cell in the [101] direction (a-c diagonal) accompanied by the interlayer expansion. There is no evidence for ordering within the metallocene layers. The intercalation of ferrocene is especially significant because its first ionization potential (6.88 eV) is substantially higher than those of organometallic compounds previously intercalated into transition metal dichalcogenides. © 1979.",,"CRYSTALS - Structure; ENERGY STORAGE; INTERCALATION COMPOUNDS; ORGANOMETALLICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018440780

Using these materials as accelerators, it is possible to formulate long‐life, one‐component epoxy resins. From gel time data, Arrhenius plots were made for some of these phosphonium compounds, and results indicate low activation energy values of the order of 16.1 kcal/mole. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the effectiveness of these phosphonium compounds as latent accelerators. The initiation mechanism probably involves the formation of hydrogen‐bonded phosphonium–epoxy or phosphonium–anhydride complexes which rearrange on the application of heat to form activated species resulting in polymerization of the epoxy–anhydride components. The transfer of a proton from the phosphonium complex(es) to other epoxy or anhydride molecules would appear to be the rate‐determining step in this initiation mechanism. Comparison of other well‐known accelerators used for the anhydride cure of bisphenol A epoxy resins shows quaternary phosphonium compounds to be among the most effective accelerators disclosed to date.

ZLC, Baden, Switzerland","Braun, M.J., BBC Brown, Boveri & Co Ltd., Dept. ZLC, Baden, Switzerland","Within 40 years the world will be depending heavily on three energy sources, which are all badly suited for distribution and consumer use. Load levelling and storage are uneconomical with nuclear power and especially with solar energy. With the exception of coal they are, however, clean and environmentally acceptable for large-scale use. The solution to this problem is to use a secondary energy-carrier system, which has to be able to connect economically scattered consumer locations to their supply centres. It will also have to provide a means of storage to smooth out demand and supply and also be compatible with the end-user requirements. Hydrogen is compatible with future energy sources, with other secondary energy carriers as well as with most end user requirements. This means it can easily be produced from water, the original energy being derived from either fossil fuels, e. g. nuclear, solar, geothermal, wind etc. Hydrogen energy can be transformed into electricity by fuel cells or generators coupled to gas turbines as well as regenerated from electricity by water electrolysis. It can be burned to yield hot water for district heating. End users can get electrical, mechanical, chemical or thermal energy from hydrogen by using fuel cells, internal-combustion engines, turbines, chemical reactors or burners. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas (bottled or underground), a liquid (cryogenic tanks) or in a solid form (metal hydrides). It can be distributed by the conventional and partly existing infrastructure of today's natural gas transportation and distribution pipe system with only minor modifications. The introduction of hydrogen as a main energy carrier is more an economic than a technical problem. Being a secondary energy carrier hydrogen will always be more expensive than the primary energy sources from which it has to be produced. It will play a major role only after the oil and gas era, which means after the year 2000. The earliest breakthroughs will occur in countries with no or few fossil energy resources and which have to turn to nuclear and solar energy first. After the year 2020, hydrogen will become a major energy carrier in many parts of the world.",,"FUELS - Storage; Hydrogen fuels; hydrogen; energy consumption; environment; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018437120

The first model is based on a three‐dimensional formulation of the governing equations for geothermal reservoirs. Since the resulting two partial differential equations, posed in terms of fluid pressure and enthalpy, are highly nonlinear and inhomogeneous, they require numerical solution. The three‐dimensional numerical model uses finite difference approximations, with fully implicit Newton‐Raphson treatment of nonlinear terms and a block (vertical slice) successive iterative technique for matrix solution. Newton‐Raphson treatment of nonlinear terms permits the use of large time steps, while the robust iterative matrix method reduces computer execution time and storage for large three‐dimensional problems. An alternative model is derived by partial integration (in the vertical dimension) of the three‐dimensional equations. This second model explicitly assumes vertical equilibrium (gravity segregation) between steam and water and can be applied to reservoirs with good vertical communication. The resulting equations are posed in terms of depth‐averaged pressure and enthalpy and are solved by a two‐dimensional finite difference model that uses a stable sequential solution technique, direct matrix methods, and Newton‐Raphson iteration on accumulation and source terms. The quasi‐three‐dimensional areal model should be used whenever possible, because it significantly reduces computer execution time and storage and it requires less data preparation. The areal model includes effects of an inclined, variable‐thickness reservoir and mass and energy leakage to confining beds. The model works best for thin (<500 m) reservoirs with high permeability. It can also be applied to problems with vertical to horizontal anisotropy when permeability is sufficiently high. Comparisons between finite difference and higher‐order finite, element approximations show some advantage in using finite element techniques for single‐phase problems. In general, for nonlinear two‐phase problems the finite element method requires use of upstream weighting and diagonal lumping of accumulation terms. These lead to lower‐order approximations and tend to obviate any advantage of using the finite element method. This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

Due to the increasing water demands of the area, additional backpumping of the surplus runoff from the LEC area into the Conservation Areas has been considered as one of several alternative plans. The Receiving Water Quantity (EPA, 1971) model has been adapted and modified to be applicable in the Conservation Areas to investigate the possible impact of additional inflow under various backpumping cases. The modification of the model included Manning's roughness coefficient, depth of flow, width of hypothetical channels through marsh areas, rainfall input, seepage rate, etc. The use of the Monte Carlo technique for area computations was found to be easy and time saving both in area and weighting rainfall input to each node. Comparison of results generated by this modified model with the recorded values in Conservation Areas 1 and 2A indicated that the model not only can be a very good evaluation tool to simulate the hydraulic regime of the Conservation Areas system but also a proper tool for investigating the impact of additional inflow resulting from the backpumping related to the water use planning and management.

In Section I, we briefly introduce the topic and then provide a summary of the current operating characteristics of electric energy production and delivery (EEPD) systems. Section II places load management in the context of the broader set of energy management strategies available to EEPD systems. The organization and rationale of the paper is then explained. In Section III, we review the set of communication/control technologies available or under development for use in the implementation of load management in EEPD systems. We provide an assessment of the relative attractiveness of alternative technologies, a brief summary description of a major field demonstration being jointly funded by EPRI and DOE, and two examples which illustrate the state of the art in modern two-way systems. In Section IV, we review the conventional approach to U.S. electric rate design, describe the current national Electric Utility Rate Design Study, review some important basic ideas of microeconomics, explore the subject of price elasticity of demand, examine the basic ideas underlying marginal cost pricing, discuss some of the practical difficulties of implementing time dependent rates, briefly examine some foreign rate design experience, and conclude by summarizing a number of U.S. rate design experiments sponsored by NSF and by FEA (now DOE). Section V is devoted to an examination of the problems of finding manageable loads in the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. Particular attention is given to the development of thermal storage systems for water heating, space heating, and space cooling. Section VI is devoted to summarizing a number of studies which have attempted to assess the short- and long-term economic impacts of load management. The state of the field is such that few definitive cost/benefit statements can be made at this time. A number of potential social impacts are discussed and some broad regulatory policy guidelines are suggested. Finally, in Section VII, we highlight conclusions reached in the five preceeding sections, and identify a number of research and policy needs.

This increase was due to an increased level of AMP in the cell. It is thus suggested that intracellular solutions maintain adenine nucleotide concentrations by preventing catabolism of AMP, thus keeping more AMP available for rephosphorylation after restoration of the blood supply.

The most important conclusion drawn is that the risk to human health from nonconventional sources can be as high as, or even higher than, that of conventional sources. This result is produced only when the risk per unit energy is considered, rather than the risk per solar panel or windmill. The risk from nonconventional energy sources derives from the large amount of material and labor needed, along with their backup and storage requirements. Risk evaluation is a relatively new discipline, and therefore the results presented here can be considered only a beginning. However, society should keep relative risk in mind when evaluating present and future energy sources.

The placental transfer of substrates depends upon the placental permeability to the substrate and upon the difference of concentration of the substrate in maternal and fetal blood. The fetus uses the substrates for 3 purposes: synthesis of new tissues (growth), oxidative metabolism and building of energy stores. Since the O2 consumption per Kg of body weight is relatively constant among the different species, the partitioning of substrates in anabolic and catabolic pathways is related to the rate of fetal growth. Glucose and lactate account for a large part of the exidative needs of the fetus, but amino acids catabolism plays also an important role. During maternal starvation, ketone bodies can be used as oxidative substrates by the fetus of monogastrics. The fetus has a low capacity to oxidize free fatty acids, even in species in which the placental transfer of these substrates occurs rapidly. Free fatty acids are used as precursors of complex lipids or are stored in fetal adipose tissues or liver. Several recent observations suggest that gluconeogenesis could occur in the fetus of ruminants, and thus could allow the transformation of lactate and amino acids into glucose before utilization by individual tissues of the fetus (brain, skeletal muscle, heart). The hormones secreted by the fetus have been shown to play an important role in inducing the storage of glycogen in fetal liver (glucocorticoids and a pituitary hormone) and the accumulation of triglycerides in fetal adipose tissue (insulin).",,"amino acid; glucocorticoid; glucose; insulin; lactic acid; triacylglycerol; endocrine system; fetus; short survey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018409417

Following addition of collagen, thrombin, or arachidonic acid to washed platelets, O2 consumption and aggregation was measured concurrently. In contrast to thrombin and arachidonic acid, collagen induced a calcium-dependent O2 burst after a lag phase of 25-35 sec. Elevation of platelet cAMP levels completely inhibited the oxygen burst and aggregation response. Blockade of energy metabolism also prevented the oxygen burst; however, the aggregation response was not completely suppressed. Eicosatetraynoic acid and indomethacin, inhibitors or arachidonic acid oxygenation, also abolished the collagen induced O2 burst but not aggregation. These findings indicate that the platelet O2 burst is utilized for formation of prostaglandin endoperoxides, which are apparently not essential for collagen induced aggregation. Comparison of the oxygen consumption and aggregation curves elicited by arachidonic acid in the presence of increasing amounts of ADP scavengers demonstrated the obligatory participation of released ADP in aggregation induced by this fatty acid. Stored platelets did not exhibit an oxygen burst when challenged by collagen or thrombin, although the aggregation response was relatively intact. In contrast, addition of arachidonic acid to stored platelets elicited both an O2 burst and aggregation, suggesting that phospholipase A2 activity, or steps leading to its activation, are more liable to storage than the platelet cyclooxygenase. It is concluded that concurrent comparison of oxygen consumption and aggregation responses permits a direct evaluation of the role of endoperoxide formation in human platelet aggregation.",,"prostaglandin; blood and hemopoietic system; human cell; in vitro study; oxygen consumption; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte metabolism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018373633

TC remains almost constant between 12-21 months, during which period the average thigh fatfold decreases by almost two mm.

The dietary components are utilized to replenish and augment glycogen and fat stores in the body. Excessive carbohydrate is also converted to lipid in the liver and stored along with the excessive lipids of dietary origin as triglycerides in adipose tissue, the major fuel storage depot. Amino acids in excess of those needed for protein synthesis are preferentially catabolized over glucose and fat for energy production. This occurs because there are no significant storage sites for amino acids or proteins, and the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds is ill tolerated. During fasting, adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and kidneys work in concert to supply, to convert, and to conserve fuels for the body. During the brief postabsorptive period, blood fuel homeostasis is maintained primarily by hepatic glycogenolysis and adipose tissue lipolysis. As fasting progresses, muscle proteolysis supplies glycogenic amino acids for heightened hepatic gluconeogenesis for a short period of time. After about three days of starvation, the metabolic profile is set to conserve protein and to supply greater quantities of alternate fuels. In particular, free fatty acids and ketone bodies are utilized to maintain energy needs. The ability of the kidney to conserve ketone bodies prevents the loss of large quantities of these valuable fuels in the urine. This delicate interplay among liver, muscle, kidney, and adipose tissue maintains blood fuel homeostasis and allows humans to survive caloric deprivation for extended periods.",,"fatty acid; glycogen; insulin; ketone body; nitrogen; acid base balance; animal; basal metabolic rate; diet; diet restriction; energy metabolism; female; gluconeogenesis; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; review; urine; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Gluconeogenesis; Glycogen; Insulin; Ketone Bodies; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018369047

In this method, the mitochondria are fortified with bovine plasma albumin and dimethyl sulfoxide, a cryoprotective substance. They are quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a liquid-nitrogen refrigerator at −196°C. Studies have suggested that mitochondria are one of the lists of biological materials that can be successfully preserved for prolonged periods.

The area compressibility modulus and the elastic shear modulus, which together characterize the surface elastic behavior of the membrane, have been measured over the temperature range of 2–50 degrees C with micropipette aspiration of flaccid and osmotically swollen red cells. In addition, the fractional increase in membrane surface area from 2–50 degrees C has been measured to give a value for the thermal area expansivity. The value of the elastic shear modulus at 25 degrees C was measured to be 6.6 X 10(-3) dyne/cm. The change in the elastic shear modulus with temperature was -6 X 10(-5) dyne/cm degrees C. Fractional forces were shown to be only on the order of 10–15%. The area compressibility modulus at 25 degrees C was measured to be 450 dyne/cm. The change in the area compressibility modulus with temperature was -6 dyne/cm degrees C. The thermal area expansivity for red cell membrane was measured to be 1.2 X 10(-3)/degrees C. With this data and thermoelastic relations the heat of expansion is determined to be 110–200 ergs/cm2; the heat of extension is 2 X 10(-2) ergs/cm2 for unit extension of the red cell membrane. The heat of expansion is of the order anticipated for a lipid bilayer idealized as twice the behavior of a monolayer at an oil-water interface. The observation that the heat of extension is positive demonstrates that the entropy of the material increases with extension, and that the dominant mechanism of elastic energy storage is energetic.

These results suggest that these nutrients are mainly oxidised and that processes involving an elevated metabolic cost, such as lipid synthesis, play a minor role. The ingestion of an isocaloric load of amino acids induced a small thermic effect (4.4% of the energy content of the load in 2 h). This effect is probably related to a low rate of protein synthesis or amino acid catabolism and an absence of tissue deposition. The small thermic effect observed suggests that a significant part of the load is not metabolised or channeled into protein synthesis. In term infants the weak thermic effect after amino acid and the failure of glucose and lipid to stimulate metabolism may possibly be analogous to the lack of post-prandial thermic effect reported in non-growing children suffering from malnutrition.

The use of solar energy in thermal form raises the problem of the temperature at which it is collected. The sun is comparable to a black body radiating at 6000 degree K, and if degradation of its energy is to be avoided it should be collected at as high a temperature level as possible. This can be demonstrated by making a thermodynamic analysis of an endothermic process which in fact only requires a low-temperature heat delivery (t less than 200 degree C).

The pressure response of the reservoir is evaluated by consideration of those parameters that define the flow resistance and the air storage volume. The thermal behaviour of the reservoir is characterized by consideration of thermal cycling within the vicinity of the wellbore and by the growth of a thermal pillar surrounding the wellbore. The potential impact of residual water on both the pressure and thermal response is evaluated. Results of the analysis are interpreted to characterize the behaviour of the reservoir under conditions of daily air cycling.

The analysis includes appraisal of thermodynamic losses of each component and approximate allowance for gas property variations. Approximate capital costs of each components is estimated. Generation costs are calculated via a present worth analysis as a function of electricity and fuel costs, capital charge rate, generation and storage periods and cycles parameters. Results for air storage systems are compared with those of advanced-concept gas turbines for peak load power. Compressed air storage with a recuperated gas turbine is economically superior under all conditions considered, to the equivalent conventional (recuperated) gas turbine. So is the unrecuperated gas turbine storage system with thermal energy storage. However, thermal energy storage and recuperation are not cost-effective together, if both are used for turbine preheating. Whether the thermal energy storage system is competitive with the recuperated system depends strongly on whether the incremental cost or the base load cost is assigned the the value of the electricity consumed during the storage phase. With electricity assessed at incremental cost from a nuclear-fired plant, the analysis shows that the unfired gas turbine storage system would be economically competitive, as long as thermal energy storage in water at temperatures as high as 200SUPC is feasible. This is so despite overall storage efficiency (kWh out/kWh in) of the order of 50%. (A).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018330290

The constraints are imposed by the physical characteristics of the subsystems, by interaction among the subsystems and by the interfacing requirements imposed by the utility. To illustrate the concepts, models for the system comprising the compressor train, piping, and an aquifer reservoir have been used in the optimization procedure. Results from these studies show that substantial reductions in capital cost and total operating cost can be achieved using optimization techniques. © 1979.",,"AQUIFERS - Mathematical Models; COMPRESSORS - Mathematical Models; ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS - Energy Storage; OPTIMIZATION - Applications; PIPING SYSTEMS - Mathematical Models; Compressed air",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018325297

The sandstone cores were subjected to various combinations of the following independant variable magnitudes: temperature (50-300SUPC), pressure (60-120 bars), time (0.5-2.0 mo), oxygen content (0-21 percent), carbon dioxide content (0.0-0.1 percent), humidity (0-100 percent), and autoclave type and stirring frequency. Three humidity conditions were simulated: (1) dry air, (2) air-water vapor, and (3) air-vapor-liquid,. Pre- and post-test measurements were made for gas permeability, liquid permeability and friability. Temperature, humidity, and time were discovered to be the dominant independent variables. Dissolution of silica and carbonate cements is considered to be the primary contributor to observed friability and permeability increases in cores treated at elevated temperature in a liquid and/or vapor environment. The lack of confining stress and high liquid-to-solid volume ratios are also considered to be significant contributory factors. The average change for air and liquid permeabilities was approximately 30+ or !10 percent for all conditions tested. The average increase in the 'friability' index was 150 percent.

The nature of such loads can be expected to be as diverse as their applications. The pulsed power demands and corresponding reactive volt-amperes requirements are undesirable from the frequency and voltage fluctuation standpoint, even for the large utility power systems. Techniques for supplying large dc-pulsed loads from a relatively small size ac generator by means of inductive storage and the capacitor commutated converters are presented. A theoretical basis is provided for analyzing the converters which serve to minimize the effects of pulsed power and corresponding reactive volt-amperes. Energy transfer between the storage inductor and the pulsed load is permitted with minimal loss, at a readily controllable rate including the reversibility of power in case of inductive loads. Use of a simple control scheme is shown to provide a precise load voltage regulation which may be a requirement for certain applications. The greatest use of theseI circuits would be in supplying loads with pulse durations of a few milliseconds to many seconds or minutes.

The flywheel energy storage system will consist of a solid rotor, synchronous inductor-type flywheel drive machine electrically coupled to a DC battery electric propulsion system through a load commutated inverter. The motor/alternator unit is coupled mechanically to a small steel flywheel which provides a portion of the vehicle's accelerating energy and regenerates the vehicle's braking energy. The laboratory simulation of the electric vehicle propulsion system will include a 108 volt lead-acid battery bank, a separately excited DC propulsion motor coupled to a flywheel which simulates the vehicle's inertia, and the flywheel energy storage system comprised of the motor/flywheel unit, the load commutated inverter and its control.

The method is particularly useful in examining the economics of devices with short lifetimes and can be employed whenever a device lifetime can be expressed as a function of physical parameters which are related to the manner in which the device is used. Given a detailed description of the pattern of use of the device in the application, the device lifetime can be calculated. The economic consequences of changes in lifetime result from the dependence of the capital recovery factor on device lifetime. It is shown how analyses can be made of changes in technical performance characteristics or changes in the pattern of use of the storage device to determine their effects upon the annual cost of energy storage and to determine minimum cost systems. © 1979.",,"ELECTRIC BATTERIES, SECONDARY - Energy Storage; OPTIMIZATION - Applications; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018313575

Several cubic-meter sized test-boxes have been constructed that incorporate basic elements of passive-solar design: glazings to admit solar radiation, good thermal insulation, and large thermal storage capacity within the insulation-envelope. The experimental thermal behavior of these text-boxes has been accurately computer simulated using weather and solar radiation data inputs, and correlated with the performance of large passive test rooms nearby. Similar small test boxes can be constructed to perform as thermal models of a particular passive-solar building design, by normalizing the appropriate thermal design parameters to one critical parameter, such as south-facting glazing area, or building floor area. Thus a thermal model will not resemble a scaled architectural model of the building, but will be distorted in appearance so as to exhibit thermal behavior similar to the real building. For a particular passive-solar building design to be located at a given site, a small thermal model of the building can be constructed and placed at the site to investigate possible micro-climate effects, such as a south-facing slope or nearby trees. The use of small passive-solar test-boxes complements simulation analyses of the influence of macro-climate and geometry on the performance of passive solar heated buildings. The accuracy and limitations of using small test-boxes to predict passive-solar building performance are discussed. © 1979.",,"BUILDINGS - Space Heating; ENERGY UTILIZATION; SOLAR ENERGY; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018309204

One of the reasons is that a synchronous motor drive can be made self-commutating so that the inverter becomes equivalent to a conventional phase-control bridge converter without large commutating components. The drive to be controlled consists of an inductor alternator coupled to a flywheel that will be used for temporary energy storage. The flywheel speed will vary over a two-to-one range;thus full performance can be achieved using a load-commutated inverter. A simple auxiliary commutating circuit is provided only for initial starting. The drive must operate both from a fixed dc voltage source (battery) and from a variable dc voltage source (dc motor), as it is intended for use in a battery-powered vehicle for load leveling. The load-commutated inverter consists of two bridges connected in parallel so as to provide two-way power flow by reversing the dc current. The control system described does not use shaft position sensing, but senses the motor terminal voltage and the ac line current to determine the motor internal operating conditions. This control method maintains the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) turn-off time as a constant percentage 1 of the period of the generated back electromotive force (EMF) as speed and current are varied during operation. The inverter turn-offtime is thus maintained by feedback control rather than the use of special function generators. A 20-kVA laboratory development drive system has been built and successfully tested using this control strategy. A hybrid computer simulation of the drive and control system hasbeen implemented, and the results are described.

The basic thermodynamics of ideal single- and two-stage adiabatic CAES is reviewed. Generic single-stage and two-stage types are discussed, and efficiency and mass flow rate as a function of storage pressure and stage pressure ratios are investigated. The performance and cost of available turbomachinery for the single- and two-stage adiabatic systems are given in detail as the basis for evaluating sixteen candidate near-term single-stage and two-stage designs. Both excavated caverns and abandoned mines are considered for storage reservoirs. Two scenarios are considered regarding joint application of CAES and Solar Thermal Energy (STE) systems. One is based on providing local CAES storage for STE systems, other on providing solar-augmentation to adiabatic CAES installations. Both solar-heated thermal storage and fuel firing are considered for provision of necessary backup during bad weather. Solar-heated heat-topping of adiabatic CAES is also considered, but rejected as an unattractive technology. The economics of all these systems is ranked on the basis of delivered busbar energy cost for three different charging energy costs. The adiabatic systems are compared to fired systems to determine the breakeven cost of fuel which yields the same busbar energy cost. An economic comparison with pumped hydro and peaking gas turbines is also given. Recommendations for future development of this technology are presented.

Preconceptual designs and cost estimates are provided for several TES systems that might be suitable for CAES applications. A ranking of these options according to costs indicates that pebble beds are likely to be most economical for CAES. The performance analysis indicates that the potential turbine fuel savings in a hybrid system with TES are minimal compared with a similar conventional cycle with recuperation. The conclusion is that the value of turbine fuel saved is unlikely to balance the anticipated additional cost of compression energy and the higher costs of the TES system.

When the power is needed by the utility, the compressed air is fed to an aboveground gas turbine, where it is heated with petroleum-based fuels prior to expansion. Pacific Northwest Laboratory is investigating advanced CAES concepts that minimize or eliminate the use of petroleum-derived fuels by storing the compression heat in Thermal Energy Storage (TES) chambers and using that thermal energy to heat the air on its way to the turbine. Most of these concepts are technically possible. The purpose of this study was to determine under what conditions these concepts are economically competitive with conventional oil-fired CAES systems. The incremental costs of electricity for the advanced CAES systems are tested for their sensitivity to changes in base-case parametric values. The results of this sensitivity analysis show that the incremental costs are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the additional capital costs for new or advanced design components in the TES systems. The incremental costs do, however, exhibit a marked sensitivity to the differential between compression energy and turbine fuel costs. In the event that this differential becomes large enough, as it might for utilities with excess low-cost base-load electricity and with continued rapid escalating fuel costs, it is concluded in this study that advanced CAES systems using TES can be economically competitive with conventional CAES systems.

For thermal energy stored during off-peak periods, two applications considered were electric peak power generation, and thermal transport to serve process heat demands and district heating systems. An initial screening of many proposed concepts selected four for conceptual design as peaking power systems. Two were based on hot rock and oil as the dual storage media. The other two stored high temperature water (HTW) under pressure: a prestressed cast iron vessel (PCIV) was used in a feed water storage configuration and underground storage in an excavated cavern in a peaking turbine configuration. Levelized annual cost components of electric power with these TES systems were compared with baseline conventional plants used in a load following mode, and with cycling coal plants of comparable capacity' Transmission of thermal energy for up to 50 km was compared for HTW, hot oil, molten salt, and steam, over their applicable temperature ranges. The complementary advantages of thermal energy storage and transport included a high capacity factor on the transmission pipeline and separation of demand peaks by the user from the most economic dispatch of both electricity and thermal energy by the utility.

At present about 23% of the world's electricity supply is from hydro plants. Since all the new energy sources under development are mainly exploitable through electricity generation, it seems likely that the world will have to move increasingly to an electricity-based energy regime. To make an effective contribution to new energy supply patterns. hydro power could be exploited by the development of small generating units to meet local community needs, by the use of pumped storage to optimize operation of other energy sources, and by the development of the many remaining sites in remote areas and third world countries with high power potential including perhaps glacier-derived power. This last development could spawn a new energy trade which would require a transfer of manufacturing resources to the countries with hydro power. Political decisions and economic considerations will influence these developments. An effective electric power trade between countries requires an acceptable international code of practice. Ultimately the speed of development of these resources will depend upon the cost of energy delivered to the consumer compared with the cost of other energy sources closer to the load centre. © 1979.",,"hydroelectric; ENERGY RESOURCES; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018297997

The three combined systems are the series system in which the solar storage is used as the source for the heat pump, the parallel system in which ambient air is used as the source for the heat pump, and the dual source system in which the storage or ambient is used as the source depending on which source yields the lowest work input.

Both theoretical and experimental investigations of heat transfer in geothermal systems are reviewed. A qualitative understanding of the large-scale convection processes in a geothermal reservoir and the prediction of reservoir behavior under production can be obtained by idealizing it as a saturated porous medium. The identification of a viable geothermal reservoir and the estimation of its capacity remain major problems in the utilization of geothermal resources. Thermal anomalies in geothermal areas can be detected by surface manifestations, aerial infrared surveys, geochemical analyses, or exploratory drillings. Many of the analyses are applicable to a wide range of engineering problems whenever they can be idealized as convection in a porous medium. These include the problems of the secondary recovery of oil by thermal methods, the use of fibrous materials for thermal insulations, the design of aquifers as an energy storage system, and the deposition of mineral ore in the subsurface formation.

This paper is a review of a program which has been under way at the University of Wisconsin since 1970. Early work between 1970 and 1976 was primarily involved in proving economic and technical feasibility of the concept The present program deals with component development and detailed design ultimately leading to construction of a large superconducting magnet capable of storing 1000-10,000 MWh. The magnet is a single-layered segmented solenoid of approx. 100 m radius. Energy containment is achieved economically by burying the magnet underground in bedrock tunnels. Magnetic loads are transmitted from the conductor to bedrock through glass fiber reinforced composite struts. The conductor consists of a composite of aluminum and NbTi and is designed for full cryogenic stability in 1.8 K superfluid helium. The dewar-conductor assembly will be rippled in a l m radius of curvature to reduce the hoop stress tension. A Graetz bridge is required to convert the d.c. superconducting current into a.c. current in the three-phase power system. Economic analysis indicates that superconductive magnetic energy storage is competitive with alternative large scale storage schemes for units greater than 1000 MWh size. © 1979.",,"ELECTRIC INVERTERS - Applications; INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS - Analysis; SUPERCONDUCTING CABLES - Applications; GRAETZ BRIDGE; SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017955446

The performance of such storage beds is examined when the thermal properties of sandstones are modified so as to adjust the permeability towards an optimum in order to reduce pumping power. The thermal properties of consolidated St. Peter sandstone, dispersed St. Peter sand, and pelletized St. Peter sand are measured by several techniques. A nondimensional computer model for beds bounded by a constant temperature water table is employed to estimate the influence of thermal property manipulation of storage system performance. Disrupting the sandstone permits a substantial increase in the volume efficiency and first and second law efficiencies. Pelletizing sand into particles of approx. 1 mm diameter permits marginal further increases in performance. Disruption of the consolidated sandstone reduces the thermal diffusivity and increases the permeability.

It has been found that membranes containing salts of polystyrenesulfonic acid, plus polyvinyl alcohol, show excellent promise for such electrical storage purposes. The electrets are formed by heating the membrane to above its glass-transition temperature (typically 60-90 °C), placing it in an electric field (in our case, by use of a 22.5 V dry cell battery) and cooling the membrane back to room temperature within the field. It is found that the membrane, typically 0.005-0.010 cm thick, will retain a potential difference of about 2.5 V. These membranes differ from the usual electrets in that they are not really dielectrics. Whereas typical dielectric electrets might have conductivities of the order of 1014 (Ω-cm)-1, the polyelectrolyte electrets have conductivities of the order of 10-9 (Ω-cm)-1 or even higher. The charge is stored by orientation of dipoles within divergence elements, probably of a semi-crystalline nature, scattered throughout the membrane. The charge storage is stable and, if the membrane is stored with the faces shorted, will last indefinitely. The electret can be discharged by connecting the two faces to an external circuit and heating the membrane to above the charging temperature. Alternatively, electrets can be discharged by use of ultraviolet light, though we have not attempted this method as yet. Using thermal discharge, we have measured charge storage capacities of the order of 1 C/g. Using our present system, we foresee no difficulty in increasing charge storage capacity by an order of magnitude or more, thus making the system comparable to lead-acid or mercury storage batteries. © 1979.",,"ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY - Measurements; ELECTRIC MEASUREMENTS - Charge; MEMBRANES - Applications; POLYELECTROLYTES - Energy Storage; POLYELECTROLYTE ELECTRETS; ELECTRETS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017955419

The principal components of the facility are the coil/cryostat assembly, the helium refrigerator-liquefier/compressor system, and the gaseous helium recovery and storage system. The epoxy impregnated, layer wound main background field coil generates 8 teals within its 40 cm diameter bore. The insert background field coil was layer wound with cooling channels provided by “barber pole” mylar conductor insulation. Ten tesla is generated within its 22 cm bore. The initial performance of the facility will be discussed. Future testing calls for operating test coils with implanted heating elements to simulate mechanically induced perturbations. The normal zone growth and recovery behavior will be observed for various disturbance energies.

The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory has undertaken a study to show how such coils can be constructed. This program includes both theoretical and experimental phases. The work is based to a large extent on the experience gained during the fast discharge (1 ms) magnetic energy transfer and storage (METS) program. A series of experiments in which a typical ohmic-heating current waveform is simulated have been undertaken using the 300-kJ, 10-kA METS superconducting coil, a 500-kW, 250-V, 2-kA dc motor generator set used as a capacitor, and a rectifier power supply. The coil has undergone full bipolar flux swings to greater than rated current (+ 12-kA, 430 kJ) and remained superconducting. The commutator dc machine has functioned successfully as a capacitor up to 12 kA. We describe the test circuits and discuss the components. Terminal characteristics are presented.

Solenoids with constant tension are achieved by changing the spacing between conductors in the axial direction. Multilayer solenoids are designed so that the tension in the different layers is the same as the required design value. This design value is chosen to make the conductors remain in tension.

Impetus for this research is the Wisconsin Superconductive Energy Storage magnet system, which proposes to be operated at 1.8 K. A survey of steady state heat transfer in He II is presented in the context of magnet stability. In addition, new results from an experiment to study the transient response of He II show substantially better heat transfer than that of normal helium (He I). For example, a step-unction application of heat flux at a rate of 2 W/cm2 can be absorbed by the helium for about five seconds before film boiling begins. This time delay is caused by the required temperature rise of the He II adjacent to the hot spot. A comparison between the enthalpy rise in the helium and the applied energy shows a close correlation.

The novel feature of the CAES power plant is the uncoupling of the compressor and turbine sections of the gas turbine so they can be operated during different time periods. This uncoupling permits air to be pressurized and stored during periods of off-peak demand. During periods of peak demand the air would be released from storage, mixed with fuel in a combustion process, and expanded through the turbine generating electric power. A potential long-term weakness of the conventional CAES power plant concept is its reliance on clean petroleum fuels. The consumption of petroleum could be completely eliminated, how-ever, by replacing the oil combustor by a coal-fired fluid bed combustor (FBC). This paper presents the highlights of an ongoing program to assess the technical and economic feasibility of advanced concepts of generating peak-load power from a CAES power plant using fluid bed combustion. The specific elements that are addressed in this paper concern the fluid bed combustion and turbomachinery technologies, with emphasis on the review and assessment of technology, parametric characterization relative to FBC/CAES power plant systems, discussion of component availability, and assessment of R&D requirements.

Measurements were performed of threshold photoelectron spectra, photoionization spectra, and of photoelectron energy spectra. The latter were obtained from photoelectron time of flight distributions at selected wavelengths. The results suggest that autoionization in the Franck-Condon gap between the X̃ 2Π and the Ã 2Σ + states of N2O+ proceeds via two distinct mechanisms. The major autoionization process (≈90%) produces the X̃ 2Π state in its low vibrational levels, while a resonant autoionization path (≈10%) produces vibrationally excited X̃ 2Π ions.

Absolute differential cross sections have been obtained using the split-field magnet detector facility (SFM) at the five standard energies for integrated luminosities ranging from 0.3 to 4.9 (pb)-1. The rising total cross section is found to define a scale for diffractive phenomena near the forward peak, including the position of the diffraction minimum near t = -1.4 GeV2. The cross section at the minimum is strongly energy dependent, approximately as the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction. The phase of the scattering amplitude is found to change sign near the minimum. The component of diffraction scattering beyond the second maximum has a much weaker t-dependence than expected in simple eikonal or constituent pictures connecting this region to the forward peak.

A summation of the food requirements for both the initial and recent populations of whales in the southern hemisphere indicate that whales are major oceanic consumers.

These cobalt catalysts gradually lose some of their activity upon repeated recycling. This loss in catalytic activity apparently arises from partial oxidation, since the loss of catalytic activity can be partially restored by treatment with a strong reducing agent such as titanium(III). The apparent activities of these catalysts are increased if the catalyst is finely powdered, thereby suggesting diffusion limitation of the catalytic activity.

Given input information such as plant capacity, forced-outage rates, scheduled maintenance requirements, and economic data for individual generating units, the program uses hourly utility load data together with synoptic weather data to simulate system loads and costs for specified levels of heating/cooling technology penetration. The program performs five categories of calculations: Simulation of residential load, aggregation and propagation of loads through the distribution and transmission subsystems, economic dispatch of generating plant, scheduling of plant maintenance, and calculation of optimal generating plant mix. Originally designed to study the impact of shifting on-peak demand to off-peak periods through the use of customer-owned thermal storage, the code has been extended to handle a variety of electric heating and cooling technologies. The computer running time for a full set of calculations is short, allowing many system alternatives to be examined at low cost. Results are presented for residential space conditioning systems for two representative utility service areas. In the service area supplied by a winter peakin Z utility, the lowest cost space heating technologies were found to be storage-augmented either by storage or by an oil furnace.

There are two main ways of exploiting these sources. In the first a back-up supply is provided. Thus, with solar water heating, it is customary to rely on electrical immersion heaters or boilers burning gas, oil or solid fuel to supplement the solar energy input during the winter months and at other times when the insolation level is low. It is generally accepted that large wind generators would feed their electrical output into the national grid. On windy days the output would reduce the amount of electricity generated in conventional power stations, thereby saving fuel. The installation of a wind or solar power plant by itself, however, will save little, if any, conventional generating capacity, as there can be no guarantee of significant wind or solar generation at times of peak demand. The second way of exploiting renewable energy sources is to couple them with some form of storage. If the storage capacity is sufficient there is a guaranteed output from the renewable energy source plus storage system at the times when it is required. Ryle1 has suggested that a form of storage is available in connection with wind power.

He found2 that a fundamental insight into the physics of such processes may be obtained by considering that the ratio of the energy dissipated to the energy stored in these materials per radian of sinusoidal excitation is a constant which does not change over a very wide range of frequency. This observation, the so-called 'universal dielectric response', has been derived by examining the behaviour of dielectric loss in the frequency and time domains, and tentatively modelled in terms of a partial screening mechanism 2-4. Here we shall discuss Jonscher's work within the context of earlier work, and it will be shown that the presence of a loss peak in the frequency domain, or a change in the slope of the double logarithmic time-domain graph, need not require the two consecutive processes in the material that have been thought to be necessary1,4. Subsequently, the clarified 'universal dielectric response' is used to interpret various empirical loci on the complex permittivity plane, Cole-Cole5, Davidson-Cole6 and Williams-Watts7-9 plots, and to compare these loci with the simple Debye form in terms of the behaviour of a single 'storage parameter', s, replacing Jonscher's n and m and the previously physically uninterpreted α of Cole and Cole and β of Davidson and Cole. © 1978 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849153554

The macrophage is highly phagocytic, often motile and sensitive to chemotaxis and contains a variety of intralysosomal digestive enzymes. The surface carries receptors for the Fc end of the immunoglobulin molecule and for complement. Macrophages in inflammatory lesions derive over hours or days via the circulating monocyte from an identifiable rapidly dividing marrow precursor; monocyte production may be under humoral control. Some division of macrophages may occur peripherally. The process of phagocytosis is energy-dependent; cytoplasmic motility is related to contraction of actin filaments. Macrophages in different sites are a family of cells with basic similarities and some differences. Their functions include phagocytosis, both in inflammatory lesions, and clearance of blood and lymph; secretion of a variety of locally or systemically active substances; presentation of antigen to the immunologically competent cell; and removal of excess antigen. They also affect the reaction to neoplastic cells and iron and lipid metabolism. They are the dominant cell in chronic granulomatous inflammations and storage diseases and themselves may rarely become neoplastic either within or outside the lymphoreticular system.",,"etiology; histiocyte; histology; macrophage; reticuloendothelial system; short survey; Animal; Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity; Chemotactic Factors, Macrophage; Granuloma; Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell; Human; Iron; Kupffer Cells; Langerhans Cells; Lipids; Lymphoma; Macrophages; Monocytes; Neoplasms; Phagocytosis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018233493

During one part of the day food is consumed at a rate in excess of immediate metabolic needs, and the surplus is stored to support metabolism for the remainder. Le Magnen and Devos1, for example, have shown a predominance of lipogenesis in the night-time feeding period of the rat, and pronounced lipolysis during the day, when little food is consumed. A variety of metabolic adaptations exists to match this discontinuous pattern of food intake with relatively constant metabolic use of nutrient2, but the question remains whether the hyperphagia at one time of day produces these changes or is a consequence of them. Le Magnen suggests the latter3, at least in the case of increased night-time meal frequency, and in models of feeding, such as that of Toates and Booth4, an increased rate of metabolic clearance of food at night is a considerable factor in promoting increased food intake. On the other hand, eating at a high rate clearly will promote metabolic changes, as bunching of the normal daily intake into a very short period will lead to increased weight gain5. A compromise possibility is that a greatly increased rate of feeding at dusk rapidly promotes metabolic changes subsequently favouring a high rate of feeding in the ways suggested by previous authors. The results reported here suggest that such a mechanism may operate in the feeding of mice, in that a great increase in feeding rate around the onset of darkness produces changes in carbohydrate metabolism which may both favour storage of energy and tend to increase subsequent food intake. © 1978 Nature Publishing Group.",,"insulin; animal experiment; circadian rhythm; food intake; glucose blood level; mouse; Animal; Blood Glucose; Circadian Rhythm; Energy Metabolism; Feedback; Feeding Behavior; Insulin; Mice",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018141607

Estimates are obtained for the efficiency of production of CdHg*, which has potential as an energy-storage medium for the amplification of light pulses at 470 nm. A time-independent analysis using a Boltzmann code was performed on a Cd, Hg mixture with an argon buffer. Seven atomic levels were considered in both Cd and Hg. A very high efficiency is obtained for excitation of the Cd(3P0,1,2) manifold from which the CdHg* excimer forms. The optimum E/N value for the mixture Cd : Hg : Ar=1 : 4 : 20 is 8×10-17 V cm2. The small value of the calculated Townsend coefficient at this E/N value required the consideration of an electron beam as the primary source of ionization. A detailed kinetic model was constructed which included electronic transition rates three-body association rates, dissociative recombination, biexcimer mixing, and biexcimer quenching. The kinetic equations were solved using the time-dependent solution of the Boltzmann equation for the electronic distribution function with a source term to account for the production of slow secondary (∼1-eV) electrons by ionization collisions of the fast (∼100-keV) primary electrons from the sustainer electron beam with the neutral atoms of the gas mixture. The effects of superelastic and inelastic collisions were explicitly included in the evaluation of the distribution function. In the case of a Cd : Hg : Ar mixture of 1 : 4 : 20 and Cd density of 5×1017 atoms/cm3, 40% of the discharge energy was deposited after 1 μsec into the molecular manifold of CdHg*.

Previously neglected, another consideration - bias field distortion in the neighborhood of the crossing - is discussed here. Poles induced by the bias field on a Permalloy element shaped to conform to a conductor produce field components parallel and transverse to the nominal bias. In traversing an isolated crossing at right angles to the conductor length and at a fixed altitude within the magnetic garnet, one calculates for the distortion bias maxima near the conductor edges and a minimum at the center. To obtain a tractable solution for the bias field as a function of coordinates a two-dimensional model was chosen for the conductor crossing: an infinite half space of infinitely permeable Permalloy with a circular depression. At points infinitely removed from the depression which houses the conductor the complex field H=Hx+jHy=jH0; that is Hx vanishes and Hy assumes the value H0 of the nominal bias field. Near the conductor centered at x=0, however, Hx is generally not zero, Hy(0,y) &lt;H0, and Hy(x,y) exhibits a minimum at x=0 for fixed y. Using this model to calculate the bias in the vicinity of a 4-μm wide, 0.5-μm thick conductor, one finds for the bias field, averaged over a 3-μm thick garnet film, extremal values of 0.952H 0 and 1.007H0. For current materials with H 0?150 Oe the local bias reduction is 7.5 Oe. Because bubbles reside at the edges of Permalloy features, the field perturbations encountered in practice will be smaller than predicted by this model. Were there no forces on a bubble other than those associated with the coordinate dependent bias, a domain situated between maxima would move to the bias minimum and be trapped there. As designers strive for greater information density, this aspect of the conductor crossing problem may assume greater importance because of difficulty in linear scaling of conductor dimensions and the use of materials with higher bias requirements.",,"DATA STORAGE, MAGNETIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017942337

Leicester, Newman and Wright2 have recently analysed wind data and empirically derived heating demand over a six-month period. On the basis of these data they suggest that short-term (∼150 h) storage is inadequate to provide a reasonably reliable supply from wind generators for heating purposes. This conclusion has been criticised by Diesendorf and Westcott3 and, in view of the limited data sample used it is clear that a more extensive analysis is required. Here we use hourly wind and temperature measurements over a 17-yr period (data obtained from the Meteorological Office, Bracknell) to investigate the performance of a simple system in which wind power is used in conjunction with 150-h thermal storage to provide domestic space heating. The results are promising, even for this basic system, and confirm that, with some modifications, such a system can provide adequate reliability. A significant result of this analysis has been to indicate the importance of selecting an appropriate value for the wind speed at which the wind turbine is to produce its peak output (the 'rated' wind speed).

In the present report the release of endogenous glutamate and the levels of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) has been measured in parallel experiments on slices from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. A Ca-dependent release of glutamate is evoked by tissue depolarization caused either with electrical field stimulation or with elevated KCl. Electrical stimulation induced a transient increase in tissue NAD(P)H levels, the increase being inhibited by approximately 50% during Ca-free conditions. KCl stimulation, on the other hand, produced a long-lasting decrease in NAD(P)H, the decrease being halved in the absence of Ca.

At various times samples were removed, erythrocytes isolated and the susceptibility of the erythrocyte membrane lipids to non-lytic concentrations of phospholipase C from either Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens tested. The morphology of the cells at various times and the release of microvesicles from the erythrocytes were also assessed. Initially the cells were attacked very little by the phospholipases at the concentrations chosen, but their susceptibility increased markedly after about 2 weeks, stabilised until 5 weeks, and then increased again to approach a nearly stable value after 8-10 weeks. The first rise accompanied the conversion of most of the cells to crenated and echinocytic configurations and was reversed if cells were incubated in a 'rejuvenating' medium designed to restore their energy supplies. The second rise occurred during the period when the cells underwent extensive microvesiculation and eventually became spherocytes: this phase involved, in particular, an increase in availability of phosphatidylethanolamine for hydrolysis by phospholipase C and was not reversed by attempts at 'rejuvenation'. When microvesicles released from the cells were harvested and their phospholipase susceptibility compared with that of the residual cells it was found that the microvesicles were the more susceptible. These changes in phospholipase susceptibility presumably reflect subtle changes in membrane organization that occur during storage and vesiculation of erythrocytes; the possible nature of such changes is discussed. © 1978.",,"phospholipase c; bacillus cereus; blood and hemopoietic system; clostridium perfringens; erythrocyte membrane; human cell; normal human; Bacillus cereus; Clostridium perfringens; Erythrocyte Aging; Erythrocyte Membrane; Erythrocytes; Human; Membrane Lipids; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Phospholipases; Phospholipids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018076073

Copper leads plated with 0.73 μm of gold were studied. Arrhenius plots were constructed and extrapolated to expected storage conditions. A storage life of greater than 2 a at 50°C is predicted for both properties. The time to loss of solderability is given by ts = 1.6 x 10-7 exp(0.8 eV/kT) h and the time to loss of bondability by tB = 4 x 10-10 exp(1.0 eV/kT) h. The effective activation energies 0.8 and 1.0 eV compare with 0.91 eV for the grain boundary diffusion of copper through gold. Loss of solderability and loss of bondability were modeled as a two-step series event. First the copper diffuses to the gold surface via its grain boundaries. The copper then oxidizes.

These two approaches will ultimately be related, but the former requires more information for specific predictions. The latter can provide predictions based on selected criteria for regulation.Meal sizes and feeding frequencies of hummingbirds are examined relative to two regulatory, criteria: maximizing rate of net energy gain and maximizing efficiency (intakes/expenditures) through a ""crop emptying"" model that incorporates energy intake from food and energy expenditures for short-term (meal to meal) maintenance and longer-term (overnight) energy storage. Experimental results suggest that the feeding behavior of hummingbirds is differentially sensitive to short-term and daily uses of energy. Changes in overnight energy storage requirements result primarily in changes in meal size, while changes in meal to meal maintenance requirements result primarily in feeding frequency changes. The economic models predict these responses. The feeding behavior of hummingbirds also appears to be sensitive to food quality, time spent flying to and from a food source, and costs associated with the weight of ingested food. © 1978 American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042511896

A kangaroo hopping above a certain speed appears to consume less oxygen than a quadrupedal mammal, of similar weight, running at the same speed (Dawson & Taylor, 1973). This is thought to be achieved by storage of elastic energy in tendons and ligaments. 2. Energy can be stored in a tendon by stretching it, but only if the muscle fibres in series with it are stiff enough to resist most of the length change. We have measured length and tension changes in the contracting gastrocnemius muscle of the wallaby Thylogale during rapid, controlled stretches, and from this determined the amount of movement in muscle fibres and tendon (method of Morgan, 1977). 3. When the muscle was developing close to its maximum isometric tension, up to eight times as much movement occurred in the tendon as in the muscle fibres. This is made possible by the wallaby having a long and compliant tendon. 4. Measurement of work absorption by the muscle with a full length of free tendon and when the tendon had been shortened, showed that with the shortened tendon a larger proportion of movement occurred in the muscle fibres, producing a steep rise in work absorption by the muscle and a consequent increase in energy loss. © 1978 The Physiological Society",,"animal; article; elasticity; energy metabolism; kangaroo; locomotion; marsupial; muscle; muscle contraction; physiology; tendon; animal experiment; energy; jumping; muscle stiffness; oxygen consumption; Animal; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Kangaroos; Locomotion; Marsupialia; Muscle Contraction; Muscles; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018196391

During the development of various high energy density solid-state batteries we noted that the solid electrolyte material, LiI dispersed in large surface area Al2O3, has a high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures, (for example 0.1Ω-1 cm-1 at 300° C) and is suitable for high-rate storage battery applications. In solid-state battery systems both the electrodes and electrolytes are in the solid state under the operating conditions of the battery. The absence of any liquid phase makes the individual cell containers unnecessary in a multicell battery resulting in a simplified battery structure and increased package efficiency. Furthermore, no material compatibility problem is encountered in the system. As a result, the solid-state battery system has excellent charge retention characteristics and a long projected operating life. Solid-state test cells, Li-Si/LiI(Al2O3)/TaS2/Ta, Li-Si/LiI(Al2O3/TiS2/Ti and Li-Si/LiI(Al2O3)/TiS2, Sb2S3, Bi were constructed and subjected to discharge-charge cycle tests at 300±10° C, at 13·7 mA cm-2. Preliminary test results demonstrated that these solid-state battery systems are rechargeable and may be suitable for both load levelling and/or vehicle propulsion. From the considerations of material availability and cost and operational efficiencies it was concluded that the Li-Si/LiI(Al2O3)/TiS2, Sb2S3, Bi system is most suitable among the three systems studied for the development of practical storage batteries. Preliminary design studies showed that practical energy densities of 200W h kg-1 and 520 W h l-1 can be realized with the Li-Si/TiS2, Sb2S3, Bi storage batteries. © 1978 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,"SOLID STATE STORAGE BATTERIES; ELECTRIC BATTERIES, PRIMARY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018019364

This test was designed to determine the general validity of these values. ""Critical velocity"" is defined as that velocity, below which no penetration of the skin occurs. A series of 212 test shots was fired after the powder storage chambers of caliber 9 mm and caliber .45 cartridge cases were altered. With the appropriate charges, velocities varying between 50 and 100 m per sec were achieved. The shots were fired orthogonally into the muscle tissue of the upper thigh of corpses and into a combination of human skin + Mipoplast®. The skin was tightened in a wooden frame and a block of Mipoplast® was directly attached. (Preliminary tests showed that projectiles nearly had the same penetration power in Mipoplast® as in muscle tissue.) The projectile velocities were determined by a ""shoot-velociter Re-Tronik"" with a resolving power of 10-6 sec. Projectiles were considered as having penetrated the skin, when they entered the epidermis for a distance equal to the caliber diameter. In order to determine a ballistic coefficient and a conversion factor, the depth of penetration into muscle tissue of the upper thigh or into Mipoplast® respectively was measured. The following bullets were used in the tests: 9 mm :lead ball 5.3 g lead, round nose projectile with a short cylindrical portion, 6.2 g lead, round nose projectile with a long cylindrical portion, 10.6 g conical, flat nose projectile 7.9 g conical, pointed nose projectile 7.9 g caliber. 45 : lead ball 9 g lead, round nose with a cylindrical portion, 14.7 g and finally a 4 nun lead ball. 47 g. The projectiles were fired from a Walther pistol P 38, caliber 9 mm Parabellum, a colt pistol, Government 1911 A1, caliber .45 ACP and from a revolver Röhm RG caliber 4 mm Rdz. The tests results permit three functional evaluations per series: (1) optimum parabola of second order, (2) optimum line (linear regression), (3) logarithmic function (log. nat.) The following results were obtained: The penetration power of a projectile does not depend primarily on its velocity, shape or cross-sectional load, but is determined by its mass. The following conclusions could be drawn, concerning lead projectiles fired by us: The greater the mass of a projectile, the lower the ""critical velocity"" (vcr = 162.1 • e-629 m) The conversion factor for the penetration power of the examined projectiles comparing skin/Mipoplast® and skin/muscle tissue was determined to be 1.2, i. e. the depth of penetration into skin and muscle tissue is 1.2 times greater than into skin + Mipoplast ®. An evaluation of these results shows a ""loop-hole"" in the Gun Control Act, since the legal requirements for the unrestricted acquisition of firearms only considers the kinetic energy of the projectile (less than 7.5 J). However, all lead ball ammunition with diameters of less than 6.2 mm definitely does penetrate the skin at that energy level. Another conclusion is that projectiles fired from unlicensed weapons such as BB guns operated by air pressure, spring or CO2-cartridge (caliber approx. 4.5 mm) can achieve penetration with as little energy as 4 J. Even if one wants to maintain the present differentiation between exempted weapons and weapons covered by the Gun Control Act, based on the energy level of 7.5 J, the legislature would have to establish a minimum mass for the projectiles. Considering the results obtained, the present limitation of the kinetic energy of the projectiles of 7.5 J alone does not guarantee the level of harmlessness the present law supposes. A projectile mass of less than 1.4 g and a kinetic energy of 7.5 J can reach a level of danger that up now has not been recognized by the legislature. Those findings ought to be considered when licensing weapons according to Para 21 and 25 WaffG (Gun Control Act of the Federal Republic of Germany) as well when prohibiting weapons according to Para 37 WaffG and Para 8, Section 1, Number 1, of the first WaffV (Weapon Regulations). © 1978 Springer-Verlag Berlin • Heidelberg.","Penetration power, of spherical or ogival projectiles; Projectile velocities; Shot, penetration power of bullets","ballistics; bullet; forensic medicine; legal aspect; methodology; muscle; skin; theoretical study; Cadaver; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Muscles; Physics; Skin; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018185236

The [3H]norepinephrine accumulated by synaptosomes was low in neonates, but reached adult levels by 15 days of age. In contrast, development of [3H]norepinephrine uptake into isolated rat brain storage vesicles was not complete until 38 days of age. Kinetic analysis of the developing vesicular uptake mechanism revealed no change in Km, while maximal uptake increased progressively from birth to maturity. Storage vesicles from immature and adult rats exhibited similar energy requirements for uptake as determined by their dependence on ATP-Mg2+ concentration; furthermore, the degree of inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake by other amines was the same in both vesicle preparations. Thus, storage vesicles isolated from adult and developing rats display an in vitro [3H]norepinephrine uptake mechanism with properties that are kinetically and pharmacologically similar. The results suggest that, while the number of storage vesicles in the central nervous system increases during development, those vesicles that are present possess a fully functional amine uptake system. © 1978.",,"adenosine triphosphate; noradrenalin; dopamine; harmaline; metaraminol; radioisotope; serotonin; age; animal; article; brain; cell count; growth, development and aging; in vitro study; kinetics; metabolism; organ weight; rat; synapse vesicle; synaptosome; animal experiment; brain; central nervous system; noradrenalin h 3; ontogeny; rat; synapse vesicle; synaptosome; Adenosine Triphosphate; Age Factors; Animal; Animals, Newborn; Brain; Cell Count; In Vitro; Kinetics; Norepinephrine; Organ Weight; Rats; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Synaptic Vesicles; Synaptosomes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018198098

The essential components of the technique are a synchrotron, an electron energy analyzer, and an ultra-high vacuum chamber (10-10 torr) in which the sample is prepared, characterized and measured. The experiments are made possible by a new focussing and tunable spectrometer recently constructed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Project, where fluxes of the order of 1011 photons/mm2 are obtained. With spectrometer of this type coupled directly to a storage ring and with a more complete capability for monochromatizing all photon energies, the SEXAFS technique should allow one to study all adsorbates with atomic number greater than carbon at atom averages as low as 0.1 to 0.01 monolayers. © 1978.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349121728

The characteristics of hypothalamic thermosensitivity in three chipmunk species, Eutamias speciosus, E. amoenus, and E. minimus, were determined at three ambient temperatures (Ta) by manipulating the temperature of the hypothalamus (Thy) with chronically implanted, water-perfused thermodes while continuously measuring metabolic rate. The proportionality constant (α) for the metabolic heat-production (MHP) response to manipulations of Thy was high in all three species. E. minimus had a higher hypothalamic thermosensitivity than E. amoenus and E. speciosus. In all three species the threshold Thy for the MHP response (Tset) increased with decreasing Ta (Figs. 1, 2; Table 1). 2. Thermoregulatory responses during and after experimentally induced whole-body and hypothalamic hyperthermia were examined in the three species at Ta=30 °C. Body temperatures (Tb) of free-living animals in natural habitats were measured with implanted thermosensitive transmitters. The tolerance to induced hyperthermia differed among the three species. E. minimus would allow Tb to rise as high as 41.9 °C before activating heat-loss mechanisms, while E. speciosus and E. amoenus would not tolerate Tb's above 40.4 °C. Following bouts of hypothermia, E. minimus and E. amoenus would allow Tb to fall considerably below the normally-regulated levels. E. minimus reached Tb's about 0.75 °C lower than E. amoenus and 2.1 °C lower than E. speciosus during these episodes of hypothermia (Figs. 3, 4). 3. It is hypothesized that the ability to tolerate hyper- and hypothermia is an adaptation used by E. minimus and E. amoenus to remain active during the day in hot, arid environments. Calculations based on an energy-budget equation show that in heat-stress conditions E. minimus can remain active longer than the other two species and that E. amoenus can remain active longer than E. speciosus (Fig. 6; Table 2). The significance of these differences for the distributions of the animals in nature is discussed. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344051601

In this paper we consider standard wigglers i.e. wigglers in which interference effects on the spectrum of synchrotron radiation are not important. In standard wigglers the spectrum of synchrotron radiation has the same general shape as the spectrum from ring bending magnets. However, the critical energy of the wiggler spectrum may be different. The critical energy of the wiggler spectrum is given by: εCW = ε{lunate}CB BW BB, where ε{lunate}CB is the critical energy from the bending magnets and BW and BB are the magnetic field strengths of the wiggler magnet and bending magnets respectively. Since most electron storage rings operate with relatively low bending magnet fields (BB≲12 kG), even a modest wiggler magnet field (≈ 18 kG) can significantly increase the critical energy. Such magnets are planned for ADONE and SPEAR. Higher field ≈ 45 kG) superconducting magnets are planned at Daresbury and Brookhaven to produce due to the superposition of the radiation from the individual poles. Wiggler designs are discussed the spectrum is produced due to the superposition of the radiation from the individual poles.

The storage ring is to be a dedicated Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) devoted to experiments in all fields of science using ultraviolet and X-radiation. Construction has now started and completion is planned for late 1979. The new source will be installed in existing buildings built to house the 5 GeV electron synchrotron NINA, which ceased operation on 1st April 1977 and is now being removed. The field in the normal bending magnets is 1.2 T, and the initial objective is a circulating beam current of 500 mA. It is planned to raise this later to 1 A. The storage ring will provide intense fluxes of photons up to about 20 keV from normal ports and up to 100 keV from 5 T superconducting transverse 3-pole wiggler magnets, of which two are planned. Up to 12 beam ports are envisaged, of which six to eight should be in operation by 1983. Detailed plans for the first six ports are now being prepared. Beam lines up to 80 m long will be available for X-ray topography experiments. The VUV lines are being designed to give best possible access for experimenters, free from hazard from high energy bremsstrahlung. Injection is from a 600 MeV synchrotron, itself fed by a 15 MeV linear accelerator. All major components of the injection system have beem ordered and completion is planned for May 1978. Detail design of the storage ring is now in progress; prototypes are being tested of the 500 MHz rf cavity, a special multipole magnet, the dipole magnet vacuum chamber (with beam port and backward tangent recess) and other components. Development of the control system is well advanced and it will be used for commissioning the injection system.

Use of powerful synchrotron radiation will allow to achieve generation of lasers in the high-energy part of the spectrum. Estimations of possible pumping of wide bandgap crystals (made for NaCl) show that such generation may be obtained with the help of synchrotron radiation of storage rings VEPP in Novosibirsk. The usage of VEPP-3 will allow to achieve a pumping density twice over threshold. Specific power of such a generation in regime of free generation will be about 103 W / cm3. The wide fluorenscence line of proposed active media will make it possible to achieve powerful ultrashort impulses in the VUV-region and tunable generation. Other possible active media for lasers with synchrotron radiation pumping are also discussed. Active media for UV and VUV lasers are intensively explored nowadays. The possibilities of pumping these lasers by powerful synchrotron radiation are discussed. An active medium must be able to absorb pumping radiation, must be transparent for radiation at the wavelength of generation and must be stable under radiation, etc. It will be rather useful to use solid active media, because they have several merits, such as great partial density of energies, convenient use, etc. But, up to now, there are no solid state UV and VUV lasers. So the first task is to look for such active media, which will be luminescent in the UV and VUV regions. Such media are large bandgap crystals with luminescence emission in the ultraviolet region. The possibility of achieving ultraviolet luminescence of large bandgap crystals is currently explored with electron beam1,2) (giving a high density of excitation) or X-ray sources3,4). Vacuum ultraviolet luminescence of crystals of rare gases was also explored with synchrotron excitation. Recently, excitation of luminescence of several crystals was achieved with the help of VUV-lasers6,7) which allow to achieve high densities of excitation in the region of fundamental absorption. Later, we shall report about the exploration of UV and VUV luminescence of crystals pumped by powerful VUV laser, about the observation of luminescence of crystals of oxides, pumped by powerful X-ray synchrotron radiation and we shall give estimations of achieving laser generation from large bandgap crystals, pumped by powerful X-ray synchrotron radiation.

The main difficulty in performing these experiments lies in the selection of the small rate of resonant quanta in the gross SR beam flux. For instance, Ires/Itot for the intrinsic width of the 57mFe Mössbauer level is of the order of 10-14. In the present paper an experimental arrangement is proposed and investigated which provides: &amp;#x02022; - preliminary monochromatization of SR by Ge monocrystals; &amp;#x02022; - suppression of the coherent background using a purely nuclear reflection at hematite single crystal α-57Fe2O3; &amp;#x02022; - suppression of the coherent and non-coherent background resulting from both SR beam high-extent polarization and the use of reflection angles on hematite close to 2θ = 90°; &amp;#x02022; - reduction of the non-coherent background by means of analyzing crystal upstream the detector. Electronic units applied provided selection of the energy spectrum range needed, measurement of the Mössbauer spectrum and time distribution. Preliminary results of the measurements are presented. The properties of the synchrotron radiation (SR) give rise to a hope on feasibility of the direct excitation of low-lying (Mössbauer) nuclear levels and hence on performance of a series of rather interesting experiments on investigation of the time dependence of the resonant diffraction. To perform such an experiment without SR one has to design ultra-rapid choppers* and superintense sources. For instance the SR beam brightness on existing electron storage rings in quantum energy range of 10-30 keV in the bandwidth equal to that of a Mössbauer level amounts to ≈ 1011 photons/cm2 sec sr1), while under the same conditions brightness of the most powerful source (≈ 0.1 Ci/mm2) is 2 × 109 photons/cm2 sec sr. To carry out a time-resolving experiment with a conventional source chopping of the quantum flux is needed thus reducing the mean brightness by a factor of ≈ 100. In contrast to that time distribution of the SR intensity in storage rings (e.g. 1 nsec pulses spaced by 0.1-1 μsec intervals) fortunately suits these experiments**. 57Fe seems to be an optimum Mössbauer isotope with respect to a sum of characteristics for first experiments. © 1978.",,"ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON - Applications; SYNCHROTRON RADIATION; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017496830

Superconductive magnets have the potential of becoming an economically desirable alternative to pumped hydro-storage, particularly in areas where topography and water conditions do not favor hydroelectric plants. Superconductive magnets are circular solenoids which develop high radial and axial forces when charged. Bedrock must be used for the support structure of large units. Our current program calls for the design of doughnut shaped tunnels, with a perimeter of at least 100 m in diameter, and a cross-section of 5 × 15 m to 5 × 40 m, which will accommodate 10,000 MWh systems. The conductor would be attached to the bedrock by fiberglass-epoxy struts; insulation would reduce any cooling of the surrounding bedrock. Because of the stiffness of the conductor and its support structure, only limited radial deformations of the bedrock are allowed. In addition, because of the adverse effects of water on the conductor, inflows must be eliminated entirely. The development of site criteria is based on integration of detailed geotechnical field investigation and finite element analysis. The site evaluation program is being applied to locating potential areas for a plant to be constructed in southern Wisconsin. © 1978.",,"UNDERGROUND CAVERNS; POWER PLANTS - Site Selection; TUNNELS AND TUNNELING; SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS; environment; nuclear safety; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017955103

Cinematographic techniques were utilized to calculate the mechanical energy states as described by Norman et al. (1976), using a 13 segment mechanical model of a runner as the basis for the computations. The data showed that both the kinetic and rotational energy increased parabolically but the potential energy decreased linearly with increases in running velocity. The calculated power of the positive work phase increased quadratically with running speed. During the phase when the runner was in contact with the ground, the applied calculations gave similar increases for the positive and negative works, and the power ratio (Wneg/Wpos) stayed the same at all measured speeds. Therefore, it is likely that the method used to calculate the various mechanical energy states did not reflect accurately enough the physiological energy costs at higher running speeds. It may, however, be quite acceptable for estimating the mechanical energy states during walking and slow running, in which case the role of negative work is less and consequently the storage and utilization of elastic energy is small. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.","Mechanical energy; Positive and negative work; Running mechanics; Work efficiency","athlete; human cell; model; nonbiological model; normal human; running; work; Biomechanics; Efficiency; Exertion; Human; Male; Mathematics; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017834648

Water in the compensating cavern absorbs air and, if left pressurized over a period of weeks, will become saturated at cavern pressure. As the saturated water rises through the vertical shaft during operation, air is released from the water when the pressure decreases from cavern to atmospheric pressure. The rising bubbles expand and the two air/water mixture accelerates upward. Since the pressure head of the water/air mixture is less than the head of an equivalent depth of water, which is the initial cavern pressure, water in the cavern can continue to be pushed out the shaft until the cavern is completely emptied. Analytical models have been developed to study this two phase flow process and determine key operating parameters. Based upon use of these models, design, and operational strategies to prevent this cavern blowout have been defined. These include installation of a U-bend trap, flaring the vertical shaft, and oversizing the cavern. (A)",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096889280

However, the goal is neither report writing nor data storage, but the enhancement of contacts and communications among members, so as to accelerate and improve the development of methods and equipment for coal production. Extensive contacts are sought in Government, R&D organizations, equipment manufacturing and user industries . Somewhat over $ 300 Mill/year are being spent on driving and cutting R&D. The rate of improvement of some component's performance has been 2.5 to 5% per year. However, the concurrent cost benefits have been overtaken by inflation. In contrast to the highly efficient, fully mechanized winning techniques in the coal industry, the drivage of roads is still far too expensive, and the rate of advance can inhibit the timely development of new coal production units. The main obstacle in the way of drivage improvement is a better understanding of rock mechanical properties and its reduction to practical terms and conversion to mechanized equipment. This view is borne out by recent investigations which showed that on the Continent the largest proportion of time (almost 50%) in conventional drivage is taken up by support emplacement. Therefore, the transfer of technology in rock mechanics from the researcher to the engineer is becoming an urgent priority for R&D. It is apparent that international cooperation can provide means of engaging the complementary strength of different camps. A sharing in development efforts is presently being pursued between the major coal producing countries. © 19th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics, USRMS 1978.

On the infernal level, local optimums are explored by optimization method applied to one-point reactor models, with the interaction variables among the subcores tentatively set at arbitrary values. On the supremal level, the interaction variables are searched by an iterative gradient-type procedure that aims at equalizing the local optimums with the overall optimum. Compared with straightforward optimization using the Generalized Newton Method, the two- level scheme has the advantage of reducing both computer time and computer storage needed for the optimization, as demonstrated by examples of actual computation covering coupled core reactors with either two or six cores. This merit further tends to as the number of subsystems. © 1978, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

The Water Resources Research Institute of Auburn University has performed an aquifer storage experiment involving warm water (97°F; 36°C). The objectives of the experimental program were to begin actual testing of the concept of heat storage in aquifers and to provide data for calibration of mathematical models describing the simultaneous transport of water and heat. Phase I consisted of drilling an exploratory well at the selected field site near Mobile, Alabama. Phase II involved construction of the central injection well, three observation wells, and performance of preliminary pumping tests. Phase III was devoted to construction of the remainder of the observation well field, performance of final pumping tests, and measurement of aquifer thermal properties; while Phase IV was devoted to a cycle of warm‐water injection, storage, and recovery. It was concluded that heat storage aquifers must have low natural pore velocities, and care must be taken not to clog the injection well with solids or precipitated chemicals. Swelling of clays in the storage formation must be minimized, and hydraulic pressures capable of breaching the confining layers must be avoided. Mechanical and chemical clogging problems may be minimized by using formation water as influent to the heating system. For a 36‐day storage of 2 million gallons, the calculated energy recovery factor of 0.69 was considered promising. Future research should be directed toward experimental studies involving larger volumes of water and high‐injection temperatures. Study should be directed also to the geochemistry problem and the effect of high temperatures on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of clay confining layers. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

During the past several years, such models have been developed in the U.S. Geological Survey and in other institutions and have been tested by comparing computed results with analytical solutions. To more completely assess the performance of these simulation models, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Energy Research and Development Agency co‐funded Auburn University to conduct a field experiment of heat storage in an aquifer near Mobile, Alabama. The data collected during the experiment were analyzed, and a simulation model of the aquifer system was constructed. Simulation of the experiment history indicates that the model can satisfactorily reproduce the observed behavior of the system. Heat capacity of the aquifer matrix and anisotropy of the aquifer permeability were found to be significant system parameters. An extensive evaluation of parameter sensitivity was not possible because experimental problems resulted in some unreliable data, but the utility of numerical models for simulating thermal energy storage in aquifers was clearly demonstrated.

The part which is not returned as mechanical energy is dissipated as heat. The “rebound resilience” is defined as the ratio of the energy returned to the energy applied for deformation by an indentation due to a single impact. In this experiment, a pendulum mass and a test piece, as long as they are in contact, may be considered an oscillating system having one degree of freedom in which the rubber is a Voigt model. The correlation between rebound resilience and loss angle of the rubber may thus be derived. The measurement of the contact time between pendulum indentor tip and rubber surface, in addition to the rebound resilience, allows calculation of deformation, speed and acceleration of the damped sinusoidal motion. The penetration of the spherical indentor under a constant force depends on Young's modulus. Scott found an empirical relationship among force applied, depth of indentation, radius of the indentor tip and the modulus. This relationship has been recently improved by Stiehler and coworkers, The Stiehler formula has been used here for evaluating the storage modulus of rubber vulcanizates by using the maximum force transmitted by the impacting mass and the indentation depth of the test piece at the same time.

Ascorbic acid degradation rates were satisfactorily described by first‐order kinetics and were dependent on water activity and temperature. Rate constants obtained for the model system stored with a large excess of oxygen (303 cans) were compared with those reported previously for the case of limited gaseous oxygen (TDT cans). At all conditions of temperature and water activity the degradation of ascorbic acid was greater for the condition of excess oxygen (303 cans). This effect is interpreted as reflecting the consumption of oxygen dissolved in the moisture of the product and the continuous dissolution of excess molecular oxygen present in the 303 cans. The significance of this oxygen effect is further manifested by the change in activation energies for RAA and TAA destruction at 0.1 aw from 7.0 kcal/mole limited oxygen to 10.7 kcal/ mole in excess oxygen conditions. These data suggest that dissolved and gaseous oxygen are primary factors in the storage stability of ascorbic acid in dehydrated food systems. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

The effects of the microreversible back‐reaction on the net yield of the storage process and on the stability of the products are discussed. It is shown that the inevitable losses of photon energy in the conversion process may be estimated and considered as roughly independent of the threshold frequency of the system. The best attainable conversion efficiency as a function of the threshold absorption wavelength may then be estimated. Rough calculations show an ultimate efficiency of about 20% with the optimum threshold wavelength in the range 600–800 nm. Photochemical production of fuel, like hydrogen from water, requires that more than one photon of the solar spectrum is used per product molecule formed. The low photon density of sunlight leads to troublesome stability requirements on the intermediates in the reaction mechanism.

Redistribution and regulation are essential. Aquifer systems – groundwater basins – can provide a share of the future cyclic storage regulation. There are some differences in management concepts in using a full basin in comparison with a partially dewatered basin. Legal, water quality, and physical impacts on aquifer systems, including subsidence, are concerns. Storage may be for the benefit of overlying water users or for distant areas. Extraction during dry periods or recharge methods will require careful planning. Existing rights and uses and equitable treatment of all parties must be assured. Financial compensation may be involved. Changes in methods of operation or degree of self‐determination by affected water agencies will require committed watermanship to resolve. Legislation or amendments to organic acts may be needed but much can be accomplished within existing statutes. Environmental impacts which can be avoided by not using large surface storage sites are important. Energy for pumping will be a key consideration. About 40 percent of California is underlain by aquifer systems. This resource offers major potential in overcoming the maldistribution of natural water resources. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

What are the main deficiency diseases that occur in nutritioal emergencies, and how should they be treated? How does one deal with diarrhoea and dehydration that so often aggravate malnutrition and kill so needlessly? What are the best ways of assessing a population's nutrition status when a relief programme is conducted? What staff is needed to run a residential feeding centre for severely malnourished children? These and many other questions - typical of those that may be asked by health personnel responsible for the field management of operations in severe nutritional emergencies - are answered in this new publication by the World Health Organization. The book is particularly concerned with the relief of mass starvation caused by the interruption of normal food supplies to a population over a long period - for instance, as a result of crop failures, war, or major natural disasters. Intended primarily for the medical and allied personnel from national or provincial health services or from relief agencies who have to deal with such situations, it should also prove invaluable to those concerned with short-term emergency food distribution. In fewer than 100 pages, the authors offer practical information and commonsense advice, illustrated by drawings and diagrams, on a wide range of topics: in addition to covering broad subjects such as the organization of food distribution and nutritional surveillance and the administration of relief camps, they provide a wealth of detail on essential particulars (e.g., the nutrient content of common tropical foods and of the special foods that relief workers may be sent, the criteria for deciding which children urgently need therapeutic feeding, the most important drugs for controlling the communicable diseases that often accompany nutritional emergencies, and how to carry out a simple test to determine whether dried skim mild contains vitamin A). They make no claim to providing pat answers to suit every situation. Some adaptation and improvization will always be needed, and the examples they give, derived from experience, should be helpful in working out local procedures and drafting guides for the on-site training of relief workers in any country.",,"book; emergency health service; environmental sanitation; food storage; immunization; infant; malnutrition; methodology; newborn; nutritional health; preschool child; prevention; school child; therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84972222577

Nandi) (33 per cent DM; 7 per cent soluble carbohydrates; 1.36 per cent M) was studied, and the resultant silage was evaluated chemically, in milk production trials with dairy cows and in digestion trials with dry cows. The silage was well preserved in a chemical sense (pH 4.5; lactic acid 1.7 per cent, volatile acids 1.2 per cent DM; volatile bases 9.8 per cent total N) but, because of the structural rigidity of the harvested grass, air could not be completely excluded even from the polythene-covered vacuum stack. The temperature reached 43¦C in the first week of storage and considerable surface wastage occurred. The silage (DM digestibility 42 per cent, voluntary DM intake 81 g/kg0.75) was of poorer quality than the grass harvested (DM digestibility 54 per cent, voluntary DM intake 84 g/kg0.75) and, even by feeding concentrates, only a low level of milk production could be sustained in (mainly Jersey) cows in the 5th-9th months of lactation. In silage-fed cows given a protein supplement (cottonseed meal) milk production was lower (3.8 kg day-1) but fat content higher (5.4 per cent) than in those given an energy supplement (sorghum grain) or energy plus protein (4.7 kg day-1 and 4.9 per cent fat). When fed lucerne hay and given the same energy plus protein supplement, cows gave significantly more milk (5.7 kg day-1 and 4.6 per cent fat). The poor nutritive value of the silage is attributed to the nature and composition of the material ensiled rather than to any defect in the ensilage process itself, and may be a feature of most silage made from tropical grasses. © 1978 ASEG.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970589047

In particular, we look at the response to constant heat flux, or fixed temperature gradient, boundaries as opposed to constant temperature boundanes assumed in Part I. We also examine the infiuence of an upper boundary with linear combinations of temperature and temperature gradient held fixed. To compare with earlier studies, calculations are done at Prandtl number of 1, Taylor number 105, Rayleigh numbers between 104 and 105, and convection zone depth 20 % of the outer radius. We find that vihen a constant heat fiux boundary condition is imposed at the bottom of the convective layer, equatorial acceleration is produced by Reynolds stresses in the convection for Rayleigh numbers up to 5 x ia4, analogously to the constant temperature bottom case, but over the same range the heat flux differentials in latitude at the top of the layer are greatly reduced. Above this Rayleigh number, equatorial acceleration is converted to deceieration, and a sharp peak in heat tlux out the top appears near the equator. Both effects are shown to be produced primarily by an axisymmetric meridional circulation, which grovis rapidiy in amplitude compared to differential rotation as R is increased. As in the previous convection calculations of the author, the meridional circulation is outward near the equator, and from equator toviard the poles near the outer surface. At small R, this circulation is driven against buoyancy by an outward pointing radial Conolis force associated vrith the equatorial acceleration. At larger R, the circulation becomes driven by buoyancy forces and can modify the diffcrential rotation from equatorial acceleration to deceleration. Experiments with constant heat tlux top as well as mixed top boundary conditions show that certain combinations form larger meridional circulation (particuiarly constant temperature bottom and constant heat flux top) which, in turii. result in more equatorial deceleration. We find that even when the heat flux is fixed at the bottom, its averagc value throughout the layer varies with time up to to%, due to storage and release of energy interna1 to the convecting layer. Tlie time scale for those variations appears to be tlie turn over lime for the convection. Each release of energy is quickly followed by a build up of kinetic energy of convection, but the differential rotation changes more slowly, on a ‘spin up time scale. Various model assumptions and results are discussed in the context of the problem of global convection and diffcrential rotation on the sun. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Assumptions of succession of steady states in the well bore and approximate independence from local unsteady heating or cooling of geothermal gradient appear to be justifiable for reasonably short flow times encountered in storage service.

As the saturated water rises through the vertical shaft during operation, air is released from the water when the pressure decreases from cavern to atmospheric pressure. The rising bubbles expand and the two phase air-water mixture accelerates upward. Since the pressure head of the water-air mixture is less than the head of an equivalent depth of water, which is the initial cavern pressure, water in the cavern can continue to be pushed out the shaft until the cavern is completely emptied. Analytical models have been developed to study this two phase flow process and determine key operating parameters.

Deterioration due to changes in proteins is shown mainly by a loss of extractability of the microfibrillary fraction, changes in enzyme activity and loss of functional properties of the meat such as water-holding capacity, ease of emulsification of the fats, and the ability to form a gel. Long term frozen storage normally results in a marked hardening of the flesh, considered to be due to crossing-over of the fibrillary proteins. However, in species characterised by a low level of protein denaturation, it has not been possible to detect any marked increase in hardness during storage. Since 1951 the author has considered that the properties of proteins in the tissues could be changed or protected by lipids, fatty acids, nucleotide compounds or even by glucides, and that little may be done to avoid deterioration during storage without a better knowledge of the chemistry and physics of muscular proteins. During 25 years many experimental results have been noted on the influence of various factors, depending on the type of frozen muscular tissue as well as the parameters relating to treatment and storage, on the state of proteins in muscles and the quality of the produce. Most of the research dealt with the influence of high concentrations of salts in the meat due to freezing out of water as ice, the break-up of cells of muscle following freezing, mechanical mincing, neutral lipids, fatty acids, oxidation products of lipids, several types of metabloite in tissues compounds, eg formaldehyde from the enzymic breakdown of trimethylamineoxide in fish, and the addition of several antioxidants and hydrophilic cryoprotectors. The type of protein change following freezing and storage in the frozen state is made up from a partial decomposition of molecular and the formation of new primary and secondary linkages. The number and energy of these depend on participation of individual factors of deterioration, the properties of the tissues and also on the parameters of treatment and storage. It is not yet known precisely which microfibrillary proteins take part especially in the reactions which lead to the undesirable changes in the quality of frozen foods, nor how to avoid these interactions.

Urea was added to the straw at feeding at 2.5% of the dry matter (DM) and soya bean meal was given at 0.3% live weight per day in all treatments. Voluntary intake, digestibility and live-weight gain were similar for the two types of treated straw. Intake of metabolisable energy and weight gain decreased with increasing level of straw in the diet, averaging 889 g per head per day for a control diet of grass silage (91.7% of total diet DM), and 749, 550 and 150 g per head per day when the proportion of straw DM to grass silage DM was 33: 66, 66 : 33 and 100 : 0, respectively. Whilst alkali-treated straw cannot replace high quality grass silage with the same nutritional efficiency, weight gains in excess of 500 g/day can be reached if the proportion of straw is less than half the total DM. © 1978.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349120654

Heating scans measure the enthalpy that can be stored and cooling scans yield the enthalpy that may be recovered from the material. Exotherms also provide information about supercooling. The automatic and rapid thermal cycling features of the instrument system can be used to greatly accelerate thermal decomposition that may arise from the daily duty cycle of the storage medium. These chemical reactions, as well as those between the medium and its containment or with substances added to improve performance, can be detected from changes in the thermal spectra. In this study, DSC methods were applied to sodium sulfate decahydrate, paraffin wax, urea, and phthalimide. For Na2SO4 - 10H2O, DSC measurements showed a decrease in heat of fusion with thermal cycling and, also, considerable supercooling; with added Na2B4O7 - 10H2O (borax), supercooling was greatly lessened but not entirely eliminated. Paraffin wax did not supercool nor were there any indications that thermal cycling or contact with aluminum degraded its thermal performance. Urea, when thermally cycled, decreased in melting point and in heat of fusion; this compound also supercooled about 50° in DSC experiments. Phthalimide, C6H4(CO)2NH, did not decompose when thermally cycled through its melting point, but it did exhibit marked supercooling. However, lesser supercooling of urea and phthalimide in test tube-scale experiments suggests that supercooling derived from DSC should be applied with caution. For phthalimide, the enthalpy of fusion, determined in this study, equalled 48.1 cal/g. © 1978.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249125791

The alkaline hydrolysis of I to octadecanol and II (R1 = R2 = H), with III as an intermediate product, proceeds more rapidly in monolayers and in 50% aqueous THF than does that of the water-soluble analogue V (R1 = R2 = C2H5) in aqueous solution. Both the surface pressure-area characteristics and luminescence of monolayers of the surfactant compounds spread on aqueous subphases depends strongly on dissolved anions; even traces of strongly interacting anions such as perchlorate lead to condensation of the films, while luminescence is ~20-fold more intense in the presence of perchlorate as compared with chloride. When the monolayers are transferred to glass slides, the pretreatment of the glass affects the extent of dark ester hydrolysis. Prolonged photolysis of monolayer assemblies on glass in contact with water leads to a slow (quantum yield, ~5 x 10-6) nonhydrolytic degradation of the complex, but to no detectable water dissociation (quantum yield for H2 production, ≤1 X 10-4). © 1978, American Chemical Society.

Apart from conventional techniques, the storage of hydrogen in metal hydrides is considered of interest for a number of applications. To make a metal hydride a suitable hydrogen storage material, it must exhibit certain characteristics concerning in particular: (i) the hydrogen storage capacity, (ii) the dissociation pressure-temperature relationship, (iii) the heat of reaction, and (iv) the kinetics of hydrogen absorption/desorption. All these data can be determined using a microbalance capable of operating at high temperatures and pressures. The principal item of the thermogravimetric installation developed at Battelle-Geneva consists of a Sartorius balance type 4406 equipped with a heatable autoclave. The attached pressure and temperature control systems allow measurements under conditions of constant pressure (10-5 Torr to 60 bar) and temperature (15 to 600°C), as well as the execution of pressure and temperature cycling programs at various scanning speeds.

The loss of storage life was as much as 60% (from 16 to 7 wk) compared with the control samples. It is suggested that the promotion of lipid oxidation in the fish pretreated with microwave energy should be considered as a particularly important factor affecting the quality during frozen preservation.

The elastic constants include: (1) an elastic modulus for volume compressibility, ∼ 10 10-1011 dyn/cm2; (2) an elastic modulus for area compressibility (at constant volume), ∼ 102 dyn/cm; (3) a surface elastic shear modulus for recoverable extension (at constant area), ∼ 10-2 dyn/cm for the red cell membrane and ∼0 for lipid bilayer membranes; and (4) a curvature or bending elastic modulus, ∼ 10 -13-10-12 dyn-cm (erg). Assumed to be volumetrically incompressible, membranes also exhibit a very large resistance to fractional changes in area per molecule or membrane thickness. On the contrary, red cell membranes have a low resistance to shear or extensional deformations, and these membranes are capable of large elastic extensions. Even though red cell membrane shear rigidity is small, the red cell membrane is a solid material for shear resultants less than the yield shear, 2-8 × 10-2 dyn/cm; above the yield point, red cell membranes begin plastic flow, resulting in permanent deformation. The lipid bilayer, however, has no shear rigidity (above the transition temperature) and thus is a two-dimensional liquid. The red cell membrane shear elastic energy storage is in general much greater than the curvature or bending energy. However, for a lipid bilayer and in situations in which membrane force resultants contribute neglibibly, bending rigidity can determine the mechanical stability. The coefficients of viscosity for tlie membrane represent: (1) the energy dissipation produced by finite rates of membrane area expansion or condensation, ∼ 10-7 dyn-sec/cm (estimate); and (2) the energy dissipation resulting from finite rates of extension or shear in the membrane plane, ∼10-4-10-2 dyn-sec/cm for the red cell membrane and ∼10-5-10-3 dyn-sec/cm for lipid bilayer membranes. Associated structural material, e.g., red cell membrane spectrin, or connective tissue strongly influences the membrane dynamic behavior in extension or shear deformation. Continuum mechanical properties are related to the molecular structure and therefore provide direct assessment of the material arrangement. In conjunction with thermodynamic considerations, mechanochemical equations of state and material thermodynamic relations can be investigated. The major difficulties are associated with the mechanical experiments and analyses. In many cases, forces on the order of 10-9-10-6 dyn have to be produced, controlled, and detected; also, observation of the experiment is often limited by microscope resolution or can only be indirectly performed. On top of this, mathematical complexity can obscure the ""physics"" and make the analysis almost intractable. Experiments must be carefully designed to measure the independent material properties of the membrane.

The relative importance of these different types of muscular activity changes as animals change gait. Energy is conserved during a walk by an alternate storage and recovery of gravitational potential energy within each stride, as in an inverted pendulum. In order for this transfer of energy to take place, muscular activity is required to hold the limb rigid while the animal rotates over it. Energy is conserved by a spring mechanism during running, trotting, galloping, and hopping. Energy is stored when active muscles and their tendons are stretched and recovered as they subsequently shorten. The recruitment patterns of motor units as a function of speed therefore, depends on the type of muscular activity as well as the force exerted. Discontinuities in the cross sectional area of active fibers with increasing speed have been observed at the trot-gallop transition. It is suggested that at this point the trunk is recruited as an additional spring enabling more energy to be stored elastically. It is concluded that we must consider what muscles are doing during normal modes of locomotion before we become too involved in designing schemes of motor unit recruitment. © 1978 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040660510

A particular steel, Tenelon, containing neither nickel nor molybdenum, is especially attractive. It is found that the principles of both elemental substitution and isotopic tailoring can reduce the long-term radioactivity levels by orders of magnitude compared to normal Type 316 stainless steel.

Utilization of stored elastic energy in leg extensor muscles by men and women. Med. Sci. Sports. Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 261-265, 1978. An alternating cycle of eccentric-concentric contractions in locomotion represents a sequence when storage and utilization of elastic energy takes place. It is possible that this storage capacity and its utilization depends on the imposed stretch loads in activated muscles, and that sex differences may be present in these phenomena. To investigate these assumed differences, subjects from both sexes and of good physical condition performed vertical jumps on the force-platform from the following experimental conditions: squatting jump (SJ) from a static starting position; counter-movement jump (CMJ) from a free standing position and with a preparatory counter-movement; drop jumps (DJ) from the various heights (20 to 100 cm) on to the platform followed immediately by a vertical jump. In all subjects the SJ, in which condition no appreciable storage of elastic energy takes place, produced the lowest height of rise of the whole body center of gravity (C.G.). The stretch load (drop height) influenced the performance so that height of rise of C. of G. increased when the drop height increased from 26 up to 62 cm (males) and from 20 to 50 cm (females). In all jumping conditions the men jumped higher than the women. However, examination of the utilization of elastic energy indicated that in CMJ the female subjects were able to utilize most (~90%) of the energy produced in the prestretching phase. Similarly, in DJ the overall change in positive energy over SJ condition was higher in women as compared to men. Thus the results suggest that although the leg extensor muscles of the men subjects could sustain much higher stretch loads, the females may be able to utilize a greater portion of the stored elastic energy in jumping activities. © 1978 The American College of Sports Medicine.","Elastic energy; Muscle mechanics; Positive and negative work","elasticity; extensor muscle; human cell; leg muscle; muscle; normal human; Adult; Biomechanics; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Female; Human; Leg; Male; Mathematics; Muscle Contraction; Posture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018219752

This seems to be in contrast to other species such as the rat where de novo fatty acid synthesis can be induced to a high capacity of glucose removal. This leaves man with a limited capacity to store excess carbohydrate. The remaining possibilities are both the main glycogen stores in liver and in muscle. The latter is by far the largest. The capacity of muscle to assimilate glucose is dependent on its glycogen content that in turn is dependent on previous glycogen depletion to supply energy for muscle contraction. Man might, thus, be uniquely limited in the capacity to dispose of extra carbohydrate in the sedentary state. This might speculatively be thought to be an explanation for a carbohydrate excess syndrome in the sedentary state that may well increase the risk for obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and diabetes mellitus. The logical treatment for such a syndrome then is either a decreased intake of energy as carbohydrate or an increased disposal of carbohydrate energy by exercise. Exercise has, indeed, been shown to have such effects both after physical training programs and, perhaps more pertinent to the question, during a few days after a single exercise bout that has consumed a large amount of muscle glycogen. © 1978, Grune & Stratton, Inc..

Finally, the utilization of that stored energy by the contractile proteins themselves may be altered. The latter process is highly dependent on intracellular calcium ion kinetics. Anesthetic drugs, which produce reversible depression of myocardial contractile function in a dose-dependent fashion, have been shown to interfere to some extent with all three processes.

The inhibition of adhesion was associated with a decrease in metabolic ATP to 6% of control levels. Without metabolic inhibitors, platelets adherent to collagen fibrils were found to have catabolized approximately 57% of their metabolic ATP, and converted a major part of this to IMP. Storage pool ATP and ADP contents were also diminished in the adherent platelets. Pretreatment with imipramine resulted in 76% inhibition of the release reaction, but only 5% inhibition of adhesion. Imipramine-treated platelets that were adherent to collagen showed significant depletion of metabolic ATP, but markedly diminished conversion of ATP to IMP as compared to control adherent platelets. Inhibition of deamination of platelet AMP by coformycin or erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA) did not inhibit adhesion, although platelets adherent to collagen after treatment with these agents showed depletion of metabolic ATP. These studies suggest that adhesion is an energy dependent process, occurring independently of release, and not associated with conversion of ATP to IMP. The energy dependent portions of the adhesion process are probably disc to sphere transformation and pseudopod formation, the ATP threshold requirement is relatively low, and the ATP utilized can probably be regenerated during the adhesion process via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.",,"adenine nucleotide; collagen; blood and hemopoietic system; histology; in vitro study; thrombocyte adhesiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018185493

The calculated error rate agrees sufficiently well with the observed error rate to conclude that cosmic ray ionization is a likely cause of observed satellite bit errors. The susceptibility of MOS RAMs to cosmic ray induced error is a result of the small charge (sub-picocoulomb) typically stored on a MOS gate to represent a data bit. Relatively small energy deposition (a few MeV) can discharge a storage node, resulting in a bit error. The heavy ion particles present in galactic cosmic rays can provide this energy, resulting in a significant bit error rate for large memory systems in satellites.

For 10 years this pilot scheme delivered 10 MW of electricity to the grid and initially 50 later 70 MW of heat to the suburb 'Farsta' of Stockholm, with a very good reliability record. As yet it has had no successors anywhere in the world. Ågesta was of course too small to give good economics, but it gave valuable experience. As the citizens of Farsta had become accustomed to the smokeless nuclear heat, there were many protests from the public when Ågesta was shut down to allow the nuclear effort in Sweden to be concentrated on bigger units. Since the oil crisis, nuclear district heating schemes have, however, been studied with increasing effort in a number of countries as one of the possible ways of achieving lower heat costs, conserving the limited oil and natural gas resources, and reducing air pollution. In this article the author describes the basis for assessing the performance and economics of such schemes. To do this it has been necessary to treat not merely the nuclear plants but also the entire system of transport distribution and storage of heat. Many of the numerical examples in this area have been taken from the Swedish scene with which the author is best acquainted but also many comments on conditions in other countries are included. Also the institutional obstacles which often stand in the way of a wider use-and the manner in which they are starting to be tackled by several countries-are discussed. The subject is treated in a manner which it is hoped will be useful also to those without previous experience of district heating. © 1978.",,"NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; NUCLEAR REACTORS; AGESTA REACTOR; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018109838

Hydrogen technology brought about as a result of the dwindling reserves of mineral oil offers particularly favourable advantages in that hydrogen, like oil, can be applied universally as an energy source not only for domestic and industrial use, but also for motor vehicles. The storage of hydrogen for mobile (vehicle) and stationary (domestic) applications is best undertaken by the aid of suitable metal hydrides. Hydride research at Daimler-Benz not only produced the world's first combination hydride vehicles, it also led to the discovery and further development of a series of possible applications for hydrides. This work shows, that hydrogen out of metal hydrides is not only environmentally acceptable and offers independence of petroleum supplies, metal hydrides also permit optimum primary energy utilization by means of waste heat recovery from all combustion processes, heating and cooling of houses and cars without consuming primary energy and a reduction in energy consumption during the production of inexpensive D2O for natural uranium reactors. © 1978.",,"AUTOMOTIVE FUELS - Research; HYDROGEN INORGANIC COMPOUNDS; METAL HYDRIDES; HYDROGEN FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018107434

The model is developed from basic vehicle parameters and, when coupled with a simple model of battery performance, is used to examine effective ranges and per-mile traveled energy requirements of electric vehicles as compared with internal combustion powered vehicles under similar driving conditions. A number of classes of vehicles are discussed, each of which is identified by characteristic values of the model's vehicle and driving pattern parameters. A simplified driving cycle is adopted and range calculations are made on each of the vehicle classes using a simple model of battery performance for a typical lead-acid battery and for a theoretical high-performance battery. The relationships developed here not only provide a simple estimating model of vehicle performance, but also lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive simulation model, the development of which is currently in progress. The simplified model has a number of restrictions on modeling alternative driving patterns. These restrictions are discussed along with logical extensions to the model that address the restrictions. The preliminary results of the model indicate that electric vehicles, employing either current technology or high-performance batteries, may be energy efficient in urban environments.

An analysis of the thermodynamic irreversibilities associated with storing energy from a hot gas source as sensible heat in huge liquid baths points out two important trade-offs: 1. There exists an optimum, well-defined quantity of hot gas to be used in order to maximize the useful work stored in the liquid bath. Using more than this optimum quantity in the hope of maximizing the amount of thermal energy stored as sensible heat leads to severe thermodynamics losses. 2. There exists an optimum relationship among the gas-liquid heat exchanger design parameters which minimizes the system irreversibility while maximizing its capability of storing useful work. This relationship provides a procedure for estimating the heat exchanger optimum number of transfer units (Ntu). Increasing the Ntu above the optimum in order to upgrade the heat exchanger effectiveness and the thermal energy storage capability leads to prohibitive losses due to fluid friction in the heat exchanger channels. The existence of the two optima demonstrates that designing sensible heat units for maximum thermal energy storage does not necessarily amount to thermodynamically optimizing such systems. © 1978 by ASME.",,"HEAT EXCHANGERS - Design; HEATING - Heat Storage; THERMODYNAMICS; LIQUID BATHS; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018035148

The CAES concept consists of compressing air during off-peak periods and storing it in underground facilities for later use. During peak-load periods the air would be withdrawn, heated by recuperation and combustion and expanded through turbines to generate power. By using off-peak electricity for compression and stored air for peak-load generation, the resulting oil consumption would be about 40 per cent of that consumed by conventional gas-turbine peaking plants. The turbomachinery requirements for this type of system could be met using existing equipment with relatively modest modifications. Although the study discussed herein focused on the storage of air in hydraulically compensated, mined, hard-rock caverns, the compressed air could also be stored in underground aquifers or leached-out salt cavities. Conventional underground excavation technology could be used to construct these storage caverns. A geological survey of the north-central and north-east regions of the United States indicated that sufficient siting opportunities exist such that a prudently designed CAES plant should have little long-term adverse impact on the environment. The competitive position of CAES relative to conventional generation alternatives is highly dependent on utility-specific factors. The cost of electric energy from CAES is generally competitive with costs from conventional peak-shaving systems such as gas turbines and will improve as low-cost off-peak energy from nuclear plants becomes available. © 1978.",,"ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION; ENERGY STORAGE; COMPRESSED AIR; nuclear power station",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018029110

Both gaseous systems in which the effluent of each reactor is not separated into the reactant and product species, and liquid/gas systems in which the effluent separates spontaneously into liquid and gas phases, are treated. the study extends to consideration of non‐isothermal reactors, to the individual roles of reactor and heat exchanger in the work production processes and to the significance of the intrinsic work of phase separation. the overall system efficiency is derived as the product of two efficiencies: the energy storage efficiency which defines the fraction of the input energy passed in chemical form to storage and the work recovery efficiency which defines the fraction of this stored energy available as output work. the fundamental thermodynamic processes underlying the derivation of these efficiencies are examined from the point of view of optimization of the design and operation of individual system components. In particular, it is shown that the available work from a thermochemical energy transfer system approaches the maximum value given by the Gibbs' free energy change when the temperature profile of the exothermic reactor is suitably tailored. The work of separation has formed the basis of the analysis of specific system components and has given a useful insight into the understanding of energy storage efficiency. Work recovery efficiencies are calculated for the ammonia/hydrogen‐nitrogen system and the paper concludes with a discussion of some practical considerations relating to the recovery of work and the performance that one might ultimately expect from this system.

Several time‐temperature‐bias‐induced catastrophic failure mechanisms have been observed, all involving the Al gate metallization. These mechanisms are Au‐Al phase formation, Al electromigration, and electrolytic corrosion. Each of these processes results ultimately in an open gate. Accelerated aging also produces gradual, long‐term degradation in both dc and rf characteristics, though the two are not always correlated. In fact, contrary to some expectations, contact resistance may increase almost two orders of magnitude without significant degradation in the noise figure or gain of a low‐noise transistor. Besides contact resistance, other mechanisms such as traps in the channel are thought to play a role in the degradation of rf properties. It was found that all the important degradation mechanisms are bias‐sensitive and that aging without bias gives erroneously long lifetime projections. The cumulative failure distributions for the mechanisms observed approximate a log‐normal relation with standard deviations between 0.6 and 1.4. The relevant degradation or failure processes have activation energies near 1.0 eV, which give rise to projected median lifetimes at 60°C (channel temperature) over 107 hours and corresponding failure rates (excepting infant mortality) under 40 FITs (40 per 109 device‐hours) at 20 years of service. © 1978 The Bell System Technical Journal",,"TRANSISTORS - Testing; TRANSISTORS, FIELD EFFECT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018021588

In the Federal Republic of Germany these two sources make up 75% of the thermal energy market. However, oil and natural gas will not be available in sufficient quantities in the long run and will thus have to be substituted, e. g. , by nuclear energy and coal. According to forecasts of the long term development of the primary energy requirement in the world the relative percentage fractions of oil and natural gas will decrease and will be replaced by nuclear energy and coal. The thermal energy market has a multi-faceted structure with respect to the production of sources of secondary energy, transport, distribution, storage and, finally, application as well as with regard to the utilization of capabilities and unit sizes of generation and thus offers possibilities of substitution in a variety of ways. There are numerous processes under development, which are technically feasible, to generate sources of secondary energy from nuclear energy to supply the thermal energy market, and in the long run sufficient varieties will be available to suit all users. Here are some of these methods and sources of secondary energy, respectively: electricity for the thermal energy market; district heat and process steam from nuclear power plants operated in the coupled heat-power mode; nuclear coal gasification; nuclear district energy; nuclear hydrogen generation from water. The conversion of coal into an easy-to-use source of energy, which is possible by means of nuclear energy and is also economically attractive, opens up new applications of coal and thus contributes to a more efficient utilization of this source of energy which is so abundant worldwide and also in the Federal Republic of Germany. According to the market and economic study included in the Nuclear Process Heat Prototype Plant Project (PNP) the theoretical potential of using substitute natural gas from nuclear coal gasification in 2025 will be some 100 million TCE/a.",,"Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018021071

General ideas on such a development have been published by several authors. This report tries to go a step further by providing an assessment of available resources, an analysis of technical problems for the utilization of this resource and its integration into a global energy system, and a preliminary estimate of construction needs and costs. The estimate of available resources is based on published climatological data for Greenland and other arctic stations, and on a cautious selection of effective solar radiation and albedo values. 210-360 km3 of water is expected to be available during the summer months at an average altitude of 1000 m, corresponding to an energy generation of 460-800 TWh. Continuous generation all-year-round, however, requires storage reservoirs with a total volume of 100-180 km3. In southwest Greenland, numerous large lakes will provide sufficient storage volumes. In the east, storage is a problem, and power generation might be restricted to the summer months. Some 12 to 15 sites have been identified on the maps where power schemes can be developed with a total installed capacity of 60-120 GW; hence, the estimated hydropower resources of Greenland come close to the 1974 total consumption of electric energy in the interconnected grid system of Western Europe which, according to the statistics of UCPTE, was 724 TWh with a peak load of 118 GW. Technologies for hydropower development are well established and already in progress towards the order of magnitude needed for Greenland; however, methods of collecting water melting from large ice surfaces have still to be studied and tested. The problem of bulk energy transport over great distances is common to all future global energy supply options, and not unique to Greenland energy. Carriers envisaged in the report are EHV sea cables and transmission lines on land, hydrogen gas pipelines across sea and land, and tankers for liquid hydrogen or ammonia. Preliminary cost comparisons show each of these carriers to be competitive under specific production and market conditions. The report gives a tentative model for the full development of Greenland's glacier power comprising all these options. Construction cost of the power schemes is estimated at 775-320 US-dollars per installed kilowatt, but another 220-430 US$/kW have to be invested in transport facilities such as EHV links or H2 gas pipelines. The use of liquid H2 as an energy carrier requires lower investments but involves higher energy losses. The integration of Greenland's glacier power into a global energy system is analyzed according to the criteria adopted for IIASA's Energy Program. No need of fundamental innovation and no serious constraints have been identified for a full development, scheme by scheme, over a projected construction period of e.g. 40 years, starting after an initial testing, planning, and design period of e.g. 10 years. A tentative study program is suggested comprising the collection of basic scientific data, as well as preparatory technical investigations and tests to ascertain the technical feasibility of the development. © 1978.",,"ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION, EHV - Costs; ENERGY RESOURCES - Greenland; GLACIERS - Greenland; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018019764

Meanwhile, although the operation of the step-down type circuit is stable, the extraordinary phenomena arise when the magnetomotive force of the energy-storage reactor is discontinuous for the light-load. These phenomena may be eliminated by the use of a dummy load or the reactor of sufficiently large inductance, but it makes the efficiency lower or the size and weight of the reactor larger. In the converter circuit presented here, the operation is stable and the extraordinary phenomena are eliminated by using the magnetic coupling among the multiple windings of the reactor.

The two systems are the Electromagnetic System (EMS) with either linear induction motor (LIM) or long stator motor propulsion, and the Electrodynamic System (EDS) with linear synchronous motor (LSM) propulsion. The operational conditions considered were 400 and 500 km/h velocities either at steady state cruise or with a grade or headwind additional loading. It is found that the LSM of the EDS system is the most suitable form of propulsion for these operating conditions, the long stator motor for the EMS having apparently reasonable characteristics at 400 km/h, but becoming degraded at 500 km/h, and the LIM's studied being unsuited to the high speed range. These results highlight the necessity to compare not only the active power supplied to a vehicle, but also the complex power at wayside substations to be able to indicate the overall efficiencies and power factors of the competing systems. The German, the Canadian and the Philco-Ford EDS designs are also compared by weight make-up and specific energy intensity. These results show that the advantage gained from a lightweight aircraft-type construction, coupled with the relatively longer body, is lost in the German design because of the extra dead weight of the wheel sets required for running on conventional duo-rail with the resultant heavier body structure.

It assumes that data for the site of the potential solar-electric plant collected over a period of ten or more years are available. The most important such data for this analysis are the mean annual insolation per unit area, I, in Btu per square foot (Btu/ft2), and the peak rate of solar insolation, P, in Btu/ft2 hr. Secondary site data include the mean number of hours of sunshine on the site per year, measures of the seasonal variation between summer and winter, and the frequency of damaging storms. For the proposed solar-electric generating plant, only two characteristics are required: the gross heat rate, H, in Btu of solar radiation received on the collectors per kilowatt hour (kWhr) of electricity delivered in usable form, and the amount and efficiency of energy storage included in the plant. The heat rate for the system depends on a series of efficiencies or losses as the received solar radiation passes through successive stages of the system to its electrical output. For fully engineered systems it can be estimated within fairly narrow limits. For speculative systems which might materialize as a result of future research and development, an assumed value can be chosen on the basis of what is hoped to be achieved.

The former term is corresponding to the minimum field to saturate a recording media, while latter is determined by the reluctance of the yoke.

PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, ε{lunate}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. ε{lunate} varies from less than 0.01% to about 0.1% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3% (±1.5%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield φ and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for φ emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light. © 1978.",,"CHEMICAL REACTIONS - Photosynthesis; SOLAR RADIATION; MARINE PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; MARINE BIOLOGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017998399

The latter includes the concentrates from various process systems that ensure that only minute amounts of radioactivity are emitted into the environment of the generating station site. For more than ten years, Ontario Hydro has been operating a centralized program for the management of miscellaneous reactor wastes at its Bruce Nuclear Power Development, between Kincardine and Port Elgin. The site facilities include both shallow in-ground and above-ground storage structures tailored to different types of wastes and a radioactive waste volume reduction facility consisting of a radioactive waste incinerator and a mechanical compactor.In the ten years of operating the reactor waste storage facilities there has never been a site or transportation situation which posed a radiological hazard to the public. Radioactivity emissions from the site have been two to three orders of magnitude below the regulatory limits with significant contributors being atomic bomb fallout and natural radioactivity such as potassium 40. Routine monitoring of the bedrock aquifer, which is separated from the storage structures by 5.2 to 10.7 meters of dense glacial till, confirms no radioactivity has reached this water from storage operations as would be expected from analysis of the small amounts of water from the underdrainage system. The unit volume costs of the three facilities described here are significant, $ 1100, $ 8400 and $ 7100 per m3 for trenches, tile holes, and quadricells respectively, but are a very small contributor to the total unit cost of nuclear electric energy. They are directly charged against the station generating the waste. In 1977 they contributed less than 0.1 mills/kWh to the total unit energy cost of 9.27/mills kWh at the Pickering Generating Station.

Asphaltenes are solid particles, insoluble in fuel oils, which burn less easily than liquid hydrocarbons do. These asphaltenes lump together to form agglomerates which, as they decant, settle in the bottom of storage tanks. Their presence makes it impossible to use that part of the fuel oil, and can cause pluggage of the filters. Higher fuel viscosities mean that, in order to achieve good combustion, the fuel has to be heated up to temperatures which some installations are not equipped to accommodate. Under these conditions it is very difficult for small and medium-sized boilers to comply with French legislation on particulate emissions (the French legislation is the strictest so far in Europe). Two new fuel oil additives can prevent asphaltenes from forming into agglomerates and act as catalysts to improve fuel combustion. Use of these additives reduces air pollution and saves energy.",,"BOILER FIRING - Oil Fuel; Oil fuel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017962393

The optimum pipe size distribution within the fluid transport network has been generated subject to requirements of minimum cost and pressure drop equality across parallel conduction paths. The optimization procedure includes the installed capital cost of pipework together with the effective cost of pumping power. An analytical expression for the overall thermochemical energy transport cost has been derived, based on a Black and Veatch pipe cost survey in which conventional pipelaying technology is assumed. Thermochemical energy transport costs are calculated for systems based on ammonia, methanol, water-methane and sulphur trioxide. The derived costs are dominated by the pipe installation component whereas other parameters such as choice of system, operating pressure, reaction enthalpy and degree of reaction are of secondary importance. Larger collectors favour a lower installed cost per unit energy while increases in network area and hence in plant output capacity lead to slow increases in unit cost. Typical thermochemical energy transport costs for a solar thermal power plant operating only during sunlight hours and based on large collectors are estimated at $20 kWt-1 (1974 U.S. dollars). It is suggested that there is a need for reduction of this estimate by developments in pipelaying technology tailored to the requirements of solar thermal power plants. Such developments would seem to be feasible for thermochemical energy transfer systems based on small diameter pipes and hence on high system pressures. © 1978.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; THERMOCHEMICAL ENERGY TRANSPORT; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017925576

The all-electric residence unit, which includes about 10 per cent of all such units in the U.S.A. and constitutes over half of those completed in 1973, seems particularly suited to a solar modification. It is proposed that heating and cooling of the all-electric residence unit be accomplished by using a solar-assisted heat-pump system. The proposed system makes use of a conventional air-conditioning unit which would be modified by fitting controls to reverse the flow of refrigerant for the heating mode and by changing the outdoor heat exchanger from refrigerant-to-air to refrigerant-to-water. In addition, there would be provided a solar collector and two insulated water-storage tanks. Water from one tank would be circulated through the refrigerant-to-water heat exchanger when needed and then returned to the other tank, so that essentially a source of heat of constant temperature would be maintained, thus decreasing the temperature interval for the heat pump and thereby saving energy. In the cooling mode the stored water would be cooled by exposure of the solar collector to the night sky to decrease the temperature interval for the heat pump, thereby reducing energy consumption. Calculations were made for an existing residence unit for which the total energy input is known and to which the proposed solar-assisted heat-pump system is applied. An estimated cost of equipment and of its operation is compared with the cost of owning and operating fuel and electrically heated systems. It is concluded that the solar-assisted heat-pump system with current fuel prices can provide immediate economic benefit over the all-electric home and is possibly on par with residences using fuel oil or liquefied petroleum gas, but it yields higher cost over systems using natural gas. The effect of a two-phase expander to replace the expansion valve in the refrigerant circuit has been theoretically investigated. It shows a significant energy saving worthy of further economic and practical consideration. © 1978.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Solar Energy Systems; BUILDINGS - Heating; ENERGY CONSERVATION; HEATING - Solar; SOLAR ENERGY; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017922998

These studies, based on design power performance curves, indicate that in good wind environments the 500 kW generators can average (on an annual basis) up to 240 kW mean power output, and the 1500 kW generators can average up to 350 kW mean power output. Higher mean power output (averaging up to 470 kW) is indicated, however from a hypothetical 1125 kW rated power unit designed to operate at wind speeds near those observed throughout the study area, rather than the higher design operating wind speed of the 1500 kW unit. The beneficial effect of operating large disperse arrays of wind turbines is that available power output can be increased-if winds are not blowing over one part of the array, chances are they will over some other part of the array. These studies indicate that wind power availability levels of 200 kW per 1125 kW generator were 77-93 per cent, depending on season. Reasonably steady high wind power in winter and high afternoon peak wind power in summer (corresponding to peak air conditioning load) means that significant peak load displacement can be achieved without the use of storage. © 1978.",,"ENERGY RESOURCES; TURBOMACHINERY; WIND TURBINES; WIND POWER",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017912055

However, the problem of on-board storage has yet to be solved. At present, storage of the hydrogen as a liquid is the only method in practice. In order to participate in the SEED Rally held in the U.S.A. in 1975, a Datsun B-210 passenger car with a 1.4 liter engine was converted to a hydrogen fueled car using the liquid storage method. This was accomplished within the short space of 4 months. Since the car had to travel at least 650 km (400 miles) between fuelings, it was equipped with a tank which could contain 230 l (61 gal) of liquid hydrogen at 5 atm. gage (71 psig). Because cooler hydrogen gas induces better engine performance, the fuel line from the rear tank to the front engine was a vacuum insulated pipe. Fuel was injected intermittently into the intake port by a mechanical valve. This car successfully completed the Rally, 2800 km (1730 miles), and proved that the liquid hydrogen car has a bright future with regard to energy economy, performance, emissions, and safety. © 1978.",,"AUTOMOBILE ENGINES - Design; AUTOMOBILES - Fuel Tanks; AUTOMOTIVE FUELS - Storage; HYDROGEN FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017909304

If exploited to its full potential in the United States, wind can provide almost 19% of the electrical energy demand forecast for the year 1995. That is equivalent to conserving 2.1 billion bbl of oil. Further, wind-energy conversion to electricity is nonpolluting, environmentally inert, and nonhazardrous, and wind-energy is continually replenished. The most likely opportunity for wide-scale exploitation is in the generation of electricity by utilities, as a supplement to fossil steam and hydroelectric power plants. Storage for satisfying peak demand or for periods without wind is provided by the unburned fuel or retained water conserved whenever the wind turbines operate. Thus, the economic tradeoff between the cost of fuel necessary to produce a kilowatt hour of energy and the cost of owning and operating a wind-turbine generater allocated per kilowatt determines whether or not wind energy is competitive. In many regions of the United States and the world, fuel costs already have escalated beyond the equivalent energy costs of wind, and if they should continue to rise as they have since 1973, it is likely to make acceptance of wind energy or other alternative energy sources more imperative. In the Circum-Pacific community, wind turbines can be used effectively to supplement diesel, or gas-turbine power plants to conserve fuel, or to operate synergetically with hydroelectric facilities as a totally independent self-sufficient energy supply. Recent studies of wind data show an abundance of good wind sites. The technology for developing large wind turbines, with rotor diameters of 80 m or more, is well in hand. What is needed to trigger the availability of commercial systems, is the materializaton of market demand and commitment from public and private utilities, communities, and goverment agencies to acquire these systems.

The incorporation of this fat within an extension of the nerve cord sheath suggests that it could act as a protective dorsal cushion for the nerve cord, which would otherwise be more exposed due to the absence of complete vertebral arches.

Use of the existing power system has the advantage of avoiding storage systems in one or other form. From the present day estimates which can be given of the annual average amount of energy produced by a wind turbine, it appears that compared to conventional production units a considerable amount of rated power must be installed in order to produce a given amount of energy because of the low utilisation factor of the wind-turbine. An energy production of 10-15% of the total electricity production as an annual average, implies that at high wind speeds the power produced is in the same order of magnitude as that of the actual load of the system. Even in a densely populated country with a dense electricity infrastructure the existing medium voltage distribution grid (10-20 kV) will not be sufficient to absorb the power from arrays or parks of wind turbines. With help of examples it can be shown that only transmission networks and substations with voltages from 50 kV upwards can be used. General criteria are discussed for the conversion of the mechanical power into electric power with suitable characteristics. Some economic considerations are given.

Modern design has tended to employ a two-blade system which offers higher power, better aerodynamic efficiency, higher speed of rotation and lower cost and weight. Such motors are often directly coupled to an electric generator via a clutch. An alternative is the wind turbine, which distributes an air flow accelerated by the Venturi effect to the turbine blades.

A novel solution to the storage of wind energy is proposed, whereby electricity produced from a combination of solar panels and wind power is used for the electrolysis of water; hydrogen and oxygen thus produced are then used to power a gas turbine and a conventional generator. Other alternative energy possibilities such as the use of fuel cells ofr molten salt (the latter for energy storage as heat), are also mentioned.

The sequence of withdrawals from storage at each of the three storage reservoirs is thus determined according to the effective generating head for the corresponding subsystem of powerhouses.

Triton X-100-extracted, demembranated (modeled) bull sperm are motile in the presence of ATP. Addition of cAMP to motile demembranated preparations of sperm produced a measured increase in motility. Maximal stimulation was obtained with 8-30 μM cAMP present in the mixture. The stimulation is of the same relative magnitude as obtained by addition of theophylline or caffeine to intact (membrane-bound) sperm. Modeled sperm show no sensitivity to theophylline. The response of the modeled sperm to the addition of cAMP was dependent upon the length of storage of the sperm and the condition of the sperm prior to modeling. Although modeled sperm show no sensitivity to theophylline, theophylline treatment of sperm prior to modeling increases the motility of the models produced and eliminates the sensitivity of the models to cAMP. Inhibiting the energy metabolism of the sperm prior to modeling greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the models to cAMP. We conclude that the effect of cAMP on modeled bull sperm reflects a naturally occurring balance which controls the motility of bull sperm, and that cAMP exerts its stimulatory action directly on the motile apparatus. © 1978.",,"adenosine triphosphate; bucladesine; caffeine; cyclic amp; cyclic gmp; deoxyglucose; potassium cyanide; theophylline; animal experiment; cattle; dose response; drug comparison; drug response; drug sensitivity; energy transfer; in vitro study; spermatozoon motility; Adenosine Monophosphate; Animal; Bucladesine; Cattle; Cell Survival; Cyanides; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic GMP; Deoxyglucose; Male; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Theophylline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017839969

They can all utilize a range of one-carbon compounds and, in addition, a number of strains can grow on some two-carbon compounds. They can be considered obligate methylotrophs or restricted facultative methylotrophs depending upon their ability to utilize two- and four-carbon compounds.

In this paper the focus of attention will be on a use of high-temperature water storage in steam-turbine power plants. Fig 1 shows a schematic diagram for a typical power plant with hot-water storage. At the time when the power demand is low, a greater than normal water flow is sent through the feedwater heater train. This would result in an increase of st eam extracted from the turbine and also in a reduction of turbine output. The excess feedwater is then directed to the storage tank. During the peaking period the heated feedwater will be recalled from the storage and returned to the power-plant system. At the same time the bala nce of required water is passed through the feedwater heater train. Because of less demand on the steam extraction, the turbine will generate more than normal output. In this arrangement the steam generator is operated at a constant load. This paper is intended to present a parametric study of a steam-turbine power plant with hot-water storage. The study will identify the parameters affecting the plant performance and its economic acceptance. Also, fuel cost and storage size are estimated for peak power generation.

During charging, water rises in the compensating shaft. AS it rises, hydrostatic pressure is reduced and dissolved air is released. The presence of air bubbles reduces the hydrostatic head of the water column by as much as 10 percent. The resultant pressure imbalance could cause the water to accelerate to a potentially dangerous velocity. Also, since the outflow will continue even if charging is stopped, all the water could be lost with concomitant loss of stored air. Since the occurrence of the champagne phenomenon could result in potentially severe consequences, any consideration of hydraulically compensated CAES systems must include a detailed analysis of the two-phase flow system in the compensating shaft. An analysis of transient performance was made, and means of preventing or controlling the problem were examined. The alternatices considered were oversizing of the cavern and incorporating a U-bend water seal below the cavern.

The spectra are compared with model chromophore resonance Raman data. It was found that metarhodopsin I is linked to opsin via a protonated Schiff base linkage, whereas metarhodopsin II is linked by an unprotonated Schiff base. A recent suggestion that the chromophore of metarhodopsin II is retinal is explicitly disproved. The chromophores of both metarhodopsins are found to have an essentially all-trans conformation. The basic mechanism for color regulation in both forms appears to be electron derealization. The data tend to support the model of cis trans isomerization as the primary mechanism for vision.

In 1971, computer systems were developed that permitted storage of information and data characterizing each effluent and onsite discharge point and relevant information on sources, effluent treatment and control systems, and discharge data, and serve as ERDA's computer-based management information systems for compiling waste discharge control and monitoring data on radioactivity released as airborne or liquid effluents or liquid discharges to onsite retention basins at ERDA facilities. The information systems and associated data outputs have proved to be an effective internal management tool for identifying effluent control problem areas and for surveying an agencywide Radioactive Effluent Reduction Program. The trend data facilitate the detection of gradual changes in the effectiveness of waste treatment systems, and errors or oversights in monitoring and data handling. Other computer outputs are useful for identifying effluent release points that have significantly higher or lower concentrations or quantities in the discharge stream than were measured the previous year. The year-to-year trend reports and the extensive computer edit and error checks have improved the reliability of the reported effluent data. Adoption of a uniform, centralized reporting system has improved the understanding and credibility of effluent data, and has allowed management to evaluate the effectiveness of effluent control practices at ERDA facilities.",,"radioisotope; computer; effluent; geographic distribution; methodology; monitoring; nuclear power plant; radioactivity; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017808714

This uptake is charge‐balanced by sodium ions and not by proton release. Light‐induced shifts in concentrations of divalent cations were found to be negligible. The transient changes in extracellular pH (alkaline overshoot) can be understood by the concomitant processes of ATP synthesis, proton/sodium exchange and potassium uptake. The driving force of potassium ion uptake is the membrane potential, no ATP‐dependent potassium transport process is found. Fluorescence measurements indicate a high permeability of the membrane to potassium ions compared to sodium ions. Therefore the potassium ion diffusion potential contributes to the membrane potential (about 30 mV/decade) and thereby influences the ATP level. Sudden enhancement of the diffusion potential by the potassium ionophore monactin leads to the expected transient increase in cellular ATP level. Due to the large size (up to 100‐fold) of the potassium ion gradient and its high capacity (intracellular concentration up to 3 M) the potassium ion gradient can well serve the cell as a long term storage form of energy.

The Q dependence of the form factor can therefore be derived from an energy analysis of the neutrons scattered from a powder sample, at several Q values.

More generally, in a relativistic theory the correction may be expanded in powers of (εM)12, where ε and M are the binding energy and the mass of the deuteron. However, present knowledge of the structure of the deuteron does not allow an evaluation of the coefficients in this expansion, so that the very sizable correction necessary in, for example, deep-inelastic lepton scattering on deuterium cannot be reliably determined.

Emission yields and lifetimes (ns) decrease for the series dianthryl carbonate (τ = 5), dianthrylethanes (τ ~ 2), dianthrylmethanes (τ ≤ 1). Reaction quantum yields are not so much a function of chromophore linkage but are responsive to the substitution pattern at 10,10′ positions. For dianthrylethanes but not for dianthrylmethanes, excimer emission is observed for sandwich dimers generated in glasses at low temperatures. High photoreactivity for proximal anthracenes is identified with intersecting plane as opposed to parallel plane (sandwich excimer) geometries. In accord with recent theory, biradicals are proposed as intermediates in photodimerization. Formation and partitioning of these species (14) respectively control excited singlet lifetimes and photodimerization quantum yields.

This film consists of a very thin layer (3000 Å thick) of wholly inorganic material sputtered onto a polyester substrate in a proprietary process. The tiny, vertical crystallites (700 Å diameter) function as anisotropic image receptors featuring extremely short response times, better than one nanosecond, and they display discharge levels proportional to the amount of absorbed energy. Accordingly, it is possible to digitally record pulses at great bandwidth as either binary or intermediate level signals without reciprocity failure and at theoretical resolution levels of 10,000 cycles/mm. These signals can be developed into visible images with electrostatic toner with great fidelity for storage, reprocessing, viewing, or even printing. With especially formulated toners it is possible to print the recording lithographically, i.e., with multiple colors, generating rather esoteric imagery. The daylight handling, infinite storage, and erasability features are expected to lead this recording material toward many applications in the laser, LED, or electron beam recording fields. © 1977 SPIE.",,"Radar; Anisotropic image; Digital recording; Electron beam recording; Inorganic materials; Intermediate level; Performance aspects; Reciprocity failures; Recording materials; Materials handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957492977

The acoustic wave pattern is stored as changes in the index of refraction (δn). The δn is proportional to the rf amplitude, and increases sublinearly with the number of laser pulses and as the 1.3 power of the incident laser energy density. The decay time varies from a few hours, when only green illumination (530 nm) is used, to several weeks when combined green and infrared illumination (1060 nm) are used. The On can be erased by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or by annealing at 250°C. This acousto-photorefractive effect has been utilized to construct an acousto-optic memory correlator wherein both the stored On and the On produced by a ""live"" propagating acoustic wave simultaneously modulate a low-power cw laser beam. The resultant detected signal is proportional to the correlation integral. The memory correlator operated at a center frequency of 10 MHz with a 1-MHz bandwidth.

The desorption pressure of LaNi5H6,7 may be modified by substitutions either of La or Ni with other elements.

We report here that Al can substitute for Ni in LaNi5 with dramatic results in lowering decomposition pressures without impairing the kinetics or the hydrogen carrying capacities. The important new result is that Al substitutions allow a wide range of decomposition pressure to be spanned in continuous fashion.

The overall event involves the successive activations of a number of different loops and arches bridging the magnetic neutral line. The spatial shifts and brightenings observed in the Fe xxiii-xxiv lines are interpreted as the activation of new structures. These continued for four or five minutes after the end of the microwave burst phase, implying additional energy-release unrelated to the nonthermal phase of the flare. A shear component observed in the coronal magnetic field may be a factor in the storage and release of the flare energy. The observed Fe xxiii-xxiv intensities define a post-burst 'heating phase' during which the temperature remained approximately constant at 13 × 106 K while the Fe xxiv intensity and 0-3 Å flux rose to peak values. This phase coincided with the activation of the densest structure (Ne = 2 × 1011 cm-3). Heating of higher loops continued into the decay phase, even as the overall temperature and flux declined with the fading of the lower Fe xxiv arches. The observed morphology of individual flaring arches is consistent with the idea of energy release at altitude in the arch (coincident with a bright, energetic core in the Fe xxiv image) and energy flow downward into the ribbons. The Doppler velocity of the Fe xxi 1354 Å line is less than 5 km s-1, indicating that the hot plasma region is stationary. The relation of this flare to the larger class of flares associated with filament eruptions and emerging magnetic flux is discussed. © 1977 D.

For efficient wall pinning, the width of the nuclear damage tracks associated with the ion trajectories in the film have been enlarged to about the wall width by using a selective (chemical) etchant that makes use of the drastically increased etching rate in the damaged track volume. Therefore, channels of cylindrical or prismatic cross section are created having a width of a few 102 to about 103 Å and a length of more than 10 μm at the given etching conditions. The pinning capability of such channels can be further enhanced in films that are grown under planar compressive or tensile misfit strain. Then, strain relaxation occurs in the vicinity of these channels which results in steep gradients of the magnetic-wall energy via magnetostriction. These strain halos extend sufficiently beyond the channels so that efficient wall pinning is observed, even if the channel cross section is small compared with the wall width. Thermomagnetic compensation-point writing in LPE garnet film, that were treated accordingly, yield a pattern of stable magnetic domains of down to 8 μm in diameter in 3-μm-thick layers. The effect of etched nuclear tracks on the magnetic-wall coercivity can be interpreted satisfactorily with present models on Hwc.",,"DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; GARNETS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017723812

Cent., NASA, Moffett Field, Calif. 94035, United States","In H. halobium, proton pumping driven by light or by respiration generates an electrochemical potential difference across the membrane. Energy storage in this form is only transient. Cellular energy transducers competing with proton leaks stabilize this free energy as high energy phosphate bonds, electrochemical potential of other ions, and chemical potential of amino acids and possibly other chemical species. The pH changes induced by light or by respiration in cell suspensions are complicated by proton flows associated with the functioning of the cellular energy transducers. Dominant is the proton inflow coupled to the synthesis of ATP, which has been kinetically resolved. A proton-per-ATP ratio of about 3 is calculated from simultaneous measurements of photophosphorylation and the proton inflow. This value is compatible with the chemiosmotic coupling hypothesis. The time course of the light-induced changes in membrane potential indicates that light-driven pumping increases a dark preexisting potential of about 130 mV only by a small amount (20-30 mV). The complex kinetic features of the membrane potential changes do not closely follow those of the pH changes, indicating that flows of ions other than protons are involved. A qualitative model consistent with the avilable data is presented. A salient feature of this model is a sudden relaxation of the protonmotive force by a proton inflow through the ATPase when the preexisting protonmotive force is increased by light or respiration and reaches a critical value. The trigger could be either the protonmotive force, the pH gradient, or possibly the internal pH.",,"proton; cell membrane transport; halobacterium halobium; in vitro study; light; membrane potential; microorganism; photosynthesis; theoretical study; Aerobiosis; Bacteriorhodopsins; Biological Transport, Active; Cell Membrane; Electron Transport; Halobacterium; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Light; Membrane Potentials; Models, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; Photophosphorylation; Photosynthesis; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017645354

A greater photon yield was obtained with Xe 127. Markedly improved resolution was shown by measurement of a line phantom, but was not apparent on subjective appraisal of scintiphotos except in the washout phase. Xenon 127 appears to be preferable to Xe 133 because of the higher counting rates, lower patient radiation dose, and longer shelf life. In addition, a prior perfusion study using a Tc 99m radiopharmaceutical does not affect the quality of a Xe 127 ventilation study. The use of Xe 127 therefore permits the selection for ventilation studies of only those patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and eliminates unnecessary radiation exposure.

Such experiments lead to atmospheric precursors and involve an accumulation of large quantities of free enthalpy. A part of this energy can be released after dissolution of the precursors in aqueous media, either by simple multiple bond hydration, or by addition of heteroatomic reagents more nucleophilic than water, or by addition of carbonaceous nucleophiles. Energy balances of such processes are discussed. The non-enzymic photochemical accumulation of redox energy in aqueous phase appears later on feasible, but the main unsolved problem lies in the understanding of the primordial processes which made the conversion of redox energy into energy available from hydrolysis possible in aqueous media in the earliest stage of chemical evolution. In this respect, chemiosmotic or configurational interpretations of oxidative phosphorylations cannot be taken into consideration because they require complex structures which cannot be allowed for at this early stage. On the contrary, a discussion of the energetics and kinetics of electron transfers to and from substrates makes understandable the basic principles involved in the energy storage processes by means of the chemical hypothesis, as well as their likely occurrence, even in a non-enzymic form, from the very earliest stages of chemical evolution. © 1977 D.

Similar results were obtained with other sulfhydryl compounds.

Ig secretion is insensitive to a variety of hormones, mediators, cyclic nucleotide derivatives, extracellular calcium depletion, and agents acting on mierotubules or microfilaments; i.e., to a number of factors which are involved in the regulation of secretion by cells with a storage compartment. On the other hand, Ig secretion is markedly inhibited by conditions which (a) lower intracellular calcium levels (ionophore A 23187 in Ca++-free medium), (b) induce partial sodium/potassium equilibration (the ionophores monensin and nigericin and, in the case of myeloma cells, ouabain and incubation in K+-free medium) or (c) uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. The first two situations are accompanied by striking alterations of the ultrastructural appearance of the Golgi complex, different in each case. These ultrastructural observations, together with autoradiographic experiments after a short pulse with L-[4,5-3H]-leucine, have led to the following hypothesis: (a) under Ca++ depletion 3H-Ig passes to Golgi vesicles but these vesicles are incapable of fusion or migration and therefore accumulate in exaggerated numbers in the Golgi area; (b) under partial Na+/K+ equilibration, 3H-Ig passes to Golgi vesicles which have an exaggerated tendency to fuse with other Golgi elements, thereby generating large vacuoles which store increasing amounts of Ig; (c) under energy block, multiple membrane fission and fusion events are inhibited and there is therefore, little intracellular transport of 3H-Ig or alteration of cell ultrastructure. © American Society for Clinical Pathology.",,"calcium; ouabain; radioisotope; cancer cell; diagnosis; electron microscopy; golgi complex; histology; immunoglobulin production; in vitro study; methodology; mouse; multiple myeloma; oxidative phosphorylation; plasma cell; theoretical study; Animal; Calcium; Exocytosis; Golgi Apparatus; Immunoglobulins; Ionophores; Kinetics; Mice; Plasma Cells; Potassium; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017670751

We have significantly narrowed this technological gap with the development of a Laser Intensity Profile System (LIPS). The LIPS provides real time displays of either near field or far field energy distributions, as an aid in resonator alignment, and accurate calculations of the integrated far field intensity (“energy in the bucket”) and the angular position of the laser centroid. The electronic interface with the laser allows individual laser pulses to be recorded, providing the only quantitative way of determining, for example, the shot-to-shot variation in beam divergence during transient laser warmup. The LIPS building blocks are drawn from available video equipment, including a silicon-target vidicon for linear response and sensitivity in the near infrared, a video disc for image storage and convenient instant replay, and an image analyzer which develops both isometric and color-coded intensity level contour displays of the laser pulse. Analysis is performed using a micro-processor. After initial setup, very little operator expertise is required, making the system ideal for production line performance tests as well as laboratory diagnostic studies. The LIPS is described in detail, and several applications to laser evaluation and characterization are presented. In addition, some areas are discussed where performance improvement may be expected in the near future. © 1977 SPIE.",,"Infrared devices; Laser pulses; Television camera tubes; Accurate calculations; Angular positions; Electronic interface; Far-field intensity; Image analysis techniques; Laser intensity distribution; Performance tests; Real time display; Image analysis; LASER",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017638836

A seismicity map of the area for the period 1890-1970 is presented. A strain-energy release map of the Himalaya was prepared following the method discussed by Allen et al. (1965). On the basis of this map it is suggested that the Himalaya does not behave as a single unit so far as the seismic activity is concerned. It could be divided appropriately into three different units; 1. (1) the Panjab Himalaya; 2. (2) the Kumaon Himalaya; and 3. (3) the Nepal Himalaya. It is suggested that the extension of Aravalli structures into the Himalayan regions has played a role in the tectonics of the Kumaon Himalaya, and probably is the cause of the complex nature of seismicity of the region. In the Kumaon Himalaya the maximum strain-energy release is related to the Main Central Thrust (MCT), whereas in the Panjab as well as in Nepal Himalaya it is related to the activity of the Main Boundary Fault (MBF). The strain-energy release characteristics of the two thrusts show that their mechanisms of storage and release of energy are different. Strain-energy release through the MCT seems to be more uniform as compared to the MBF along which the release of energy has been mostly abrupt, through large magnitude earthquakes. Focal-mechanism solutions of Himalayan earthquakes located north as well as south of the Indus Suture Zone indicate that the Indian plate is underthrusting the Tibetan plate towards the north, wehereas the latter is underthrusting the Indian plate towards the south. P-axes lying to the north as well as south of the Indus Suture Line are shallow dipping. This confirms the view that the present-day seismicity of the area is a result of continental-continental collision and not of lithospheric subduction. © 1977.",,"SEISMOTECTONICS; EARTHQUAKES - Himalayas; GEOLOGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017546518

An analog simulation was then constructed to enable the performance of the model to be studied conveniently. In this second part, the results obtained using thee simulation are presented and discussed. The behavior of the model is first studied at a normal cadence, and the required muscle actions observed. Locomotion at other speeds is then investigated by forcing the swing duration to vary from that normally found in comfortable speed walking. In order to investigate the energy cost of walking at different speeds, an energy balance is drawn up for the swing phase. This is used to demonstrate a minimum energy requirement at a locomotion speed corresponding to a normal cadence if certain assumptions regarding the energy storage properties of muscles are made. Finally, a modified simulation is introduced which enables the swing phase of an above-knee amputee using a conventional prosthesis to be studied.The value of an analogue computer simulation as a means of investigating the basic muscle actions and physiology during the swing phase of normal locomotion has been demonstrated. Typical amputee gait defects have been shown on a second simulation which could be used to identify the reasons for the particular deficiency, and the remedial action required investigated. It could also be used as a design tool which enables the dynamic performance of different types of prostheses to be thoroughly investigated prior to patient trials. Work has already commenced on constructing a model of the normal leg during the stance phase, so that the entire walking cycle can be simulated.

Since reserpine is known to interfere with oxidative phosphorylation of isolated mitochondria, possible effects of reserpine on the energy metabolism of intact platelets were examined with the aim of determining whether or not such effects could explain the reduced transfer of metabolic ATP into the releasable pool of ATP. Reserpine caused a small increase in [14C]hypoxanthine and [14C]inosine accumulation in a suspension of washed rabbit platelets prelabeled with [14C]adenosine or [14C]adenine. Reserpine also caused increased oxidation of [14C]glucose. Serotonin mimicked these effects of reserpine, and imipramine inhibited the serotonin-induced as well as the reserpine-induced increases in [14C]hypoxanthine and [14C]inosine formation and glucose oxidation. However, imipramine did not prevent the reserpine-induced inhibition of [14C]ATP transfer from the metabolically active pool into the releasable pool. It is concluded, that the effects of reserpine on energy metabolism are at least partially attributable to the increased demand for energy for the uptake of serotonin, liberated from the platelets during incubation with reserpine, and not to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the small decrease of the metabolically active ATP pool upon incubation of platelets with reserpine cannot explain the reduced transfer of ATP from the metabolic pool into the amine storage granule pool. © 1977.",,"adenine nucleotide; adenosine triphosphate; imipramine; oligomycin; radioisotope; reserpine; serotonin; adenine c 14; adenosine c 14; adenosine diphosphate c 14; adenosine phosphate c 14; adenosine triphosphate c 14; amine granule; dose time effect relation; drug metabolism; energy transfer; glucose c 14; glucose oxidation; in vitro study; pharmacokinetics; rabbit; serotonin release; thrombocyte; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Blood Glucose; Blood Platelets; In Vitro; Oxidation-Reduction; Rabbits; Reserpine; Serotonin; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017654257

Microballoon targets now used require temporal resolution of better than a few picoseconds to track accurately target collapse and disassembly. Instabilities of two picoseconds or less are predicted for the process. Most streak cameras are based upon a sector-focused streak tube, which in the design limit is capable of only about 10 ps x-ray resolution. Therefore, a new tube, based upon the proximity-focused or wafer intensifier was developed as a laser-fusion diagnostic capable in the design limit of delivering truly sub-picosecond x-ray resolution. A new power supply was also developed to drive the streak tube. Together, a camera has resulted with true picosecond capability, small size, high sensitivity, broad dynamic range, high spatial resolution, and very low jitter.

Of this, 75% was storage lipid (wax ester and triglyceride) and 25% structural (phospholipid, galactolipid, etc.). Based on chlorophyll a: lipid ratios of intact coral and isolated zooxanthellae, it was determined that over 90% of the storage lipid resided in the host tissue. One half of the structural lipids was found in the host and the other in the symbiotic algae. Gentle fractionation of coral tissue indicated that zooxanthellae possessed less than 14% of the total coral protein. Coral tips and isolated zooxanthellae were incubated with sodium acetate-1-14C in light and dark to obtain lipogenic rates and proportions of fatty acids and lipid classes synthesized. The rate of lipid synthesis from acetate-1-14C by intact coral was stimulated three-fold in the light (1200 lux), which indicated that the majority of coral lipogenesis occurred in the zooxanthellae. Intact coral triglycerides contained ca. 68% of the 14C-activity and wax esters ca. 21%. Zooxanthellae isolated by the Water Pik technique synthesized negligible amounts of wax ester, which implied that wax ester synthesis was a property of the animal tissue. Isolated zooxanthellae and intact coral synthesized identical triglyceride fatty acids from acetate-1-14C. This study provides evidence for a carbon cycle between host and symbiont whereby the zooxanthellae take up host-derived carbon (probably in the form of acetate), synthesize fatty acids using their photosynthetically derived energy, and return the lipid to the host where it appears as wax ester and triglyceride. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250297790

The climatonomic transform of the balance equation serves to assess surface-temperature perturbations resulting from parameter modifications which simulate effects of dust contamination of a snow surface. Three climatonomical model experiments permit the following conclusions: (1) an albedo reduction increases primarily the summer temperatures; (2) an emissivity decrease raises the temperature of all months nearly uniformly; (3) the thermally induced feedback on submedium structure (if summer melting is instigated) increases the storage capacity and reduces spring and summer temperatures with compensating rise in autumn and winter temperature.

The quantum efficiency reaches a maximum of 27% at 3° and an energy of 0.86 keV. At all energies, the quantum efficiency increases as the angle of incidence decreases until a critical angle is reached, after which the efficiency decreases rapidly. The quantum efficiency, outside of the small angle dip, decreases with energy at a constant angle. The general behaviour of the quantum efficiency can be understood using a very simple physical model. The low angle dip is caused by reflection from the surface of the channel. The variation of the quantum efficiency as a function of energy can be explained by the variation of the X-ray absorption and of the photo- and Auger electron ranges. The data are reasonably reproduced by a simple model. © 1977 SPIE.",,"Auger electron spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Image storage tubes; Microchannels; X ray absorption; Angle of Incidence; Auger electron; Critical angles; Efficiency increase; Micro channel plate; Simple modeling; Simple Physical Models; Quantum efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957478553

In all developmental stages studied, muscle rather than liver tissue served as the main site of carbohydrate and fat storage. Blood glucose and muscle lipid exhibited a positive relationship while liver HMSD and muscle ME activity, a negative relationship, with ammocoete weight. These responses were attributed to a proliferation of red fibers and adipocytes in the ammocoete muscle as the time of metamorphosis approched. Muscle lipid stores of ammocoetes in their last year of larval life increased dramatically during the fall and winter preceding metamorphosis. Changes in tissue enzyme activity of ammocoetes in their last year of larval life indicated that the liver was the site of amino acid incorporation into fat while muscle was the site of lipogenesis from glucose.

The PC12 line has previously been shown to respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) by extending neuronal-like processes and to synthesize and contain norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). In the present experiments, upon exposure to 51.5 mM K+, PC12 cells released a substantial proportion (ca. 30% and 12% for NGF-untreated and -treated cells, respectively) of their endogenous NE and DA. The release was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and was inhibited by excess Mg2+. Veratridine, an alkaloid which activates Na+ action potential ionophores, was also effective in releasing DA and NE. Exposure of PC12 cells (NGF-treated and -untreated) to reserpine (10-5 M) resulted in depletion of intracellular DA and NE levels by over 90% in 21 h. PC12 cells were also found to take up NE from the external medium by means of a saturable transport mechanism which follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent Km≈ 2 μM), is energy and sodium dependent and which is blocked by low concentrations of cocaine and desmethylimipramine. Such findings indicate that PC12 cells (a) can release catecholamines by means of an exocytotic secretion mechanism, (b) store most of their endogenous catecholamines in chromaffin granules and/or vesicles and (c) have an uptake1-type transport system for norepinephrine. PC12 cells thus appear to express a number of differentiated properties characteristic of sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells and may be a useful system in which to study catecholamine metabolism. © 1977.",,"barium; calcium; catecholamine; desipramine; dimethyl sulfoxide; dopamine; magnesium; nerve growth factor; noradrenalin; pargyline; radioisotope; reserpine; tetrodotoxin; veratridine; cancer cell culture; cell line; chromaffin cell; clone; in vitro study; michaelis constant; noradrenalin h 3; pheochromocytoma; rat; sympathetic nerve cell; theoretical study; Animal; Catecholamines; Cations, Divalent; Clone Cells; Cocaine; Desipramine; Dinitrophenols; Dopamine; Iodoacetates; Kinetics; Nerve Growth Factors; Norepinephrine; Pheochromocytoma; Potassium; Rats; Reserpine; Sodium; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Veratridine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017727949

It is concluded that the classical picture of a single cis-trans isomerization step is the only one which satisfactorily accounts for all the available experimental data. Experiments are performed showing that this process is temperature independent over a range of 200‡ C. In contrast to the efficient and wavelength independent photobleaching of rhodopsin, the yields of the 11-cis → all-trans isomerization of the free protonated Schiff base chromophore are small, exhibiting a marked dependence on the excitation wavelength. Potential energy curves for both ground and excited states of rhodopsin are derived from the analysis of the accumulated experimental data (Rosenfeld, Honig, Ottolenghi, and Ebrey, Pure Appl. Chem., in press). In variance with the behavior of model compounds, photoisomerization in the pigment proceeds via the quantitative population of a common, barrierless, thermally relaxed excited state along the 11-12 torsional coordinate separating the 11-cis (rhodopsin) and all-trans (bathorhodopsin) configurations. In the ground state, interactions with the protein destabilize the all-trans isomerization product, leading to storage of a significant fraction of the photon's energy in the primary step. Next, the photochemistry of the purple membrane protein of Halobacterium halobium is discussed. It is suggested that, as in the case of visual pigments, the primary photoevent is a geometrical change in the chromophore. Also, as with visual pigments, the resulting primary photoproduct must have the highest free energy of any form of the pigment. The quantum yield for the formation of the 412 nm intermediate (""M"") is c. 0.26, while that for the back reaction is c. 0.68 (Becher and Ebrey, Biophys. J., in press). The sum of these two quantum yields is c. 1.0, suggesting, again like rhodopsin, that the primary photochemistry proceeds through a common excited state shared by the pigment and its bathoproduct. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,"protein; visual pigment; methodology; normal value; photochemistry; purple membrane; retina; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017381315

All these batteries suffer from a common ailment known as voltage delay which results in a temporary voltage depression on load, particularly after prolonged high temperature storage and low temperature testing. This is due to the presence of a protective film on the Li. The film is responsible for the apparent stability of Li in the non-aqueous electrolytes in spite of its thermodynamic instability. The Li films were characterized in some of the above systems. The morphology and the growth characteristic of a LiCl film on Li in the SOCl2 inorganic electrolytes were studied in some detail and are discussed in this review. Significant improvements in the voltage delay problem were accomplished as a result of these studies. It is particularly gratifying to note that some of the Li batteries, e.g. Li/Ag2CrO4 and Li/SO2, are now being commercially manufactured for various military and consumer applications, and as such the Li batteries are here to stay. © 1977.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001700542

When rapid cooling was used to stop secretion and centrifugation to separate the cells from the medium, maximal amounts of storage ATP plus ADP and preadsorbed [14C]serotonin were found in the supernatant immediately (&lt;5 s) after A23187 addition. These results suggested that A23187 could cause shape change and aggregation through secreted ADP and not directly. When secretion was stopped with chilling and formaldehyde treatment before centrifugation, the secreted substances appeared after a lag of 60-120 s, i.e. after shape change was terminated and aggregation was well on its way. These two platelet responses thus seemed to be independent of secretion and induced directly by A23187. The absence of a lag period when secretion was stopped by chilling alone was thought to be due to centrifugation-induced secretion of platelets conditioned by A23187. Formaldehyde completely inhibited centrifugation-induced secretion. A 37°C, formaldehyde caused rapid breakdown of metabolic ATP in platelets with a pattern dependent on the formaldehyde concentration: Below 50 mM, ATP was converted to inosine plus hypoxanthine via ADP, AMP and IMP and the adenylate energy charge was preserved. Above 100 mM, AMP was the end product with a drastic reduction in the adenylate energy charge. These changes were not due to lysis of the platelets, but were apparently caused by an formaldehyde-induced increase in cellular ATP consumption. Platelet secretion is usually associated with a conversion of metabolic ATP to hypoxanthine.

The processes are discussed mainly at energies corresponding to the regions of the minimum and the rise of the total cross sections and to regions covered by the accelerators at Serpukhov and Batavia and the colliding-beam storage rings. Detailed consideration is given to np interactions, including the technique for performing experiments in neutron beams. This is done because accurate experiments in neutron beams have been carried out only recently, and the experimental features of these experiments are not widely known. The article discusses total cross sections, forward elastic scattering, backward elastic scattering (np charge exchange), and diffraction dissociation of nucleons. The equality of the total np and pp cross sections (observed experimentally in the energy range of the Serpukhov accelerator), and the near identity of elastic scattering in the diffraction region, mean from the point of view of the optical model that the distributions of nuclear matter in neutrons and protons in the peripheral regions are practically identical. The equality of the total cross sections is in agreement with the prediction of dual models involving degeneracy of the ρ and A2 trajectories. It is well known that in the np charge-exchange reaction there is also observed a longrange interaction which appears in the form of a very sharp peak at t≈0. The slope of the peak is ≈1/mπ2, where mπ, is the pion mass. The existence of this peak and also the simple kinematic law for variation of the cross section with energy: E–2(observed in experiments up to 30 GeV) are due to the dominant role of pion exchange in the charge-exchange reaction. On going to higher energies (the energy range of the Serpukhov accelerator) changes are observed in the energy behavior of the charge-exchange reaction: E–(1.5–1.6). Changes of this type were predicted in Regge models and are due to the increasing role of ρ and A2 exchanges at high energies. Recently careful studies have been made of the diffraction dissociation of nucleons at high energies (Serpukhov, Batavia, and colliding beams). These studies have revealed a number of features previously unobserved (at energies below 30 GeV), such as the backward peak in the distribution in cos ΘGJ in the Gottfried-Jackson coordinate system, the shift of the maximum in the mass spectrum toward higher masses, the approach of the cross section to a constant value at high energies, and other effects. All of the observed effects can be explained with the Deck mechanism if, in addition to one-pion exchange we take into account baryon exchanges and interference. © 1977 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931655059

Such work has evolved from considerations of the stellar atmosphere as a transition zone between the quasi-Equilibrium stellar interior and the non-Equilibrium interstellar medium. As opposed to suggestions of irreversibility originating in the large (Gal-Or, e.g.), we suggest that the origin is local, in coupling between different storage modes for matter and energy. In contract to suggestions of non-Equilibrium biophysical structures arising in fluctuations from a quasi-Equilibrium state (Prigogine et al.), we suggest that they arise via condensations within a non-Equilibrium, steady-state, unstable environment.

It will also reduce aircraft weight and the number of skill catagories required in maintenance training programs. Current aircraft have two parallel and nearly equal-sized secondary power systems (electrical and hydraulic). Of the two, only electrical has the potential for powering all significant functions on the aircraft from radio to landing gear. However, even though electrical power generation and distribution has always been competitive with hydraulic, electrical actuators (utilization) have been heavy and slow. For this reason, hydraulics have for many years monopolized all actuation applications in which power and/or frequency response requirements were moderately high. With the advent of high specific output, low inertia, rare-earth permanent magnet-type electric motors, the aircraft actuation field was reopened to electric motors. This, in turn, made possible the ""all-electric"" airplane, and significant power system (generation and distribution system) weight savings. For the B-1 aircraft, used as a typical example in this paper, these savings were on the order of 566 pounds. Servo-motor versions of these new electric motors will be adequate for most actuation functions. However, certain specific functions on advanced high-performance aircraft will still exceed the motor's capability in terms of power and/or frequency response. It is shown in this paper that the application of a mechanical servo-power package (MSPP) to these functions will meet the power and frequency response requirements, and will save additional weight. The MSPP consists of an electric motor, an adapter gearbox, a flywheel, a mechanical controller, and a mechanical hinge. The MSPP is shown to be capable of meeting high power demands while achieving a frequency response nearly an order of magnitude higher than the electric motor servo design goal. Through the energy storage features of the flywheel, the MSSP is able to save additional weight. On the B-1 aircraft, this weight saving is 1,046 pounds. It is also shown that the total weight savings on the B-1 aircraft, as a result of converting to the ""all electric"" airplane configuration, is 1,642 pounds.

This paper has dealt with ""unconventional"" underground energy storage: high pressure gases, cryogens and hot water. Natural gas can be stored in rock caverns as compressed gas or as a liquid (LNG), both with favorable cost comparisons to surface tank storage. Compressed air power systems can use mined caverns for storage of highly compressed air. Large hot water accumulators could be constructed as rock chambers. Within all these areas, there has been a need for further rock mechanics research, which was recently undertaken in Sweden. Major groups of problems are: gas tightness of fractured rock, heat flow and stress conditions in rock masses subject to thermal loading, and geochemical processes due to heat. Two examples of research results were given in this paper. In order to ensure gas tightness, rock fractures surrounding compressed gas caverns must be filled with water flowing towards the cavern. It is demonstrated that a minimum value of flow gradient is 1. Another example of Swedish research presented a method for cryogenic grouting of rock masses surrounding LNG caverns. A basic principle here is that grout material which flows towards the cavern sooner or later will solidify in rock fractures due to low temperatures. The fractures will then become impermeable to the stored cryogen. This grouting effect was successfully tested in the field. © 18th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics, USRMS 1977.

The events set in action by a rainstorm may be looked on as an alternation of fluxes and storages, as the water moves from one level of the ecosystem to another level. At each level, storage affords an opportunity for redistribution of water into competing outflows. This series of partitions of water into different outflows represents a sequence of branching processes, each of which depends on external or environmental conditions. Delivery as an aerodynamic process is also determined by the size of the water particles: fog droplets are small and are carried easily by a strong wind. One major outflow of water from its transient storage place on leaves takes place in the form of vapor, and is favored in high-energy environments. Organic material shed by the aerial parts of an ecosystem covers the mineral soil and forms still another intercepting layer in the downward hegira of water. Its storage capacity is small, some water being held on its surfaces and some absorbed within the litter itself, especially by its finer components. © 1977, Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023571053

The foliage of ecosystems rooted in moist soil forms an environment in which much water is vaporized. An ecosystem in sufficiently moist soil can be treated as a type of surface cover in which energy and atmospheric conditions, rather than water supply, are the controlling factors in the rate of vaporization of water. These are the same conditions that control vaporization at lake and snow surfaces, but vegetation is somewhat different when contrasted with these other surface covers. Like a snow cover it can, for instance, draw on only little heat storage in its substrate to support evaporation; unlike snow cover, it absorbs a large fraction of the sunshine that falls on it, and its surface temperature can rise far above the 0°C that is limiting for snow and that restricts the possible vapor pressure at a snow surface. In comparison with a water body, a vegetation-soil ecosystem has small heat storage, as good absorption of solar radiation, and a better linkage with the atmosphere by means of convective exchanges because it is rougher. These likenesses and differences suggest a little about the process of evaporation from ecosystems, the energy sources that power it and the external conditions that govern it. The chapter examines evaporation from the surfaces of several forms in which water substance exists in nature-snow, water bodies, shallow water, wet soil, and well-watered vegetation of varying thickness and other properties. In each type, different factors are found to influence evaporation. © 1977 Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023569732

This chapter illustrates the underground component of the off-site flow of water, and discusses the total yield of water and its associations with crop yield. The largest outflow from groundwater in humid lands occurs where fluvial erosion has incised valleys down into the volume of rock occupied by a groundwater body. On-site transpiration goes with on-site photosynthetic production. The different ways water moves affect the land surface and leave their marks on it. It can move, as drifting or avalanching snow, as ice, as liquid flow on the surface, within the upper porous layers of the soil and in deeper bodies of groundwater. The manner in which water moves away from the ecosystems on the earth's surface to which it was delivered by atmospheric processes depends on the delivery—usually sporadic and highly unpredictable—and on the receptiveness, storage capability, transmission, and energy availability characterizing these ecosystems. © 1977 Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023521079

Like other storages, these bodies can be analyzed in terms of inputs, outputs, and resulting changes in the mass of water stored. Groundwater storage is the balance between incoming water, which results from percolation that is either widespread or localized, and various kinds of outflow. The volume of water in groundwater storage is determined by the specific yield fraction and the depth of the saturated layer. The lower edge of this layer usually is indefinite, as the small fissures or fractures pinch out with depth. Mass budgets associated with groundwater are discussed. Outflows that occur locally from groundwater can be classified in terms of the environment into which the water is discharged. (a) At linear depressions, the emerging groundwater is concentrated in volume sufficient for its potential energy to power its flow into a river system and away from the local area altogether. (b) Outflow in small trickles into high-energy environments allows the absorption of radiant energy by wet soil or wet-soil plants to power the evaporation of most or all of the water. These sites provide conditions favoring water flux from the groundwater body into the local air, quite a different departure route than that taken by ground water that feeds into rivers. © 1977 Academic Press Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012620624

This is important for the development of new food sources, for more economical and energy‐efficient processing of food from existing sources, for better food quality and quality control, and for adherence to new regulations such as nutritional labeling and shelf‐life dating. Several classes of food‐processing problems are presented where advances can be made on the basis of improved understanding of heat and mass transfer mechanisms. These include cases of competing transport, cases where transport competes with kinetics of chemical or biochemical reactions, and cases where determination and understanding of the rate‐determining factor are needed. Specific examples are drawn from drying processes, leaching and extraction, freezing, sterilization and enzyme deactivation, and artificial cultivation. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

Ascorbic acid destruction under anaerobic conditions was confirmed to be a first‐order reaction with respect to ascorbic acid concentration. The effect of storage temperature on the rate of ascorbic acid destruction was accounted for by the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of anaerobic destruction of ascorbic acid was 3.3 kcal/mol at pH 4.06, and was shown to change with changes in pH. The rate of ascorbic acid destruction was influenced by pH, reaching a maximum near the pKa of ascorbic acid. The rate of copper‐catalysed destruction of ascorbic acid increased as copper concentration in tomato juice increased, and was affected by pH. A mathematical model, which described the rate of ascorbic acid destruction as functions of storage temperature, pH and copper, was developed based on the experimentally derived equations. A computer simulation program was developed using the mathematical model to predict ascorbic acid stability in tomato juice. The computer‐aided predictions of ascorbic acid stability in tomato juice was in good agreement with the results obtained from the shelf‐life tests. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

The specific deterioration process studied was the loss of vitamin C in dehydrated tomato juice, as affected by environmental changes of temperature, water activity, and oxygen. Degradation of ascorbic acid (AA) was found to follow first‐order reaction kinetics. The effects of temperature on the reaction rate could be described by the Arrhenius equation. Water activity had a strong effect on the reaction rate constant and on the activation energy. The effects of oxygen in this system were negligible. The rates of dehydroascorbic acid deterioration were similar to those of AA. Mathematical modeling of the retention of AA as a function of time, temperature and water activity was developed using theoretical, empirical and statistical considerations. This model was combined with equations describing the transport of water to the food, utilizing experimentally obtained mass transport parameters for the packages, and sorption characteristics of the food. By solving these equations numerically with the aid of a computer, AA retention was simulated for various conditions. Retention was also experimentally determined by storage tests. There was reasonable agreement between experimentally observed losses of AA and those predicted by the computer simulation program. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

The powders evaluated were produced by two different drying methods — drum drying and the conventional cube dehydration. Pigment degradation rates generally followed a first order reaction with an energy of activation of 7.0 and 8.0 Kcal/mole for betanine and 6.2 and 6.4 Kcal/mole for vulgaxanthin for drum and air dehydrated powders, respectively. Optimal pigment stability in the reconstituted juice was obtained at pH 5.7 for both the high and low tested temperatures (40 and 86°C). Freeze dried powder (used as a control), although having a higher initial pigment concentration, showed a markedly higher degradation rate in its reconstituted juice at the 40°C temperature, thus suggesting an enzymatic pigment degradation activity in the native beet.

A presentation in 1974 by Dr. Arulf Rabl led to a partial solution to the problem.2 In a discussion of the solar pond theory in the collection and storage of energy, Dr. Rabl included a demonstration showing that layers of different salinity content could be used as an energy storage system. The possibility for using a similar demonstration to show atmospheric layers and stability emerged. Further consideration resulted in the discovery of several other concepts that could be shown and discussed with a single demonstration model. The convenience of using a single demonstration for teaching several topics and the inexpensiveness and availability of the necessary materials favor use of the model in geography classrooms. © 1977 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945616028

Some data published by Sachs (1967) have also been analysed. Most of the exponents of the aliometric equations agree well with McMahon's (1973, 1975a) theory of elastic similarity: lengths are approximately proportional to (mass)0˙25, diameters to (mass)0˙375 and cross‐sectional areas to (mass)0˙75. However, some of the exponents for diameters and areas in the hind leg are significantly different from those predicted by the theory. The results are discussed in conjunction with previously published data on fast galloping. It is shown that maximum stresses in bones, muscles and tendons are probably more or less independent of body mass in antelopes galloping at their maximum speed. The tensile stresses in the tibia and humerus approach the tensile yield strength of bone. The total work which is done by the muscles in each stride at maximum speed and the energy saved by elastic storage are probably more or less proportional to body mass. The deviations of some of the allometric exponents for diameter from the expected value of 0middot;375 are partially explained. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

The total amount of gases generated during infinite time is proportional to the total exposure dose; hydrogen evolves at a rate of 5.5 ´ 10–3cmVg’MR. The amount of total gas evolution is governed solely by the quantity of asphalt, and is independent of the sludge contained therein. Nor do differences in the rate of dose appear to have any significant effect. In so far as concerns smallness of radiolysis, slightly better performance can be expected from straight than from blown asphalt. There is no danger of explosion of the asphalt products currently generated at JAERI (10–5Ci/kg), which can be expected to accumulate in infinite time no more than about 3 cm3from a 200 l product. Only asphalt products containing activity in concentrations exceeding 10–1Ci/kg risk explosion when kept in enclosed storage, through accumulation of hydrogen in quantity exceeding the explosion limit in a relatively short time. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Asphalts; Chemical radiation effects; Chemical sludge; Cobalt 60; Dose rates; External irradiation; Gas composition; Hydrogen; Radiation dose; Radiolysis; Safety evaluation; Solidification; Storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912846813

Schott.) is an underexploited root crop with promising economic value. A study was made to determine the feasibility of producing samples of taro (var. Lehua) in ration dense forms which will be stable at 38°C for a year or more, and to detect problems in dehydration and processing which would affect the palatability and storage quality of the dried products. Taro samples (5 mm thick slices) were freeze dried, air dried and solar dried, then stored in polyethylene bags at 21°C, 38°C and 60°C. Analyzed monthly, most samples showed small changes in acidity, some degradation in anthocyanins, some increase in moisture contents, and a rather large decrease in catalase activities. Taste panel evaluation of eating quality by multiple comparison test resulted in scores averaging 4.5/7.0 for all the dried samples while the control received 5.5/7.0. Energy value was about 4.0 Cal/g and gelatinization temperature was in the upper range as that of rice and slightly higher than wheat. Further assessments are being continued to determine if the physical form chosen was suitable for stability and acceptability tests, the preferred method of dehydration in terms of optimizing quality and energy requirements, and the effects of processing and storage on the eating qualities.

The results are in substantial agreement with published results for single crystal work on SrCl2, the activation energies being 1.8 eV for the intrinsic region, 0.35 eV for the extrinsic region, and 0.45 eV for the regions in which association of defects occurs. Most significant was the discovery of metastable electrolytes (4-5 mole% KCl in SrCl2) having a conductivity of 1 × 10-6 ohm-1 cm-1 at room temperature. These supersaturated solutions could be heat cycled up to 72°C, and they retained their initial conductivity after storage for 6 months at room temperature. This indicates that the equilibrium solubility of a dopant is not necessarily the limiting factor for extrinsic conductance in a solid material. © 1977.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49449124899

The results suggest that decreased negativity of vascular interface makes the vascular system more susceptible to thrombosis. The in-vivo patency of an implantable cardiovascular prosthesis is determined by the rest potential of the alloy in saline. Surface contamination during manufacture, storage, cleaning and sterilization prior to and during actual implantation leads to thrombogenesis. Highly thrombogenic materials - copper and titanium-aluminum alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) remain patent in-vivo if maintained at a highly negative potential by (a) cathodic polarization, or (b) by galvanic coupling. The implantation behavior of practical prostheses has been found to be significantly improved by (a) electrochemical cleaning/polishing and (b) taking special precautions to preclude attachment of particulate matter to the prosthesis during sterilization (by whatever method this is achieved), and implantation. Particulate matter on the prostheses can be identified by scanning electron microscopic examination of the surface coupled with X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy. We were able to identify the surface contamination and locate the source using these techniques in stored prostheses which are ordinarily implanted. Similarly the effects of drugs on the cardiovascular system have been assessed in experimental animals using electrokinetic and electron-optical techniques. Electroosmotic flow studies across arteries and veins of experimental animals administered on various drugs yields information on the alteration of the vascular surface charge due to ingestion of. © 1977.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349130615

Seven radiochemical fractions were separated and at least partially characterized. When irradiation and storage conditions suppressed thermal annealing, cobalt(II), which carried 65% of the 60Co was the predominant radiochemical form isolated. The combined d- and l-[Co(en)3]3+ isomers carried 8 ± 4% whereas less than 1% of the total activity appeared in the l-[Co(en)3]3+ fraction. Two radiochemical fractions, [Co(en)2X2]n+ and [Co(en)2(NH3)X]m+, were isolated and separated as the [Co(en)2(NO2)2]+ and [Co(en)2(NH3)(NO2)]2+ ions in solution. Two unknown radiochemical forms, which were converted to [Co(H2O)6]2+ in aqueous solution, were detected. First order rate constants for this conversion of these two species at 30° in aqueous solution were 1.4 × 10-4 sec-1 and 2.6 × 10-6 sec-1. Upon post-irradiation thermal treatment between 40 and 160°C, the [Co(en)3]3+ activity increased at the expense of Co2+ activity, with little change in the activities of the other products below 120°C. A comparison of isothermal and isochronal annealing curves indicated three annealing processes with activation energies of ca. 100, 100 and 270 kJ/mole, respectively. © 1977.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349129485

ISABELLE would permit the exploration of proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies continuously variable from 60 to 400 GeV and with luminosities of 1032-1033 cm-2s-1 over the entire energy range. The facility would consist of two interlaced rings of superconducting magnets, operating at 40 kG, in a common tunnel about 2.6 km in circumference. The proton beams would collide at six intersection regions where particle detecting systems would be located. Protons of about 30 GeV from the AGS will be accumulated in each ring to obtain the design current of 10 A prior to their acceleration to the final energy. In this paper the design philosophy underlying the principal design choices, as well as a brief description of the major accelerator systems and the conventional structures, is presented. An overview of the physics potential provided by ISABELLE is then given. The large extension of the center-of-mass energy range combined with the very high luminosity would provide unique possibilities for the investigation of the questions of greatest current interest in particle physics. Arguments, based on the available data and reasonable theoretical concepts, are presented that suggest strongly that the intermediate vector bosons required for a unified weak and electromagnetic field theory should be discovered. They should be studied in detail. The hadron production at high transverse momentum, the energy dependence of the strong interactions, and the possible search for new, massive particles are also discussed. The paper concludes with a detailed beam analysis, the various limitations on beam current, the procedures followed in optimizing the luminosity, and a justification of the projected performance levels. © 1977 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744693427

The tidal flow and velocity depend on the waterway area, energy losses, sea level, basin storage and upland inflow to the basin. Incremental closure of the channel when building the impounding structure affects the waterway area, changes the flow and velocity and promotes a differential water level across the structure. These hydraulic effects can influence the choice of building method (e.g. in situ construction or floated-in caissons, rockfill or sandfill). The correct choice of building sequence minimises adverse hydraulic effects. A mathematical model is essential in studying alternative methods and sequences of closure for the wide ranges of tidal levels and waterway openings likely to be involved. Such a model was used for the study of a tidal power scheme at Secure Bay, Western Australia. The program outputs include flows and velocities through each available opening, water levels and (where appropriate) energy generation. (A)",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18744426151

Even at optimum dry matter, protein degradation is considerable. If the forage becomes too dry, additional protein becomes indigestible from heat damage. Untreated direct-cut silages have low recoveries of energy and nitrogen. Protein degradation is extensive during storage. Low intake, partial feed conversion, daily animal production, and animal production per ton or hectare result. Formic acid may be used to desiccate standing forage in an effort to control dry matter, but adding formic acid to direct-cut forage at the silo is probably as beneficial. Formic acid alone, formic acid-formaldehyde, or formaldehyde alone eliminate many of the problems of direct-cut silage. Amounts of formaldehyde, when used alone, may be too critical for farm use. Formic acid also improves the quality and animal responses with wilted silages. Propionic acid controls the heat damage in wilted silages where the forage becomes too dry before ensiling.

Sample experimental data are given in the paper to demonstrate the concept of the transient tests. © 1977.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Solar Energy Systems; HEATING - Solar; SOLAR ENERGY; THERMAL STORAGE; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017727441

A number of factors will enter into the decision as to which alternative is better. In general, it is desirable to utilize the alimentary tract if it is functioning adequately. The potential hazard of aspiration and problems in inserting the tube into the appropriate part of the tract may offset advantages of tube feeding. The composition of the formula to be administered will depend upon the functional state of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolic needs of the patient. Defined-formula diets have become commercially available for p.o. and tube feeding. These are both a boon and a problem to patient, physician, and dietitian. They simplify ordering, storage, preparation, and administration, but they have drawbacks related to their fixed composition. The large number of diverse formulations require expertise for their proper use. Entry of food into the alimentary tract is a stimulus to maintenance of structure and function of that tract and to hyperplasia when resection of bowel has occurred. Special formulations and modifications in route and rate of feeding may be beneficial in meeting the needs of patients with pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption of various etiology, fistulas, and organ failures that modify nutritional requirements. Consideration should be given to adjunctive chemotherapy during nutritional rehabilitation of patients with known or suspected tumor. © 1977, American Association for Cancer Research.

In the final state, a purely nuclear energy production system, based on only two reactor types, was assumed to cover all electric and non-electrical energy demands of the model society. It is the purpose of this paper to evaluate the whole nuclear fuel cycle belonging to the asymptotic nuclear energy-production system. In order to achieve this, all normal operational and accidental risks connected with the nuclear material throughputs are analyzed. Thus, an idea of the relative importance of the different hazards is obtained; furthermore, the basis for a comparison of the nuclear option with alternative options (which is the subject of forthcoming work) is given. With this purpose in mind, only orders of magnitude are considered throughout the paper; in addition, the argumentation is restricted to the level of expected values. Following the introduction, the mass flows of nuclear material through the nuclear fuel cycle are analyzed. The methodology used is then developed. The normal operation releases of radioactivity are considered and possible modes of accidental radioactive releases are analyzed; the problem of a final waste storage is treated separately because of its unique nature. Different kinds of sabotage and blackmail, including the construction of a nuclear explosive device, are next analyzed; finally, all calculations are summarized. In conclusion, a number of decision-oriented assessments are identified that must be made when the large-scale deployment of nuclear energy is considered. © 1977.",,"NUCLEAR REACTORS - Safeguard Systems; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - Safe Handling; NUCLEAR FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017705710

Accurate concentrations of free Ca2+ between 1 and 15μM were generated with ATP as a Ca2+ buffer system. Using the method of iterative approximation, the accurate value of the initial velocity of ATP‐driven 45Ca uptake, and the time (t0.5) for half‐maximal uptake can be calculated. The rate of initial Ca2+ uptake increased in response to the rising free Ca2+ concentrations in the medium (in the presence of 0.6–5.0 mM ATP). A maximal rate was obtained between 10 and 15 μM of free Ca2+. For different ATP concentrations (0.6–5.0 mM), the half‐maximal rate of Ca2+ transport (Km) was observed between 4.1 and 7.4 μM Ca2+ (with a mean Km of 5.6 ± 0.6 μ Ca2+; n= 5). Hill plots of the data yield straight lines with an average slope n, of 1.93 ± 0.29, indicating the existence of two binding sites for Ca2+ in the transmembrane transport system. Keeping the free Ca2+ concentration on a constant level (6 μM), the rate of initial Ca2+ uptake also increased continually with rising ATP concentrations (maximum velocity v= 7.1 nmol of Ca2+× mg protein−1× s−1).

The data are discussed with regard to the physiological role which cardiac mitochondria may play as a reversible storage site during the contraction relaxation cycle of the heart.

The rats carrying one or two normal alleles Fafa or FaFa, lean rats) are normal in appearance and in body composition, whereas in homozygous recessive individuals (fafa, fatty rats), the fatty trait is noticeable by 3 wk of age. When the food intake of fatty Zucker rats is restricted to that consumed by lean littermates, their rate of growth is reduced but their body composition continues to be abnormal. The pair-fed fatty animals retained an increased fraction of the ingested calories, and had a preferential storage of calories in lipids, the rate of fat deposition being 50% greater than in lean rats. Hyperphagia alone can, therefore, not alone explain the abnormal lipid deposition in the fatty strain. Fatty and lean female Zucker rats weaned at 24 days of age, to receive then until the 34th day of age a commercial pelleted diet, were at that stage divided into groups, and fed on one of 6 diets. Fatty and lean rats differed markedly in body composition at 24 and 34 days. At day 34, the carcass lipid content of fatty animals was almost 4 times that of lean counterparts. Body protein content was the same, however, for the 2 phenotypes at both the time points. When food was given to satisfy appetite, the rate of protein deposition was the same for the 2 types of animals on all the diets and at the time points, but the lipid and energy deposition, were much greater in the fatty rats. Food intake of these animals was also much greater on all the diets except on the 4% protein diet, which both groups ate poorly. Food restriction for the fatty animals led to significant reduction in protein deposition, but these pair-fed animals continued to deposit twice as much lipid and energy. The intake of metabolizable energy (ME) in the lean rats was maximum on a 15% protein diet to remain almost constant at higher protein concentrations. The fatty animals showed maximum intake of ME on a 30% protein diet, and a fall at higher concentrations. Thus maximum differences between the two phenotypes with regard to ME intake, weight gain and lipid deposition were apparent on a 30% protein diet. Protein deposition in both types of animals reached a peak on a 15% protein diet. Nitrogen retention/intake of apparently digestible nitrogen, was significantly higher for the lean rats. Energy retention/ME intake was very much higher for the fatty animals. Heat production (ME intake-energy retention) of the 2 phenotypes eating ad lib was similar. These observations confirm that the obesity in these rats is not simply due to hyperphagia. That the mechanism for appetite control is not lost in the fatty animals is suggested by the observations that these animals show a markedly reduced appetite on low protein diets or an absolute zinc deficiency. These animals spent a lot of time in searching through their food as if they were looking for specific nutrients. It is suggested that the food intake in the congenitally obese Zucker rats is regulated by the need for adequate protein deposition.",,"ethnic or racial aspects; etiology; fat intake; food intake; genetics; methodology; obesity; protein deficiency; rat; theoretical study",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017653558

These authors can report one such case. The man had worked with uranium dioxide (UO2) powder for 22 mth when a routine in vivo uranium-in-chest count was carried out; 3 mth later he died suddenly from a coronary thrombosis, but from the time of monitoring until his death he had been transferred to another department (no UO2 contact). At autopsy one lung, the mediastinum, samples of kidney, liver, sternum, rib and vertebrae were available for study. The chest survey was carried out in the Whole Body Counter at British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) Windscale, where U is detected by means of the 90 and 185 keV gamma photons emitted by mixed U isotopes together with emissions from associated daughter products. A 120 mm diameter, 100 mm thick sodium iodide (thallium activated) crystal is employed, a side shield of 25 mm thick aged lead being incorporated to reduce the level of Compton Scatter effects. Measurements are made with the detector viewing the subject's back and chest sequentially. Pulse height analysis is performed with a multi-channel analyser which allows correction for normal room background (obtained by the observation of a water filled phantom) and presents the data in a form suitable for isotopic analysis. Because the sensitivity of the counting system is dependent on the degree of 235U enrichment, analyses of the subject's fecal voidings (provided during the week prior to measurement) were used to determine the mean storage of U in the lungs, and also the radiologic significance of this value with regard to the more dominant 234U isotope arising from its high specific activity. In this case, before chemical analysis, a lung was placed in a standard man phantom to test the validity of the previous in vivo measurement. The results of these analyses show that the Whole Body Counter system has a measurement capability of the order of 50% of the maximum permissible level as derived from ICRP (dependent upon isotopic composition and subject to chest wall thickness). Radiochemical analyses of the autopsy tissues were also carried out in the Bioanalytical Laboratories, BNFL, Windscale. In other subjects, it has been observed that the biologic half-life in lung of UO2 is significantly longer than the period between the original in vivo measurement and the analysis of the autopsy samples, such that the relative change in the lung content would be less than 10%. On this basis a table is presented in which the assessments of uranium in the lung are presented. The mediastinal tissue includes the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and if the U should reside essentially in these, and if the mass lymph nodes would be similar to that described by Pochin then they would contain about 1 μg U/g. This is at variance with earlier measurements that these are critical tissues regardless of the physicochemical form and atmospheric concentration of UO2 and other oxides, but in agreement with the conclusions of Donoghue et al. (1972). The relative concentrations of U in tissues other than lung (e.g. kidney vs liver, kidney vs bone) were in reasonable agreement with those reported by Donoghue although their subject had been exposed mainly to U3O8. The authors conclude that the results from organs taken at autopsy broadly confirm the in vivo chest survey result.",,"radioisotope; uranium; uranium dioxide; uranium; autopsy; body burden; coronary artery thrombosis; major clinical study; methodology; radiology; article; autopsy; environmental exposure; half life time; human; lung; male; mediastinum; radiation monitoring; Autopsy; Environmental Exposure; Half-Life; Human; Lung; Male; Mediastinum; Radiation Monitoring; Uranium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017621861

The quantities of the absorbed X-irradiation doses in the fetus amounted to: 22.5; 74.5 and 154.5 rad. In the course of the post-natal development glucose and lactate concentrations were estimated in brains of animals which had been sacrificed on the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 18th and 33rd day after birth. The glucose content in the course of initial 10 days of life in the irradiated rabbits displayed the appearance of progressive decrease. This occurrence developed earlier and had a more intensive course in rabbits irradiated with 74.5 and 154.5 rad in relation to the control animals. The lactate content in irradiated animals demonstrated a characteristic course over the period in which marked glucose decrease in brain manifests a considerable lactate increase. After the initial 18 days of post-natal development, both parameters, glucose concentration and lactate concentration had the appearance of relative stabilization. The noted dynamic changes of the energetic metabolic processes in newborn animals after exposure to radiation of various sources and energies were proved by glycogen, glucose and lactate findings in brains of control and irradiated animals. Intensive glucose absorption in brain tissue with a high utilization rate maintaining reactivity and chemical composition of the nervous tissue was established. The central role of glucose in the energy metabolism of brain was also proved by the 'tracer' method. These investigations have shown that glucose metabolism in nervous tissue varies considerably compared to other tissues. Whereas in other tissues, 14C labelled glucose was converted mainly into glycogen, lactate and CO2, in nervous tissue 14C labelled glucose appeared after one minute in more considerable amounts in aminoacids, as e.g. glutamic, asparagin, glutamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, in alanine and glycine. The relative activity values of enzymes in brain which conform to recent data on the organization of glucose metabolism as well as the results of radio-active precursors provide a firm biochemical basis for the unique part of glucose in brain metabolism. The majority of functional and biochemical changes in the course of brain development does not merely comprise a quantitative increase of enzyme activity. A specific structural organization of the metabolic pathway arises and gives rise to glucose utilization predominantly by route of glycosis in the cycle of tricarboxyl-acids. These biochemical changes correspond, owing to time, to electrophysiological manifestations of brain development. Imbalance of metabolism and metabolites due to low irradiation doses exhibits correlation with changes in enzyme activity; thus, data on the check up of these reactions in a certain metabolic direction with an altered metabolic route may be obtained. Data furnished by numerous authors demonstrate the nervous tissue to accumulate glycogen either when injured mechanically or by irradiation. The data on the changes of the content of carbohydrates and their metabolism in tissues following irradiation, even in case of almost identical doses exhibits correlation with changes in enzyme activity. The assumption that glycogenolysis drop due to irradiation, plays a significant part in glycogen storage following brain irradiation, seems likely.",,"glucose; glycogen; lactic acid; radioisotope; animal experiment; brain; central nervous system; female genital system; fetus; pregnancy; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017612767

For calves receiving dried forage only, the carbohydrate content of mixed bacteria varied with time after feeding, reaching a maximum of approximately 140 g/kg dry matter (dm) after 0.5-1 h, decreasing to about 60 g/kg DM after 4 h. 3, Replacement of part of the dried forage with glucose to give a similar metabolizable energy intake but approximately half as much nitrogen, produced a similar pattern of change with time after feeding but resulted in a markedly increased maximum bacterial carbohydrate content (approximately 230 g/kg dm). Addition of urea to this diet reduced the bacterial accumulation of carbohydrate to approximately the same level as was found in samples from calves receiving forage only diets. For the forage diets the carbohydrate content fell to 60–100 g/kg dm 4 h after feeding. For the hay and cereal diet the value was 170 g/kg DM at this time. 4. Changes in bacterial carbohydrate content were largely a result of changes in storage polysaccharide (a-dextran) content. 5.

The time of acidic methylation (first step of the collagen activation process) was important to obtain a good enzymatic surfacic activity. Homogeneity of the coupling procedure on the surface of collagen films was shown. Some properties of free enzyme were not affected after grafting: optimum pH and temperature, activation energy, and Km for maltose. Heat stability of the bound enzyme was slightly better; Km for soluble starch increased fivefold. In contrast, the maximal velocity in the presence of soluble starch remained four times that of maltose hydrolysis. Amyloglucosidase collagen membranes were used in a helicoidal reactor to produce glucose from maltose or soluble starch solutions. Tracer studies have shown that the helicoidal reactor behaved as a CSTR. The influence of maltose concentration and flow rate on conversion was studied and confirmed the absence of diffusional limitations for maltose. Recycling of concentrated solutions of maltose and soluble starch indicated strong diffusional restrictions for soluble starch. The catalytic support kept all its activity for 18 days continuous operation at 40°C and 80% after 17 months storage at 4°C.

The polyglucose is laid down within the cells as rosette-like granules, which are made up from smaller grains. The size of each granule appears to be limited to less than 30 nm, since an increase in polyglucose content leads to more granules being formed rather than an increase in granule size. The polyglucose in washed cells is fermented in the dark to acetate, propionate, caproate and succinate, of which acetate by far comprises the largest fraction (68%). During incubation of washed cells without hydrogen donor, the level of polyglucose decreases regardless of whether the cells are incubated in the dark or in the light. Since the products formed from polyglucose under the two different conditions are not the same, it is suggested that polyglucose in the dark serves as an energy source, whereas when in the light the role of polyglucose is mainly to provide the cell with reducing power. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorobium; Dark metabolism; Polyglucose","glucose; polysaccharide; bacterium; electron microscopy; in vitro study; microorganism; theoretical study; Darkness; Glycogen; Light; Microscopy, Electron; Rhodospirillales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017599630

The enzyme is a monomer of molecular weight 55,000 ± 6000 and occurs in mantle muscle in a single electrophoretic form with a specific activity of 310 units/g wet wt at 25 °C. The pH optima are 8.2 and 6.9 in the arginine phosphate-synthesizing and ATP-synthesizing directions, respectively. The divalent cation requirement of the enzyme is satisfied by Mg2+ or Mn2+ but added Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ are inhibitory. Monovalent ions (NH4+, K+, Na+, Cl-) inhibit the enzyme. Michaelis constants for ATP and arginine (both measured at pH 7.6) and for ADP and arginine phosphate (pH 7.2) are 0.8, 1.0, 0.2, and 3.5 mm, respectively, the Km's for any one substrate being independent of the concentration of its cosubstrate. Of over 40 metabolites tested for in vitro effects on the purified enzyme, only NADH, within its physiological range, affected enzyme activity. NADH is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of 0.15 mm. Like other enzymes of energy metabolism in squid mantle muscle, arginine kinase is tightly regulated, its activity being closely integrated with that of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle by NADH control. A theory is proposed, based on the data obtained, that the arginine kinase/arginine phosphate system in this highly aerobic muscle serves to reversibly regulate glycolytic flux and that its role in ""energy storage"" is very limited. © 1977.",,"arginine kinase; creatine phosphate; in vitro study; invertebrate; muscle; phosphagen kinase; theoretical study; Ammonia; Animal; Arginine; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Muscles; NAD; Phosphotransferases; Potassium; Sodium; Squid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017594808

The results of many simulations of the air heating system are used to establish the relationship between system performance and the system design and meteorological variables. The results are presented in analytic and graphical form, referred to as an f-chart for solar air heating systems.

A critique of permalloy versus implanted contiguous-disk devices is made, pointing out their basic difference in magnetization reversal processes and explaining the superiority of the latter over the former in achieving a good edge affinity of bubbles. The requirements for a good implanted device are reviewed, including the selection of garnet material parameters (K1, λ111), of implantation parameters (ion energy and dosage) and of device pattern geometry (thickness and shape of implanted layer). An understanding of these requirements has made it possible to demonstrate 1-µm bubble propagation in several contiguous-disk type circuits with 4.5-µm periods, yielding an areal density of over 3 × 107 bit/in2 made by conventional photolithography.

The formalism is applied to a simple one-room building. By making a few simplifying assumptions and by considering only one- or two-layer walls and roofs, the equations are kept sufficiently short to preserve the insight of the reader into the effects of a few construction features upon the building's thermal response. Such construction features, mainly the placement of insulation inside or outside the main wall mass, are extensively discussed, with an eye on their potential energy savings. The results are: (1) the placement of insulation outside the wall masonry reduces the amplitude of the internal temperature swing caused by weather conditions and by internal heat gains. If the inside temperature is left free to oscillate within a few degrees, the amplitude of the heating or cooling load is greatly reduced, allowing for substantial energy savings. However, the building is thermally sluggish and inefficient durign thermostat setbacks because of its large wall heat storage. (2) Inside placement of insulation increases the room temperature response to weather conditions and to internal heat gains. Thus, heating or cooling is needed for temperature peak-shaving.

The radiation trap consists of fixed insulating layer separated from the flat roof and glazing, protected by hinged insulating panel, in the southern gap between the roof and the fixed insulation. This fixed insulating layer is covered by corrugated metal sheets, painted white, which serve as nocturnal radiators in summer. The radiation trap is integrated with the building, thermally as well as architecturally. In winter the sun energy penetrates through the glazing and is absorbed directly in the roof, which serves as a combined collector, storage for one night and heat distribution system. The hot air in the space between the flat roof and the fixed insulation is blown into a thermal storage of gravel, under the floor or inside the building. The stored heat is ""recovered"" by forced convection during cloudy days. In summer the penetration of solar radiation during daytime is prevented by the hinged insulating panel. At night the painted external metal layer is cooled by outgoing radiation and the air under the corrugations is blown into the space of the radiation trap and cools the roof, which, in turn, serves as a heat sink during the next day.

The same solution applies to a rod of a cubic crystal with the rod axis oriented along a (111) direction. From the static solution, the limiting value of the torsional wave speed at zero frequency Vo is found to satisfy ρV02 =c44 -c142/c66. A very low frequency approximation to the displacement functions in a torsional wave is obtained by postulating wave expressions that reduce to the static expressions in the low-frequency limit and which satisfy the most important of the boundary conditions. The average kinetic and potential energies are calculated from these expressions. Use of Rayleigh's principle that the average kinetic energy should equal the average potential energy in the wave then yields a low-frequency approximation to the dispersion curve. Expressions which are valid over a larger frequency range are then derived through the use of a systematic asymptotic expansion of the displacement functions and propagation constant in powers of a dimensionless frequency parameter.

The safe storage of the ingredients and products of these processes, the controlled disposal of waste and the successful harnessing of the reaction energies are all problems which tax our technological resources. There is now sufficient evidence from recent years to demonstrate the potential of fault situations to cause vast economic losses in terms of plant damage and loss of production, to cause loss of life and injury to numbers of operators and in some cases to cause the effects of the catastrophe to extend far beyond the bounds of the factory fence. The need to objectively measure and regulate reliability has now long since been clear and has stimulated the growth of a formalised methodology of reliability assessment which finds expression in quantitative terms. This quantitative component of assessment offers an analogue scale of performance estimation. By this means alternative design strategies can be decisively compared and the reliability spectrum of the component-sections (at any chosen hierarchical level) of a system can be derived. Also the reliability performance of a system may be assessed with respect to some quoted target criterion. Such a target criterion may be derived in reference to plant economics, plant safety or both. Thus a definitive means of gauging the adequacy of the reliability of systems is provided which is increasingly of value as the scales of our technological activities grow. The ability to regulate the reliability of plant to satisfy explicitly derived performance requirements clearly places a valuable and reassuring tool in the hands of the designer. Not only does the tool enable the correct level of reliability to be designed into a system (which is itself cost effective) but also provides a sufficient break-down of performance constituents to enable the most cost effective means of achieving this level to be found. © 1977, The Institute of Measurement and Control.

The usefulness of this technique for investigating the importance of the domain interface and for studying the mixing/ demixing of domains has been demonstrated. By examining the percent rigid material as a function of temperature, a polystyrene/butadiene block copolymer showed little evidence of domain interface effects, while in a series of segmented polyurethanes, the interface was seen to be important. The domains of a polyester soft segment and diphenylmethane diisocyanate hard segment polyurethane were mixed by annealing at 170°C. Examination of the demixing process as a function of storage temperature enabled an activation energy for domain formation of 36 ± 5 kcal/mole to be calculated. In a series of polyurethanes with varying amounts of hard segments, the material with the least amount of hard segments showed evidence of soft segment crystallinity. The mixing proces in this series was interpreted in terms of shifting correlation frequency distributions.

During periods when off-peak electrical power was available, the water battery would produce hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis of water; during peak demand periods the water battery would be operated in the reverse mode, functioning as a fuel cell by producing electrical power through the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen held in its storage vessels. The analysis involved characterisation of the PSE&amp;G system demand requirements now and in the future, its current off-peak energy availability, the typical sizing and placement of energy storage units and the approximate break even economics and potential advantages to the utility of a water battery energy storage system. In the economic analysis, the water battery was compared with the gas turbine and the fuel cell for cost effectiveness in meeting peak and intermediate power demands, respectively. Compared with a 'reformer-type' fuel cell (costed at $300/kW for intermediate duty) the break even capital cost of a 50% efficient water battery would be $100/kW plus about $200/kW for each increase of $1/106 Btu above the reference cost of $1/106 Btu for fossil fuel. The available margin would increase about $50/kW for each decrease of 1 mill/kWh in off-peak energy cost below the reference cost of 8 mills/kWh. In a similar comparison with the gas turbine (costed at $135/kW) for peaking duty, the break even cost of a 50% efficient water battery would be $100/kW. The break even cost could rise about $100/kW for each increase in fossil fuel cost of $1/106 Btu and about $20/kW for each decrease in off-peak energy cost of 1 mill/kWh. © 1977.",,"ELECTRIC UTILITIES; HYDROGEN - Manufacture; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017512414

These can be avoided by pumping up the beam in the accumulator. When the current stack is injected into the storage ring, potentially harmful instability is essentially neutralized. Second, high-field magnets characteristic of future high energy proton rings are designed with superconducting coils within the iron magnetic shield. This means coil construction and placement errors propagate rapidly within the beam aperture. An intermediate “stacking ring” allows the minimum use of the superconducting ring aperture.

Extremely low joule loss cryogenic disconnects are required between storage coils in the liquid helium environment to allow charging the coils in series over a prolonged time, then to isolate the coils for parallel fast discharging into the load. Another switch must break the current in the series charging loop and absorb the energy from the stray inductance. This action will allow the subsequent opening of the cryogenic disconnects under near zero current condition. The current now has been transferred to the many paralled circuits, each containing a high current, high voltage interrupter. The opening and arc commutation of the interrupter starts the energy transfer into the load. The primary activities associated with the cryogenic disconnect have been testing and development of contact materials, configurations, and closing forces for carrying 26 kA with a resistance less than 40 n Ω, and development of an actuating system that is both reliable and fast acting in a liquid helium environment. The charging loop switch will include a continuous duty switch and a vacuum interrupter. The continuous duty switch resistance can be an order of magnitude larger than that of the cryogenic disconnect because it does not present a refrigeration load. The HVDC interrupter must break 26 kA and withstand 60 kV during the energy transfer time of 700 μs. Testing in progress already has shown successful interruption using single vacuum interrupters up to 31 kA and 66 kV.

Nuclear base sources plus hydroelectric pumped-storage for peaking provide two excellent means for attaining both purposes. Numerous sites and the necessary technology are available for pumped-storage development at cost between $240 and $320 per kilowatt. The low operating cost of pumped-storage provides a significant cost credit in comparative evaluations with other peaking plants. Pumped-storage use in the United States has been impeded by legal and other obstacles, but pumped-storage use should increase in the future. The purpose of this paper is to present a very brief review of the current state of pumped-storage, with a cataloging of its benefits and problems, and a brief summary of future potentialities. Pumped-storage is, of course, a source of power and energy for supplying peak loads. It serves other useful purposes additionally. In supplying such services, it is part of an electric power system that has a larger and more important purpose. These days there is strong evidence that the public is not fully conversant with that purpose. The public's viewpoint has delayed or prevented construction of several million kilowatts of pumped-storage and realization of its benefits. The potential for pumped-storage is directly related to the public's viewpoint.

Typical scheduling procedures include a priority ordering constraint which requires that units be committed to or removed from power production in a fixed order. A dynamic programming model which relaxes this constraints yields a large combinatorial problem whose state space depends on the number of feasible combinations of generating units. Reduction of storage requirements is achieved through the implementation of data structure techniques. An example of the dynamic programming procedure with data from an actual system suggests significant coast reductions. A comparison with a case in the literature also results in significant savings.

For this application any change from vehicles driven by internal combustion engines to vehicles driven by electric motors can only be justified if the use of electrical drives results in an overall cost reduction. This criterion means that a direct current, separately excited motor with its speed controlled by field weakening is the best solution. In a conventionally designed motor the attainable speed range is limited to approximately 1:3. In most cases additional means for the extension of the driving range are required. If, however, the motor is equipped with an additional compensation winding, a controllable speed range of close to 1:8 is obtainable by field weakening. Acceleration characteristics are applied to evaluate the various drive units which provide advantages in energy consumption and disadvantages in the acceleration time, and vice versa. On the basis of test vehicles with various drive systems, design of the required control is explained. Additional requirements for automatic control are partially offset by the additional protective devices required to restrict the effects of faulty handling of a manually controlled drive.

In some cases parameters of interest can only be expressed as probability distributions, which complicates the modeling process. Here simulation methods are appropriate for developing a usable if not fully optimal solution to the problem. Since driving patterns vary from individual to individual, and from day to day for any one person, it is difficult to determine the daily driving range required for an urban automobile. This is a critical parameter for the analysis of electric vehicles because it fixes the energy density which the battery must deliver. A Monte Carlo simulation process was used to develop the United States daily range requirements for an electric vehicle from probability distributions of trip lengths and frequencies and average annual mileage data. The analysis shows that a car in the United States with a practical daily range of 82 mi (132 km) can meet the needs of the owner on 95 percent of the days of the year, or at all times other than his long vacation trips. Increasing the range of the vehicle beyond this point will not make it more useful to the owner because it will still not provide intercity transportation. A daily range of 82 mi can be provided by an intermediate battery technology level characterized by an energy density of 30 to 50 Wh/lb (66 to 110 Wh/kg). Candidate batteries in this class are nidkel-zinc, nickel-iron, and iron-air. The implication of these results for the research goals of far-term battery systems suggests a shift in emphasis toward lower cost and greater life and away from high energy density. In addition, if the implimentation of electric vehicles follows the “S-shaped” diffusion model typical of new technologies, the optimum strategy from the standpoint of saving petroleum is to introduce near-term, intermediate, and far-term battery technologies in vehicles at the earliest date at which each battery system can be developed to the point of commercialization.

The stacked-gate injection MOS (SIMOS) device is an n-channel MOS transistor with a control gate stacked on the floating gate. In the programming mode, electrons are accelerated by the channel drift field to energies high enough to overcome the barrier height of the Si-SiO2 interface and so injected into the floating gate. On account of the channel-injection mechanism performed in the programming mode, channel lengths of less than 4 µm are required. A combination of this condition with the stacked-gate concept is achieved by a self-aligned technique which defines both polysilicon gates by a single photolithographic procedure. By means of the self-aligned technique, both the one-transistor EPROM cell and the one-transistor EAROM cell can be realized. Basic structures of the two different type one-transistor memory cells are the SIMOS transistor and the SIMOS tetrode, respectively.

However, some capacity would be required which could operate not only as stored energy peak-shaving devices, but, which can be counted upon to operate as firm capacity in either the peak-shaving or continuous intermediate generation duty region of the load curve depending on system conditions. It was felt that this would provide the flexibility needed for more efficient utilization of existing capital intensive generation and transmission facilities. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis for “Dual Mode” operation of fuel cells as an intermediate load generation device using coal derived or distillate fuels during certain periods and as peak-shaving units in conjunction with electrolyzers at other times. In the latter case, hydrogen generated by the electrolyzer was assumed to be injected into the natural gas network during off-peak electric demand periods. During peak electric demand periods an equivalent amount of BTU's would be removed from the gas network for conversion to electricity. Based on the referenced expansion plan for the New York Power Pool (NYPP), it is shown that fuel cell capacity in combination with electrolyzers could generate net annual savings to NYPP member companies totalling $131 million (1974 dollars), including a reduction in fuel oil consumption of 30 million barrels annually by 1989. This assumes a NYPP reference generation system mix containing 3000MW of pumped storage hydro and the expansion plan with fuel cells to contain 1800MW of fuel cells instead of an equivalent amount of planned conventional fossil units. Other power system benefits due to fuel cell performance characteristics, both static and dynamic are analyzed. The importance of the type of converter interface selected and the corresponding system benefits are analyzed. The system benefits that can be derived from a force-commutated dc converter interface apply equally well to a dispersed dc battery storage source.

The electrochemical system considered was an electrically rechargeable flow cell with a titanium trichlorideltitanium tetrachloride1||ferric chloridelferrous chloride (TiCl3|TiCl41||FeCl3|FeCl2) redox couple. The preliminary calculations were made to help determine whether the redox-flow-cell system has an attractive potential as a bulk energy storage system for power load leveling. With the rise in demand for electric power, the problem facing the electric utility industry of meeting peak power demands has been growing more acute. Because present methods of meeting peak power demands are not entirely adequate the electric utility industry has been interested in new methods for meeting peak power demands. On the basis of preliminary capital cost estimates, size estimates, and several other important considerations, the redox-flow-cell system emerges as having great promise as a bulk energy storage system for power load leveling. The size of this system would be less than 2% of that of a comparable pumped hydroelectric plant. The capital cost of a 10 MW, 60 and 85 MW-hr redox system is estimated to be $190-$330 per kilowatt. This cost compares well with that of competing systems, especially when one considers that for many sites a saving in transmission costs (up to $200 per kilowatt) could be realized with the redox system. This saving could be achieved because the redox systems could be built in various sizes and located near the load centers. The other important features of the redox system contributing to its load-leveling application are its low adverse environmental impact, its high efficiency, its apparent absence of electrochemically related cycle life limitations, and its fast response. © 1977, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The multi-rimmed flywheel configuration is first chosen for this study because of its superior operating characteristics and versatility. Then the Kevlar-49/epoxy system is adopted as the basic composite material, which is sandwiched between thin layers of rubber. A general stress analysis procedure is developed for the multi-rimmed structure and a computer routine is established to investigate the effects of various material and geometric parameters on the internal stress levels. A maximum stress criterion is used for failure of the composite flywheel. The basic goal of optimization is to achieve a stress distribution such that each ring in the multi-ringed structure will fail at approximately the same angular speed. The parameters varied in the optimization process include the thickness, Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus and density of the inter-ring material, the density and thickness of the composite material, and the thickness of the flywheel in the axial direction. The optimization process demonstrated that this procedure can be applied in general when other failure criteria or performance characteristics (such as maximum kinetic energy, kinetic energy per weight and kinetic energy per volume) are preferred. © 1977.",,"FLYWHEELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017452917

An attempt to quantify the amount of sand in an outer bar is made with the major governing parameter of inlet hydraulics, tidal prism. In areas of high wave activity there appears to be a well defined limiting relationship to the amount of sand stored in the offshore bar as a function of tidal prism. In areas where inlets are exposed to lower wave activity, more scatter is noted in this correlation. Relationships for estimating the equilibrium storage volume of sand in the outer bar/shoal of newly cut inlets in highly exposed, moderately exposed, and mildly exposed coasts (where degree of exposure relates to wave action offshore) are proposed for use in estimating quantities of sand which will eventually be lost to adjacent beaches. A conclusion of the study is that more sand is stored in the outer bar of a low energy coast than in the outer bar of a high energy coast. An upper limit to outer bar storage in low energy zones may be a function of additional parameters other than tidal prism such as longshore energy flux at the inlet site and inlet history.

Whether an explosion of a hydrocarbon gas in the atmosphere will occur in the form of a deflagration or a detonation is largely dependent on the type of flame acceleration process which is closely related to the rate of energy release. Flame propagations at normal flame velocities in a free explosible gas cloud will certainly not lead to detonation. However, with sufficiently large clouds - particularly under adverse boundary conditions - the flame acceleration could become so high that an initial deflagration changes into a detonative process. Results of recent investigations, which will be discussed in detail, show that in a free cloud with deflagrative ignition (flame, heated wire, sparks) the occurrence of a gas detonation can practically be excluded. Apparently, free gas clouds can only be induced to detonate by a sufficiently strong detonative initiation. Independently of the initiating event in the practice of damage analysis, it has become customary to describe the consequences of an explosion by means of the so-called TNT equivalent. Therefore, it is attempted to specify this equivalent for hydrocarbons by means of energetic considerations including the propagation functions for the case of spherically symmetric detonations. Analogous to the safety distances required in the handling and storage of high explosives, a mass-distance relation of the form R = k(L)1 3 could be considered where L is the mass of spontaneously released hydrocarbon and k varies only with the structural shape of the blast loaded buildings. With the inclusion of an empirical relation which relates the quasi-static design pressure for a building with the normally reflected blast pressure of a blast wave, it is further attempted to establish a relation between the structural capacity of a building - i.e. the pressure resistance of a building structure for detonative dynamic loading and for quasi-static loading - and the unit-mass distance R L 1 3. © 1977.",,"NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017442616

Box 89, East Melbourne, Vic. 3002, Australia","Since the cost effectiveness of solar heat generating systems decreases as the temperature increases, the potential for large-scale use of solar energy for industrial processes is very dependent on the operating temperature of the process. Examination of a sample of the Australian food processing industry has shown that 70 per cent of the heat is used at temperatures below 100°C and there is no significant usage above 150°C. A feasibility study of a typical plant in Melbourne shows that it is technically practicable to phase solar energy heating systems into existing processes, and that using known techniques over 30 per cent of the annual heat requirements could be provided by solar collectors. The roof area is adequate for the mounting of collectors but space must be found for insulated hot water tanks to provide thermal storage. Since the gross return on investment in the solar installation is the value of the fuel saved, this directly related to fuel prices. In a situation where energy prices are changing rapidly, recommendations on cost effectiveness have no lasting significance. The paper describes simple methods of making accurate predictions for specific situations so that plant owners and operators can make their own judgements on cost effectiveness. © 1977.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION; FOOD PRODUCTS PLANTS; HEATING - Solar; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017434043

Starting with the deduction that matching with the external load ensures operation at the maximum power point of the I-V characteristics of a solar cell and that the internal resistance and efficiency of a cell are dependent on intensity of the incident radiation, the effect of variation of insolation on the performance of a solar battery-motor system is examined in general terms. The cases of cells with series resistance dependent on and independent of insolation are separately considered and the desirability of introducing new criterion in design of motor, when driven by a solar battery, is stressed. The role of a concentrator, in preserving matching and uniformity of output, is pointed out and its optimum values for minimum variation, arising out of the diurnal variation of the AM-value, are obtained for typical Si and CdS cells. The more important parameters, determining the effective efficiency of solar cell in a battery using concentrator and storage system, are introduced and the expression for cost/W, as reported in Paris Conference, is further refined. Methods for estimation of these parameters, keeping in view the concentrator used, are also indicated. It is found that shadowing and non-uniform illumination of the solar cell panel can affect both the efficiency and matching of the system. © 1977.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Concentrators; SOLAR BATTERIES; SOLAR CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017428522

Its combination of near-vertical collector and near-horizontal reflector. Its unusually large 8,000 gallon storage tank. Its combination of near-identical collectors; one on the house, the other freestanding. This paper assesses the contributions made by solar energy in space heating. The apparent solar contribution is approached from two directions: 1. (1) Calculation of ""Assumed Solar"" Energy-House heat loss is calculated and known heat contributed by electricity, people and direct solar gain through windows is subtracted; remainder is assumed stored solar energy. 2. (2) Calculation of ""Measured Solar"" Energy-Stored solar energy utilized is calculated by measuring the energy provided by the collectors, then adjusting for energy deposited or withdrawn from storage during each month, and for losses to ground from storage. The monthly ""assumed solar"" is compared to the monthly ""measured solar"", and reasons for differences are discussed. The distribution of the complete energy needs of the house (24,230 kWh for the season) is: 52%: Stored solar energy. 22%: Direct solar gain through windows. 13%: Electric appliances and lights. 9%: Electric space heating. 4%: Heat from occupants' metabolism. When the net heating requirement is considered (24,230 kWh less the direct solar gain through windows, lights and appliances, and people) this requirement is 14,802 kWh, and is termed the ""space heating"" requirement. This is distributed: 85% Stored solar energy. 15% Electric resistance units. Calculation of measured solar collector/storage tank contributions, when compared with those assumed from the heat loss calculation, indicate close agreement over the 8-month heating season, but wide variations in some months. Some of the variation can be attributed to uncertainties in measurements; but it does indicate a large storage role for the earth facing the uninsulated storage tank. © 1977.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR HOUSES; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017426823

Because of the small temperature potentials available from flat plate collectors, large masses and volumes are involved when energy is stored by raising or lowering the temperature of a tank of fluid or bed of gravel. This paper proposes energy storage in the form of heat of adsorption in beds of adsorbent material. This is most readily achieved by nominating water as the adsorbate so that water vapour is transferred to or from the absorbent from the humid air flowing through the bed. The large heat of adsorption means that the adsorption of a small mass of water liberates a large amount of energy which mostly is transferred to the air stream. It is shown that adsorbing materials can occupy a much smaller volume than non-adsorbing materials for the same quantity of energy stored, and that thermal insulation can be dispensed with. Provided that the container is impervious to water vapour, energy can be stored indefinitely. © 1977.",,"ENERGY UTILIZATION; HEATING - Solar; SOLAR ENERGY; ADSORBENT BEDS; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017415101

In fact, the function of virtually all systems is influenced by changes in circulating body fuels (glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, and ketones). The pattern of metabolic fuel availability in the maternal circulation is, in turn, dependent on the maternal hormonal milieu, notably the secretion of insulin, glucagon, and a variety of placentally derived gestational hormones, as well as the siphoning of metabolic fuels by the conceptus. Under normal circumstances these various factors so interact as to provide adequate fuel storage by the mother and delivery of substrate to the conceptus so as to ensure normal fetal growth and development. The most common circumstance in which fuel metabolism is markedly altered is maternal diabetes mellitus. In fact, the consequences to the fetus of uncontrolled maternal diabetes are so severe that successful termination of a diabetic pregnancy in the pre insulin era could be characterized as a distinct rarity worthy of a case report.

A review of other potential materials problems identified three areas of concern: corrosion of the fuel basket and canister lining, fuel sheath oxidation, and UO2 oxidation. Preliminary analysis suggests that the first of these will be minimized by the migration of moisture to the outside of the canister under the influence of the temperature gradient, and the second is predicted to be insignificant for periods up to 100 yr.

The studies showing this have now been extended to human platelets. Human platelets labeled with 14C adenosine or 14C adenine were incubated for up to 10 hr in vitro at 37°C. After 10 hr, about 12% of the total platelet 14C ATP and 14C ADP had become releasable with thrombin (4.2 units/ml). Lysis of platelets did not occur, since less than 1% of the platelet bound 51Cr from platelets labeled with this radioisotope appeared in the ambient fluid upon thrombin treatment. The 14C ATP/14C ADP ratio of the released adenine nucleotides (7.6) was similar to the 14C ATP/14C ADP ratio of the nonreleasable adenine nucleotides (7.1) 2 hr after the labeling with 14C adenosine. However, upon prolonged incubation (10 hr) in vitro, the 14C ATP/14C ADP ratio of the releasable adenine nucleotides decreased to 2.7. The adenylate energy charge and the 14C ATP/14C ADP ratio of the metabolic adenine nucleotide pool did not change significantly during the time of observation. The 14C ATP content of the platelets decreased by less than 1% hr of incubation at 37°C. These observations are interpreted to mean that the 14C is transferred from the metabolically active, nonreleasable adenine nucleotide pool of human platelets into the releasable adenine nucleotide pool as ATP and is partially hydrolyzed there to yield ADP. The transfer of ATP across the storage organelle membrane of platelets may be similar to transport processes in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and may represent a general phenomenon in cells that possess storage organelles containing adenine nucleotides.",,"adenine c 14; adenine nucleotide; adenosine c 14; unclassified drug; article; in vitro study; normal human; theoretical study; thrombocyte release reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017356286

Wastes will reside from 1000 to 3000 ft (300-900 m) below the ground in stable geologic formations. According to ERDA-76-43 either salt, crystalline, or agrillaceous rock formations could work; however, salt beds have received the most attention to data and will probably be sites for early repositories. To develop the repositories, large vaults will be excavated in the chosen formation. High-level waste will be set in metal-lined holes carves in these vaults. Waste will then be capped with a removable shield plug. When repository safety is proven, wastes will be set in holes without the metal lining and will fuse with surrounding material. If spent fuel is reprocessed - as has been the plan for many years - then high-level liquid waste from reprocessors will be solidified. Solidification will transform the liquid to a stable solid that won't decompose, explode, burn, or revert to liquid or gas in high temperatures.

Following the successful application of stability theories, programs in the areas of superconducting alternators, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator coils and inductive energy storage coils have been productive. The universal Air Force requirement for lightweight machinery eliminates cryostatic stability from consideration for lightweight designs of superconducting coils. Maximum overall current density is necessary. Serious transient field losses are induced by armature currents in synchronous alternators, conductive gas currents in MHD generators and discharge currents in energy storage coils. Shock and vibration structural support of the superconductor to prevent motion induced quenches remains a challenge to the machine designer. Exotic superalloy or advanced composite structures are required to achieve high stiffness and lightweight. Development of flexible multifilament Nb3Sn is underway to create thermal margin for superconducting machinery. The problems of achieving ultra-lightweight performance are reviewed with special emphasis on the interrelated problems of potting, structural support and cooling at high current density in an environment of transient magnetic field.

Data taken with this apparatus on a coil having an energy storage capability of approximately 7 kJ is presented. The apparatus described is essentially an electronic wattmeter. It makes use of a magnetically coupled coil to cancel out as nearly as possible the inductive portion of the coil voltage during charge and discharge, thus leaving a voltage which is due almost entirely to the coil energy losses. This voltage is then integrated and displayed along the vertical axis of an X-Y oscilloscope, the horizontal axis being the coil current. The area of the figure so formed is proportional to the energy dissipated during the cycle. Two different techniques for sensing the inductive component of the coil voltage are described together with data taken by each technique.

These 2.2-T, 300-kJ magnets are to operate at 10 to 12 kA with a safety factor in critical current of about 50% at 10 kA. The conductor must exhibit low losses in addition to being stable. Magnetic Corporation of America (MCA) designed a flat conductor using 1224 copper-matrix, monofilament wires combined in two stages of cabling followed by two stages of flat braiding. Two of these conductors were constructed, one with wire already on hand and the second using wire made specifically for this application. Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC) designed two rectangular conductors using 315 and 319 mixed-matrix multifilament wires combined in three stages of cabling followed by compaction in a Turk's head. The maximum transport current capabilities (It) of these cables were measured in hairpin shaped samples with the straight section under test in perpendicularly applied fields. The measured results at 2.5 T for the two MCA cables were 11.7 kA and 15.4 kA, and for the IGC cables were 18.2 kA and 19.3 kA (extrapolated). In addition, samples of the compacted and uncompacted major strands from the IGC cables were tested. The results of these measurements are compared with values of It calculated from the single-wire critical currents taking into account the adjacent conductor fields and the cable self-fields. Several causes of degradation of It in the compacted cable are discussed including those due to experimental factors. © 1977, IEEE.

Recently, these program goals have been reviewed and modified to reflect new directions in fusion research. The development of superconducting toroidal field coils has been assigned first priority for the Experimental Power Reactor. This effort, centered at ORNL, will have the extensive support of industry, so that large construction capability can be encouraged. Ohmic heating coils for tokamaks promise to be an even more difficult task, and an expanded effort will be initiated as funds become available. Magnets for mirror confinement systems should have the highest fields practical. Accordingly, LLL has been funded to develop multifilamentary niobium-tin for future mirror experiments. If successful, the material might complement the recent trend toward higher field tokamaks as well. Energy Storage development at LASL is concentrating on inductive storage for 1 msec discharge and a superconducting homopolar generator for 30 msec to 1 sec discharge times. The stainless steel structure is a major cost element of any magnet system. However, recent calculations have shown that a magnetic coil form affects the toroidal field ripple in the EPR by only a few parts in a thousand. Thus, an opportunity exists to characterize and develop less expensive alloys for low temperature magnet structures. © 1977, IEEE.

The choice of co-ordinate system, cartesian or internal, in which minimization is to be affected is largely a matter of personal preference as there is little to choose between the two options as far as speed or performance are concerned, although cartesians are probably slightly easier to program. Minimization algorithms based on the general Newton iteration, are the logical, and for practical purposes the only, choice of procedure. In order to obtain consistent and reliable results the maximum net force on any one atom at the local energy minimum should be less than 10-6 kcal mole-1 Å-1 and this can only be achieved by means of a second derivative or quasi-Newton minimization algorithm. The latter techniques are rather sensitive to poor approximations to the minimum energy molecular conformation and may be profitably used in tandem with algorithms (pattern search, steepest descent, etc.) which have poorer convergence properties but are more tolerant of approximate trial structures. The choice of analytical or numerical derivatives to be used in conjunction with the (Newton iteration-based) minimization procedure is again something of an open question-analyticals are faster but numericals easier to program and more versatile. With care, numerical first and second derivatives can be calculated only marginally more slowly than analyticals and ways of achieving this are discussed. Calculation of transition states and a procedure midway between trial and error and least-squares generation of force fields are also discussed. Finally the program which resulted from the foregoing considerations is described and an indication of storage requirements and program performance is given. The program uses cartesian co-ordinates, a tandem quasi-Newton minimization procedure and numerical first and second derivatives. © 1977.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011872065

With a total instrumental resolution of 0.3 eV at 57 eV photon energies, we have obtained d core line widths in the low 0.7 eV region, within 0.15 eV of the corresponding metal line widths. Correlations of the Sn 4d line widths and chemical shifts with previously obtained 3d widths and shifts show that we have minimized experimental difficulties such as charging and decomposition. The resolution in the valence band region is good enough to detect and assign a large number of the valence band peaks. For example, eight valence band peaks can be resolved in the Ph4Sn spectrum, and these peaks can be assigned readily to the benzene molecular orbitals and the Sn-C bonding orbitals. The routinely variable photon energy is sometimes useful for assigning peaks in these spectra. The broadening of the Sn 4d peaks is attributed to an unresolved ligand field splitting. In particular, the broadening is due to the asymmetry or electric field gradient C20 term in the crystal field expansion. From the known nuclear field gradients, the magnitude of the C20 term (-0.036 ± 0.006 eV) in the Me2Sn compounds is shown to be consistent with the |C20| values observed previously for Me2Cd (0.026 eV), XeF2 (0.042 eV), and XeF4 (0.043 eV). These results show that the electric field gradient splitting has to be considered as an important broadening mechanism (and splitting mechanism at very high resolutions) in photoelectron and adsorption studies. The 4d and 5d spin-orbit splittings do not vary with the chemical environment. However, the ratio of the d5/2:d3/2 intensities appears to be sensitive to the chemical environment and varies considerably from the theoretical 1.5:1 ratio expected in an independent particle picture. © 1977, American Chemical Society.

It is concluded that the classical picture of a single cis-trans isomerization step is the only one which satisfactorily accounts for all the available experimental data. Experiments are performed showing that this process is temperature independent over a range of 200°C. Photoisomerization yields for the free protonated Schiff base of 11-cis (and all-trans) retinal are measured as a function of the excitation wavelength. In contrast to the efficient and wavelength independent photobleaching of rhodopsin, the yields of the ll-cis↠*all-trans isomerization of the free chromophore are small, exhibiting a marked dependence on the excitation wavelength. Potential energy curves for both ground and excited states of rhodopsin are derived from the analysis of the accumulated experimental data. In variance with the behavior of model compounds, photoisomerization in the pigment proceeds via the quantitative population of a common, barrierless, thermally relaxed excited state along the 11–12 torsional coordinate separating the 11-cis (rhodopsin) and all-trans (bathorhodopsin) configurations. In the ground state, interactions with the protein destabilize the all-trans isomerization product, leading to storage of a significant fraction of the photon's energy in the primary step. © 1977, Walter de Gruyter.

In principle, the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for a given atom can be analyzed to reveal the radial distances and atomic numbers of those atoms surrounding the absorber. The requisite highquality x-ray absorption spectra can now be easily and rapidly obtained on solid or solution samples, using synchrotron radiation from the Stanford electron-positron storage ring SPEAR at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In order to provide the basis for an understanding of metalloprotein absorption fine structure, data for ferrocene, Co(NH3)63+, Co(OH2)62+, and a variety of iron porphyrins have been analyzed. The procedure used was to fit the EXAFS of known structures with a parameterized, semiempirical function: ΣiCik-β1exp(-2(σi2)k2) sin (2Rik + α(k)); where the sum is over all neighboring atoms, the distance information R, is contained in the phase term, and the other variables account for the amplitude behavior as described in detail in the text. These parameters are then used in fits on other known structures, and the accuracy of the calculated distances (Ri) is used as a test for the validity of the method. The results of fits on Fe11TPP, Fe111TPP(SC6H5), and FeTpivPP(N-MeIm)O2 indicate that radial distances out to four coordination shells in iron porphyrins can be determined to better than 0.1 Á. For cases where the interest is only in changes in coordination, difference methods of analysis have been developed which allow accurate determination of the geometry and distances to small molecules such as dioxygen which can reversibly bind to the metal ion. For oxy and deoxy FeTpivPP(N-MeIm), the Fe-0 distances are determined to better than 0.03 Å. At present, the interpretation of the EXAFS from an unknown structure relies heavily on comparison with model compound data. However, the present results suggest that a library of transferable phase shift and amplitude functions may be eventually compiled, and that curve-fitting analysis of the extended fine structure will be useful for determining the local structure around specific atomic constituents in metalloproteins and other complex materials. © 1976, American Chemical Society.

Changing the filter bandwidth in a way related to a change in the average wavelength should produce the effect at other average wavelengths.

It contains 2309 private dwellings, 26 shops and 17 public and quasi-public buildings, factories, offices, etc. The refuse-based scheme required few modifications to the existing pipework and boilers and in essence involved the tapping in of flow and return mains from the incinerator and its heat exchangers into the existing primary circuits. The boiler houses are on full standby in case of failure or malfunction. Income from heat ″exported″ and ferrous metals recovered is expected to bring the net operating costs of incineration down to about 3 pounds per tonne.The Sheffield refuse incineration plant is the fourth steam raising heat recovery plant in the UK. It comes into commission at a time of substantial cutbacks in public expenditure and the emergence of several other technical solutions to the disposal of domestic waste and commercial waste. The plant is a 2 stream x 10 tons/hr unit fitted with steam raising boilers of conventional water tube design. The installation is equipped with reverse acting roller grates below the boiler. The refuse incineration scheme is used to supply energy to a multistorey flats complex near the plant. The operating costs of the plant are described.",,"HEATING - District; Scrap metal; STEAM GENERATORS - Waste Heat Utilization; Refuse incinerators; cost; incineration; methodology; solid waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017167822

AG, Basle, Switzerland","Pletscher, A., F.Hoffmann La Roche Co. AG, Basle, Switzerland","The membranes of isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin granules take up catecholamines by an ATP dependent process which fulfills many criteria of carrier mediated energy requiring transport. This transport together with an intragranular mechanism probably explains the high storage capacity of the chromaffin granules for catecholamines. Other amines (e.g. 5 hydroxytryptamine (5HT), octopamine) are also taken up by the membranes, but to a different degree. This probably explains why amines normally not present in storage organelles, if available in increased amounts, may accumulate within these organelles and function as false neurohumoral transmitters. Two mechanisms of amine uptake seem to exist at the level of the granule membranes, one reserpine sensitive (transporting, for instance, catecholamines and 5HT), and one reserpine resistant (transporting tryptamine and partly metaraminol). Both mechanisms depend on ATP. Chlorpromazine interferes with the reserpine sensitive as well as the reserpine resistant uptake of noradrenaline (NA) by granule membranes to a similar degree. Consequently the mechanisms of action of neuroleptics and reserpine at the granule membrane level are probably different. There is only an incomplete parallelism between the inhibition of NA uptake by granule membranes in vitro and the degree of enhancement of neuronal DA turnover in vivo caused by various neuroleptics. Therefore, factors other than interference with the amine transport through the granule membranes must be co determinant in the neuroleptic induced enhancement of DA turnover in vivo.",,"2 ethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7 hexahydro 2 hydroxy 3 isobutyl 9,10 dimethoxy 11bh benzo[a]quinolizine; adrenalin; benzo[a]quinolizine derivative; butaclamol; chlorpromazine; clozapine; dopamine; haloperidol; histamine; metaraminol; metitepine; monoamine; n ethylmaleimide; noradrenalin; octopamine; ouabain; phenethylamine; pimozide; radioisotope; reserpine; serotonin; thioridazine; tryptamine; tyramine; adrenal gland; cell membrane; cell membrane transport; chromaffin granule; in vitro study; noradrenalin c 14; theoretical study; Adrenal Medulla; Amines; Animal; Cattle; Cell Membrane Permeability; Chlorpromazine; Dopamine; Octopamine; Receptors, Neurotransmitter; Serotonin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017092879

The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a system of closed tubules present in every smooth muscle examined. The volume of the SR varies in different smooth muscles (from approximately 2.0 to 7.5% of cytoplasmic volume) and correlates with the ability of a given smooth muscle to contract in calcium free media. The SR accumulates the divalent cation strontium and forms couplings with the surface membrane. Mitochondria are other potential sites of calcium accumulation in vascular smooth muscle, as indicated by the respiration supported accumulation of calcium (with a K(m) of approximately 17 μM) by isolated mitochondria and by the energy dependent accumulation of barium by mitochondria in situ. The presence of barium in mitochondrial granules in tissues contracted with barium and the presence of strontium and calcium in appropriately incubated preparations have been verified with electron probe microanalysis. Calcium has also been demonstrated in mitochondrial granules in frozen dried cardiac muscle sections and in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. This technique appears suitable for eventual quantitation of mitochondrial calcium content in vascular and other smooth muscles. Thin (actin, 50-80 A), thick (myosin, approximately 155 A), and intermediate (approximately 100 A) filaments are present in suitably fixed vascular smooth muscle. In rabbit portal anterior mesenteric vein intermediate high voltage stereo electron microscopy shows the myosin filaments to be tapered and approximately 2.2 μm long: significantly longer than the myosin filaments in vertebrate striated muscle. Actin filaments insert on dense bodies. The ultrastructural findings are compatible with physiological evidence suggesting the contribution of intracellular organelles to the regulation of cytoplasmic free calcium levels and the operation of a sliding filament mechanism of contraction in vertebrate smooth muscle.",,"calcium; electron microscopy; mitochondrion; sarcoplasmic reticulum; smooth muscle contraction; theoretical study; vascular smooth muscle; Animal; Arteries; Calcium; Mesenteric Veins; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Smooth; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017078231

The primary conclusion is that fallout augmentation by targeting nuclear reactors is of marginal military or strategic value.The implications of a nuclear power industry in a large nuclear war in the yr 2000 were examined from the standpoints of: target value of reactors, consequences for nearby population, and long term consequences of adding reactor fission products to the fallout from the weapons. The primary conclusion is that fallout augmentation by targeting nuclear reactors is of marginal military or strategic value. With the anticipated missile guidance accuracy by the yr 2000, it will be feasible to evacuate all reactors and high level liquid waste tanks, and add those fission products to the fallout. However, the augmented fallout is not intense enough for long term interdiction of strategic amounts of transportation or food production capacity under probable emergency standards for radiation exposure. On the basis of contribution to gross national product, 2400 MW(e) nuclear or fossil fueled power plants are competitive targets compared to the rest of the economy for 1 Mton warheads, and isolated 1000 MW(e) plants are competitive targets for 125 kt warheads, given the estimated size of the USSR strategic force. If the US adopts a USSR style civil defence plan, casualties from direct weapon effects on reactors will be largely avoided, and the principal effect of fallout augmentation over that caused by the attack alone would be doubling the 90Sr contamination on essential grain growing areas. In the population near nuclear power reactors, fatalities from the release of radioactive aerosols from damaged reactors can be essentially eliminated by the use of expedient respiratory protection by the population downwind of the damaged reactor. The potential dose commitment from the attack alone is estimated to cause the US an increase of 30% in the cancer death rate. However, this increase in death rate would not show up for more than a decade after the attack. Fallout augmentation from cratering reactors and high level waste tanks could result in doubling the delayed cancer death rate if: the USSR is willing to spend an additional 400 to 600 warheads to produce this effect, and if fission product wastes are retained in surface or near surface storage for 10 yr after reprocessing.",,"Civil defense; Nuclear power plants; radioisotope; atomic warfare; civil defense; fallout; nuclear energy; nuclear power plant; radiation dose; radioactive waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017054877

The variable adjustment of the delay between the preionization and the main discharge in a pin-grid double discharge TEA CO2 laser permits the use of low He concentrations (≤60%), and different CO 2/(CO2+N2) ratios (ranging from 1 to 0) at relatively high main discharge storage energy density (150 J/liter). The addition of a different preionization source (Lamberton-Pearson type) to this laser type leads to further increase in overall performance. This permits a completely variable TEA CO2 laser operation over the gas mixture [100-45% He, and CO2/(CO2+N2) ratio from 1 to 0] and the pump energy (to more than 200 J/liter) without the use of any sophisticated discharge circuit configuration or any seeded gas in the laser mixture.

A 50% decrease in the level of metabolic ATP (3H-labelled), which was essentially complete in 30 s, was matched in rate by adenine nucleotide secretion from storage in dense granules. Incubation of platelets with antimycin before thrombin addition increased the rate of fall in metabolic ATP, but did not affect the rate of adenine nucleotide secretion. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase secretion, which was slower than adenine nucleotide secretion in control platelets, was noticeably inhibited by antimycin, confirming previous reports that different regulatory mechanisms exist for dense and α-granule secretion. The rates of rephosphorylation of metabolic ADP to ATP via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were estimated by measuring lactate production and O2 consumption in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets and compared to the level of metabolic ATP (9-10 nmol/mg of platelet protein in the resting state). The rate of ATP production was stimulated at least two fold from 12 nmol to 24 nmol/min/mg within seconds of thrombin addition. This increased rate was maintained over the observed period of 5 min although the level of metabolic ATP had decreased to 4-5 nmol/mg within 30 s; the turnover of the remaining metabolic ATP thus increased four fold over the resting state although the actual stimulation of energy production was only two fold. © 1976.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase; radioisotope; thrombin; in vitro study; normal human; theoretical study; thrombocyte; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Antimycin A; Blood Platelets; Energy Metabolism; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypoxanthines; Inosine; Inosine Nucleotides; Kinetics; Oxygen Consumption; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thrombin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017095749

A body of theory on so-called reproductive ""strategies"" has yet to be adequately related to an independent theoretical framework on optimal foraging tactics. Some of the possible interactions and constraints between an animal's input of matter and energy via foraging and its output in offspring using these same materials are briefly considered. For example, storage and utilization of lipids allow an organism to gather and sequester matter and energy during a period that is not suitable for successful reproduction, but enable the organism to expend those materials at a later, more satisfactory time. Such interactions between foraging and reproduction lead to a sort of temporal integration, which greatly complicates estimation of reproductive effort (current investment in seed, eggs, or progeny) in variable environments. An optimal reproductive tactic maximizes an individual's reproductive value (the sum of all present plus the expected probable number of all future offspring) at every age. Reproductive effort should vary inversely with residual reproductive value (expectation of future offspring); moreover, the precise form of the trade-off between present offspring versus future progeny, which is itself sensitive to a multitude of environmental influences including resource availability and the immediate environmental conditions for reproduction and survival, dictates the optimal tactic at any given age. Simple graphical models of optimal reproductive tactics are presented and discussed. Finally, some promising directions for future work, as well as certain potential difficulties, are noted. © 1976 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957214126

If a semi-purified diet high in fat is fed instead of the chow-type ration, some strains of rats and mice respond by accumulating abnormal amounts of weight and fat. Their bodies now contain as much as 40% fat and fat depots are enlarged. Rats which respond to a high fat diet with excessive weight and fat gain consume more kilocalories in the same time interval and are more efficient in energy utilization than rats of the same strain which consume a grain diet. For these rats, if medium-chain triglycerides are substituted for the long-chain triglycerides in the high fat diet, there is a depression in food intake, accretion of body weight and fat as well as energy utilization.Blood makes up 3.5 to 5.1% of the fat organ weight.

Adult avian depot fats are composed largely of 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids and are mostly unsaturated. Variation in fatty acid composition among species may be attributed to dietary differences and physiological state of the bird. Storage occurs mainly by addition of lipid to adipocyte vacuoles without an increase in cell number. Daily cycles of fat deposition and use are of greater amplitude at higher latitudes, but in general the lipid stored during the day will only provide energy for the overnight fast plus a few daylight hours. Storage levels may be minimized due to the disadvantages of increased wing-loading. A variety of behavioral, physiological and morphological adaptations may be used to reduce the need for overnight energy reserves. Migratory fattening is largely a function of migration speed, magnitude of barriers to be crossed and aerodynamic considerations. Lipid reserves are greatest in eggs of precocial birds and are retained longer in precocial young. Adaptive strategies of fat deposition in young birds are related largely to the ability of adults to feed young before and after fledging. © 1976 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000321689

Although the delayed fluorescence probably arises from a back-reaction between the oxidized reaction center bacteriochlorophyll complex (P+) and the reduced electron acceptor (X-), the decay of delayed fluorescence after a flash is much faster (τ1 2 ≈ 120 μs) than the decay of P+X-.

The enhancement of delayed fluorescence at high flash repetition rates occurs only at redox potentials which are low enough (&lt; + 240 mV) so that electron donors are available to reduce P+X- to PX- in part of the reaction center population. The enhancement decays between flashes as PX- is reoxidized to PX, as measured by the recovery of photochemical activity. Evidently, the reduction of P+X- to PX- leads to the storage of free energy that can be used on a subsequent flash to promote delayed fluorescence. The reduction of P+X- also is associated with a carotenoid spectral shift which decays as PX- is reoxidized to PX. Although this suggests that the free energy which supports the delayed fluorescence might be stored as a membrane potential, the ionophore gramicidin D only partially inhibits the enhancement of delayed fluorescence. With widely separated flashes, gramicidin has no effect on delayed fluorescence. At redox potentials low enough to keep X fully reduced, delayed fluorescence of the type described above does not occur, but one can detect weak luminescence which probably is due to phosphorescence of a protoporphyrin. © 1976.",,"bacteriochlorophyll; in vitro study; microorganism; theoretical study; Bacteriochlorophylls; Light; Phenanthrolines; Photosynthesis; Potentiometry; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017155982

Also, they are adaptable to measurement of physiological processes such as respiration and energy consumption. We describe a flight-mill system with floating magnets and Teflon® bearings in its rotor that minimize frictional drag. Rotation (of the mill rotor) is transduced by interruption of a light beam to a phototransistor, which produces a signal monitored by a specially constructed event recorder. The event recorder temporarily stores the data from each mill and then transmits them in proper format for permanent storage on seven-track magnetic tape. The system allows simultaneous data collection from 18 individual insects and provides a computerized interpretation of their performance. The result is an analysis of all the significant parameters of flight that can be derived by measuring duration, velocity, distance, and frequency. © 1976 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864890009

After a resting period of up to 6 months cells of Nitrobacter agilis grow with acetate, formate, and pyruvate as carbon and energy source. Yeast extract and peptone were added to supply the organism with nitrogen and to meet possible vitamin requirements. 2. The length of the growth period depends on the substrate; it increases according to the following sequence: pyruvate, formate, acetate. The highest growth yield is observed with pyruvate, the lowest with formate. 3. O2 consumption is increased in the presence of substrates as compared to endogenous respiration. With pyruvate and acetate twice as much O2 is consumed, with formate 7 times, with yeast extractpeptone 10 times as much. 4. The ability of nitrite oxidation is largely preserved, except in cells grown with acetate or pyruvate in the presence of 0.015% yeast extract and peptone. Such cells have nearly no cytochrome a1. Accordingly, the cytochrome spectra of nitrite oxidizers grown under chemoorganotrophic and lithoautotrophic conditions coincide qualitatively. 5. The nitrite oxidizing system is inducible. It is induced by nitrite but also by substances present in yeast extract and peptone. Cells grown on acetate and yeast extract and peptone (0.015%) require 3-4 weeks before they regain the ability to grow with nitrite. Cells grown chemoorganotrophically with the same substrates and yeast extract and peptone (0.15%) start growing with nitrite as energy source without a lag. 6.

Results show the existence of three-dimensional (volume) radiative divergence in the canyon-air system. The results are compared with air temperature cooling rates (energy storage change) in the canyon. With calm, cloudless conditions, radiative divergence is the dominant mechanism controlling air temperature changes. In the early part of the night this results in air cooling, but radiative warming was commonly observed after midnight. Canyon-air volume radiative divergence is found to be considerably less than that observed previously above roof-level, and in rural areas. Measured cooling rates in the canyon are poorly predicted by a surface-oriented cooling approach. This again points to the importance of the atmospheric radiation balance. © 1976 D.

IFTE theory, derived from laboratory observations in the Double Inverse Pinch Device (DIPD), provides a quantitative extension of ""neutral sheet"" theories to include nonsteady field line reconnection. Current flow along the reconnection line increases with magnetic flux storage. When flux build-up exceeds the level corresponding to a critical limit on the current, instabilities induce a sudden transition in the mode of conduction. The resulting IFTE, indifferent to the specific modes and instabilities involved, is the more energetic, the lower the initial resistivity. It is the more violent, the greater the resulting resistivity increase and the faster its growth. Violent events can develop very large voltage transients along the reconnection line. Persistent build-up promoting conditions produce relaxation oscillations in the quantity of flux and energy stored (build-up-IFTE cycles). It is difficult to avoid the conclusion: flares and substorms are examples of IFTE. © 1976 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250385414

Photographs taken at 9 s intervals allow detailed information to be obtained about the site of the energy release, as well as about the evolution of the flare itself. Observations show that the flare occured in an entire arcade of loops rather than in any single loop. Sequential brightening of different X-ray features indicates that some excitation moved perpendicular to the magnetic field of the arcade at velocities of 180-280 km/s. The most intense X-ray features were located in places where the magnetic field composing the arcade had a small radius of curvature with horizontal field gradients higher than the surrounding region and where the axis of the arcade changed direction. We feel that the arcade geometry strongly influenced the propagation of the triggering disturbance, as well as the storage and site of the subsequent deposition of energy. A magnetosonic wave is suggested as the propagating mechanism triggering instabilities that may have existed in the preflare structure. This event demonstrates that all energy emitted during a flare need not be released immediately nor in the same location, thereby eliminating some problems encountered in many flare theories.

The same population of microbodies already existing in the zoosporangium appeared to be segregated into zoospore initials during cytoplasmic cleavage. Microbodies laid at the anterior end of zoospores and were part of an organized assemblage of organelles, the microbody-lipid globule complex. In the microbody-lipid globule complex, endoplasmic reticulum occurred on the surface of the lipid globules toward the zoospore's exterior, and the microbody, subtended by mitochondria, was appressed to the opposite surface of the lipid globule. The organization of the microbody-lipid globule complex changed as the zoospore swam and encysted. As lipid globules coalesced, the microbody-lipid globule complex became disorganized. After lipid globule coalescence was completed, the microbody-lipid globule complex regained its order, and several microbodies were clustered adjacent to a single lipid globule. The microbodies persisted even in the encysted zoospore, but they were found on all sides of the lipid globule. Microbodies isolated from zoospores contained catalase as well as malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, two enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle. When zoospores encysted greater activities of these glyoxylate cycle enzymes could be detected. The presence of glyoxylate cycle enzymes and the close association between the microbody and lipid globule suggest that microbodies function as glyoxysomes in zoospores and encysted zoospores. The functional significance of the morphological organization of the microbody-lipid complex is discussed in terms of energy production and the conversion of storage lipid into structural components of the cell. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017135606

The observed low charge multiplicity of the central cluster X indicates that this process is dominated by the formation of a low-mass system in the central region. In particular, we find that the differential cross-section for the process p + p → p + h+ + h- + p, where h represents a charged particle, shows no correlation between tA and tB and has an exponential slope of 9.9 ± 1.8 GeV-2 independent of energy.

Furthermore, extensive sub-zero temperature ranges in the air mass have been recorded. (A) The utilization of pneumatic energy in hydraulic systems has in recent times increased considerably. This is not only apparent in the numerous conventional air chamber applications for pumping installations, but also in instances where the traditional open surge-tank has been replaced by this form of stored energy. Since this enclosed air mass generally has a marked effect on the overall performance of the system, its transient behaviour needs to be thoroughly understood. During the past few years, a rational theory to describe the air mass behaviour by incorporating the relatively large temperature fluctuations in the air volume, has been proposed to replace the fundamentally-wrong empirical polytropic equations. This new thermodynamic RHT theory, although substantiated by laboratory experiments, lacked field data for further general application. Field measurements of pressure, volume and temperature are now available which clearly justify the approach postulated by the RHT theory. Tests on prorotype air chamber installations in Southern Germany, positively reveal that the relationship between the air pressure (p) and the air volume (V), cannot be adequately described by the polytropic equation, pVSUBn constant, where 'n' is a single constant value for a particular installation and setting. This field p-V relationship is highlighted by the direct online plotting of these two parameters, thus eliminating any possible translation of data' errors.

Both series and parallel hybrids were considered in a 1815 kg vehicle. To facilitate this study, a computer program was written which modeled the vehicle and, using experimental data, computed its fuel consumption and emissions over the 1972 FTP driving cycle, starting with a fully warmed up engine. This study indicates that, under certain conditions, the fuel consumption or emissions of the hybrid vehicle may be reduced as compared to its non-hybrid counterpart, but under other conditions, they may be increased. It is not possible to reduce fuel consumption and all of the emissions simultaneously. The reduction of one pollutant is usually accompanied by an increase in one of the others. The extent of the reduction or increase experienced with hybrid operation depends on the particular type of hybrid and on the engine operating conditions. The following table shows the relative effects of minimizing fuel consumption or any of the various pollutants. The table also shows which type of hybrid is best as well as the operating schedule and fuel control parameter. The fuel consumption and emissions are normalized with respect to the standard vehicle as defined in Assumption 8. This table indicates that the hybrid offers a small decrease in fuel consumption as compared to the standard car and at the expense of increased NOx emissions. Minimizing unburned hydrocarbons reduces fuel consumption but at the expense of increased NOx. Both fuel consumption and NOx emissions are increased when carbon monoxide is minimized. Very large increases in fuel consumption and in unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions result from minimizing oxides of nitrogen emissions.

The battery is one form of energy storage that has successfully found application in special-purpose vehicles for nearly three-quarters of a century. Heavy duty lift-trucks and tugs, golf carts and delivery vehicles are among the vehicle types powered by battery-electric systems. Personal transportation needs have been served to only a limited extent by electric vehicles because of the low power, limited range and lack of durability provided. by the conventional lead-acid battery. However, recent changes in the energy availability picture have necessitated reconsideration of the electric vehicle. In order to compare the efficiency of utilization of the Earth's fossil energy resources (petroleum and coal) by battery-electric and gasoline powered special-purpose urban vehicles, an analytic study was conducted. The guidelines of this study restricted it to three special-purpose cars that are smaller and have lower performance than conventional subcompact cars and a delivery van. The vehicle power train components represent demonstrated current technology. The most important guideline of the study required the performance levels and load carrying capacity of the gasoline and electric-powered vehicles to be the same. The results of the study indicate that a lead-acid battery powered, two-passenger shopper vehicle with a 40 km range consumed about 90% more petroleum per kilometer of driving than does its spark ignition engine powered counterpart. With coal as the prime source, they consume about the same amount of energy. Increases in desired range, performance and vehicle size beyond that of the shopper increase the electric vehicle energy consumption with respect to the gasoline powered version. The position of the electric vehicle is improved with respect to the gasoline vehicle by the development of advanced batteries, increased electric component efficiencies and an actual electric vehicle mass less than assumed due to a reduced mass compounding factor. An aspect related to the conventionally powered vehicle that tends to reduce the advantage over the electric is a potential efficiency penalty of the spark ignition engine due to its small size. Incorporation of these considerations into the study produce results more favorable for the electric version. The energy consumption of a nickel-zinc battery powered shopper is only about 30 percent more than its spark ignition engine powered counterpart considering petroleum as the prime source of energy. With coal as the prime source, the advanced technology electric vehicle consumes about 30 percent less than the spark ignition engine powered version.",,"Coal; Coal deposits; Electric automobiles; Energy utilization; Engines; Gasoline; Lead acid batteries; Vehicle performance; Electric components; Fossil energy resources; Liquid hydrocarbon fuel; Nickel-zinc batteries; Personal transportation; Potential efficiency; Powertrain components; Vehicle energy consumption; Electric ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072486402

As the cost of the wind turbine and its supporting structure is very high for the power produced (compared with other prime sources) it is desirable to extract the maximum practical power from a fluctuating wind speed. Normally power must be extracted over a wind range of wind speeds, and a load be applied to the wind turbine, appropriate to that speed, to operate it near optimum efficiency. It is necessary that attention be paid to the behaviour with high wind speeds to prevent damage to the wind turbine, its support, or the power handling equipment. In many cases power is required at a rate which bears no relation to wind conditions and storage must be provided. This paper describes the provision of a steady electrical supply, of either 50V. DC. or 240V. 50Hz A.C., at power levels of around 100W. (though these figures may be varied), from wind as a prime source.

H+ or OH‐ produced in excess of that required to maintain cytoplasmic pH for H+ or OH‐, the major process involved is H+ efflux (frequently by active transport) from the cell. IN higher land plants, much of assimilated N occurs as hoot protein; the shoot cells have no direct acess to the H+ and OH‐ sink of the soil solution. When ammonium ion is the N source it is assimilated into organic‐N in the roots. The shoot is supplied with a mixture of amino‐acids, amides and organic acids which an be incorporated (with neutral photosynthate) into cell material without damaging pH changes. Similar considerations apply to symbiotic N2 assimilation in root nodules. IN both cases the excess H+ generated in the root cell cytoplasm is exerted is excreted to the soil solution; there is no mechanism whereby photolithotrophic plant can, in the long term, counter intracellular acidity without resort to active H+ efflux to an extracellular sink. When nitrate is reduced in roots, the organic compounds involved in N transportged to the shoot are similar to those used when ammonium or N2 is the N source with similar implications for the regulation of shoot pH. The excess OH‐ generated in the roots is partly excreted to the soil solution, and partly neutralized by the ‘biochemical pH stat’ which produces strong organic acids from essentially neutral precursors. When nitrate is assimilated solely in shoots, the excess OH‐ is initially neutralized by the operation of the biochemical pH state. Storage of the inorganic cation‐organate in shoot cell vacuoles could lead to turgor and volume regulation problems in these cells. These are avoided when an insoluble salt (calcium oxalate) is the product of the pH stat, or when the cation organate is translocated to the roots where organate breakdown regenerates OH‐, whcih is lost to the soil solution. This mixture of biochemical, and long and short distance transport processes, enables cells remote from a large sink for H+ or OH‐ to produce protein without unfavourable pH changes. These processes related to pH regulation during N assimilation have important consequences for the carbon and energy economy of the plant. Copyright © 1976, Wiley Blackwell.

When the hays were fed at constant intake to sheep in metabolism cages, formaldehyde treatment depressed the concentration of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFA's) in rumen fluid and lowered the molar proportions of iso- and n-valeric acids, but caused either very little or no depression in apparent energy digestibility. It was concluded that formaldehyde treatment of the hays reduced protein degradation by rumen microorganisms and probably increased the amount of protein digested in the post-ruminal region of the digestive system, and that this was achieved without any serious effect on energy digestion. The hays were also fed for 50 days at restricted and ad libitum intakes to young Komney sheep kept in outdoor pens, followed by a 55-day post-treatment period on spring pasture. Voluntary intake was high in both experiments and was unaffected by formaldehyde treatment in hay baled at normal moisture content. There was a tendency for formaldehyde treatment to cause a small increase in voluntary intake in hay baled at the highest moisture content, but this was counteracted by its effect in depressing digestibility, giving no increase in digestible dry-matter intake. Live-weight gains were low in relation to intake, giving a weight loss in most treatment groups. Formaldehyde treatment significantly reduced weight loss and the effect was still present at the end of the post-treatment period. From regressions of weight change on digestible energy intake, it was considered that formaldehyde treatment had brought about a small improvement in the efficiency with which energy was used below maintenance. Wool growth rates appeared normal for the levels of intake achieved and were increased 14-5 % by formaldehyde treatment at ad libitum intake and 5-5 % at restricted intake. Residual responses to formaldehyde treatment in the post-treatment period averaged 8 %. The total amount of extra clean wool produced from formaldehyde treatment over bothperiodswas46and94g respectively at the restricted and ad libitum intakes, representing only 1-5 and 3-0% of the annual fleece production. Wool growth on diets treated with formaldehyde in sheep feed at the maintenance level of energy intake is discussed in relation to the concentration of protein-bound sulphur-containing amino acids (SAA's) in the diet dry matter. It was concluded that large responses in wool growth from protein protection of forage diets are unlikely unless the concentration of SAA's in the dry matter can be considerably increased from their present low levels. It is suggested that the possibility of achieving this through plant breeding techniques be investigated. © 1976, Cambridge University Press.

He also thinks that the OPEC could, in cooperation with Third World countries, initiate a new world bank utilizing commodities produced in the Third World as the reserve currency to replace US dollars or other currencies such as the SDR. Such a bank (with a currency that would not devalue, would become a ‘currency of preference’ for international trade, and would enable the enormous expansion of credit for agricultural production without inflationary effects) could be sponsored by the UN. There are, however, certain difficulties, partly technical such as the problem of storage, and partly political such as the reaction of the industrialized world.

Self-scanning photoconductor diode arrays are produced for a number of applications. Unlike photoelectronic detectors, these devices work by photoconduction and the incident photons interact directly with the semiconductor to produce charge carriers. The charge carriers are stored in the sensing element until the sensing element is interrogated. On the basis of the method of interrogation, these arrays are categorized as charge coupled devices, charge injection devices, and self-scanned photodiode array. It is desirable to develop a detector that combines the advantages of photoemissive detection with the intrinsic signal amplification of electron bombarded silicon, and the convenience of the internal storage self-scanned diode array. This chapter describes the type of self-scanning diode array used in experiments. An experiment is discussed in which a special electron gun was used to provide nearly monoenergetic electrons of energy greater than 40 keV to demonstrate the pulse resolution capabilities of the diode array in the electron bombardment mode. The chapter also discusses the technical feasibility of a self-scanned diode array as a possible single event counting photoelectronic device. © 1976 Academic Press Inc.

ITS is a device designed to obtain the moderate dispersion spectra of astronomical objects taking advantage of the relatively high quantum efficiency afforded by the photocathode of an image tube and the short term image storage by the phosphor of the tube. ITS is attached to a spectrograph having as its image forming component a folded Schmidt camera with external focal plane. Three electrostatically focused image tubes, coupled through fiber optics bundles, amplify the light in the spectrum. The spectrograph is provided with two entrance apertures such that separate spectra of the object under observation plus sky and the sky alone can normally be obtained. At present, each spectrum has 2048 channels and covers a wavelength range from 90 to 400 nm wide depending on the grating used, over the useful range of the image tube photocathode. As the device has a linear response to light input, it can provide sky-subtracted spectra on an absolute energy scale. ITS has been in use on the Lick Observatory 120 inch telescope and is currently being scheduled for 10 to 15 nights each month. © 1976 Academic Press Inc.

The development of an electronic image transducer based on a silicon diode array vidicon is presented. The sensor is installed in the vacuum column of the microscope so that the electron image receptor side of the target is directly exposed to the focused high energy electrons. The configuration results in a sensing mechanism that has high quantum efficiency and minimum information loss, which cannot be equaled by sensors using multiple energy conversion processes. The sensitivity of the image transducer described here is demonstrated by the quantum noise limited performance set by the input information. The electron image data is sensed by an array of 512 × 512 of discrete reverse biased diodes of 21.5 × 21.5 μm2 in size. The effectively discrete diodes are sufficiently isolated from their neighbors so that image integration is achieved. It is found that when cooled, the sensor displays storage capabilities that make image integration possible, permit low data rate readout for direct digital recording, and show a noticeable increase in dynamic range and improvement of target life. © 1976, Academic Press Inc.

Antiobesity therapy can be achieved either by decreasing the availability of exogenous energy substrates, thereby accelerating the utilization of endogenous ones, or by metabolic regulation, defined in the present context as intervention in the biosynthesis, storage or utilization of energy substrates. The chapter discusses potential antiobesity agents possessing various metabolic effects that may or may not influence appetite. Pharrnacological studies suggest that catecholamines in the brain serve an important neurotransmitter function in the regulation of appetite. Advances have been made in the identification of peripheral factors that influence hunger and satiety. The possible importance of hepatic and duodenal glucoreceptors and the mechanism(s) by which signals from these receptors reach the brain, where they are integrated into specific feeding responses are being examined currently. With respect to anorectic agents, the clinical efficacy of fenfluramine in reducing appetite and body weight in obese subjects has been established in several double-blind studies. Fenfluramine and mazindol in addition to their anorectic activity possess effects on energy metabolism, which although of limited significance in explaining their antiobesity action, may suggest other mechanisms by which drugs could control obesity. © 1976, Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956776441

In 1938 a solar user could recover his initial investment from fuel cost savings in less than 2 yr and anticipate a seemingly endless supply of free hot water. By the early 1950s, however, three primary forces combined to reduce the industry to a few firms whose principal solar activity was the repair or replacement of water storage tanks. (1) The rapid decline in electricity rates along with the increasing first cost of installing a solar unit reversed the economic advantage of the solar approach. (2) The widely held opinion that solar systems would last indefinitely was abruptly altered when the water storage tanks began to develop leaks. Tank failures often caused considerable damage and became increasingly costly to repair. (3) The emergence of the large scale builder-developer largely removed the choice of hot water system from the individual homeowner. In his efforts to be first-cost competitive, the developer installed the less expensive conventional hot water unit rather than the solar unit. Recent developments in energy prices and availability, however, have produced an economic environment more promising to a resurgence of solar water heating. Under certain potentially realistic first-cost estimates and projected fuel price increases, a strong economic argument in favor of solar water heaters can be made. Further, homeowner attitudes toward solar units are generally positive and receptive to considering the solar alternatives. © 1976.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549129398

Of these new uses, electric utility energy storage for peak-shaving, supplements to the natural gas supply and special purpose transportation fuel such as aircraft, show promise. The Study concludes that the development and implementation of new means of supplying hydrogen, replacing the use of natural gas and petroleum feedstocks, are imperative. New production technology is essential to support even the lowest growth estimate. Methods based on alternative fossil feedstocks, such as coal and heavy oils, which are less expensive and nearer to technical maturity than non-fossil production systems, should be made operational while these feedstocks are abundant. Concurrently, the long-term tasks of advancing electrolysis technology, researching other water-splitting techniques, and integrating these with developing nuclear and emerging solar primary-energy systems, must be carried on, together with work on hydrogen combustion systems and research in materials and safety engineering. Systems studies and assessments of the economic, social and environmental impacts of hydrogen technology are also called for. © 1976.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449147844

Supplements of hay are not essential but 1 kg good lucerne or grass hay could slightly improve growth rate. Urea can supply all the nitrogen supplement for animals over 200 kg: in this case, animal performance decreases (by 9 - 10%); it is wiser to add 4 - 500 g to the maize silage plus urea, to limit the decline in performance. For early maturing breeds, cereal supplements are not necessary, except during the last 2 or 3 months to improve the carcass and are mainly needed with low dry matter silages. For late maturing breeds, energy supplementation of maize silage is followed by slight improvement in growth rate, feed efficiency and carcass quality. The rate of substitution of silage by concentrate was found to be higher with moist cereals than with dried cereals and with high dry matter silage than with low dry matter silage. There was no difference in feed efficiency between ground dried grain and moist grain (either crushed and ensiled, or stored after propionic acid treatment and rolled) when maize grain amounted to 35 or 40% of DM intake. On the other hand, dried or moist maize grain had a much better utilisation when crushed before being fed to the animals. Maize ears dried or ensiled can replace maize grain as supplements to whole crop silage. Maize ears of grain can be fed as the basis of a diet, to which grain, some straw (0.5 to 1 kg per day) or hay (1 - 2 kg per day) is added. The growth rate is higher with ensiled ears and grain diets than with whole crop diets; feed efficiency is better for diets of ensiled ears (by 16% on average) and for moist grain diets (by 18.5% on average) than for the whole crop diets. Storage method for maize grain when grain is given ad libitum did not seem to have an effect on the growth rate, but feed efficiency is better with moist grain (by 10- 12%) than with dried grain and with ground grain than with whole grain (especially in the case of propionic acid treated grain for heavy animals). In France, the development of maize cultivation has certainly allowed an acceleration in the organisation of young bull production in such a way that maize and maize silage are synonymous with modern cattle feeding. Over the last few years many studies have been carried out on maize utilisation (whole plant, ears, grains or associations of these different parts). We are going to present here the main conclusions of the results obtained in France by INRA, ITCF or ITEB, for diets of whole crop maize silage and ears or grains ensiled or dried.

Many solid state phenomena have to be investigated in high magnetic fields, for which superconducting magnets offer many advantages, and are in common use today. Their industrial applications in magnetic separation and also for levitated trains are promising. In the long run, the most extensive application of superconductivity will probably be in energy technology. Superconducting power transmission cables, magnets for energy conversion in superconducting electrical machines, MHD-generators and fusion reactors and magnets for energy storage are being investigated. Magnets for fusion reactors will have particularly large physical dimensions, which means that much development effort is still needed, for there is no economic alternative-these, the magnets for fusion reactors, have got to be superconducting. Superconducting surfaces in radio frequency cavities can give Q-vadues up to a factor of 106 higher than those of conventional resonators. Particle accelerators are the important application. And for telecommunication, simple coaxial superconducting radio frequency cables seem promising. The tunnel effect in superconducting junctions is now being developed commercially for sensitive magnetometers and may soon possibly feature in the memory cells of computer devices.

Improved design and operating strategies are suggested to make more efficient use of off-the-self (or other readily accessible) technology for space conditioning. The use of Comfort Range Thermal Storage (temperatures in the approximate range of 65-75 °F) and special operational strategies are central to these approaches. Fossil-fuel heaters, heat pumps, solar collectors, electric driven air coolers, all can be used more efficiently when they are effectively interfaced with selected thermal storage systems. A central heated (fossil fuel) and cooled (electric air-conditioner) residence located in Long Island, New York, is considered as an example. With Comfort Range Thermal Storage, it is found that the revised operating approach leads to 50% savings in space conditioning costs, with the basic functional features of the building unchanged from those of a typical well-insulated frame residence. Additional insulation results in further savings. Devices, methods and strategies employed to achieve these results include the use of Comfort Range Thermal Storage as well as one or more of the following: 1. (1) Variable firing rate fossil fuel heater. 2. (2) Thermally purgeable fossil fuel heater. 3. (3) Outside air for all fossil fuel heater requirements. 4. (4) Separation of the combustion and heat transfer function from the thermal storage function of a conventional boiler. 5. (5) Use of off-peak electrical energy. 6. (6) User-oriented controls for space conditioning applications to allow conscious reprogramming of temperature to suit variations in life-style of the occupants. 7. (7) Control of energy flow at windows during the heating and cooling seasons. 8. (8) Comfort Range Thermal Storage in the temperature range of 65-75 °F. 9. (9) Functionally composite building materials. Not all the above options are suitable for inclusion in new structures. Not all can be retrofitted to existing structures. Nevertheless, substantial energy and cost savings are selectively possible in all cases of fossil-fuel heating systems. Retrofitting of existing masonry buildings promises particularly significant economies. Such structures are typically uninsulated. Retrofit strategies which include insulation, permit economies substantially greater than those which result solely from the insulation-prescribed reduced heat losses. Such retrofitting, as well as the retrofitting of substantial thermal storage capacity to existing insulated frame buildings can result in substantial cost reductions for space heating and cooling. © 1976.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Electric Power; BOILER FIRING - Energy Conservation; BOILERS - Efficiency; TEMPERATURE CONTROL - Energy Conservation; ENTHALPY; SPACE CONDITIONING; THERMAL STORAGE; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017275134

The aim of the study has been to perform a self-consistent analysis of a probable future fusion power system based on the philosophy that design decisions, wherever possible, should be conservative and should be based on present technology. As such, this system will not be the smallest, the least expensive, or the optimum Tokamak reactor. Rather, it represents a feasible system which we use to assess the technological problems uncovered and to examine possible solutions. The plasma is designed to generate 5000 MW(th) during a pulse and 1709 MW(e) continuously based upon a burn cycle with a 90 min burn and a 6.5 min rejuvenation period. The plasma carries a current of 14.9 MA and is designed with a double null poloidal divertor for impurity control and particle pumping. In addition, a low Z liner in the form of a carbon curtain is included to eliminate any source of high Z impurities. Plasma heating to ignition involves the use of neutral beam heating for a 10 sec period during which 200 MW of 500 keV deuterium atoms are injected into the plasma. The blanket design employs helium cooling and the solid lithium-bearing compound, lithium aluminate (Li2Al2O4) for breeding tritium. The structural material is 316 stainless steel and beryllium is used as a neutron multiplier. The neutron radiation environment produces radiation damage that considerably influences blanket and system performance. The most significant effect is the loss of ductility which appears to limit the usable lifetime of the blanket first wall to about 2 yr at a 14 MeV neutron wall loading of 1.16 MW/m2. The solid breeder blanket minimizes the tritium inventory but because of the low fractional burnup in the plasma and the need for roughly a one day reserve of fuel, the inventory is 17.7 kg. Induced radioactivity levels in the structure are of the order of 1 Ci/W(th) at shutdown after two years of operation. The main contributors to the activity are 54Mn(t1 2 = 300 day) and 57Ni(t1 2 = 36.4 hr). Afterheat levels are slightly above 1% of thermal power but the afterheat power density is low, less than 0.1 w/g. The power cycle involves a HeNa intermediate heat exchanger followed by a sodium-steam system. The sodium intermediary is used to minimize tritium leakage through the power cycle and to provide a working fluid for thermal energy storage such that continuous electrical output is produced despite a pulse plasma cycle. A materials resource study has been completed for a UWMAK-II type system and beryllium appears to present a particular problem with regard to adequate resources. Other materials that could present problems of procurement include chromium and nickel. A preliminary economic analysis has been carried out to identify major cost areas and this is described. © 1976.",,"TOKAMAK DEVICES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017267387

Optimality is defined as the maximization of the long term growth rate and/or survival of the population. The main predictions of the analysis of the optimal policy are: (1) The cells divide only during the night. (2) The energy for division is provided by storage materials produced during the day. Under most conditions, storage materials are produced in the exact amount needed to supply the energy required during the night. (3) Storage materials are produced only toward the end of the light period, while the production machinery is synthesized at the beginning of the light period. (4) The weight fraction of storage materials, S, increases when the light intensity increases. The duration of the synthesis of S decreases when light intensity increases, i.e. it starts later in the day. (5) Day length has only a small effect on S and even a smaller effect on the duration of the synthesis.

The basic model assumes that air at a given absolute humidity and at either a high or low temperature is available to charge or discharge the store, the air flow direction for the charging case being opposed to that for the discharging case. When air flows through the bed, transfer of heat and water vapour to the air stream is assumed to teh governed by surface transfer coefficients, while difusion of heat and water vapour in the fluid flow direction is neglected. For periods of no air flow, diffusion in the direction of the bed axis occurs; and for both the air flow and no air flow cases, heat transfer through the container walls is included. From the foregoing, three operating modes are possible-charging, discharging and no flow-and when charging or discharging there may be variations in the air flow rate. A repeatable random number sequence is used to determine the mode of operation at each time step during the numerical integration, and the magnitude of the random number determines the air flow rate. For this random number sequence the effects of wall losses and adsorption capacity of the adsorbent (on store performance) are studied. © 1976.",,"HEAT TRANSFER; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR RADIATION - Measurements; ENERGY STORAGE BEDS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017181467

Inst., Helsinki, Finland","Tarssanen, L., Wihuri Res. Inst., Helsinki, Finland","For the measurement of the ultrasonic fragility of erythrocytes a new simple method is presented. The purpose of the present work was to discover the nature of the ultrasonic hemolysis process and the determinants of erythrocyte ultrasonic fragility. Ultrasonic hemolysis is an all or none phenomenon proceeding at a logarithmic rate in which the membrane bursts into fragments spontaneously and the erythrocyte contents are lost. During progressive hemolysis the unhemolyzed erythrocytes appeared morphologically intact in scanning electron microscopy. The ultrasonic fragility determinants were sought by different pretreatments of the erythrocytes. The ultrasonic fragility was unchanged by the following pretreatments: swelling or shrinkage in NaCl concentrations between 0.5% and 1.6%, washing of the erythrocytes, application of different anticoagulants, storage of the blood, membrane injury due to papain, ether or mechanical stress, membrane rigidity due to formaldehyde treatment and, finally, oxygenation, deoxygenation or carboxylation of the hemoglobin. Consequently the ultrasonic fragility was concluded to be independent of such factors as the volume thickness index, the variations of the osmotic material inside the erythrocyte, membrane alterations or the variations within the heme grouping. The ultrasonic fragility was decreased by lowering the sonication temperature, by gel formation of the hemoglobin due to shrinkage of erythrocytes in 2.2% NaCl, by carbon dioxide and by glutaraldehyde treatment of the erythrocytes. The ultrasonic fragility decrease by the above mentioned pretreatments was concluded to be due to an increase in the hemoglobin viscosity. The ultrasonic fragility was also decreased by preheating the erythrocytes to 52° for one minute, a pretreatment that causes formation of microspherocytes more resistant to ultrasonication. This finding was supported by the lower ultrasonic fragility seen in such mammalian species whose erythrocytes are smaller. However, an even more significant correlation was seen with smaller erythrocyte diameters. This observation was supported by the observation of unchanged fragility after osmotic swelling or shrinkage of erythrocytes in NaCl solutions between concentrations of 0.5% and 1.6%, where the thickness is changed but the diameter remains constant. The ultrasonic fragility determinants thus proved to be hemoglobin viscosity and erythrocyte diameter. The ultrasonic fragility method was compared with the earlier fragility methods. Osmotic and ultrasonic fragility are different phenomena. Mechanical fragility can be divided into two types, that involving low and that involving high energy stress. The former is dependent on the membrane properties, while the latter is progressively more dependent on the increasing fluid drop like transition of the erythrocyte and consequently on the viscosity of the hemoglobin. There were two determinants of the ultrasonic fragility, hemoglobin viscosity and erythrocyte diameter, whereas a membrane effect was totally absent. Thus ultrasound probably behaves like an extremely high energy viscous stress. Moreover, a fluid drop or an erythrocyte with a smaller diameter or a more viscous interior is more resistant in an ultrasonic field.",,"erythrocyte fragility; erythrocyte membrane; hemolysis; in vitro study; methodology; osmotic resistance; theoretical study; ultrasound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017135883

In this paper, a technique is described for implementing a 3 kVp, three filter approach. Using carefully chosen spectra and logarithmic image processing, images are produced which are compatible with our previously described two stage storage tube subtraction device. Proper manipulation of the resulting difference images results in a final absorption edge image in which only the element of interest is visualized, with unwanted background images suppressed. Computer calculations are presented to illustrate the relative sizes of difference signals arising from the element of interest and from tissue and bone backgrounds.

Four healthy subjects were studied during exercise in water, using a swimming flume, and in air, on a stationary bicycle ergometer at mean skin temperatures of 30 and 33°C, respectively. Measurements included rectal (T), esophageal (T), and mean skin (T) temperatures, metabolic energy liberation (M) and total heat production (H), maximal aerobic power output (Vo max). cardiac frequency and calculated peripheral tissue heat conductance (K). The results showed that for a given M and T, T and T were about 0.4°C lower and the K values were consistently higher in swimming than in bicycling. The intersubject variability in T and T was reduced by considering relative (expressed as %Vomax) rather than absolute work load, but the differences in the body temperatures between the two types of exercise remained. It was concluded that during exercise in water where the capacity for heat dissipation is increased, the body core temperature (T) is maintained at a lower level due to the higher forced convective and conductive heat transfer from the skin in water. This reduces the heat storage at the beginning of exercise compared with conditions in air. The lower T‐ T gradient for a given H in swimming, which results in higher K values implies a greater skin circulation than during cycling in air. © 1976 Scandinavian Physiological Society","environment; Esophageal temperature; heat dissipation; heat production; skin temperature; sweat rate; temperature regulation; work","water; bicycle ergometry; body temperature; heart rate; normal human; skin temperature; sweating; swimming; theoretical study; thermogenesis; thermoregulation; Adult; Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Female; Heart Rate; Human; Male; Secretory Rate; Skin Physiology; Skin Temperature; Sweating; Swimming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017107736

Both in vitro and in vivo results using bleomycin labeled with a large number of different radionuclides have now, been reported. In general, it has not been possible to predict in vivo biologic behavior solely from in vitro data. For example, 57Co-bleomycin and 111In-bleomycin both have identical patterns in several different chromatographic systems and do not break down with prolonged storage in saline, exposure to heat, or other cations. However, when the labeled bleomycin is exposed to serum transferrin (and to other as yet unidentified ligands in the body) a difference in stability becomes obvious. The stability and biologic activity of 57Co-bleomycin in humans demonstrate the validity of metal chelation as a labeling technique for this specific molecule, and also suggests that other stable chelates will have useful applications. Although 57Co-bleomycin has the most desirable biologic characteristics of all the chelates of bleomycin, the extremely long physical half-life of 57Co of 270 days creates a significant contamination problem in the hospital. Because of this, the use of 57Co-bleomycin is limited to a few specialized centers. All users have emphasized the need for a better radionuclide to produce a labeled bleomycin with the same or superior biologic characteristics to 57Co-bleomycin. Unfortunately, the elements forming the most stable chelates with bleomycin (copper, zinc, cobalt, and nickel) do not have radionuclides with suitable physical characteristics for scanning. Copper-67 may become available in the future from high-energy linear accelerators.

The system was specific inasmuch as Ca2, Cr3, Mn2, Co2 or Cu2 did not compete with, inhibit, or enhance the process. Zn2 uptake was inhibited by Cd2+. The system exhibited saturation kinetics with a half saturation value of 1.3 μM and a maximum rate of 0.21 (nmol Zn2+) min-1 (mg dry wt-1) at 30°C. Zn2 uptake required intact membranes since only the binding process was observed in the presence of nystatin, toluene, or sodium dodecyl sulphate. Cells did not exchange recently accumulated 65Zn following the addition of a large excess of non radioactive Zn2+. Similarly, cells pre loaded with 65Zn did not lose the cation during starvation, and efflux did not occur when glucose and exogenous Zn2 were supplied after the starvation period. Efflux was only observed after the addition of toluene or nystatin, or when cells were heated to 100°C. Cells fed a large quantity of Zn2 contained a protein fraction resembling animal cell metallothionein. In batch culture, cells of C. utilis accumulated Zn2 only during the lag phase and the latter half of the exponential growth phase.",,"nystatin; radioisotope; zinc; zinc 65; arsenic acid derivative; cyanide; edetic acid; formaldehyde; fungal protein; glucose; hydrazone derivative; n ethylmaleimide; nystatin; pentetic acid; toluene; uncoupling protein; zinc; Candida; cell membrane transport; in vitro study; microorganism; theoretical study; article; biosynthesis; Candida; cell membrane; electron transport; kinetics; metabolism; pH; temperature; Arsenates; Candida; Cell Membrane; Cyanides; Edetic Acid; Electron Transport; Ethylmaleimide; Formaldehyde; Fungal Proteins; Glucose; Hydrazones; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Nystatin; Pentetic Acid; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Temperature; Toluene; Uncoupling Agents; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017101232

The blackened plate (1.5 m2) of the collector-cum-storage unit of this heater absorbs solar energy and transfers it to the water stored in its enclosure (140 × 90 × 5.5 cm), the water being in direct contact with the absorber plate. The collector-cum-storage unit is enclosed in a wooden box with 10 cm thick glass wool insulation at the bottom and one glass cover. Experiments have been carried out to test the performance of the water heater under four different modes of operation: (a) water circulation with a small pump (b) natural convection conditions (c) water draw-offs taking place when the water is around 50-60°C (d) water flowing continuously past the absorber plate with flow rates of 38, 60, and 75.9 kg/hr. The day-long collection efficiency under the first two modes has been ascertained to be around 50-53 per cent for a rise in water temperature of 57-50°C. For water temperatures between 60 and 70°C, the collection efficiency is around 65-58 per cent. No appreciable difference in the collection efficiencies has been observed under the first two modes of operation. The average collection efficiency under the third mode of testing has been found to be 64.8 per cent with 202.61 of water heated from 38.5 to 58°C. In continuous flow of water past the absorber plate, a collection efficiency as high as 71.8 per cent was attained at the mass flow rate of 75.9 kg/hr, when tested under steady flow conditions. If no water is drawn off during the day, temperatures between 50 and 60°C are reached at about 11 a.m.-12 noon, 60-70°C at 12 noon-1 p.m., and 70-80°C at about 1-2 p.m., the maximum being as high at 86°C by about 3.30 p.m. In addition a theoretical calculation based on Hottel and Woertz equation for the overall heat loss coefficient between the absorber plate and the surroundings for the hourly rise in water temperature shows a very good agreement with the experimentally measured values of water temperatures. © 1976.",,"SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017095073

A role for vitamin E in medicine is focused because tocopherol deficiency in man secondary to nutritional deprivation is a rare occurrence in developed countries. It is difficult to produce vitamin E deficiency under experimental conditions in adult man because of the considerable tissue storage leading to an extended period of diminished intake before depletion occurs. The deficiency occurs in association with intestinal malabsorption syndromes of various etiologies. Prematurely delivered infants, who begin life with marginal stores at best and who also exhibit transient malabsorption, are commonly subject to vitamin E deficiency. The role of vitamin E in medicine is discussed on the basis of nutritional observations divided into two broad categories: findings in patients with chemically proven vitamin E deficiency and those on subjects who possess normal circulating tocopherol levels but are placed on therapeutic trials because of diseases perceived by some physicians to be associated with antioxidant deficiency. The large clinical trials in which vitamin E is given at pharmacological levels for presumed medical indications and trials of vitamin E for bona fide deficiency disease in man is also reviewed in the chapter. © 1976 Academic Press, Inc.",,"alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; hemoglobin; lipoprotein; unsaturated fatty acid; alpha tocopherol; gamma tocopherol; alpha tocopherol deficiency; animal; blood clotting; celiac disease; coronary artery disease; cystic fibrosis; diet; erythrocyte; fat intake; human; lymph; malabsorption; metabolism; newborn; prematurity; protein calorie malnutrition; protein synthesis; retrolental fibroplasia; review; beta lipoprotein blood level; blood clotting; cystic fibrosis; intermittent claudication; ischemic heart disease; malabsorption; marasmus; pharmacokinetics; plasma; prematurity; survey; vitamin deficiency; Animals; Antioxidants; Blood Coagulation; Celiac Disease; Coronary Disease; Cystic Fibrosis; Diet; Dietary Fats; Erythrocytes; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Hemoglobins; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Lipoproteins; Lymph; Malabsorption Syndromes; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein-Energy Malnutrition; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Vitamin E; Vitamin E Deficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017094269

Although there is no generally agreed neurochemical mechanism which directly explains the intoxication effect of alcohol on the brain, it seems probable that the interference of alcohol in the normal functioning of the sodium-potassium pump leads to changes in the transmembrane potential. However, the other major possibility is that alcohol impairs the normal functioning of the brain by interfering with metabolic processes in the neurons. This could be caused either by disturbing the homeostasis of the metabolic pathways or by impairing the transmission of nerve impulses by interference in the release, storage, and metabolism of neurotransmitters. Before definite answers can be provided regarding the mechanism of alcohol addiction and withdrawal and the treatment of alcoholism, it is important that fundamental knowledge regarding the mechanism of intoxication be obtained.

IR, UV (solution), NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and GC methods showed no detectable difference between the long wavelength UV light‐exposed (yellow) and unexposed (colorless) samples of the pure compound. Long wavelength UV light exposure studies with several substituted piperazine analogs revealed a structure‐activity requirement for the color conversion process. The data indicated that the transformation process from colorless (or faint yellow) to bright yellow is photochromism (phototropy) and is dependent on the intensity of the “action spectrum” in the 300–400‐nm region. Studies in the solid state showed that heat‐induced fading of the color followed apparent zero‐order kinetics.

Activity of these endometrial enzymes has been compared between two groups: 252 patients with normal menstrual histories and 156 patients, all over the age of 40, with abnormal uterine bleeding. Material was obtained by endometrial biopsy or curettage. In the pathologic classification of the group of 156, 30 patients had secretory endometria, 88 patients had endometria classified as proliferative, 24 were classified as endometrial hyperplasia, and 14 were classified as adenocarcinoma. All tissue was studied by histologic, histochemical, and biochemical methods. Glycogen synthetase activity caused synthesis of glucose to glycogen, increasing in amount until midcycle, when glycogen phosphorylase activity caused the breakdown to glucose during the regressive stage of endometrial activity. This normal cyclic activity did not occur in the abnormal endometria, where activity of both enzymes continued at low constant tempo. Only the I form of glycogen synthetase increased as the tissue became more hyperplastic. With the constant glycogen content and the increased activity of both the TPN isocitric dehydrogenase and glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase in the hyperplastic and cancerous endometria, tissue energy was created, resulting in abnormal cell proliferation. These altered biochemical and cellular activities may be the basis for malignant cell growth.

(1) Deterministic environments: an environment in which pulses of low and high substrate concentrations alternate, the optimal level of storage materials increases when the variability of the environment increases. In an environment in which a substrate pulse is followed by starvation, the optimal level of storage materials increases when the death rate or the duration of starvation increases. The optimal level decreases with increasing duration of the pulse and with increasing level of rRNA before the starvation period. The dominant optimal policy is to synthesize enough storage materials for complete survival during the starvation period. In an environment in which a substrate pulse appears, the concentration falls gradually, and starvation follows only after a period of low and falling concentration, the optimal level of storage materials is usually that needed for complete survival during starvation. The synthesis will take place toward the end of the growing period, since the decrease in concentration is a signal for the coming starvation. (2) Probabilistic environments: even when the probability for starvation is quite low, it is optimal to synthesize enough storage materials to provide for a complete survival during the starvation period. The current hypothesis, that storage materials are synthesized only when there is a surplus of energy at the time, irrespective of the future needs of the cells, is criticized. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the synthesis of storage materials is according to an optimal policy which takes into account both the present cost and the future requirements for energy. © 1975 Academic Press Inc.",,"polysaccharide; microorganism; model; starvation; theoretical study; Bacteria; Biological Transport, Active; Carbon; Culture Media; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Escherichia coli; Mathematics; Models, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017073575

In Proton machines future developments can be expected to involve superconducting magnet rings as well as storage rings to obtain higher CM energies. In Heavy Ion machines the trend is towards developing higher current medium energy machines with higher intensities than the present ones. In the region of medium energy physics (Proton machines Ep < 1 GeV) a number of circular and linear machines are commencing to operate whose main advantage over the old F.M. cyclotronsis primarily the higher intensity. In High Energy electron accelerators the main trend is at present to use the existing machines as injectors for electron-positron colliding rings, whose luminosity and energy are being increased to satisfy the needs of the Physics Research Programs. Some years in the future there are plans for Electron-Proton colliding rings (PEP) at energies around 70 GeV. In the lower energy range of electron machines there is considerable development of Medical accelerators underway as sources of Pions, Neutrons or Xrays, the last being the conventional use. The electron storage rings of the Physics machines are also in use as sources of synchrotron radiation, for physical and biological research in the far ultraviolet and soft Xray region. The main developments in the next five years in accelerator construction are in the direction of using Superconducting magnets for circular machines and superconducting cavities for Linear accelerators. Fixed target machines will be used as injectors for colliding beam storage rings. A number of Heavy Ion machines will be constructed capable of accelerating all ions up to Uranium.

Storage conditions have also been varied. The erythrocytes, which were from healthy subjects, were suspended either in autologous plasma or in phosphate buffer. The heat effect, P, was shown to increase linearly in the physiological pH range: 1.2% per 0.01 pH unit. Variation of the glucose concentration within a wide range, 3-32 mmol/l, did not affect the P value. The temperature coefficient for P was determined to be Q10 = 2.8 for the temperature range 32-42 d̀C. A constant energy of activation was found, 82.6 kJ/mol, for the temperature range 25-42 d̀C. When the erythrocytes were stored at 4 d̀C, P values (measured at 37 d̀C) increased initially by 6%h. After 24 h of storage P was about 50% higher than the initial value.

Med., Osaka, Japan","Using the strip of vas deferens from guinea pigs, the contractile mechanisms of K, acetylcholine (ACh), histamine (Hist), noradrenaline (NA) and Ba, and the effects of the modified contents of Na and K in the bathing solution (BS) on the actions of these agents were investigated with respect to the mobilization of Ca. I. Actions of Contractile Drugs. 1. Shapes of the contractile responses to K, NA and Ba recorded on the smoked paper consisted of the phasic contraction (PC) and the subsequent tonic contraction (TC), whereas those to ACh and Hist showed only PC. PCs by these drugs are induced by the release of Ca from the storage sites. TCs by K and Ba are maintained by the energy-dependent active influx of Ca, whereas TC by NA is maintained by the release of Ca. Furthermore, since the contraction by Ba could be kept constant in Ca-free bath solution, it is conceivable that the direct stimulation of muscle contractile elements without the mediation of Ca mobilization is partly involved in the contracting mechanism of Ba. 2. In the muscle cell membrane there are three divisions with Ca stores: the first is the store where Ca is most easily released, the second is where Ca is comparatively easily released, and the third is where Ca is not easily released. K and Hist can release Ca from the first store, ACh and NA from the first and second stores, and Ba from these three stores for producing the contraction. 3. Contractions induced by exogenous Ca in Ca-free bath solution are produced by the passive Ca-influx in the low Ca concentrations and by the additional active Ca-influx in the high Ca concentrations. II. Effect of the Modified Contents of Na in Bath Solution. 1. Removal of Na from the bath solution produced a sustained contraction through the release and the influx of Ca. 2. The fact that after 5 min exposure of the strip to Na-deficient solution, PCs by ACh, K and Ba and TCs by K and Ba were potentiated, suggests that the release and the influx of Ca by these agents are accelerated in the Na-deficient solution. However, the fact that after 30 min exposure, PC by ACh and TCs by K and Ba were decreased, suggests that the release and the influx of Ca by these agents are subsequently inhibited. 3. Contractions by exogenous Ca in Ca-free solution increased at 5 min and 30 min but decreased at 120 min, after removal of Na from the solution. This finding indicates that the influx of Ca is accelerated and then inhibited. III. Effect of the Removal of K from Bath Solution. 1. After 30 min exposure of the preparation to K-free solution, PC by ACh and PC and TC by Ba were reduced. These findings suggest that the release and the influx of Ca due to these agents are inhibited by the exposure to K free solution. 2. Contraction by exogenous Ca in high concentration was more strongly reduced than in the concentration by the exposure to K-free solution. Thus, it is considered that in the absence of external K, the active influx of Ca is more preferentially reduced than the passive influx of Ca.",,"2,4 dinitrophenol; acetylcholine; barium; barium chloride; calcium; histamine; noradrenalin; potassium; potassium chloride; animal experiment; dose response; drug comparison; drug interaction; drug response; guinea pig; male genital system; muscle; muscle contraction; smooth muscle contraction; spermatic cord",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0017026571

It is found that, for example, the U factor describing heat conduction into the ground is less than 10% of the U factor of a well insulated above-ground building. The ground serves also as a heat storage medium for a yearly storage in an under-ground building when temperature fluctuations of a few degrees are accepted in the building and when the heat flux into the ground is the dominating heat loss.

S. is to augment the restricted supplies of fuel, while at the same time to control environmental impacts to an acceptable level. An often-quoted goal is to provide additional clean fuel from coal or shale corresponding to, say, 20% of current U. S. oil consumption, or somewhat over 3 million bbl. /day oil equivalent, or about one-half our oil imports. In view of this studies are currently underway to assess the impact this new coal conversion industry will have on the environment. In this work, the authors examine such factors as the flow rates of streams entering and leaving the process, the components and effect of sour water, trace elements and clean-up procedures.To produce clean fuel equivalent to 20% of current U.S. consumption would require 80 coal conversion plants consuming between 1 and 2 million tons/day of coal. The environmental aspects of this industry are described. The conversion of coal to synthetic natural gas is discussed, and the gasification process with steam and oxygen is illustrated. The specific areas of concern are solids disposal (refuse from coal cleaning plus ash, and sludge from water treatment), emissions to the air (those from furnaces and coal dryers, sulfur plant tail gas, from cooling towers, and CO2 from acid gas removal), water effluents (gas liquor containing phenols, sulfur, nitrogen and total dissolved solids, and rain runoff from coal storage) and trace metals (volatiles from the gas clean up system, from leaching of refuse and ash and from oil products). The typical flow rates of streams entering and leaving main areas of the process, as well as all auxiliary facilities and utilities needed to make the process self sufficient are shown. The system for cleaning up the raw gas is particularly important and will have the following provisions: cooling (steam generation, air cooling, cooling water), dust removal (high energy venturi scrubber), phase separation (tar, oil, naphtha, water), hydrolysis, acid gas removal (H2S to sulfur plant, CO2 vent to air, ZnO guard bed), solvent extraction (recover phenols etc. from sour water), and sour water stripper.",,"Environmental impact; Coal gasification; coal; pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016983919

Australia, the driest of earth's continents, will probably have a need for such water supply supplementation and industrial process application long before desalting is applied generally to agriculture or rural production. As the cost of fossil fuel gradually increases, it would also seem likely that the thermal energy required for desalting will come from nuclear fuels. In this paper the existing fresh water resources of the Australian continent are briefly surveyed. Present costs associated with supplying fresh water for industrial and domestic consumption to selected communities at representative locations of the Australian continent are assessed. The technology and economics of large scale sea water desalination plants operating on thermal cycles are discussed. In particular, the multi-stage flash evaporator principle is reviewed and its potential discussed. Consideration is given to the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear powered heat sources. Proposals are made for the control and conjunctive use of reservoirs and desalination plants. The optimisation of desalination plant size and its integration with reservoir storage schemes in two potential Australian locations is discussed. © 1976.",,"OPTIMIZATION; DESALINATION PLANTS; FLASH EVAPORATOR PRINCIPLE; DESALINATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016966871

A charge chamber was charged (evacuated) with a small amount of hydrogen; a valve was opened to the sample; hydrogen was absorbed (given off) until the plateau pressure was reached. The resulting pressure changes could be fitted to a straight line by plotting the reciprocal pressure versus time. The measured sorption rates are independent of pressure (up to 5 atm) and independent of the sense of sorption (ab- or desorption). The sorption rates measured range from 15 s at 0 °C to 1 s at 90 °C until 2/3 of the admitted hydrogen is absorbed. If the sorption rates are plotted logarithmically versus 1/T, the activation energy for sorption can be determined as 7.6 kcal/mol H2.

The Heat Storage Well concept evolved at TEMPO in 1972. Technical, economic, institutional, and legal aspects of implementing the concept are being studied. Heat Storage Wells offer the possibility of conserving a substantial part of the heat energy now wasted in generating electricity and of reducing thermal pollution caused by the waste heat. Large thermal electric power plants would produce heat at useful temperatures such as 300–400°F. Combined electric‐ and heat‐generating systems will require low‐cost, low‐loss storage of large amounts of hot water for periods of 90 to 180 days to serve both electric loads and seasonally‐varying heat loads. Compared to conventional electricity‐only systems, combined electricity‐heat systems can save more than 20 percent in energy, reduce the cost of both electricity and heat, and eliminate the need for cooling water or towers. Possibilities for changes in legal and institutional practices are suggested, such as making resource‐allocation decisions on the basis of energy units rather than dollars.

The 3 vitrification systems are the in can melter, the metallic melter and the joule heated ceramic melter. The in can melting technique uses the storage canister as the melting crucible. As the waste oxide powder falls from the calciner into the storage canister, glass forming frit is metered into the canister. The furnace surrounding the canister maintains the wall at 1050°C, which melts the batch. The metallic melter is a metal crucible with a bottom freeze value drain. Waste oxides fall from the calciner into the melter along with the glass former and are melted. The walls of the metallic melter are maintained at 1150°C by the surrounding resistance heated furnace. Draining of the accumulated melt is accomplished by periodically dicontinuing the cooling air to the coil around the drain tube. The joule heated ceramic melter is a relatively new method for melting high level waste glasses. The material that contacts the molten glass is a highly corrosion resistant, refractory oxide composed primarily of chromium oxide. In this type of melter, alternating electric current is transferred from immersed electrodes to the ionically conductive glass where it is dissipated as thermal energy. Dissipation of energy directly into the glass allows the melter to melt the glass thoroughly at a high productive rate. Test and plant experience with the 3 methods are described.A study is presented of the in-can melter, the metallic melter, and the joule-heated ceramic melter.

In both cases there are no longer any major problems with the superconducting windings or cryogenic systems, but technological problems connected with other components are governing the chances of large scale applications. For superconducting synchronous machines, after the successful operation of machines in the MVA range, a new phase of basic investigations has started. Fundamental problems which could not be studied in the MVA machines, but which influence the design of large turbo-alternators, must now be investigated. Fusion power by magnetic confinement will probably be the largest field of application for superconducting magnets in the long run. The present research programmes require large superconducting magnets by the mid-1980s for the experimental reactors envisaged at that time. In addition to dc windings, pulse-operated superconducting windings are required in some systems, such as Tokamak. The high sensitivity of the overall plant efficiency and the active power demand of the pulsed windings require great efficiency from energy storage and transfer systems. Superconducting energy storage systems would be suitable for this, if transfer between inductances could be provided with sufficient efficiency. Basic experiments gave encouraging results. In power plant systems and electric machines an extremely high level of reliability and availability has been achieved. Less reliability will not be accepted for systems with superconducting magnets.

In the presence of filler, the capacity of the matrix to store and dissipate energy increases, but the character of molecular motions underlying the dispersions observed is preserved because the temperature of the dispersions remains unchanged. The effect of water on the dynamic relaxation behavior of composites is primarily reflected in changes in the shape of the temperature dependence of the dissipating capacity of the matrix. The data allow the conclusion to be drawn that the chain mobility at the interphase boundary does not decrease and that no additional frictional mechanisms appear.

Eleven vocabularies were analyzed and integrated: AIP, CA, API, GA, INIS, TEST, GEOR, El, PA, DDC, and NASA. The following major concepts were considered within the scope: energy sources (fuels); derived products; exploration, production and processing; energy conversion; energy transportation, transmission and distribution; energy consumption, utilization, and conservation; power generation; energy storage; energy policy and legislation; environmental impacts; transportation modes (land, air, sea); propulsion systems; consuming sectors and economics; and international supply and consumption. The methodology consisted of 1) establishing term selection criteria, 2) analyzing individual system vocabularies for energy‐related terms, 3) processing energy subsets and 4) reviewing the integrated product and generating a final vocabulary. Three broad problem areas were identified during the study: 1) energy definition, 2) analyst viewpoint variances, 3) thesaurus format/convention variances. The conceptualization, identification, and selection of energy terms was especially difficult in several subject disciplines, including such areas as engineering materials, mathematics, electronics, explosives, psychology and other social sciences. Five types of synonym construction were encountered. It was concluded that vocabulary conversion, which permits subject switching, offers some degree of inter‐system compatibility. Conversion is the ability to retrieve all documents on a given subject from all available (and appropriate) data bases with a single query. When coupled with development of a standard system protocol, full information‐resource utilization will be possible. A prototype conversion guide (synonym table) was constructed for further study. One of the significant findings was that, without any additional intellectual efforts, conversion can be increased from 28 percent (exact match only) to 46 percent using exact match plus singular‐plural equivalencies, plus synonym expansion.

The contractions by K, ACh and Ba are exponential in shape, but consisted of phasic contraction (PC) and the subsequent tonic contraction (TC). PC by K and ACh are initiated by the release and the passive influx of Ca, whereas the PC by Ba is due to the release of Ca. On the other hand, TC by these three agents is maintained by the active influx of Ca requiring energy. Since only the contraction by Ba remains constant in Ca(-) bath solution, it is assumed that the direct stimulation to muscle contractile elements without the mediation of Ca mobilization is also partly related to the contracting mechanism of Ba. Storage sites of Ca in the cell membrane of this preparation are distinguished into three divisions, the first, the second and the third, which contains loosely-, less loosely-, and tightly-bound Ca, respectively. K releases Ca to elicit contraction from the first division, ACh does so from the first and the second divisions, and Ba does so from all of the three divisions. The following assumption was obtained on the antispasmodic action of Cd and Mn, on the basis of the influence of Ca removal from bath solution and of addition of high K to bath solution and the analysis with concentration-action curves. The antispasmodic mechanism of Cd and Mn is due to inhibition of cell membrane (competitive/ inhibition of influx and then release of Ca and subsequently competitive and non-competitive inhibition of influx and release of Ca) followed by the non-competitive inhibition of muscle contractile system, with the increase of dosage. © 1976, The Japanese Pharmacological Society.

Water is used both for heat collection and heat storage. Inexpensive layers of weatherable transparent plastic over the water suppress heat loss to the environment. The hot water is stored in an insulated reservoir at night. The stored hot water heats a thermodynamic fluid, probably Freon 11, which drives a turbine and an electric generator. A shallow solar pond system can be built using materials, fabrication techniques and geometries that are presently used on a large scale in U.S. insustry. A 10 MWe plant built in the Southwest would require a total area of about 2 km2 and could provide power for a community or a manufacturing process. The estimated busbar cost of electricity (1975 dollars) for a shallow solar pond system, which could come on line in as short a time as 5-7 yr, is 56 mills/kWh. This cost could be reduced with the development of improved and cheaper plastics and more efficient turbines. Another potentially important use of shallow solar ponds is to provide process hot water, up to the boiling point, for industrial and commercial purposes. Also, a shallow solar pond could provide hot water for the space heating, air conditioning and hot water needs of a community of homes or apartments. © 1976.",,"ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION; ENERGY RESOURCES; HEATING - Hot Water Systems; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS; SHALLOW SOLAR PONDS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016896119

Experimental results show that the bias margin in this mode is very sensitive to the magnitude of the field and its orientation relative to the start-stop direction of the drive field. In a T-I circuit a complete margin loss was observed for an in-plane field of 3 Oe oriented antiparallel to the start-stop direction. For parallel orientations of the in-plane field the. start-stop margin improved and approached that of the continuous propagation margin at an in-plane field of approximately 6 Oe. Dependence of the start-stop margin on the orientation of the start-stop direction relative to the pattern was also observed. Measurements of the bubble collapse field at various points in the pattern show a very strong dependence on the in-plane field and the permalloy geometry. The collapse-field results and magnetostatic energy considerations which take into account local field variations and bubble-bubble interactions provide a basis for understanding the experimentally observed start-stop margins. These results show that a small tilt (2 to 3) should be introduced in the bias field to overcome normal alignment tolerances and ensure that a favorable in-plane field is always present.

The formalism can be applied to the steady-state limit of creep in the same range of temperatures and strain rates; the stress exponent of the creep rate must, as a consequence, be strongly temperature dependent, the activation energy weakly stress dependent. Near half the melting temperature, where available work-hardening data and available creep data overlap, they match.

This requirement would eventually lead to the operation of storage plant on a daily cycle of storing energy for 6-8 h and generating for 12-16 h. Conventional CAS schemes, typified by the Nordwestdeutchen Kraftwerke (NWK) installation in West Germany, are shown to be incapable of fulfilling this duty on merit. The basic concept is then re-examined and a novel development is proposed which, by using uncooled compressors and conserving the compression energy, constitutes a true energy storage scheme requiring no fuel other than the off-peak energy taken from the electrical grid. The efficiency and other performance characteristics of this proposal are discussed. The capital cost of an 8 GWh storage scheme is tentatively put at £125-175/kW (at 1974 price levels), depending on the air store construction, well within the £200/kW cost target which storage plant would need to meet to be of interest for storing off-peak nuclear power by the end of the present century.

The results showed that the heights of vertical jumps were considerably reduced at lowered temperature, but the gain in height after a counter movement in the form of a jump down from a height of 0.4 m over the force platform, was significantly higher in the cold condition. To test whether this was due to an increased stiffness of the muscles, experiments with imposed sinusoidal length variations at 14 Hz were performed. Δforce ×Δlength‐1 (i.e. stiffness) increased with isometric tension independent of muscle temperature. Experiments in which the rate of tension development and relaxation in voluntary maximal isometric contractions were measured at different muscle temperatures showed that maximal isometric tension changed by less than 1 % per degree but the rate of tension development and relaxation by 3–5 % and 5 % per degree, respectively, in the temperature range studied (30° to 40°).

In fluid power systems, the inertia of moving parts (including fluid) is responsible for inertance, and the fluid bulk modulus and springs account for capacitance. Generally, it is expected that the order of the mathematical model, which is equal to the number of state variables, is equal to the number of energy storage elements. The exceptional cases, in which the order is less than the number of energy storage elements, are referred to as those involving algebraic state constraints. Since an overwhelming majority of analytical and simulation techniques depend on an explicit evaluation of state variables, systems analysts resort to the in troduction of storage elements and a consequent reformulation of the mathematical model in order to remove algebraic constraints. This reformulation can often lead to inefficient simulation due to drastic changes in the eigen values. This tutorial explores the physical origins of algebraic constraints on state variables with examples from fluid power systems and delineates their influence on further analysis.

Planned for completion in December 1975, the 53,000 ft2, single story building will utilize 15,000 ft2 of various types of solar collectors in a test bed to provide nearly all of the heating demand and over half of the air conditioning demand. This is a cooperative project involving joint participation between Langley and NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Drawing on its space-program-developed skills and resources in heat transfer, materials and systems studies, NASA-Lewis will provide technology support for the Langley building project. A solar energy technology program underway at Lewis includes solar collector testing in an indoor solar simulator facility and in an outdoor test facility, property measurements of solar panel coatings, and operation of a laboratory-scale solar model system test facility. Based on results obtained in this program, NASA-Lewis will select and procure the solar collectors for the Langley test bed. The selection will be made in late 1974 or early 1975. Early results from simulator tests indicate that non-selective coatings behave more nearly in accord with predicted performance than do selective coatings. Initial experiments on the decay rate of thermally stratified hot water in a storage tank have been run. Results suggest that where high temperature water is required to drive a chiller, excess solar energy collected by a building solar system should be stored overnight in the form of chilled water rather than hot water. © 1976.",,"HEATING - Solar; OFFICE BUILDINGS - Air Conditioning; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR PANEL COATINGS; AIR CONDITIONING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016870312

Predictions of profiles (CO2 concentration, water vapour, temperature, light, photosynthesis) in the canopy were biologically good enough for many applications, but they revealed the inadequacies in our understanding of the environment within the plant canopy. Also considered were spring and fall tillage and harvest operations. After calculating several spring freeze-thaw periods for the test year, 1969, enough work days were accumulated to complete tillage operations, allowing completion of planting by 12 May. Two 63 hp tractors and associated equipment were used to farm the 81 ha hypothetical farmstead used for test purposes. Without this large investment in equipment, planting date would have been delayed until late June or early July since the spring of 1969 was very wet. The simulated crop was grown under actual 1969 weather conditions. On 4 September the corn crop reached harvest maturity as gauged by a GDD (Growing Degree Day) 'clock'. The simulator predicted a yield of 7368 kg/ha. This was a gross over-prediction of the 4088 kg/ha average reported for 1969 in central Missouri. This over-prediction was accounted for by the ideal conditions given the simulator when actual data were not available. This included leaf angles, CO2 concentration, and stomatal resistance. Harvesting took 30 days to complete, using one four-row sheller, two trucks, a farm elevator, and 127 272 kg of storage capacity. It appered that the farm dryer was the limiting piece of equipment in the harvesting operation. This crop production simulator forms the basic framework that can eventually analyse more complex systems. However, at this point, the simulator is only in the initial stages of development, and it should be realised that much more extensive development is necessary before the ultimate simulator is achieved. © 1976.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007807654

The succinate-consuming respiration of isolated mitochondria becomes resistant after wounding, while the NADH-consuming respiration remains KCN-sensitive. The alternative oxidase most likely is located at the succinate dehydrogenase complex. From the inhibition characteristics of metal chelators it can be concluded that the alternative oxidase functions also in uninhibited respiration. Induction of alternative oxidase is low or absent in tubers before harvest and increases afterwards. While uninhibited respiration decreases during storage the relative importance of the cyanide (CN)-resistant respiration rises sharply.

Structures were observed on the low-energy side of the onset which were interpreted in terms of the spin-orbit splitting of the initial 4p12 and 4p32 states. The broadening of the p-d structure was interpreted qualitatively in terms of multiplet splitting and autoionization processes. At higher energy, structures related to 3 d transitions were observed. © 1976 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004431594

The cells delivered high energy densities (184 WHr/1b and 13.5 WHr/in3) when fresh and showed excellent retention of intrinsic capacity but loss of rate capability on storage at 72° and 55°C. The cells showed severe voltage delays at -30°C following 72° or 55°C storage, particularly at drains of 0.5A or greater. The cells tended to explode on 10A discharge, on short circuit and on overdischarge. Approaches to alleviate these problems have been explored and the results will be discussed. © 1976.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003370843
