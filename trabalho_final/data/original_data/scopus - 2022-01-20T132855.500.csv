This technology emerged in the information field in recent years. It is a data storage technology that combines routing and coding to improve transmission efficiency by additionally encoding data at intermediate nodes[1]. This kind of new technology is able to enhance data throughput, cut down node energy consumption, and achieve energy balance by utilizing the inherent spatial diversity and data redundancy features of WSN. Routing protocol is an important technology in the design of wireless sensor networks. Aiming at the traditional directed diffusion routing protocol (DD), this paper analyzes the problem that the original protocol costs too much in energy and time, and proposes an efficient and energysaving improved directed diffusion routing protocol NC-DD (Network Coding-DD). This protocol solves the problem of excessive energy consumption when the node works caused by a improper forwarding strategy in the original protocol.

Most of the countries in the world, and especially the developed countries, fund research towards distributed generation and zero energy balance communities. In order to eliminate the consumption of fossil fuels, a crucial role is taken by hydrogen as a fuel, as, if it is produced from renewable energy sources, it could contribute in substituting the fossil fuels used in transport or building's thermal energy sectors. Moreover, it is well known that electrolysis-fuel cells can also be used as a storage medium in autonomous renewable energy systems. In this case, fuel cells need to be carefully sized in order to optimize the storage system both in energy and economic aspects. In this respect, a theoretical model was developed, able to simulate at any time step the operation of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell, by using as input data the technical specifications of the cell and the hydrogen flow. The developed model is based on theoretical, experimental and semi-empirical models in order to provide a flexible algorithm in terms of fuel cell sizing. The model is validated with an existing fuel cell experimental system (Nexa 1200) at different hydrogen flow profiles. The results showed high precision which verifies the reliability of the proposed model for using it in optimization procedures. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076780804

The composite (NaNO3/MgO) was prepared by mixing sodium nitrate with the addition of 1 wt.%, 2 wt.%, and 3 wt.% of MgO. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to evaluate the main thermal properties of the obtained composite materials, namely: their latent heat, specific heat and sub-cooling temperature. Their thermal conductivity is estimated based on a validated theoretical model from the literature. Finally, the chemical structures of the pure PCM and the three composites are investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Overall, the experimental and numerical results have indicated a clear enhancement of the thermal storage properties (especially the thermal conductivity and the sub-cooling temperature) of NaNO3 when it is doped with MgO: The thermal conductivity of the pure PCM was enhanced by 5 % and 19%, when it is doped by 3 wt.% and 10 wt.% respectively. While, the sub-cooling degree was decreased up to 46% when it is doped by 3wt.%, which is very good for the thermal cycling of this PCM inside the LTES system.

It is know that the enthalpy of formation plays a keys role in energy balance calculation combustion properties, equilibrium constants of reactions and fuel characteristics of materials. Several methods have been carried out in calculation and estimating the enthalpy of formation, such a semi empirical model, Miedema model and density functional theory calculations. Currently, the datamining is the newly developed approach which attracts and increasing care of the material science researches. In the current paper, the one know datamining approach based on artificial neural network (predictive technique) has been proposed to estimate the enthalpy formation for several hydrides. An (3-13-1) architecture structure has been developed to predict the enthalpy of formation for rare-earth dihydrides CeH2, PrH2 and DyH2, Also, an (6-15-1) architecture of artificial neural network has been developed to estimate the enthalpy of formation, for the 39 ternary hydrides selected from different published works. The performance indices such a relative error, coefficient of determination and mean square error were used to control the performance of obtained results.

In fact, it matches at a relatively low cost between the electricity produced by these plants and the periods of demand. Moreover, LHS systems have higher energy density compared to Sensible Heat Storage (SHS) ones. However, their inorganic materials have low thermal conductivity, which reduces the dynamics of the storage system with respect to the limitation of operating conditions of a CSP plant. One of the effective ways to resolve this problem is the use of extending surfaces such as fins. The present work evaluates the viability of this LHS applied to the case study of a heat exchanger with and without fins. A Computational fluid dynamics (CFO) model of the studied system was built in the COMSOL-Multyphysics environment. Furthermore, it was succefully validated against the available experimental results.

As there is no independent electricity price for battery energy storage in China, relevant policies also prohibit the investment into the cost of transmission and distribution, making it difficult to realize the expected income, which to some extent restricts the development of battery energy storage power station and new energy storage technology. This study analyzes the location benefit, system benefit and their combination of grid side battery energy storage, and compares them with the cost of the whole life cycle of battery. It evaluates the cost-effectiveness by using the indexes of income flow, net present value, dynamic investment payback period and intrinsic rate of return. The results show that under the existing market and policy conditions, the single price can not recover the investment cost.

Noticeably, they need electricity which is often by diesel generators. The refuelling process is a barricade due to the very far and remote area distance which make it very expensive. To overcome this issue, a hybridization is initiated with the local renewable solar energy. Correspondingly, the PV source marks an excess or shortage of energy; to cope this uncontrolled power an energy storage system is compulsory. This work is confined to the hydro pumped storage system which is favorable due to its geological aspects and the subject matter. This hybridization needs a specific energy management control. The suggested management strategy considers the temporal solar energy and associates it to the pumping servitudes and the online fuel consumption optimization. This last, proves the PSH performance dual function in both the irrigation and power restitution; it also reduce the gas emission and save fuel. As far as this study is concerned, the suggested formula of online fuel consumption per kWh is successfully examined through the energy management strategy in comparison to that of the literature.

Common energy generation methods are pressure, heat and vibration. Researchers are consistently trying to find alternative ways to utilize clean energy wasted in environment in form of these resources. This paper demonstrates the method of harvesting energy from human walk. Generated electric energy can be used to power mobile phones, emergency flashlights, etc. It can also be utilized for uninterruptedly powering up a soldier's wearables electronics gadgets in military operations. It can also be used to track any soldier's location in remote areas. It is based on a considerably designed structure of piezo transducers with a suitable thickness and diameter, which makes it easy-to-use and accordant with a shoe sole. When pressure is applied on piezoelectric discs, AC voltage is produced which is then converted for desired output. After receiving desired outcomes, this energy source can become a direct current (DC) power supply with a support from power management circuits. This energy can be stored in any external power storage. Our design will demonstrate the feasibility of harvesting electrical energy from piezoelectric to low power wearable devices.

In our model, the tasks may have different arrival time, execution time and deadlines, so that the energy cost can be reduced through task shifting within their deadlines. In addition, the energy cost can also be reduced through energy shifting when its price is low using energy storage devices (ESDs). However, it is challenging to decide whether to shift tasks or to shift energy using ESDs considering the fluctuating prices of the electricity. Note that, there are energy losses during charging, discharging and self-discharging of the ESDs, which can not be ignored. We solve the problem in two steps: 1) schedule the tasks based on the electricity prices within a certain time; 2) model the scheduling of energy into a constraint optimization problem and solve it using CPLEX.

Processing and transferring this data consumes a lot of communication, energy, computing and storage resources. Due to the limited resources (energy, computing power and storage capacity) of sensor nodes, how to effectively deal with the large amount of data generated in the Internet of things has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming at the energy consumption, environment and security of wireless sensor networks, data aggregation technology is proposed. In this context, data aggregation came into being. Due to the aggregation of multiple data into one data in the process of data transmission, data aggregation reduces data redundancy, saves energy consumption, bandwidth and other resources, thus reducing data transmission delay and thereby improving the reliability, security and stability of the network. This increases the network life cycle. The security of data aggregation in the Internet of things is effectively solved. © 2019 IEEE.","data aggregation; Internet of things; security needs; technical research","Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Life cycle; Redundancy; Sensor nodes; Data transmission delay; Environment data; Key technologies; Network life cycle; Security and stability; Security of wireless sensor networks; Security requirements; Storage resources; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085481925

This is done at most with only two languages. Also, they lack the interactivity factor which plays a key role in making the tourist interested to know more. In the past decade, efforts were spent to mitigate this issue by using a smart moving unit, usually a smart phone, where audio information can be listened to by the tourist. All information pieces are stored in the moving device. The problem becomes significant, when the antiquities to display are of a huge number and of extensive information. This, together with multiple languages becomes an impeding factor for moving unit of low or moderate storage capabilities. This paper proposes new design and implementation for a special purpose handheld device, with limited storage, capable of displaying different types of high-quality multimedia on an interactive screen of high resolution. This is resolved in this paper through employing a server, in which all antiquities database is stored. Firstly, the moving unit determines its location, sends its coordinates to the database server. Then, the latter determines the nearest antiquity to the moving unit and finally sends the antiquity's multimedia data to the moving unit to display. For moderate needed accuracy, long lifetime, ease of operation and cost effectiveness, Bluetooth Low-Energy beacons are used.

As a result, the prices of domestic goods are on the rise. The threat of noise pollution and greenhouse gas emission associated with these generators cannot be over-emphasized. A renewable energy resource will provide a better alternative. This paper therefore designs and implements a regulated DC variable power supply of rating (0-15)V, 5A using solar PV with storage. The gap found from the literature review was; lack of digitally displayed output of the system. The paper designed and implemented DC variable power supply using a voltage regulator (LM33S), resistors, LED, capacitors, a solar PV of200 W, a 12V/24V20 A charge controller and two 12 V, l8Ah batteries. During the design stage, the voltage regulator capacity, solar PV, charge controller, battery ratings were designed. Tests were carried out with the aid of a digital multimeter to determine the response of the system. Results obtained showed that the system is capable of powering DC loads not greater than 75 W. It was also established that implemented system output voltage ranges from 1.21 V to 15.2 V.

It extends the computing resources of the cloud at the edge of the cellular network closer to the mobile user. Resource management in mobile edge computing is one of the main issues that are studied recently by many researchers. It consists of resource allocation and computation offloading. Allocation of resources involves managing and scheduling the resources to accomplish the requests of the users. It depends on the availability and the capacity of the resources. According to the deadline of each requested task, the service provider will assign each user the sufficient resources. Computation offloading is the transfer of the tasks to be executed at an external platform (edge or cloud server). It depends on the processing capability and the storage capacity of the device. It is difficult to provide an optimal solution for resource management in a dynamic system due to the random variations of tasks required by the users and the mobility of these users, thus machine learning techniques are proposed to solve this optimization problem. In this paper we provide the state-of-the-art for using machine learning to optimize resource management in mobile edge computing.

Most existing PIM works are concentrated on near-memory processing (NMP) and/or in-memory processing (IMP). A computational Memory Architecture (CMA) supporting in bit-line processing brings parallel computation as close as possible to the location of the stored data/bits without using any dedicated computational logic unit(s). It first selects and sets up an operation, reads bit information from external inputs and/or local memory cells in parallel and simultaneously, stabilizes the bit-lines throughout the controlled bit-line keeper (KEEPER), and finally writes the data to external outputs and/or local memory cells in one compute cycle with eight phases. PIM eliminates the overhead of data movement between processing unit and memory, resulting in high bandwidth, massive parallelism, with a high energy efficiency. Since, computational logic unit are not used, CMA further eliminates the overhead of data movement between the computing logic and memory units. In this work, we introduce an enhanced bit-line keeper (E-KEEPER) that does not require any dedicated commands from the compute-line controller. The E-KEEPER helps in reducing the number of phases in one compute cycle to three phases only. Therefore, the compute cycle, the number of bit-flip of command lines and the write critical zone are reduced by 62.5%, 15.38% and 66.6%, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Built-in Computing; Compute-line; Computer Architecture; In-place Processing; Memory Architecture","Big data; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Computer architecture; Computer circuits; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Logic programming; Semiconductor storage; Walls (structural partitions); Built-in Computing; Computational logic; Computational memory; Compute-line; High energy efficiency; Massive parallelism; Parallel Computation; Processing in memory; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082668424

The VSI converter is used as an interface between distributed generators, energy storage systems and the ac-grid. The objective of the research project is to develop a controller with high static and dynamic features, that performs with low computational burden and low switching stress. The first step to develop the controller is to select the appropiate reference frame. The αβ frame is used for its simple structure and easy implementation. Then, the proposed methodology consider the controller performance to define the sampling period, the prediction horizon and the switching pattern. Results show that an increment in the sampling period results in a major harmonic content, and if the prediction horizon increases, the number of calculations is higher without improving the controller performance. The main features of the proposed controller are: low sampling times and a two-steps prediction horizon. With these features the VSI efficiency rises, while the systems's losses and harmonic distortion are reduced. © 2019 IEEE.","Indirect control; instantaneous power; power control; predictive control; voltage source inverter","Controllers; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Power control; Controller performance; Distributed generators; Energy storage systems; Grid-connected converters; Indirect control; Instantaneous power; Predictive control; Voltage source inverter; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082499509

The nanonode's communication system is anticipated to be a bottleneck for such nanonetworks, hence an accurate modeling of its energy consumption is needed. Currently, TS-OOK is a prevailing scheme for nanocommunication in the terahertz (THz) frequencies, with short pulses representing logical ""1""s and silences logical ""0""s. In the energy modeling of this scheme, certain energy consumptions are attributed to the transmission and reception of the pulses. However, traditional communication systems teach us that the idling energy consumption should not be neglected. Hence, we provide an energy consumption model for TS-OOK-based nanocommunication systems that accounts for the energy consumed in idling, in addition to the transmission and reception-originated consumptions. We demonstrate that, for a meaningful performance of the considered nanonetwork, the nanonode's idling energy consumption has to be at least nine orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding energy consumption in reception. To increase the tolerable idling energy, we propose a new energy lifecycle for the receiving nanonodes. Assuming frequent packet repetitions on the transmit side, the proposed lifecycle utilizes periodic short wake-ups of the receiving nanonodes. We show that, when the proposed lifecycle is utilized, up to three orders of magnitude higher idling energy consumption can be tolerated compared to the baseline. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Amplitude shift keying; Energy harvesting; Life cycle; Nanotechnology; Accurate modeling; Energy consumption model; Nanoscale applications; Orders of magnitude; Packet repetition; Storage capacity; Terahertz frequencies; Three orders of magnitude; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081979533

Through experiments, it became clear that the top-down central power grids are not suited to the needs of the twenty-first century. The new energy revolution by considering multi-energy carriers, not just electricity, represents an opportunity to improve the system and will have a revolutionary impact on the future power grids. To meet current power grid challenges, a new concept of the energy hub has emerged. The energy hub can be considered as a modern electric power grid infrastructure that contains different types of energy sources and generation with multi-Type energy storage devices to feed electrical, heating and gas demands. The new energy hub needs a more complex and different one, because its size is much larger, while traditional energy systems rely on a strong infrastructure of information and communication. This paper focuses on critical issues related to technologies of energy hub in the first place with regard to information and communication technology (ICT).

This paper proposes an optimized approach for energy scheduling of grid-connected MG that includes a battery energy storage system (BESS) and different distributed generators as micro-Turbines, fuel cells, wind turbines, and photovoltaic units, where the optimal hourly generation scheduling is needed to get the minimum MG's operating cost. The general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) is used in modelling of the studied system and solving the constrained optimization problem. The optimal hourly generation scheduling of the MG is investigated in three different scenarios. In the first scenario, no BESS is connected to the system, while in the second scenario, the BESS is connected to the system, and in the third scenario, the optimal generation scheduling of the MG is investigated with BESS considered while considering increased limits of the power imported from or exported to the main grid. The results obtained validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the results obtained by other algorithms presented in the literature. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Distributed generation; General algebraic modeling system; Generation scheduling; Microgrid; Renewable energy sources","Algebra; Constrained optimization; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Microgrids; Natural resources; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Algebraic modeling; Battery energy storage systems; Generation scheduling; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081789128

In consideration of the energy storage feature, a flywheel device has great advantages over chemical batteries for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites: lifespan, density of power, short charge time, wide operational temperature band, and deep depth of discharge. Flywheel systems have significant advantages over chemical batteries also it can be used to control the spacecraft attitude. The combination of power and attitude control is a practical solution for small satellites to enhance space missions. Double counter-rotating flywheels mounted on an air table are introduced in this paper to execute the control system of combined power and single-Axis attitude control. The system control technique of integrated power and attitude control could be implemented based either on a speed control mode or on a torque control mode. The control algorithm's method is known as field orientation control. This method offers the flywheel motor / generator with precise and high bandwidth torque control by controlling rotor reference frame currents that are dc in steady-state. The Permanent magnet synchronous motor/generator is regulated by the direction of the field. The current rotational frame of the d-Axis is ordered to zero and the current order of the q-Axis rotational frame of reference differs to maintain dc bus regulation and control of attitude. MATLAB Simulink is used to model the combined power and single-Axis attitude control system using two similar flywheels. Furthermore, different cases and different modes of operation are presented which showed that flywheels behavior changed according to different operations. © 2019 IEEE.","Attitude control; Dc bus voltage; Flywheels; Low Earth orbit satellites","Attitude control; Battery management systems; Communication satellites; Control systems; Earth (planet); Electric power transmission; Flywheels; Orbits; Permanent magnets; Secondary batteries; Small satellites; Space flight; Torque control; Traction motors; Vehicle transmissions; Wheels; DC-bus voltages; Integrated power and attitude control; Low earth orbit satellites; Operational temperature; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Practical solutions; Rotor reference frame; Spacecraft attitude; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081787748

Adding to its high stability and low cost, the induction motor efficiency improves with loss minimization. Also, it can consume more power than you actually need to perform its working when it operating in less than full load condition. In this paper, a proposed topology and its control strategies based on the Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) are used. FLC makes control of start current amplitude and saves more power. Through the MATLAB/SIMULINK software package, the performance of this control was verified through simulation. Compare with the conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, the simulation schemes show good, high-performance results in time-domain response and rapid rejection of system-Affected disturbance. Therefore, the core losses of the induction motor are greatly reduced, and in this way improved the efficiency of the driving system.

We ask the question: assuming that data must be accessed remotely, can latencies be hidden without application change? We present TAZeR, a remote I/O framework that reduces effective data access latency. TAZeR transparently converts POSIX I/O into operations that interleave application work with data transfer, i.e., read prefetching and write stage-out. TAZeR ensures read data moves directly to application memory without synchronous intervention (soft zero-copy). TAZeR uses distributed bandwidth-aware staging to exploit data reuse across application tasks and to manage the capacity constraints of fast hierarchical storage. We evaluate TAZeR on a High Energy Physics workflow where two 1 Gb/s WAN links request remote data at 48 Gb/s using non-streaming access patterns. TAZeR is 12 times and 22 times faster than XRootD (state-of-the-art) and file copies (current approach), respectively; and within 7% of optimal.

These heterogeneous computing systems, often contain various accelerators, can significantly improve the computation performance thanks to their parallel compute cores. Much research has exploited accelerators to reduce the computation time; however, I/O access time or end-to-end total execution time is often overlooked. Typically, when I/O access time with the storage is considered, the performance gain from accelerators can be substantially degraded. In this work, we designed a computational storage in a heterogeneous computing system. Our evaluation employs a real-world compute-bound machine learning application on three computing systems: A conventional CPU system, a modern FPGA system, and the computational storage system. Compared to CPU system, we found that the modern FPGA system can achieve a 100x speedup for computation and 62x better energy efficiency, but only 26 × speedup and 16 × energy efficiency improvement when data movement time is taken into account; whereas the computational storage system can achieve 63 × computation speedup and 51 × better energy efficiency including data movement time. The experiment demonstrates that a compute-bound problem on conventional CPU system may become an I/O-bound problem on heterogeneous system. By adopting computational storage in heterogeneous system, we find that both the computation performance and the I/O performance is improved. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Computer aided instruction; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Computation performance; Computing system; Energy efficiency improvements; Exascale computing; Heterogeneous computing system; Heterogeneous systems; Machine learning applications; Performance Gain; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081173982

However, due to simultaneous cooperative spectrum sensing, CR may consume more storage energy, thereby reducing its transmission performance. In this paper, in order to ensure its transmission performance, a scheme of synchronous simultaneous cooperative spectrum sensing and wireless power transmission is proposed, which can harvest radio frequency energy of PU signals to provide energy consumed by spectrum detection.

This paper proposes a novel control strategy for a grid-connected three-phase four-wire smart inverter. By using the proposed power control strategy and the positive- and negative-sequence decoupling controls, the smart inverter can provide not only frequency but also voltage regulation to maintain a balanced and stable system. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, a 2 kW grid-connected three-phase four-wire prototype inverter was implemented, which was connected to a three-phase AC source for analysis.

Several new connected customers in line with these government targets and plans are in networks that are already constrained, with the consequence of violating statutory performance requirements and electrical parameters, such as thermal loading, voltage limits and technical losses. Utilities' solutions to remedy these problems sometimes requires huge investments to upgrade infrastructure and this may take years for implementation. In many instances, short-term solutions are available and feasible. This study investigates Solar Roof-Top PV (RTPV) as a renewable energy resource for reticulation (11/22KV) networks. Currently RTPV is not well documented and guided when considering available Grid codes, Guidelines and Standards. This paper demonstrates that RTPV penetration is more worthwhile to consider than capital strengthening/refurbishment projects. The study demonstrates the supportive role of RTPV to meet electrification demands. With increased penetration of RTPV's on distribution networks, there is a benefit to the feeder tail-end voltages with reduced thermal loading and technical losses in distribution networks. This provides Utilities with the opportunity to electrify more customers and defer capital expenditure, while reducing the carbon footprint. The balance of the paper presents an accurate view of RTPV analysis, attributed to the accuracy of data, by using a practical network topology coupled with its related statistical loading. It further takes into account the associated customer connected at the LV transformers. With the imminent influx of RTPV, the results of this study will assist in equipping the South African Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) for the readiness of RTPV and the influence of RTPV on reticulation networks by quantifying the impacts and expectations for the Electric Power Utility and the customer. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS); Roof-Top Photovoltaics (RTPV)","Carbon footprint; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Roofs; Sales; Smart power grids; Thermal load; Battery energy storage systems; Electric power utilities; Electrical parameter; Electricity infrastructure; Photovoltaics; Short-term solutions; South African government; Statutory performance; Electric network parameters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081051295

However, the cost of per GB data by SSD is much more than that by HDD. Therefore, the hybrid heterogeneous storage system based on SSD and HDD has become the main stream of development of storage systems. In the hybrid storage system, the internal structure, working principle and failure mechanism of different storage devices are very different, which brings great challenges to the reliability of the storage system. Therefore, how to evaluate the reliability of hybrid heterogeneous storage system has become an important research area. The former evaluation method lacks the consideration of the heterogeneity of storage system and the failure rate of storage medium. To solve these problems, we design and implement a fault injector for hybrid heterogeneous storage systems by using the Systemtap and shell script to inject fault. The fault types are classified into four types: storage media failures, memory failures, CPU failures and network adapter failures. In addition, for the storage media failures, we establish corresponding function model of fault rate according to the related research on HDD and SSD failure rate and use those models to inject faults. By this way, in a short time we can evaluate the reliability of hybrid heterogeneous storage system for long-term operation. The experimental results show that the fault injector can effectively simulate the hardware failures in the hybrid heterogeneous storage system. © 2019 IEEE.","failure rate function model; fault injection; hybrid heterogeneous storage system; systemtap","Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Failure (mechanical); Failure analysis; Function evaluation; Software testing; Virtual storage; Design and implementations; Design and implements; Failure rate functions; Fault injection; Hybrid storage systems; Low energy consumption; Storage systems; systemtap; Hard disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080911556

But the amount is still very small compared to the other existing potentials. The classic issue in the utilization of solar energy is intermittent solar energy and power fluctuations. The power of the PV is not fixed, unpredictable and dependent on natural factors, namely irradiation, temperature and the influence of shadows. Several methods have been proposed to overcome intermittent energy and fluctuations in PV power including the Hybrid PV Generators, Power Curtailment, Geographical Dispersed, and Electrical Storage methods. Each method has characteristics in its application. Hybrid PV generators are relatively easy to apply but they are expensive and cause greenhouse gases. Power Curtailment is easy to apply but it is inefficient because a lot of energy is wasted. Geographical Dispersed requires large land. Electrical storage requires a large energy storage capacity. To overcome this, a new method is proposed, namely Dynamic Power Injection which is a combination of MPPT, Power Curtailment, and Electrical Storage. A comparative study with simulation using Simulink Matlab against 3 methods of PV power stabilization was conducted. The simulation results show that the DPI method is the most effective and efficient way to increase the stability of PV power. © 2019 IEEE.","DPI; Matlab Simulink; PV power stabilization","Agricultural robots; Electric energy storage; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Robotics; Solar energy; Stabilization; Systems engineering; Comparative studies; Electricity generation; Energy storage capacity; ITS applications; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Natural factors; Power fluctuations; Power stabilization; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080908699

In a stand-alone environment, diesel generator (DG) and renewable energy sources (RESs) like wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaics (PVs), and fuel cells (FCs) provide an effective and reliable solution to fulfill a household load. To achieve the economic and environmental aspects of hybrid RESs (HRESs), optimal sizing of components is indispensable. In this paper, the PVWT-FC-DG hybrid system is considered, optimally sized, and modeled in terms of environmental emissions and total annual cost (TAC) values for Hawksbay, Pakistan. For optimal sizing, the teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is proposed that does not require any algorithm-specific parameter for its execution.

Among these, solar energy has evolved as the most cost-effective and mature technology for energy generation. Solar energy being intermittent in nature with numerous parameters affecting its operations such as sunlight intensity, soiling on solar panels and panel defects can result in unexpected and undesirable power output oscillation. Thus a low cost, real time solar panel monitoring system is needed for performance evaluation and preventive measures. This work presents a low-cost real time cyber-physical system for remote monitoring of solar energy plants. The proposed system uses arduino nano integrated with current, voltage, light intensity, dust, humidity and temperature sensors for performance evaluation and effect of different sensed parameters on power generation.

Technologies are becoming commercially available to systems and services that can enable efficient and sustainable management of energy production and use. In short, smart cities can be defined as a city that uses IC'I's solutions such as smart sensors, cognitive learning, and context awareness to make life more comfortable, more efficient and more sustainable. A smart city is a sustainable and efficient urban center providing its inhabitants with a high quality of life through optimal management resources. This study examines how intelligent technologies and services can integrate local energy production and use to provide a more sustainable and efficient system. Due to rapid urbanization, energy management in smart cities is an essential challenge to tackle. Due to the complexity of the energy systems and their vital role, energy management is one of the most demanding issues within urban centers. Therefore, this problem needs to be devoted to considerable attention and effort. Optimized operations using predictive analytics, data mining and modeling are the main tools commonly used to evaluate the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions, as well as to plan the best ways to move from current to smarter cities. The reviews show energy-related work on smart city planning and operating models by classifying their scope into main areas of intervention: energy generation, infrastructure, energy storage, mobile internet, cloud technology, internet of things (IoT), autonomous and near autonomous vehicles, facilities, and intelligent transport system. © 2019 IEEE.","4IR; Digital Transformation; Energy; Sustainable Management; Technology Disruption","Data mining; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Predictive analytics; Smart city; Sustainable development; Digital transformation; Energy; Industrial revolutions; Intelligent technology; Intelligent transport systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Optimized operations; Sustainable management; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079661796

Conventionally, the DCMGs were required to either be shut down during critical situations of their dc-bus overvoltage, or experienced load curtailment during undervoltage caused by a high mismatch between load demand and generation. To solve this issue, weather forecasting and/or employing more DGs were required which had the drawbacks of complexity, availability of more sources and higher cost. The proposed system in this paper uses an enhanced control strategy for the converter's operation of the integrated PV system. As a result, unlike the conventional power management systems, the stability of the dc-bus voltage can be ensured, particularly during the critical situation of dc-bus overvoltage without a need for shutting down the system, adding complexity and increasing total cost.

However, as the converter interfaced photovoltaic (PV) generation increases, the system inertia reduces. This may result in system failures, especially for islanded micro-grid. Virtual inertial control (VIC) technology, which enables PVs to mimic the characteristics of synchronous generators (SG), has drawn increasing attention. Nevertheless, the implementation of a traditional VSG strategy typically requires a constant PV power reserve, causing unnecessary production loss during system steady states. Although VIC can also be effectively implemented by utilizing an energy storage system (ESS). The high cost is still hindering its large-scale integration. In this paper, a forecasting based virtual inertia control (FB-VIC) strategy is proposed, which enables the PV system to serve as an alternative inertia supplier without using any ESS. PV generation is pre-reserved based on the load forecasting results. The reserved PV power and SG are coordinated to perform frequency regulation. A simulation model is built to simulate the proposed FB-VIC method during a system contingency. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method can reduce the instantaneous SG power capacity over 40%. In addition, the proposed control method limits the frequency oscillation in a smaller range, which improves the system dynamic stability. © 2019 IEEE.","Load forecasting; Micro-grid; Virtual inertial control; Virtual synchronous generator","Forecasting; Photovoltaic cells; Systems engineering; Energy storage systems; Frequency oscillations; Frequency regulations; Inertial controls; Islanded micro grids; Photovoltaic generation; Simulation model; System contingencies; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086300947

Our objective is to provide the vehicle's real-time controller with robust, smooth feedback that prevents unnecessary oscillations in steering, which can waste significant amounts of energy. We do so by assigning weights for measurements based on their consistency with the robot's motions. The calculations are based on two main data sources: (1) measured velocity vectors from wheel driving (odometer) and steering of the 4WDS test-case robot; and (2) data obtained from a differential global navigation satellite system on the absolute pose of the robot. We show that the sensor fusion is robust to the noise and single point failures of the sensors, while the maximum heading oscillations are reduced by 70%-95%, preserving the accuracy of the global positioning system.

Based on the DC bus voltage droop control to provide the inertia of the converter, two improved virtual inertia control strategies are proposed. From the perspective of DC bus voltage Udc and system virtual inertia coefficient Hv under load disturbance, the advantages and disadvantages of three virtual inertia control strategies and the influence of control parameters on system inertia are analyzed. The conventional droop control is a full-band response load disturbance, and the inertia coefficient Hdpincreases with the droop coefficient Kdp increases, but the DC bus voltage cannot be restored to the initial set value. The improved low-pass filter control (ILPFC) only responds to the load disturbance in the low frequency band. In fact, a delay link is introduced on the basis of the conventional droop control to slow down the frequency response speed, and increasing the K1 or ω1 can also increase the system inertia effect. The improved high-pass filter control (IHPFC) only responds to load disturbances in the high frequency band, overcomes the problem that the conventional droop control cannot restore the DC bus voltage to the initial set value. Meanwhile, increasing Kh or decreasing ωh can also improve the system inertia support. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy and the correctness of the analysis conclusion are verified by simulation. © 2019 IEEE.","Conventional droop control; Improved high-pass filter control; Improved low-pass filter control; Photovoltaic system; Virtual inertia control","Frequency response; High pass filters; HVDC power transmission; Low pass filters; Photovoltaic cells; Restoration; Solar energy; Control parameters; Control strategies; Electronic power systems; High frequency bands; Inertia coefficient; Load disturbances; Low frequency band; Photovoltaic power generation systems; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085477358

Metal-air batteries, having a promising technology that could address this need, faces challenges due to the costly and locally unavailable production of air-cathode. Thus, the proponents came up with the idea of designing portable metal-air battery with configured air-cathode layering technology using activated carbon derived from waste coffee grounds and saltwater as electrolyte. The design process involves genetic algorithm to optimize both performance and dimensions.

Using density functional theory, this study investigated Mg, Ca, and K as dopants to aluminene to determine their effects on its physical properties. Calculations were carried out using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with Perdew-Burke-Erzernhof (PBE) as generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional. The brillouin zone sampling was set to 8 by 8 by 1 mesh size, and the energy cut-off of 450 eV. Density functional theory were employed to determine the best possible site (either at the hollow, bridge, or top) for adsorption, and to obtain stress-strain graphs. Among the three sites it was found that the Mg, Ca, and K decorations all prefer the hollow site for adsorption. With its shortest distances also located at that site. As for the stress-strain graph it was found to have a low strain as seen by its linear behavior. Lastly obtaining the slope gave the elastic modulus and stiffness, and with the introduction of the decorations at the hollow site increases its property values. Results showed better stiffness and modulus compared to pristine aluminene. © 2019 IEEE.","Aluminene; density functional theory; elastic modulus","Calculations; Environmental management; Hydrogen storage; Nanotechnology; Stiffness; Brillouin zone sampling; Elastic properties; Exchange-correlation functionals; First-principles investigations; Generalized gradient approximations; Hydrogen storage media; Linear behavior; Vienna ab-initio simulation packages; Density functional theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084733512

Greenhouse agriculture has been a profitable technology despite the large energy and water need. Integrating these technologies will result in substantial energy and water saving. Sensible cooling is attempted first in the greenhouse. The time evolution of the temperature variation of the flowing air and temperature of conduit walls along the height of the tower and at the greenhouse exit are studied. Parameters like tower height, made-off materials, entry temperature, and wind velocity are considered in the quest to reach to lowest temperature at the greenhouse exit. A high-fidelity model is developed governed by the non-isothermal Navier-Stokes flow in conjugated heat with the conduit material in unsteady and turbulent flow regime. The continuity, momentum, energy, and turbulent scalars are solved simultaneously and results are compared/validated against the first principle of convective-sensible heat for conduit temperature. Results reveal that additional height enable more cooling energy storage, however this cooling energy is non-sustainable and depletes in a relatively short time over several minutes. This suggests utilization of very high specific heat materials or integration of trans-evaporative cooling. The latter is simulated and results are favorable and shows to bring the needed cooling to the greenhouse. © 2019 IEEE.","CFD; cooling tower; evaporative cooling; greenhouse cooling","Agricultural robots; Energy conservation; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Greenhouses; Navier Stokes equations; Specific heat; Towers; Water conservation; Architectural element; Evaporative cooling; First principles; High fidelity models; Navier Stokes flow; Passive ventilation; Substantial energy; Temperature variation; Cooling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084672432

Concerning the photovoltaic solar energy conversion, such performances being mainly related to the DC-AC stage, the grid connected inverter control strategy design became a major research subject to bring answers for the ever challenging grid technical regulations (grid codes). As a prerequisite option for active power bi-directional operation, the storage batteries pack is assumed here as an energy buffer directly connected between the DC-DC and DC-AC stages. As a consequence, the strong decoupling effect induced by imposing a constant DC link voltage, allows conducting the analysis and design of both parts separately. In this context and as part-I of the overall undertaken design project, a grid connected inverter using a hysteresis current control (HCC) strategy is pre-designed and optimised to serve as an open loop, bidirectional DC-AC power converter benchmark. Foreseeing the main practical realization constraints, an original sizing process of the associated line inductor is applied to limit the maximum switching frequency. Then, making use of the rich electrical engineering library of the SimPowerSystems toolbox under Matlab/Simulink environment, the designed grid connected installation is analysed through detailed simulations. Furthermore, particular control circuits are elaborated to generate properly the corresponding AC current reference and allow bi-directional active and reactive power flow decoupled control. Finally, reproducing tightly the detailed and realistic architecture of the planned realization, the resulting DC-AC stage structure is submitted to numerous validating tests as a power converter which may be further included in simple but robust active and reactive power control closed loops. © 2019 IEEE.","Active reactive power; Distributed Generation (DG); Grid connected inverter; Hysteresis current control (HCC); Photovoltaic (PV) system; Three phase system","Battery Pack; Buffer storage; DC-DC converters; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; MATLAB; Power control; Reactive power; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Switching frequency; Active and Reactive Power; Active and reactive power controls; DC-AC power converters; Grid connected inverters; Grid connected systems; Hysteresis current control; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Photovoltaic solar energy; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084660710

The procedure uses the Stroh-like formalism to obtain the exact solution for FGPM plates which can be expressed in more concise and easier handling forms comparing to other more complicated semi-analytical or numerical approaches used in the literature. Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) is then used to solve the optimization problem in order to identify the piezoelectric material properties in the z-direction. In order to validate the given exact solution, a numerical example for a single-layer FGPM plate is presented and compared to the previous findings in the literature. Several numerical examples are presented using PSO algorithm to solve the identification problem of piezoelectric material constants and good results are obtaind.

Billions of smart objects across the world generate sensed data about the environmental changes and report them. These sensed data create a lot of traffic in the network, a lot of redundancy, and duplicated records, and increase the storage size in BigData in cloud computing. Some of the sensed data are required to perform a real-time action. In this paper, we propose a framework to provide the decision makers in today's organizations with real-time data that could help them make better decisions. In addition, it could filter and fuse the data with Adaptive Sampling rate using Feedback control mechanism (FCM) in the network layer. The proposed framework will reduce the number of IoT records. Moreover, it avoids a lot of traffic in the network, increases the network life, and minimizes the energy consumption. The proposed approach can help most of Businessmen in their decisions, increases the performance and reduces the cost. It can also be applied to any Business-like ERP, CRM, and SCM. We have implemented and tested it by SQL and CQL. The results of the experiments show that the reduction has been achieved by 82.34 percent compared to the base one. This reduction has improved the energy consumption in the traffic in the network layer, generating an efficient BigData in terms of non-noise, storage capacity and cost. © 2019 IEEE.","BigData; Cloud Computing; Data Filtration; Data Fusion; Data Redundancy; Data Stream; Feedback Control Mechanism (FCM); Internet of Things (IoT); Real-Time; Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Adaptive control systems; Cost reduction; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Feedback; Information management; Network layers; Adaptive sampling; Cloud environments; Control mechanism; Decision makers; Environmental change; Internet of Things (IOT); Real time data management; Storage capacity; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084152210

A robust optimization model is proposed to stabilize the wind power output fluctuation by electric vehicles. Based on the requirements of ""active power change"" in wind power in national standards, the change of wind power output rate is expressed. After that, the robust optimization method is used to deal with the uncertainty of wind power output, and a double-layer optimization model for the coordinated control of wind farm and electric vehicles is established. The upper layer model decision maker is the wind farm, with the objective of maximizing the income of selling electricity of wind farm as the objective function. The lower layer model decision makers are electric vehicle owners, with the objective of minimizing the cost of electric vehicle electricity expenses. In addition, the robust optimization model is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming problem by linear programming dual theorem and KKT optimality condition.

In order to further reduce the risk of wind/solar uncertainty, the objective function of minimizing operational risk is constructed by conditional risk at value (CVaR), and the constraints of uncertain variables are transformed by robust stochastic optimization theory. The multi-objective risk aversion optimization model of VPP is constructed by choosing the maximum operating income and minimizing total carbon emissions. Finally, an improved IEEE30-bus system is selected to carry out an example analysis. The results show that: (1) The risk aversion model can take into account the multiple demands of benefits, risks and carbon emissions; in particular, when the robustness coefficient is less than 0.85, smaller uncertainties will bring greater risks, indicating that decision makers'risk attitudes will affect the VPP scheduling scheme; (2) When the prediction error E is high, the same growth rate will bring the higher growth rate of CVaR, which indicates that the lower prediction accuracy will magnify the uncertainty risk. Decision makers need to improve the prediction accuracy to reduce the operational risk of VPP; (3) Maximum total emission allocation (MTEA) can highlight the environmental friendliness of clean energy and realize the optimal balanced operation of VPP as a whole. In conclusion, the model can provide decision support for decision-making to formulate optimal VPP scheduling strategy. © 2019 IEEE.","conditional risk at value; demand response; uncertainty; virtual power plant","Carbon; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Scheduling; Site selection; Stochastic models; Wind power; Biomass power generations; Environmental friendliness; Optimization modeling; Photovoltaic generation; Scheduling strategies; Stochastic optimization theories; Stochastic scheduling; Virtual power plants (VPP); Growth rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084046371

Multi-vector energy system is one of the solutions to cope with this issue. Moreover, a safe and resilient operational method is required for such complicated energy systems. This paper proposes a multi-vector energy system including wind, hydrogen and fuel cells as a supplement part to the main grid. Electricity is firstly converted by wind energy while certain percent of electricity is used for water electrolysis where hydrogen as energy storage is generated. Fuel cells consume hydrogen when electrical energy demand peaks. To evaluate the performance of the energy system, an analytical model is developed to coordinate the operation of the system involving energy conversion between hydrogen, electrical and mechanical forms. Genetic Algorithm (GA) as optimal strategy is used to determine the operational scheme for the system. In the study, different load scenarios are used on the basis of real-world measurement data.

The development of integrated energy systems opens a new path for in-depth reform of the energy sector. However, integrated energy systems are currently facing problems such as high operating costs, limited consumption levels of new energy and low energy efficiency per unit equipment. Therefore, firstly, we propose an integrated energy system optimal operation model considering new energy incentive mechanism. By utilizing the lowest integrated energy system daily operation cost as the target, mixed integer linear programming method is adopted for calculation and solution, whilst artificial intelligence algorithm is introduced to ensure the accuracy of relevant prediction data. Secondly, the study fully considers the economy, rationality, efficiency and other requirements of system operation, improves constraint model of each unit equipment in the system and implementing four typical scenarios of incentive mechanism.

The wind energy conversion system (WECS) is a Type-A turbine with squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) and a capacitor bank. A passivity-based proportional-integral control (PI-PBC) is used that controls the power transfer of the SMES system to the power grid. The proposed controller is designed with two main objectives: First, to deliver (or absorb) a suitable active power to (or from) the power system, and second, to regulate the voltage of the WECS. The proposed PI-PBC guarantees asymptotically stability in closed-loop and exploits the advantages of the proportional-integral (PI) actions.

Multilevel inverters are considered very convenient topologies in application in renewable energy source systems. Their high efficiency and quality in their output voltage make them an interesting choice for photovoltaic applications, wind energy and battery storage systems. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different inverter topologies with seven-level voltage outputs, with applications in transformerless photovoltaic systems, is performed.

Due to the large size of consumed and produced datasets by these workflows, data placement is becoming more and more a challenging task. When Intensive Workflows tasks are executed, they may require a massive volume of data that are physically distributed across multiple Servers. Moving these datasets appears to be costly in terms of workflow execution time, communication cost and energy consumption. Thus, an efficient data placement strategy is needed and it must take into consideration the following challenges: reducing the workflow communication, the total data movement, and the energy consumption. Actually, ensuring an optimal mapping of data to Cloud Storage Service in a reasonable time turns out to constitute a challenging task as it is considered as an NP-Hard problem. In this paper, a decentralized and scalable agent based-approach that considers both the placement of original and intermediate datasets obtained during workflow run is proposed, with the main concern is reducing the execution time of the data placement algorithm. It involves two steps. The first step consists in distributing all the data placement process based on a set of cooperative agents and this is based on the idea that the formal context can be partitioned on a set of formal sub-context. The second step is the placement of the newly generated datasets during the execution of workflow tasks as 'intermediate data' using an Incremental algorithm for constructing Concepts Lattice (or Galois Lattice).

However, renewable energy sources connected to the AC side of HMMC will lead to fluctuation of DC transmission power. To solve this issue, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed to be embedded in submodule (SM) of HMMC, serving as the energy buffer unit. Based on this structure, SM control strategy and DC fault ride through (FRT) strategy are proposed in this paper.

Recent growth in the novel and cheap, sensor and actuation devices show that the interest in IoT technologies is phenomenal. IoT devices present several challenges due to device constraints such as limited power, storage, bandwidth, and processing capacity. For a battery powered IoT device to operate for an extended amount of time, it is vitally important for it to be designed to conserve power to ensure realize prolonged network life. In IoT networks, energy is usually expended during the transmission and reception of packets. Ensuring successful transmissions while minimizing energy use is a challenge. Routing protocols play a vital role in facilitating the delivery of these packets from the source to the destination nodes. The use of energy-efficient routing protocols can help to reduce the power consumption of IoT devices. Several routing protocols have been developed for network communication. It is important to evaluate these protocols to find one that is suitable for use in power constrained IoT environments. This study conducts a comparative energy evaluation of RPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy networks) and LOADng (Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol-Next Generation).

To fully reduce the power consumption of data transmission, which is the most significant part of the total power consumption, we designed the ultra-low power data Transceiver constructed by low voltage discrete devices working at the 1.8V voltage. The power consumption of other parts of the node is also optimized. As a result, the overall power consumption is less than 80mW when the data rate is 2Mbps. The low-power collection node can be connected to any sensor that generates a digital signal. Low power consumption and reliable features make it suitable for large-scale and complex production environments. © 2019 IEEE.","Data collection node; Data Transceiver; Low power consumption","Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Manufacture; Transceivers; Complex production; Data collection; Data transceivers; Digital signals; Discrete devices; Industrial production; Low-power consumption; Total power consumption; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081629170

In this paper, the position is taken that no matter how well a system has been designed, failure is inevitable. By thinking in terms of energy and process physics, a new tool to assist in this analysis, the Energy Expansion Tree, is employed to look for opportunities to short circuit the chain of events in such a way as to achieve relatively fail-safe behavior. ©2019 IEEE.","Black swans; Fail safe; System safety; Useful life","Failure (mechanical); Manufacture; Random errors; Black swans; Catastrophic consequences; Catastrophic failures; Common mode failures; Fail safes; System configurations; System safety; Useful life; Safety engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081560183

Emerging nonvolatile devices have the ability of in-memory processing, and thus, have the potential to partially alleviate the memory wall bottleneck. People have adopted nonvolatile devices to build various accelerators that are targeted at different problems and applications. In this work, we adopt one of the emerging nonvolatile devices, the ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET), to build a multifunctional in-memory processing unit, which is named FeMAT. From a structural point of view, FeMAT is an FeFET-based memory array composed of 3T-based cells. From a functional point of view, FeMAT not only is a nonvolatile memory, but also can perform some logic operations (i.e., the processing-in-memory (PIM) mode), binary convolutions (i.e., the binary convolutional neural network (BCNN) acceleration mode) and content searching (i.e., the ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) mode) in the memory. These functions are seamlessly fused into the FeFET-based memory array and can be configured online without changing the circuit structure. Superior energy efficiency is demonstrated by our experiments and comparisons with a resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) based equivalence, as well as a TCAM and a BCNN accelerator based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. © 2019 IEEE.","Binary convolutional neural network; Ferroelectric-field effect transistor; In-memory processing; Ternary content-addressable memory","Associative storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Energy efficiency; Ferroelectricity; Field effect transistors; Image coding; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Random access storage; Binary convolution; Circuit structures; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Ferroelectric field effect transistors; Non-volatile memory; Processing in memory; Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM); Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081165575

However, the existing ReRAM-based PIM architectures suffer from considerable additional auxiliary logic and device variations. In this work, we propose a novel analog computing architecture NB Engine for classification by implementing Naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm on ReRAM crossbar arrays. The two key steps of the NB algorithm, that is, probability calculation and electing the class that has the highest probability, are elaborately accomplished in our architecture. The ReRAM arrays are both used as storage and computation components. We store the pre-calculated prior probabilities and conditional probabilities of every class in crossbar arrays. Then the probability calculation step is completed in parallel through the MVM operation of the array. In general, the election step is a multiple-comparison procedure and is normally implemented by a comparison tree. Here, we reuse the max pooling module in a conventional CNN PIM architecture to realize a compatible comparison logic. However, neither of the two designs can avoid the overhead of costly high bit-precision Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). So we introduce a novel analog parallel comparison design which does not need any ADCs or other computing logic with better energy-saving and area-efficiency. Our proposed NB Engine is tested by 11 various datasets. The influence of several non-ideal device properties is discussed and the NB Engine exhibits great tolerance to these variations. The experiment results show that our design offers a runtime speedup up to 2289.6x compared with the software-implemented NB classifier with negligible accuracy loss. In addition, the NB Engine saves 96.2% energy consumption and 45.2% array area compared with the CNN PIM compatible design. © 2019 IEEE.","Naive Bayes; Processing In Memory; ReRAM","Analog to digital conversion; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Convolutional neural networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Engines; Image processing; In situ processing; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Probability; RRAM; Analog to digital converters; Conditional probabilities; Matrix vector multiplication; Multiple-comparison procedures; Naive bayes; Probability calculations; Processing in memory; Resistive rams (ReRAM); Rhenium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081158648

It can be pure electric vehicles or hybrid vehicles. The Hybrid vehicles combine internal combustion engines and electric motors to move. The use of resources on hybrid vehicles can be either series or parallel. A series hybrid model uses an electric motor as a driving force and combustion engine as a generator drive when a parallel hybrid vehicles use both resources as drivers simultaneously. Electrical energy can be obtained from renewable energy or waste utilization. This paper discuss the effectiveness of the use of advanced vehicles to reduce the use of fossil fuels. In this study compared some types of advanced vehicles with travel routes in Surakarta as represent urban area in Indonesia. The test is done using vehicle modeling with MATLAB software simulation. The research was done by using drive cycle data from previous research. The shows hybrid vehicle series need more fuel than parallel type. The size of the combustion engine in the vehicle series is very influential on the performance of the vehicle.

The Republic of Estonia, like many other countries supports investments into solar panels and the selling of renewable energy. At the same time, the cost of solar panels has been falling, and this in turn raises the question if it's reasonable to support solar panel installations? In the same time, it is extremely important that the energy supply is continuous and uniform from the grid operator's point of view. Selling electricity produced by solar panels or wind generators without an intermediate storage device is extremely chaotic and does not provide the consumer with the necessary uninterrupted energy flow. Due to the high cost of battery banks, small energy producers also find it economically difficult to install battery banks in order to ensure uninterrupted energy supply. The article focuses on finding the optimal subsidy system for support to installing a battery bank for a prosumer. The hypothesis is that an installation subsidy of 100 € per 1 kWh of energy storage capacity of a battery bank makes the investment feasible for renewable energy producers and, in this context, also increases energy security. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery storage; Energy storage system (ESS); Renewable energy; Solar energy; Subsidies","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Energy security; Sales; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Virtual storage; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage systems; Energy supplies; Government subsidies; Intermediate storage; Renewable energies; Subsidies; Wind generator systems; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080970081

A small PV-Battery-SOFC' hybrid power generation system was designed to solve these problems. The system consists of photovoltaic arrays (PV), high-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), battery, DC load, power conversion circuit, PLC controller and other components. A new type of SOFC was used as a reliable supplementary power supply for the photovoltaic array. The control unit adopted Delta DVP series PLC as the controller and the voltage and current control method to collect and feedback the system operation data in real-time, which can automatically monitor the system current and voltage to make them work in a stable state. According to the working characteristics of each component unit, the control strategy of the corresponding interface conversion circuit was developed. In this way, the PLC controller completed the intelligent switching of multiple operating modes of the system, and also realized the energy balance management between photovoltaic array, high-temperature SOFC and battery. Through the analysis of the experimental data, it is shown that the multiple micro-power sources in PV-Battery-SOFC' hybrid power generation system can be operated and switched in a safe and stable state. Thus, the rapid and accurate management of various micro-power sources in the system can be realized and the stable operation and high-efficiency control of the power generation system also can be ensured.

However due to the high cost, battery energy storage cannot be configured on a large scale in power systems. By applying the H-P filtering method, the time-varying wind power fluctuation can be decomposed into long-term trend component parts and short-term fluctuation component parts. A coordinated control method is proposed in this paper that the long-term trend component parts of wind power fluctuations are stabilized by thermal power units while short-term fluctuation component parts are suppressed by battery energy storage systems (BESS). Thereby avoiding frequent regulation of the thermal power units and saving the capacity requirement of the BESS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified based on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation model. The simulation results indicate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed coordinated control method. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage SystemThermal Power Units; Fluctuation Smoothing; H-P filtering","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Fossil fuel power plants; Wind power; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Capacity requirement; Co-ordinated control; Fluctuation smoothing; Power units; PSCAD/EMTDC simulations; Thermal power units; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079509996

To address this issue, a deep peak-regulation reserve trading strategy for power system with high-share of renewable energy based on virtual energy storages (VES) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a peak-regulation reserve model of renewable energy is established based on the uncertainty, and a peak-regulation reserve model of VES is designed considering the demand-side response and the ""charge and discharge"" characteristics of energy storage. Secondly, on the basis of the deep peak-regulation technology of thermal units, a deep peak-regulation reserve model for thermal power is proposed, in which different peak-regulation depths have different electricity price compensations. Finally, a peak-regulation reserve trading strategy with renewable energy accommodation as the core and minimum peak-regulation reserve cost as the objective is proposed, where VES and deep peak regulation of thermal power are both the market participants. Results of case study verify the effectiveness of the proposed reserve trading strategy to ensure the peak-regulation reserve capacity of the system. © 2019 IEEE.","deep peak regulation; peak-regulation reserve; Renewable energy accommodation; trading strategy; virtual energy storage","Commerce; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Virtual addresses; Charge and discharge; Deep peak regulations; Demand side response; peak-regulation reserve; Power grid operations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy power; Trading strategies; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079509988

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) offer promise to mitigate such disadvantages. However, to apply BESSs to practical power grids, we require a means to allocate them, including their number, location, and capacity, and a control strategy to allocate power demand. In this paper, we first define a linear performance index, called power mileage, which denotes the voltage quality. We then build a new model using power mileage to optimize the allocation of BESSs and construct a simple control method to alleviate the voltage fluctuation. The use of a power dispatch matrix obtained from the optimization model yields a simple but effective method for controlling the batteries. Applying our model to a real-world power grid in Chongqing, China shows that the method works well at peak-shaving on a large scale and mitigates fluctuation over short time periods. © 2019 IEEE.","battery energy storage system; control strategy; output fluctuation; peak shaving","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Battery energy storage systems; Control strategies; Linear performance index; Optimization modeling; Output fluctuations; Peak shaving; Simple control method; Voltage fluctuations; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079497100

They are not connected to main grid and operate at islanding mode. The other two stations (Beijing station and Fengning station) are connected to main power grid in North China, as energy consumption center and power balance node of the MMC-HVDC grid. Near Fengning station, pump storage generators are built to provide power support for the system. Due to the complex structure of the system, severe challenges have been posed for the control of MMC converters, renewable energy and pump storage generators. Output of renewable energy is intermittent. Voltage of DC grid is highly sensitive to power unbalance. And power quality requirements of energy consumption center is high. In this paper, coordinated generation control strategy of DC converters, renewable energy and pump storage generators is proposed. A frequency supplementary control is designed for the converter connecting to renewable energy. A Powerfrequency (P-f) droop control is designed for renewable energy generation to coordinate with MMV converters. And a generation control based on power fluctuation on AC transmission line is designed for the pump storage generators. To illustrate the effectiveness of those strategies, a hardware-in-loop simulation is done on real time digital simulation (RTDS) platform. Simulation results show that, under the condition of power fluctuation, the converter and the renewable energy generation cooperate to achieve a selfsuppression of the overall output on MMC-HVDC grid. Furthermore, the pump storage generators can alleviate the power flow fluctuation of AC system caused by DC grid. The coordinated control strategies promotes a flexible connection among the renewable energy, MMC-HVDC grid and the AC power system. As a result, safe and stable operation ability of the whole system is enhanced. © 2019 IEEE.","Modular multilevel converters; Optimal control; Power generation control; Renewable energy sources","Electric load flow; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; HVDC power transmission; Power control; Power converters; Power generation; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Simulation platform; Coordinated control strategy; Hardware in loop simulation; Modular multilevel converters; Optimal controls; Power generation control; Real-time digital simulations; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079481087

Firstly, energy dispatching strategy is constructed. Then, two possible modes of ""integration of investment and operation"" and ""independence of investment and operation"" in the future of incremental distribution network are analyzed, and different optimization models for different stakeholders are built. Considering the demand of nearby absorption of renewable energy and the reliability of power-supply in incremental distribution network, multi-objective optimization of power-supply capacity allocation is carried out with performance indicators such as non-nearest consumption probability of renewable energy is proposed. Using the actual wind power output and user load data, a set of power capacity allocation schemes is optimized by using multi-objective black hole algorithm. Finally, based on D-S evidence theory, considering the needs and the willingness of each stakeholder, a power allocation scheme to ensure the relative maximization of the interests of each market participant is obtained.

Minimizing power consumption is particularly important for low power embedded applications. Specific CNN compute patterns offer a possibility of significant data reuse, leading to idea of using specialized on-chip cache memories which enable significant improvement in power consumption. However, due to unique caching pattern present within CNNs, standard cache memories would not be efficient. In this paper novel on-chip cache memory architecture, based on idea of input feature map striping, is proposed, which requires significantly less on-chip memory resources compared to previously proposed solutions.

Inspired by this thought, previous work has demonstrated various memristor-based logic families with different attributes and computation patterns. Besides, some logic synthesis tools are designed for specific memristive logic implementations. However, the poor universality and the neglect of realistic constraints in memory largely restrict the utility of these logic synthesis tools. In this paper, we propose a general logic synthesis framework for memristor-based logic design, containing a universal abstract description method for memristive logic, a mapping rules generator, and a synthesis and mapping flow. The proposed logic synthesis framework is suitable for various types of existing memristor-based logic families and takes the memory status into consideration. It is also possible to handle future memristive devices and logic families by providing the universal abstraction interface. Furthermore, we also design a circuit-partitioning-based synthesis acceleration strategy to tackle with the long synthesis time problem. Experimental results show that, our framework can generate mapping results under the restriction of limited resource, while the existing synthesis tools may fail under the same restriction, and achieve comparable synthesis results with the same resource as the existing synthesis tools, which is enough for computation and storage. And the proposed acceleration scheme can achieve ? 1000× speedup compared with the initial one. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Logic design; Logic Synthesis; Mapping; Memristors; Acceleration strategies; Alternative solutions; Circuit partitioning; Computing system; Computing units; Description method; Logic synthesis tools; Synthesis time; Computer circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077803429

Non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been demonstrated as promising alternatives for constructing computing-in-memory (CiM) systems to accelerate NN computing. However, NVM-based NN computing systems are vulnerable to the confidentiality attacks because the weight parameters persist in memory when the system is powered off, enabling an attacker with physical access to extract the well-trained NN models.

Generation and distribution were localized, and long-distance transmission was not yet necessary. As demand for electricity service increased, distribution networks expanded in capacity and geography. Systems once isolated from one another were becoming interconnected. Recently, the integration of the distributed renewable energy resources is evolving as an emerging and promising power scenario for the energy system. Smart grid, as a modernized electrical grid, uses information and communication technology to improve the efficiency, reliability, and economics of the production and distribution of electricity [9, 10, 11]. As the main building block of the smart grid, microgrid (MG) integrates a number of local DG units, energy storage systems, and local loads together to form a small-scale power system.

Due to the increasing memory intensity of most DNN workloads, main memory can dominate the system's energy consumption and stall time. One effective way to reduce the energy consumption and increase the performance of DNN inference systems is by using approximate memory, which operates with reduced supply voltage and reduced access latency parameters that violate standard specifications. Using approximate memory reduces reliability, leading to higher bit error rates. Fortunately, neural networks have an intrinsic capacity to tolerate increased bit errors. This can enableenergy-efficient and high-performance neural network inference using approximate DRAM devices. Based on this observation, we propose EDEN, the first general framework that reduces DNN energy consumption and DNN evaluation latency by using approximate DRAM devices, while strictly meeting a user-specified target DNN accuracy. EDEN relies on two key ideas: 1) retraining the DNN for a target approximate DRAM device to increase the DNN's error tolerance, and 2) efficient mapping of the error tolerance of each individual DNN data type to a corresponding approximate DRAM partition in a way that meets the user-specified DNN accuracy requirements. We evaluate EDEN on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DNN accelerators with error models obtained from real approximate DRAM devices. We show that EDEN's DNN retraining technique reliably improves the error resiliency of the DNN by an order of magnitude. For a target accuracy within 1% of the original DNN, our results show that EDEN enables 1) an average DRAM energy reduction of 21%, 37%, 31%, and 32% in CPU, GPU, and two different DNN accelerator architectures, respectively, across a variety of state-ofthe- art networks, and 2) an average (maximum) speedup of 8% (17%) and 2.7% (5.5%) in CPU and GPU architectures, respectively, when evaluating latency-bound neural networks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Deep neural networks; DRAM; Energy efficiency; Error tolerance; Machine learning; Memory systems","Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Errors; Graphics processing unit; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Program processors; Accelerator architectures; Error tolerance; Intrinsic capacity; Language processing; Memory systems; Network inference; Retraining technique; Standard specifications; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074454776

Besides the development of the design of the hybrid system and its configuration, there is the topic of power management which responds especially to the renewable intermittency issue. Indeed, our work is strongly focused on optimal energy management for residential loads; which plays a very important role for smart houses that will be the basis of a smart city in the near future. To do so, a PV-Wind-Battery hybrid system is taken as a primary source enabling the house to satisfy its own energy needs while considering the grid only as a storage facility with infinite capacity. To connect the energy sources cited above, a hybrid architecture is proposed, and the different electrical switches mentioned on it are efficiently conducted by our proposed energy management system. The results showed that the autonomy of the system is ensured by injecting the surplus energy during the day and recovering it at night. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distributed generator; Energy management system; Hybrid architecture; Hybrid system; Renewable energy; Smart grid","Computer architecture; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Housing; Hybrid systems; Power management; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Smart power grids; Battery hybrid systems; Distributed generators; Hybrid architectures; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimal control design; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Storage facilities; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077736255

By re-purposing the peripheral circuits, the certain NVM array can perform both storage and computing operations to accelerate the data-intensive convention Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the parallelism of the NVM-based CIM should be considered. In this paper, we present a CIM architecture developed by the Spin-orbit Torque (SOT) MRAM using both read-out and write-in operations. We highlight the memory structure and control method of the write-in operations. With the excellent write performance of SOT-MRAM, the proposed writein operation can obtain ultra-fast and energy-efficient computing data operations. The write-in operation works as a complement of the conventional read-out CIM architecture rather than replace it. © 2019 IEEE.","Computing element; Computing-in-memory; Neural network; Spin-orbit torque MRAM; Write-based logic","Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Memory architecture; MRAM devices; Network architecture; Programmable logic controllers; Control methods; Data operations; Emerging non-volatile memory; Energy efficient; Energy efficient computing; Memory structure; Neuromorphic computing; Peripheral circuits; Storage as a service (STaaS)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109342710

The channel noise characteristics are important for management system. Their estimation is realized with varying degrees of uncertainly, considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since IoT devices have limited processing capabilities, low-computational methods for channel noise estimation are necessary.

Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system power plant with the hybrid system is introduced as a potential solution to fulfil electricity demand for off-grid areas, such as Jifak Village, Asmat Regency, Papua. In 2018, the electricity network coverage area was only 57.03% in Papua Province, Indonesia. On the other side, this region consistently receives high solar radiation intensity for an average 4.68 kWh/m2 per year. The research objective was designing suitable hybrid Photovoltaic (PV) system module, which will be utilized further in Jifak Village, Asmat Regency. This developed hybrid PV System model was featuring PV module, a boost converter, Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) method with applied Incremental Conductance Algorithm for tracking maximum power point, storage battery model, a single-phase inverter model, generator set (Genset) and communal load model. Hybrid PV system model was developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK program, and HOMER Pro program was used for a feasibility study on the economic value of this system. MATLAB/SIMULINK program chosen due to its customization capability for hourly data input. Meanwhile, HOMER Pro program was only accommodating average monthly data input. MATLAB/SIMULINK customization ability was the driving system for incorporating more comprehensive PV performance.

There is a complex coupling relationship between the energy storage component capacitance and inductance, hysteresis modulation and SMC controller, which seriously restricts the transient response and output voltage quality of the system. In this paper, the full-order sliding mode control method is applied to solve the problems of differential seeking and high frequency chattering in the existing sliding mode control. For the second-order Buck converter system, a new full-step sliding surface and robust control law are designed, and the stability proof is given. The traditional sliding mode control chattering is caused by the symbol function in the control law. In the full-order sliding mode control, the switching control term uses the integral of the symbol function instead of the symbol function, and increases the order of the sliding mode variable to the symbol function. Integral derivation, on the basis of ensuring the control effect, the continuity of the control quantity is realized, the chattering is eliminated, and the full-order mode of the sliding mode motion of the Buck converter is guaranteed. System performance is improved by eliminating control amount chattering.

If the load continues to increase and the supply of electricity is fixed, then one day it will cause the supply to be smaller than the demand. If electricity provider is able to provide electricity in accordance with the growth of expenses, then there will be an increase in the cost of production of the electric power system as well. Electricity production costs are different every hour, because it follows changes in load curve that changes every hour. This study aims to save electricity production costs for 1 day or 24 hours using load shifting methods with pump storage. The general definition of load shifting method is to move the peak load to the base load, so that the cost of generating electricity at peak loads becomes cheaper. Another way to move peak loads to basic loads can use pump storage. Indonesia has new Cisokan Pump Storage located in West Java. The working principle of pump storage is when the base load will act as pump to move water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir, and during this process it will consume electricity. When the peak load will act as generator by draining water from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir, so that it will reduce electricity consumption during peak loads. In this study, two scenarios will be conducted to determine whether load shifting methods using pump storage can save the cost of production of the electrical power system. The first scenario is the operation of 24-hour electric power system without pump storage. The second scenario is the operation of the electrical power system for 24 hours using pump storage. The result of this study, for scenario 1 the total cost of production for 24 hours is $ 20.251.047,78. For scenario 2, the total production cost for 24 hours is $ 20.174.721,5. From scenario 1 and 2, using pump storage as medium to load shifting methods has proven to save 24 hours of electricity power production costs of $ 76.326,28 and electricity prices are also lower in $/kWh every hour. © 2019 IEEE.","Cost Production; Demand; Load Shifting; Pump Storage; Supply","Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Pumps; Reservoirs (water); Cost of productions; Electrical energy; Electrical power system; Electricity prices; Electricity production costs; Electricity-consumption; Power production; Total production cost; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084451409

These extremely energy efficient buildings can produce their own energy whereas local storage and sources are needed. To meet those goals, new technologies and control principles must be developed and implemented. Energy usage could be best optimized by a central energy management system (EMS). This paper proposes an energy router-based EMS for NZEBs. The concept and its features will be explained and analyzed. The energy router has many tasks, e.g. energy routing, system protection and reliability, voltage regulation. However, the focus of this paper will be on the power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC). Modern households are overwhelmed by the nonlinear electrical loads, which are lowering the power quality in the grid. The power quality is a serious issue also in NZEB. This paper will demonstrate how an energy router can be used to control reactive and active power and compensate current harmonics at the PCC. The system behavior will be simulated and verified by the experimental prototype. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy Management System; harmonic compensation; Near Zero Energy Buildings; Power Factor Correction","Electric fault currents; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Intelligent buildings; Power quality; Voltage regulators; Zero energy buildings; Building sectors; Control principle; Current harmonics; Energy efficient building; Experimental prototype; Point of common coupling; System behaviors; System protection; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084333470

A chemical battery energy storage system (BESS) providing compensation techniques such as virtual inertia response (VIR) and droop-based primary frequency response (PFR) can supply the corrective power needed to remedy the increased frequency volatility. This study explores the frequency volatility in a 300 MW hydro-diesel ac-island grid for increasing levels of PV up to a target of 100 MW, and the corrective impact of BESS-based VIR and PFR. The analysis conducted in MATLAB-Simulink® showed that the combined governor response of both hydro and diesel units where fast enough to compensate the aggregated PV plant ramps, and therefore no BESS support would be required for such power imbalances. Analysis of the frequency volatility to the event of losing a large hydro unit, showed that the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) would change approximately 0.043 Hz/s for every unit change in the systems rotational inertia, increasing from 0.48 Hz/s and exceeding a target ROCOF of 1 Hz/s. The final ROCOF was 1.24 Hz/s at the 100 MW PV level. In this case, 6.52 MW BESS-based VIR and PFR power was needed to correct the frequency response to a desired target ROCOF of 1 Hz/s and nadir of above the under-frequency load shed (UFLS) limit of 58.6 Hz. In comparison, running 21 MW additional diesel units reduced the ROCOF to under 1 Hz/s, but could not maintain the nadir above the UFLS. © 2019 IEEE.","battery; diesel; Frequency; hydro; primary response; PV; ROCOF; virtual inertia","Chemical analysis; Electric batteries; Frequency response; Chemical batteries; Compensation techniques; Conventional generation; Frequency dynamics; Island power systems; Rate of change of frequencies; Rotational inertia; Under frequencies; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084331155

To ensure the profitability under long-term operation of PV-BESS, lifetime evaluation is necessary during the design stage. In PV-BESS, the battery and power converters are the reliability-critical components that are subjected to high stress during the operation. This paper proposes a systematic lifetime evaluation framework for the PV-BESS where a three-stage modeling approach is applied to the battery and power converter lifetime estimation. The proposed lifetime evaluation also includes the interaction between the operation of the battery and power converter and its impact on the lifetime, which is the key novelty of this work. The framework is demonstrated on a case study of the PV-BESS in Germany. It reveals that the battery is the most life-limiting component, where the deep cycles and high average state-of-charge are the main factors limiting the battery lifetime. Additionally, the thermal stress of the battery converter is higher than that of the PV converter due to the high loading dynamic resulting from the battery charging/discharaing. © 2019 IEEE.","battery; DC/DC converters; lifetime; mission profile; Photvoltaic system; reliability","Charging (batteries); Industrial electronics; Power converters; Secondary batteries; Stress analysis; Battery converters; Battery energy storage systems; Battery lifetime; Critical component; Lifetime estimation; Lifetime evaluation; Photovoltaic systems; State of charge; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084110657

The current interest in the use of renewable energy is driven by the need to reduce the high environmental impact of fossil-based energy systems and to improve the quality of power quality in smart grid. One of the main problems of renewable sources is the impossibility of controlling the energy production due to it is intermittence. Because of this uncertainty, the voltage and frequency of the power grid can be disturbed and decrease the power quality of electric energy. In micro generation systems, this problem can be improved with the inclusion of intermediate storage systems. The energy stored in this system can be used as resource to assist the powering loads or as a form of avoiding abrupt changes in the transferred energy to the electric power grid (EPG). This fact could help to maintain the stabilization and, consequently, optimize the functioning of the EPG, optimizing the PV micro production. The introduction of micro production with intermediate storage can be considered fundamental for the implementation of smart grids (SG) because they allow a better electric management and a consequent cost reduction. In this paper is described a renewable energy micro production system for smart grid compatible with a photovoltaic and wind renewable sources with a battery bank as an intermediate storage system. This micro production system can follow the references of electric power generated by the SG and contribute for a better management of the electric energy. An experimental prototype was built with photovoltaic panels (PV) and has been traced values of some parameters for power quality. An approximate $25\ \boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{s}$ response was obtained by the batteries for each Watt of power required by the SG. © 2019 IEEE.","intermediate storage; Micro production; optimization; photovoltaic; smart grid; stability","Cost reduction; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Industrial electronics; Photovoltaic cells; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Alternative to fossil fuels; Economically viable; Electric power grids; Experimental prototype; Intermediate storage; Micro generation systems; Renewable energy source; Use of renewable energies; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084088935

Pulsed fields have become mainstream technology in medical imaging and they are present in nondestructive testing, accelerators, etc. Today, some modern dosimeters perform better with only a slight underestimation in pulsed fields of higher dose rates, but dose rate measurements during the pulse still remain a challenge, especially for scattered radiation. This can also be extended to short exposures, dominant in the medical sector. We developed a detector consisting of a silicon photomultiplier coupled to a 10x10x10 mm3 scintillator. For the current stage of research, a NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal was chosen due to its high light yield and capability to detect low energy X-rays. Signals from the detector are digitized using a digital storage oscilloscope and recorded for offline analysis. Analysis was based on signal integration, which remained invariant to pulse pileup and thus allowed measurements from low to high dose rates several times higher than IEC 61526 requirements. Preliminary results showed sufficient time and dose (H∗(10)) resolution for measurement of scattered radiation pulses down to several ms in width. © 2019 IEEE.","Dosimetry; Pulsed fields; Scintillators; Silicon photomultiplier","Cathode ray oscilloscopes; Digital storage; Nondestructive examination; Radiation; Sodium Iodide; Dose rate measurements; High-resolution measurements; Low energy x rays; Off-line analysis; Scattered radiations; Scintillation crystals; Signal integration; Silicon photomultiplier; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083563235

At present, UAV networks are widely used in military, disaster reconstruction, agricultural and other scenarios. The routing problem as a focus in the research of UAV network has also aroused researcher's extensive attention. The routing algotithm in UAV network mainly include proactive routing algorithm, reactive routing algorithm, auxiliary routing algorithm, etc. However, most of these routing algorithms are centralized, deployment difculties, low stability and poor scalability. And they also require each node to maintain a global routing information table in order to obtain global node information in real time to network flooding, which undoubtedly wastes a lot of storage space for uav nodes with limited space. This paper, a novel and effective distributed routing algorithm is proposed which named reputation-based distributed routing algorithm(RBDR), and deploy it to the high mobility UAV network. In RBDR, we introduce a realtime quota-controlled strategy (which can control the number of message replicates in real time) and defne the concept of reputation for each node, this can avoid network congestion and improve the success rate of messages transmission. Since each node only needs to maintain its own friend list without obtaining the global network status, so the distributed RBDR algorithm can avoid the problem of difcult deployment and difcult information exchange of centralized routing algorithm in the high mobility UAV network. The experimental results show that the RBDR algorithm have higher success rate of message transmission and lower network resource overhead in high mobility UAV network. © 2019 IEEE.","Network congestion; Quota-controlled; UAV network; Wireless mobile network","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Routing algorithms; Wireless networks; Distributed routing algorithm; Information exchanges; Message transmissions; Messages transmission; Network congestions; Proactive routing; Routing problems; Wireless mobile networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083106815

But, due to wind variability, there will be fluctuations in the output power of wind turbine generators. If these generators are connected to a DC grid, the power fluctuations will negatively be reflected on the DC voltage. So, Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) is proposed in this study as an effective solution for voltage stabilization of DC grids connected to wind energy systems. The adopted wind turbine generator is Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). The models of wind turbine, PMSG, and interfacing rectifier are built using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Then, a model for SMES is built including a superconducting coil with large inductance and a DC-DC bidirectional converter. The SMES control is built through PI controller to determine the duty cycle to the DC-DC bidirectional converter to achieve charging, freewheeling and discharging modes for the SMES. Two various operating conditions are considered, operation with variable wind speed and operation with sudden load change. SMES could effectively absorb the excess or deliver the shortage in output power enabling DC voltage stabilization at the desired value. © 2019 IEEE.","DC grids; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Voltage stabilization","DC-DC converters; Electric energy storage; Magnetic storage; Maximum power point trackers; Permanent magnets; Power electronics; Robustness (control systems); Stabilization; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnets; Turbogenerators; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Bidirectional converter (BDC); Maximum Power Point Tracking; Operating condition; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Variable speed wind turbines; Voltage stabilization; Wind energy systems; Synchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083029150

The traditional model has been more difficult to burden the storage, processing and analysis of massive electricity consumption information, and has gradually become the performance bottleneck of the system. Based on Hadoop with the advantages of distributed storage and parallel computing, the current performance bottleneck can be solved. In order to improve the fault tolerance of Hadoop in the production environment, the QJM (Quorum Journal Manager) mode is adopted as the high-availability shared storage mechanism, and the ZooKeeper cluster is introduced to complete the switching between the active and standby nodes to achieve smooth failover and avoidance. In order to fully analyze and explore the potential value in massive electricity consumption information, Hive data warehouse is used to realize complex query and multi-dimensional analysis. Based on statistical analysis data, a gray model is used to predict the trend of some data in future electricity usage information. Through the real-time collection of massive electricity consumption information, data cleaning and classification preprocessing, HDFS cloud storage, MapReduce parallel computing, HiveQL statistical analysis, the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible. It also verifies that the gray model can better predict the future power consumption trend under the Hadoop HA (High Available) architecture. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data about Electricity; Fault Tolerance; Grey Model; Hadoop HA(High Available); Hive Data Warehouse; Statistical Analysis","Data warehouses; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Fault tolerance; Forecasting; Smart power grids; Statistical methods; Distributed storage; Electricity-consumption; Grey Model; Hadoop HA(High Available); Multi-dimensional analysis; Performance bottlenecks; Production environments; Real-time collection; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082118732

This flexibility will potentially cause changes in the operating pattern of coal-fired power plants, which operate at a minimum load. This pattern of operation will lead to increased use of coal, reduce the value of thermal efficiency, and possibly reduce equipment reliability. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of the flexibility of the coal-fired plant operation on its reliability. The solution that we propose in this paper is to integrate the coal-fired plant with Battery Energy Storage (BES). On scheme, the battery will be charged in a off-peak and will be discharged when a peak-load. We present several choices of BES in this paper, to find out more about this integration. in part 1 this will focus on how the impact of integration of coal power plants with battery energy storage in terms of heat rate levels, analysis is based on the effects of changes in heat rate levels of coal power plants during the use of BES and compared when not using BES. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage (BES); Economic Evaluation; Flexibility; Heat Rate; Lagrangian Optimization; Reliability","Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission; Fossil fuel power plants; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Battery energy storages (BES); Economic evaluations; Flexibility; Heat rate; Lagrangian optimization; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081989166

During the transition, since the power supply continues to supply energy, and the magnetic energy stored in the inductor translates into a capacitance in the form of electrostatic field energy stored in the system at some point, an overvoltage several times greater than the supply voltage, this is the operation over voltage. In the transmission line, the common overvoltage operation has cut off the no-load line overvoltage and closing no-load line overvoltage. Due to the obvious effect of capacitance of submarine cable used by offshore wind farms and the reactive voltage distribution characteristics of offshore submarine cables connected to the grid with onshore wind farms, there are significant differences in fault characteristics and overvoltage problems are prone to occur.

Based on the survey results, it was identified that major concerns of the energy stakeholders are related with the integration of different platforms used for different purposes (for example, operational planning and real time systems), and how to exchange information/data between parties in an expedited and standardized way. The survey participants see energy storage as the most essential technology in the future energy system, followed by the smart metering, online voltage regulation and demand response services. However, on the market landscape, survey results suggest that the creation of limited number of fully integrated regulated markets is the most consensual solution to avoid the fragmentation in many different markets and products. © 2019 IEEE.","Data management; Markets; Network operator's coordination; Services; Smart grids; Tools; Users","Commerce; Digital storage; Information management; Interactive computer systems; Marketing; Real time systems; Systems engineering; Tools; Voltage regulators; Distribution systems; Future challenges; Network operator; Operational planning; Services; Smart grid; Transmission system operators; Users; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081093511

Based on the analysis of the key factors affecting the execution of combat missions, such as combat environment, operation objectives and UUV system, the mission planning method which combines online monitoring, evaluation, prediction and adaptive adjustment is designed. This method has the ability of revising the initial plan in respond to observed information.

Energy management system (EMS) is very important for power system planning and operation of microgrid. To make sure that the generation meets challenges of load profile requires more robust and effective EMS of microgrid. Specifically, the planning and operation of power supply needs to incorporate the load forecast for the optimal dispatch strategy. This paper proposes Model Predictive Control (MPC) of EMS to dispatch generation power in microgrid for minimum total operating cost. The load forecast is obtained by recurrent neural network for one day ahead. The efficiency and accuracy of load forecasting model affects the efficiency of dispatch algorithm of microgrid. The proposed algorithm is applied to a case study of Mae Hong Son (MHS) microgrid including battery energy storage system and power exchange with utility grid to satisfy load demand for both actual load and forecasted load profiles.

The system consists of PV array, DC-DC boost converter, voltage source inverter (VSI), induction motor, and water pump. In order to extract the maximum power from the PV array, the incremental conductance (INC) method is simply utilized. The dc-link voltage is maintained constant using a proportional-integral (PI) controller by controlling the induction motor speed using simple open loop quadratic scalar V/f control. The proposed quadratic scalar V/f control is compared with the widely used linear V/f control using a simulation case study based on MATLAB/SIMULINK. The performance of the proposed method is examined under variable values of solar radiation. When compared with the available scalar controllers, the proposed controller generally improves the system dynamics as well as the overall system efficiency especially under low speed (low discharge) operation.

The storage pumps (double flux or multistage pumps) are structurally different from the regular ones. As a particularity, these types of pumps are equipped with a suction elbow with complex geometrical configuration. The suction elbow generates unsteady hydrodynamic phenomena, which are ingested by the impeller, leading to severe structural and cavitational issues. A suction elbow with a simplified geometry is experimentally investigated to assess the unsteady field at the pump inlet. The unsteady pressure signals acquired on both inlet and outlet walls of the suction elbow are analyzed for nine discharge values from 16.6 l/s to 43.7 l/s.

On a large scale PV is connected to the distribution as a peak load generator during the day. Integration of PV with grid has several issues, especially because of the intermittent solar energy problems due to the influence of irradiance and environmental temperature. It's causes the energy produced to fluctuate and be unstable. These power fluctuations affect system stability and frequency. To overcome this problem, several methods for PV power stabilization have been developed. One of them is Constant Power Generation (CPG) where PV output power is limited to certain P value settings so as to reduce PV power fluctuations. In this paper the Dynamic Power Injection method is proposed which is a modification of the CPG method with the dynamic action of charge and discharge using batteries as energy storage. The principle of DPI is same with CPG that determines P setting as P output of PV Power, but stabilization of PV Power Outputis also support by active power management. Charge when PV power bigger than P setting and injection when PV power less than P setting. Thus the output power in each condition of PV power same with P setting. By using matlab simulink a DPI circuit simulation is carried out to increase the stability of the power and frequency of the system. The simulation results show that DPI is able to produce stable PV output power on 30 kW and the frequency of the system can be maintained at 50 Hz. © 2019 IEEE.","CPG; DPI; Simulink; stabilization","Circuit simulation; Energy conservation; MATLAB; Solar energy; Stabilization; Charge and discharge; Dynamic actions; Electrical energy; Environmental temperature; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Power fluctuations; Power stabilization; Simulink; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078236335

Generation and distribution were localized, and long-distance transmission was not yet necessary. As demand for electricity service increased, distribution networks expanded in capacity and geography. Systems once isolated from one another were becoming interconnected. Recently, the integration of the distributed renewable energy resources is evolving as an emerging and promising power scenario for the energy system. Smart grid, as a modernized electrical grid, uses information and communication technology to improve the efficiency, reliability, and economics of the production and distribution of electricity [9, 10, 11].

The algorithm aims at minimizing the user's electricity bill by shifting the appliances' time of operation to off-peak periods based on the pricing scheme used. The users are divided into three categories according to their appliances' operation time flexibility. The proposed algorithm performance is evaluated under Time of Use (TOU) and Quadratic Pricing Function (QPF). The results are then compared to those obtained by the centralized approach. The user's electricity bill is minimized in case of applying TOU and QPF pricing schemes but QPF yielded lower peak-to-average ratio (PAR). The performance of the algorithm is tested in case of existence of energy storage system (ESS) in homes. Moreover, simulation results showed that obtaining a battery as an energy storage device is beneficial for the users in terms of electricity bill reduction. © 2019 IEEE.","Appliance scheduling; Demand Response; Home Energy Management System; Smart grid","Costs; Demand side management; Domestic appliances; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management systems; Internet of things; Optimization; Scheduling; Centralized approaches; Decentralized optimization; Demand response; Energy storage systems; Home energy management systems; Optimization algorithms; Peak to average ratios; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077959337

Many satellite applications require the broadcast delay to be limited to a certain value. However, due to the high-speed movement of satellites, the network topology changes frequently, making the broadcast routing problem NP-hard. In this paper, we study the delay-constrained minimum energy broadcast problem in satellite networks. Considering the limited-sources in satellite systems, in order to reduce computation complexity and storage requirements, we propose the temporal netgrid model based multi-power level flow graph (MLFG) to describe the time-varying topology instead of using existing space-time graphs. Based on MLFG, an iterative algorithm is proposed to minimize the broadcasting energy consumption while satisfying the delay requirement. Simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve higher energy efficiency while comparing with other existing methods. © 2019 IEEE.","broadcast routing; delay-constrained broadcast; minimum energy broadcast; Satellite networks","Communication satellites; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flow graphs; Iterative methods; Network routing; Satellites; Signal processing; Topology; Broadcast routing; Computation complexity; Energy-efficient broadcast; Minimum energy; Minimum energy broadcast problems; Satellite applications; Satellite network; Seamless connectivity; Broadcasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077778770

For the recent years, prolific amount of renewable energy resources that include wind and photovoltaic (PV) sources have been introduced in South Australian power system. These wind generators are mostly variable speed machines, hence they neither have inertia response nor can they perform governor like response following a contingency. The demand in South Australia can be significantly catered utilizing renewable sources and considerable power import from the adjacent state Victoria. Therefore, the number of synchronous generators in the South Australian network can be small. In such situations, the frequency response following a contingency can be concerning and the network may undergo substantial under frequency load shedding. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a frequency responsive BESS model to improve the frequency response of a low inertia power system that resembles the South Australian network. The network is investigated under various operating conditions to explore the performance of BESS regarding frequency response enhancement. © 2019 IEEE.","battery energy storage; frequency response; low inertia power system; under frequency load shedding","Battery storage; Electric power plant loads; Frequency response; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; low inertia power system; Operating condition; Renewable sources; South Australia; Underfrequency load-shedding; Wind generator systems; Electric load shedding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077686021

Like any other power electronic converter, three-phase PWM rectifier may be affected by various faults like open-circuit faults. Therefore, fault diagnosis is extremely important to reduce the maintenance costs and improve the stability of the system. A novel open-circuit faults diagnosis method is proposed. The fault diagnosis method only requires the three-phase AC currents, and then Concordia transform is used to calculate the slopes of the current trajectories (knowledge-based). After that the data-driven method of random forest algorithm is used to train the fault diagnosis classifier with slopes data. Finally the knowledge-based and data-driven fault diagnosis methods are combined to achieve fault diagnosis and location.

This paper focuses on the aggregations of microgrids to form energy communities, which is beneficial to the management and the locality-balance of energy. Considering the time-varying character of photovoltaic power, we propose a novel algorithm to aggregate microgrids using the predicted data of net energy instead of historical data. The proposed algorithm firstly clusters the microgrids with positive net energy into different communities, based on Kmeans method, and then add the remaining microgrids with negative net energy into one selected cluster one by one according to the information of both location and total net energy of the cluster. Moreover, two evaluation factors are proposed to validate the efficiency of the proposed aggregation algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation algorithm can realize the energy balance of all communities as well as guarantee more communities with positive net energy and minimize the average distance of microgrids to the community center than SECs. © 2019 IEEE.","Data prediction; Energy community; Microgrid aggregations; Net energy","Clustering algorithms; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Photovoltaic cells; Aggregation algorithms; Balance of energies; Data prediction; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy community; Energy storage systems; Micro grid; Net energy; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076439614

The survey was conducted based on the rated power, storage tank sizes and period of operation in a day. The aim of the project is to review the energy efficiency and energy consumption of the geysers and boilers. From the survey, it shows that these water heating systems are operated 24 hours without any other control or energy management activities. Which means that power is supplied 24 hours a day and the thermostats automatically switch on to heat water whenever the water temperature decreases, even when there is no hot water demand. Also, seeing that load shifting can be a challenge mainly for the morning peak period due to the high hot water demand during that time because the majority of students' classes starts in the mornings. The energy consumption during peak periods is charged more than during normal or off-peak periods. Energy management activities can be applied to water heating processes in order to reduce the energy consumption and can therefore reduce the institution's energy costs.

The hot water contribution in the residential sector of South Africa is up to 60% on an average monthly basis and accounts for more than 50% of the monthly electricity cost. Electric storage tank water waters are the main contributors to the high energy consumption in the residences and most of the heating process takes place during the peak times, when electricity is more expensive than off-peak and normal time. This and the growing population and living standards of the economy has led to the high demand of electricity and energy shortage in the country. Reducing the desired end users' water temperature has been proposed as a solution to reduce the energy consumption this practice increases chances of diseases like legionella pneumophila. The water heating process could be incorporated with the time-of-use (TOU) tariff to reduce the energy consumption by load shifting from peak demand to off-peak or normal time. Renewable energy source technologies can also be used to reduce the energy consumption; however, the renewable energy systems show a common disadvantage in meeting the energy demand during certain climate conditions. And therefore, the hybrid energy systems can be implemented to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency of the renewable energy system. To further reduce the energy consumption, the TOU tariff can be used for optimal control and energy management of the hybrid system. © 2019 IEEE.","Heat pump; Residential demand; Solar system; South Africa; Water heating","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Heat pump systems; Heating; Housing; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Solar system; Heat pumps; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Residential demand; Solar assisted heat pump; South Africa; Time of use (TOU) tariffs; Water heating; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076347510

The actuality of this problem regarding the efficiency of the use of electricity is determined by the fact that at present most of the receivers in the residential sector are of single-phase type (washing machines, air conditioners, electric pumps, refrigerators, kitchen equipment, etc As a solution to increase the efficiency of the use of electricity in the consumption phase, the use of three-phase asynchronous motors is examined, which have higher energy performance indices compared to single-phase asynchronous motors. For the control of three-phase motors when supplying them from the single-phase network, a new three-phase inverter control algorithm is proposed, which has been called frequency-pulse-width-modulation (FPWM). The simultaneous modulation of the frequency and the width of the control impulses leads to the decrease of approximately 25% of the number of the control impulses of the transistors of the three-phase inverter. This ensures quality indices of electricity supplied to the three-phase asynchronous motor and minimal pollution of single-phase grid with the higher current harmonics. The proposed frequency-pulse-width-modulation algorithm excluded the function of intermediate energy storage in the electrolytic type DC filter capacitors, which have a shorter lifetime compared to other components of the voltage inverter. As a filter capacitor of the proposed three-phase inverter, only capacitors with dielectric film are used, which have a much smaller capacity value compared to the previously used electrolytic capacitors. The substitution of the electrolytic capacitors was possible because in the proposed inverter the dielectric film capacitors filter switching harmonics of the transistors. © 2019 IEEE.","AC-AC converters; energy efficiency; frequency-pulse-width-modulation; power conversion; pulse width modulation converters","AC-AC power converters; Air conditioning; Dielectric films; Electric energy storage; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy efficiency; Frequency modulation; Induction motors; Motors; Power quality; Pulse width modulation; Voltage control; AC-AC converters; Energy performance indices; Intermediate energies; Power conversion; Pulse width modulation converters; Single phase asynchronous motors; Three-phase asynchronous motor; Three-phase converter; Electric inverters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076225673

The paper deals the dual electricity - hydrogen charge station in interaction with smart grid and renewable energy sources all controlled by Energy Management System (EMS). The refueling stations have options for all-EVs: as BEV and PHEV or FCEVs. The EMS has the ability to control the loading and unloading of a hydrogen storage system and electricity production by fuel cell, managing the energy flow in order to maintain grid stability and could be solved if charging is used on times of low electricity demand and/or high supply.

Vehicles with electric propulsion systems, as well as those that use internal combustion engines (ICE) need to comply with certain EMC rules and not overtake an acceptable level of radiated emissions. Compared to ICE vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) need recharging of the battery after driving and this simple action may cause EMC issues by producing big levels of radiated emissions that are not acceptable for residential, commercial or light industrial environments. Also, while driving, all vehicles have to be compliant with EMC regulations, so that every electric/electronic system and subsystem inside the vehicle or in the proximity of the vehicle, to function as designed and not be harmful or affect in any way human beings or the environment. This study presents the different operating modes an EV should be tested from EMC point of view to check the generated level of radiated emissions. One of the operating modes is 'rechargeable energy storage system (REESS) in charging mode coupled to the power grid'. Another one is 'other than REESS in charging mode coupled to the power grid', but this operating mode can be split in two: 'driving mode' and 'ready to drive mode'. By analyzing the results obtained from performing real radiated emissions tests in a semi-anechoic chamber on an EV will show the differences between different operating modes, different location of the charging inlet and as well as different types of charging cables. © 2019 IEEE.","Electric Vehicle; Electromagnetic Compatibility; Operating modes; Radiated Emissions","Charging (batteries); Commercial vehicles; Electric power transmission networks; Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Industrial emissions; Internal combustion engines; Electric propulsion systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; High voltage components; Industrial environments; Operating modes; Radiated emissions; Semi-anechoic chambers; Electromagnetic compatibility",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075630300

However, the probability of timing failure in SRAM accessing becomes unacceptably high at low voltage, which makes the SRAM bottleneck of the system performance. The timing speculation SRAM (SSRAM) can recognize the timing failures and correct them by extending the bitline discharging time. But for the cache with an operation granularity of a cacheline, even one-bit cell with timing failure makes the whole cacheline to be accessed with the conservative timing margin, which nullifies the advantage of timing speculations. Such weak cachelines, which contain at least one-bit cell with timing failure, bring significant performance degradation in a low-voltage cache. In this paper, we propose RRS cache, a set-associative L1 cache based on the SSRAM, to reduce the weak cacheline access penalty under low supply voltages. RRS cache improves the proportion of the error-free cachelines (or strong cachelines) by clustering as more as possible bit cells with timing failures into weak cachelines. In addition, it swaps the frequently reused data to the strong cachelines to further reduce the average access latency and the energy consumption by an optimized filling/replacement policy. According to the simulation results, RRS cache improves the performance by 29.79% and reduces the energy consumption by 17.64% for a four-core processor with only 4.12% extra area overhead compared to the cache design with the raw timing speculation SRAM. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cacheline remapping; Low-voltage cache; Near-threshold voltage; Replacement policy; Timing speculation SRAM","Energy policy; Energy utilization; Outages; Threshold voltage; Timing circuits; Low supply voltages; Low voltages; Near thresholds; Performance degradation; Remapping; Replacement policy; Timing failures; Timing speculations; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075885173

At such scales, the use of batteries is in many cases infeasible, thus the nanonodes are envisioned to operate using only capacitors that rely on energy harvesting. This will result in constrained energy storage capacity with unpredictable charging rate, which will in turn yield non-periodic intermittent on-off behavior of the nanonodes. This paradigm is currently largely unexplored, hence it is challenging to make claims about the achievable network reliability. To provide initial insights, we investigate the reliability of nanoscale THz communication in a one-hop downlink broadcast scenario in face of intermittent on-off behavior of the receiving nanonodes. We do that because we believe that the reliable communication will be highly relevant for software-controlled metamaterial applications. Our results demonstrate the need for intelligent selection of energy levels for turning on and off the battery-less nanonodes. In addition and perhaps counter-intuitively, we demonstrate that the repetitions of packets substantially degrade the reliability of the considered nanonetwork. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Energy-harvesting; Metamaterials; Nanonetwork; Reliability; THz","Application programs; Energy harvesting; Metamaterials; Reliability; Secondary batteries; Software reliability; Constrained energy; Nano-networks; Nanonetwork; Nanoscale applications; Network reliability; Reliable communication; Terahertz frequencies; THz communications; Nanotechnology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073810244

Thus electric heating load is growing rapidly, which may result in some undesired problem to distribution grid due to its randomness and dispersed integration. However, electric heating load may be a kind of energy storage system by optimal control of its operation. So the optimal modeling of electric heating load characteristic considering its randomness is of important for grid planning and construction. In this paper, the heating loads of distributed residential users in a certain area are modeled based on Fanger Thermal Comfort Equation (FTCE) and the PMV thermal comfort index calculation method. Different temperatures are taken into consideration during modeling users' heating loads. According to the time- varying equation of inside temperature, the heat load demand curve is estimated. And then a multi-objective optimization model for electric heating load with heat energy storage is studied considering demand response (DR), which optimizes economy and comfort index.

The study presents a modelling approach for assessment of optimal operation of solar PV system for locomotive schedule operation in South Africa. The study approach entails indirect and direct system solar powered system (SPS) modelling, train loading modelling and cost evaluation model implication for economic assessment of its operation. In this study, a diesel-grid-SPS hybridisation in different configurations (three) was designed, simulated and analysed. The aim was to assess the most efficient and cost effective operation in relation to power provision to the locomotive while also addressing the issue of excess (surplus) supply back to the gird and its profitability. The operational running cost of the indirect systems seemed to present the cheapest alternative to fossil fuel energy usage for the train. However, energy storage technology capacity (battery weight) in respect of the indirect system makes it ideally not feasible for such purpose. From the result analysis, it can be deduced that the direct system is more economical from the point of energy cost performance characterization. © 2019 IEEE.","diesel-grid-SPS hybridisation; energy cost; locomotive schedule operation; SPS modelling; train-loading modelling","Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Locomotives; Operating costs; Solar energy; Alternative energy source; Alternative to fossil fuels; Economic assessments; Energy storage technologies; Optimal operation; Solar PV systems; Solar-powered system; Transport sectors; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088387685

The objective of such a power consumer is to minimize its long term time-averaged cost by jointly taking into account the operational constraints of its energy storage device, its stochastic solar power generation and time-varying load, as well as the fluctuating electricity prices. We formulate this energy management problem as a constrained stochastic programming problem. A real-time control algorithm is designed based on the Lyapunov optimization theory to provide an asymptotically optimal solution that can quickly adapt to the system dynamics without requiring any statistics of the system. The performance of the proposed real-time control algorithm is evaluated via both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. By comparing with a greedy algorithm, it is shown that the proposed control algorithm can save power consumption cost while improving the utilization of renewable energy generation. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy Management; Energy Storage Sharing; Lyapunov Optimization; Microgrids; Stochastic System","Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Real time control; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Asymptotically optimal; Dynamic energy managements; Electricity prices; Management problems; Operational constraints; Optimization theory; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy generators; Storage management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088368926

In this paper, a day-ahead scheduling strategy for a microgrid-like FCS with an in-station photovoltaic system (PVS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed. The strategy is modeled as a scenario-based stochastic optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the expected total operation cost in the next day. Considering the power exchange between the FCS and the grid, the operation cost contains the cost of buying power in the day-ahead market, the expected adjustment cost and penalty in the real-time market and the life loss cost of the BESS. A piecewise linear life loss calculation model of the BESS is adopted. The uncertainty of the PVS output and the fast charging demand are considered in the model through randomly generated scenarios. In each scenario the PVS output and fast charging demand are generated using a Monte Carlo simulation method. This strategy considers the life loss cost of the BESS effectively and provide reasonable day-ahead schedules.

The strategy considers the voltage sensitivity and voltage offset of each node, as well as the state of charge (SOC) and capacity of each energy storage device to determine the action priority and action threshold voltage of each energy storage device. According to the action threshold voltage and voltage data collected locally, each energy storage device discharges or charges to solve the voltage offset problem. Finally, a simulation model is built in MATLAB and the simulation results fully prove the effectiveness of this method. © 2019 IEEE.","action priority; energy storage device; measurement and control device; rural power grid; voltage offset","Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; MATLAB; Threshold voltage; Power grids; Priority control; Residential photovoltaic; Simulation model; State of charge; Voltage data; Voltage offsets; Voltage sensitivity; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084601083

In order to promote energy transformation, nuclear power and other power sources that originally only bear the base load will gradually share the burden of peak-regulation. With the advancement of nuclear power technology, its load-following performance has gradually improved. Nuclear power companies need to study their possible peak-regulation measures to prepare for the subsequent nuclear power to actively participate in the system load regulation. This paper explores the feasibility of nuclear-BESS hybrid systems for peak regulation and compares the economics under two different regulation modes (alternative peak-regulation mode and joint peak-regulation mode).

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a multi-time scale coordinated scheduling model for the combined system of Wind power-Photovoltaic-Thermal generator-Hydro pumped storage-Battery (WPTHB) by taking advantages of their complementary operation characteristics. The scheduling model is composed of three time scales: the day-ahead scheduling, the 1-hour ahead scheduling and 15-minute ahead scheduling. 1) in the day-ahead scheduling, based on the day-ahead forecast data of Wind-Photovoltaic power and Load demand (WPL), the optimal power outputs of thermal power units in 24 hours are solved from a mix integer linear programing (MILP) model to achieve the minimal operation cost of thermal units. 2) In the 1-hour ahead scheduling, based on power outputs of thermal units solved in the day-ahead scheduling and the 1-hour-ahead forecasted WPL, the hydro pumped storage power output is optimized to achieve its minimal operation cost. 3) In the 15-minute ahead scheduling, based on the day-ahead optimal power outputs of thermal units and the 1-hour ahead optimal outputs of pumped storages, the battery optimal power generation is obtained from a AC optimal power flow model solved by MATPOWER. Simulations of New England system validate that the proposed multi-time scale coordinated scheduling model could fully explore the different power regulation speeds and capacity of hydro pumped storages, thermal power generators and batteries to effectively alleviate WPL variations and achieve economic operation for multi-source generation systems. © 2019 IEEE.","1-hour ahead scheduling; 15-minute ahead scheduling; AC-optimal power flow; coordinated scheduling model; day-ahead scheduling; mix integer linear programing; Multi-time scale","Acoustic generators; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Hydroelectric generators; Integer programming; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Time measurement; Wind power; Ac optimal power flows; Coordinated scheduling; Day-ahead scheduling; Integer linear programing; Multi-time scale; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076777518

Dead-beat current control strategy, one of the most attractive digital current control strategies, enables the inductor current to reach the current reference in a minimal finite number of sampling cycles among digital current control strategies. However, steady state error and dynamic performance compromise will be introduced due to parameter mismatches. In this paper, based on a quantitative analysis for parameter mismatches' influence on steady state error and dynamic response, a self-correction and dead-beat current control algorithm is proposed to achieve both fast dynamic response and zero steady state error. The steady state error is eliminated by identifying system parameters with a least squares algorithm with forgetting factor. The dynamic response is fast with dead-beat control, enabling the inductor current to reach the current reference in quite few sampling cycles.

Moreover, the voltage stresses of high voltage side MOSFETs are significantly reduced in comparison with conventional active rectifiers. This facilitates an easier selection of low-cost and highly-reliable Si MOSFETs. To optimize the converter performance, a unique phase-shift and frequency hybrid modulation scheme are proposed.

The alternative disruptive changes include maximum electrification, hydrogen use or synthetic carbon-neutral hydrocarbons used as energy carriers. The enhanced PRIMES model presented in this paper includes all the options and the technologies enabling the energy transition towards a carbon-neutral EU economy by 2050.

Thus, suppressing the battery temperature rise is of great importance to enforce the reliability and extend the cycling life of batteries. In this paper, we propose a temperature-suppression power allocation strategy to address this issue. Specifically, the pulse technique is integrated into the control loop to reduce the battery average current during each pulse period, which is able to suppress the battery temperature rise efficiently. Meanwhile, the pulse technique is combined with a designed filter-based power allocation algorithm to distribute load power for batteries and supercapacitors. The proposed strategy can suppress the battery temperature rise under the premise of meeting load power requirements.

In a previous work, the technical functionality of a load management system solving the grid congestion issues was described. Here we aggregate the yearly energy balance and the associated costs in six case studies to verify that the roll-out of the new flexible loads is economically viable. The financial attractiveness of the roll-out of new flexible loads with reduced tariff system and future drop in technology price is verified in all these customers and the tariff reduction for conditional loads is the decisive factor of the profitability in four of them. © 2019 IEEE.","flexible loads; power grid capacity; power tariff; security of supply; smart grid","Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy security; Power markets; Flexible loads; Power grids; Power tariff; Security of supply; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076683593

But, because of the factor of the intermittent irradiance and ambient temperature so that the energy produced fluctuates and unstable. For PV connected to the grid, these power fluctuations affect system stability and frequency. To overcome this problem, several methods for PV power stabilization have been developed. One of them is the Constant Power Generation, where PV output power is limited to a certain power value so it can reduce PV power fluctuations. In this paper, the Dynamic Power Injection method is proposed as modification of the CPG method with energy storage batteries. In principle DPI similar with the CPG method that determines the power limit, but DPI operation include the active power management by charging and discharging action. The battery is using as energy storage when Power PV greater Power limit. On the other hand battery as an energy source for active power injection at Power PV less than Power limit. Thus the output power in each condition can be maintained as Power PV equal with P limit.

In recent years, a lot of research has been done to reduce the electrical energy consumption of data centers by high performance computing. However, very few researchers have focused on the electrical energy consumption by the electrical components inside the data center.

In addition, BLE based location services are deployed in many applications such as smart-buildings and industrial automation, where a scalable high-accuracy ranging solution is required for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) and real-time ranging. In state-of-the-art phase-based ranging, the accurate distance between two devices is measured one-to-one for each pair separately, which is not energy and time efficient for large-scale and dense deployment. In this paper, therefore, we introduce two high-accuracy concurrent phase-based ranging solutions, named group ranging, for large-scale and dense applications to improve the energy-consumption and ranging duration. Through experiment and mathematical analysis, we show that our proposed group ranging can improve the ranging duration by a factor of around n - 1, whereby n represents the number of devices. Furthermore, in this paper, we study the effect of proposed solutions in ranging accuracy in the presence of Crystal Offset Difference (COD) and phase-noise at the two devices involved in ranging. In addition, we introduce a solution to compensate for the ranging offset due to the COD. Finally, we propose how our group ranging solutions can be combined into the BLE standard data link layer in both connection-oriented and connectionless modes of operation. © 2019 IEEE.","BLE; Bluetooth; constant tone; large-scale; localization; phase; ranging; RTLS; trilateration","Bluetooth; Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Radio communication; Range finding; Real time systems; Smartphones; constant tone; large-scale; localization; phase; RTLS; Trilateration; Location based services",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075903005

The challenges are mainly due to the limited fault current contributed by the DGs during the fault. This paper focuses on key issues with overcurrent protection schemes with various configurations of DGs and connection points. It was found that the current magnitude based conventional overcurrent relays would fail to operate in islanded operation of microgrids, while in grid-connected mode, the relays would operate but with extended time delay or would not operate for certain fault locations with high penetration of DGs. Overrated converter interfaced DGs would cause problems such as relay blinding and sympathetic tripping. The problems are examined and discussed in cases with DGs interfaced by rated and overrated converters in islanded and grid-connected operations, as well as in cases of different connection points of DGs, energy storage system and fault locations in the microgrid. The paper also attempts to suggest and discuss a number of protection solutions to the presented issues considering cost and reliability aspects. © 2019 IEEE.","converter interfaced DG; Medium-voltage microgrid; protection blinding; relaying; sympathetic tripping","Electric power transmission networks; Overcurrent protection; Smart power grids; converter interfaced DG; Micro grid; protection blinding; relaying; sympathetic tripping; Surge protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075902690

One of the possible proposals for addressing these issues is a hybrid system consisting of a synchronous condenser and a battery energy storage system (BESS). The most significant benefit of a synchronous condenser is that it retains the fundamental characteristics of a conventional synchronous generator, while the main contribution of BESS is the possibility of storing energy and frequency support. BESS is connected to the grid through a power converter, which means that it is also capable of providing reactive power. The reactive power sharing between the two components needs to be coordinated, so that they share an equal amount of reactive power under overexcited and underexcited operating conditions.

Efficiently integrating renewable energies needs to ensure the availability of electricity at all times and the compliance with stability limits, despite the fluctuation in energy generation. The future advancement of electrical networks can be supported by corresponding models. Due to the high time resolution required and the associated computational effort of todaýs modeling tools simplifications which influence the model accuracy must be made. The methodology presented in this paper for accurately modeling electrical networks regarding active and reactive power uses the cellular approach for aggregating network structures, thus enabling the required simplifications. This allows preserving the electrical behavior of the initial grid as well as fast calculations of complex power systems. Models within the cellular approach enable efficiently designing and planning of cross energy carrier systems as well as storages. Since plants for renewable energy generation are used centrally and decentrally in different sizes and therefore at different voltage levels, the applicability of the methodology is tested according to the specific topologies and characteristics at different voltage levels. © 2019 IEEE.","(Power system planning); Modeling; Power distribution lines; Power system simulation; Reactive power","Electric network parameters; Fossil fuels; Models; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Active and Reactive Power; Computational effort; Energy infrastructures; Power distribution lines; Power system planning; Power system simulations; Renewable energy carrier; Renewable energy generation; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075709471

This behavior is due to their complex data access patterns, limited data reusability, and low arithmetic intensity. To overcome these issues, we harness the potential of near-memory computing by offloading a horizontal diffusion kernel, which is a compound stencil kernel, from the COSMO weather prediction application to a reconfigurable fabric. We use a heterogeneous system that comprises a CPU and an FPGA with on-chip SRAM memory and on-board DRAM memory. By introducing a memory hierarchy tailored to the targeted application and using a coherent memory model, we move the computation close to the memory, which improves memory efficiency. Our hardware design on the FPGA uses high-level synthesis techniques and results in an accelerator with IBM CAPI 2.0 (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) technology. We evaluate it against a tuned software implementation running on an IBM POWER9 host system. The experimental results show that these kernels on an FPGA can outperform a complete 16-core POWER9 node (configured with 64 threads) by 3.3x.

Fog radio access network (Fog-RAN) offers a promising solution by integrating the computing power and storage of edge processing nodes (e.g., base stations). In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning task selection and downlink transmit beamforming approach to improve the communication efficiency while achieving green computing, i.e., minimizing the sum of computation power consumption for deep learning tasks and downlink transmit power consumption. For efficient algorithm design, we exploit the group sparsity structure of the aggregated beamforming vector and propose a log-sum based group sparse beamforming framework. An iteratively reweighted l1 algorithm is developed to solve the nonconvex and nonsmooth log-sum minimization problem. Furthermore, we derive the global convergence result of the iteratively reweighted l1 algorithm, which shows that it converges to the first-order stationary point from any feasible starting point. Simulation results demonstrate that our log-sum based group sparse beamforming approach for deep learning tasks processing is more efficient than state- of-the-art approaches in terms of power consumption. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Beamforming; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Fog; Green computing; Iterative methods; Radio access networks; Communication efficiency; Computation power; Downlink transmit beamforming; Global conver-gence; Group sparsities; Minimization problems; State-of-the-art approach; Stationary points; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075228482

The traditional TOU price optimization model only considers the purchasing power of a single customer with the photovoltaic (PV) system. However, for multi-customer, the total purchasing power is related to the PV ratio coefficient, so it is necessary to construct the total purchasing power model based on the PV ratio coefficient. First, this paper establishes the model of energy storage battery (ESB) electricity and calculates the purchasing power for a single customer with a PV system. Next, the model of the multi-customer's total purchasing power is established by the PV ratio coefficient, and the objective functions of TOU price are constructed with the purpose of peak power shifting.

Remote areas need reliable solutions for fulfilling electricity needs for their daily life activities across the globe. Wind energy utilization is increasing worldwide with wind-battery-load topology as a cost-effective solution for remote area electrification and standalone hybrid microgrid clusters. Intelligent control of voltage source inverter (VSI) ensures high power quality with efficient voltage and frequency profile for sensitive and critical loads. While maximum wind power extraction provides reliable solution with battery energy storage system (BESS). In this paper, finite control set model predictive voltage control (FCS-MPVC) is proposed for wind-battery based standalone microgrid to regulate load voltage and frequency. Control hierarchy consists of dc-dc converters and VSI. Wind maximum power is extracted by using dc-dc boost converter and DC bus voltage is stabilized by using bidirectional battery converter.

First, an active buck-boost topology is considered, where a low-pass filter is applied to allocate load currents for batteries and supercapacitors. Then we design a feed-forward load compensator with the objective of suppressing the DC bus voltage fluctuations. Different from existing studies, the expressions of the compensator and the low-pass filter have been built analytically.

Therefore, the local electricity market has local resources, the inflexible and flexible residential loads, and the connection to the distribution network. This connection is used for buying energy from the wholesale market through a retailer. For evaluating the feasibility of the scheduling in a local energy market, an optimization model is proposed in this study to maximize the operational profits from the local electricity market, which is managed by an energy service company (ESCO). There are revenues from selling the energy to all residential loads, while the costs come from buying the electricity and managing all the local resources.

However, the inverter connecting the BESS may suffer performance and stability issues when due to a low short circuit ratio (SCR) the inverter phase-locked loop (PLL) and the grid impedance negatively interact. To address this issue this work proposes a robust proportional-integral controller (R-PI) for the inverter inner-loop current control. The R-PI is synthesized by the structured H-infinity method using MATLAB and the performance is compared with a regular proportional-integral controller (PI) designed by the conventional frequency shaping method. A sensitivity analysis that includes the dynamic impact of the PLL is conducted for varying SCR. The analysis is verified by time domain simulations in MATLAB and shows that both the R-PI and the PI maintained the inverter stability under the worst-case SCR of 2. However, the benchmarked transient performance of the regular PI was compromised under the simulated SCR variation of 7.2 to 2, while the R-PI was capable of maintaining this performance throughout the SCR variation. © 2019 IEEE.","frequency response; phase locked loop; robust control; short circuit ratio; voltage source inverter","Controllers; Electric inverters; Frequency response; Locks (fasteners); MATLAB; Phase locked loops; Robust control; Sensitivity analysis; Two term control systems; Chemical batteries; Frequency compensation; Phase Locked Loop (PLL); Proportional integral controllers; Short circuit ratio; Time-domain simulations; Transient performance; Voltage source inverter; Time domain analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073345891

The new advent of tram lines cannot be separated from the electric mobility policies and the new technological developments. Among other features, trams that can ride on light rail infrastructures, as well as, heavy rail infrastructures have been adopted in many European cities. A core challenge when developing this type of solutions is to make compatible infrastructures running at different frequencies and voltage levels, as for instance, to develop trams able to operate at standard voltages (in line with EN50163/IEC60850), as for instance, 750 VDC in an urban area or 15 kV 162/3Hz in rail lines. Considering standard voltage levels for heavy and light rail operation, the main purpose of this paper is to describe an adaptive converter based on modular stages. This converter also includes intermediate energy storage (batteries and ultracapacitors) and is designed considering a system with 6 traction motors. To analyze the behavior and viability of the proposed converter, a simulation model of the entire system is developed based on models in line with the dynamics of such electrical systems. The results obtained show that is possible to operate a tram under different feeding conditions based on a modular solution. © 2019 IEEE.","Adaptative converter; light rail; multi-voltage; traction","Electric lines; Electric traction; Railroad transportation; Adaptative converter; Different frequency; Electrical systems; Feeding conditions; Intermediate energies; Light rail; Multi-voltage; Technological development; Trolley cars",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073337268

To this aim, and unlike related studies of the current state-of-the-art, the approach presented in this paper is based on a multiperiod optimization model that simulates half-hourly operational decisions. The optimization model includes a non-linear power flow equation based representation of the system, branch capacity constraints (instead of energy flows-the traditional state-of-the-art practice), different feasible battery sizes (currently available in the market), high RES penetration levels, the time of use electricity prices (half-hour dynamic prices), load data of customers (defined from real-world profiles), and reference battery costs (from existing literature). The objective is to decide the location and size of the battery storage within the medium voltage electrical network by minimizing the difference between operational and capital expenditures. The location of the battery storage is modeled with binary variables, whereas the size is modeled as a parameter first and then as a continuous variable. The value of the optimization model is demonstrated in a case study built upon a modified version of the IEEE 33 bus test system. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Electric network parameters; Location; Optimization; Capacity constraints; Capital expenditures; Continuous variables; Cost-effective approach; Operational decisions; Optimization modeling; Power flow equations; Time-of-use electricity price; Electric batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073331906

However, management and control approaches are required for seamless integration of these systems in energy efficient buildings. In this paper, a model predictive control approach is introduced for efficient MG operation. The proposed approach allows minimizing the usage of the traditional electric grid for supplying the power to the building's loads by using as much as possible the power generated by RES while optimizing the storage devices operations. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed in order to balance the power flow in MG system. The deployed strategy controls the charge/discharge current of the battery depending on RES production, and load consumption variability.

The study investigates EV integration pathways with different degrees of flexibility provided by the charging schemes passive charging (PC), Grid-To-Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) in the energy system model Balmorel. While PC yields in the largest annualized system cost, V2G can achieve considerable savings. Smart charging schemes reduces electricity price variability considerably compared to PC. Further, investments in additional battery storage systems are delayed using G2V until 2050 whereas PC have significantly larger requirements already decades before. The flexible charging schemes have subsequently positive effects on emission reduction. Allowing the model to use the foresight mode and taking into account future developments earlier reduces the system cost of all scenarios. While V2G still is the cheapest option, it however, is considerably small in the improvements which shows a certain robustness whereas PC gains relatively more by being able to adjusting earlier for the substantial peak demand requirements. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy market design; Flexibility; Internal energy market/system integration; Market integration of renewable energy sources","Commerce; Emission control; Integration; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Battery storage system; Energy market designs; Flexibility; Grid to vehicle (G2V); Internal energy market; Market integration; Variable renewable energies; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071566584

Firstly, vibration signals were divided into blocks according to their cutting size and an energy sequence was produced in accordance with the energy of each signal block. Secondly, the energy sequence was classified by the QPSO algorithm to obtain the biggest variance. Whereafter, using the K-SVD algorithm, the proposed adaptive sparse dictionary learning framework enhances reconstruction capability of vibration signals. Finally, bearing fault testing experiment validates the effectiveness of the adaptive compression sensing method method.

An effective ADT needs to ensure failure mechanism consistency of products between various accelerated stresses and normal stress. Thus, a new test method for failure mechanism consistency of accelerated degradation test based on wiener process is proposed in this paper. Frist, degradation modeling for products based on Wiener process is established, and the link between the drift parameter of the Wiener process and accelerated stresses is set up by using accelerated models, such as Arrhenius equation. The relationship among drift parameters under different accelerated stresses is deduced based on the hypothesis that failure mechanism of products under different stresses is consistent when corresponding failure activation energies are invariant. Then, test samples are constructed separately under different stresses and assumed to satisfy a normal distribution, and t statistic is used for these samples to test failure mechanisms consistency. Finally, the accelerated storage degradation data of a certain type of resistor are used as an example to calculate failure mechanism variation interval of this resistor, which verifies the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.","accelerated degradation test; consistency of failure mechanisms; failure activation energy; Wiener process","Activation energy; Digital storage; Normal distribution; Random processes; Reliability; Resistors; Safety engineering; Testing; Accelerated degradation tests; Accelerated models; Accelerated storages; Accelerated stress; Arrhenius equation; Failure activation energy; Failure mechanism; Wiener process; Failure (mechanical)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082389351

In this paper, the comparison of inductive XRAM generator and capacitor-based (C-based) generator topologies is discussed for the excitation of an electromagnetic launcher (EML). In addition, the effect of capacitance or inductance of the storage element on the load current and laucher efficiency is investigated. The circuit simulation results of these PPS topologies are presented, each of which having 200 kJ PPS energy. The EML used in the study has 0.1 kg total mass of projectile, 3 m long rail. Although the energy density of the XRAM generators is larger than C-based PPSs, the design of an XRAM generator is more challenging than C-based PPS due to the large voltage drop of its opening switches. Moreover, the efficiency of the total system is highly dependent on the design of the storage element. For the XRAM generator, the efficiency is limited by the capability of the opening switches. In this study, using RC snubber circuit, the voltage stress on the GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor opening switches of the XRAM generator is decreased to 2 kV peak voltage, which is available in the market. © 2019 IEEE.","C-based pulsed power supply; electromagnetic launcher; opening switch; Pulsed power generation; XRAM generator","Capacitance; Circuit simulation; Electric excitation; Electromagnetic launchers; Launching; Oscillators (electronic); Power electronics; Topology; Capacitive type; Comparative studies; Opening switch; Pulsed power supply; Pulsed-power; Snubber circuit; Storage elements; XRAM generator; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081556869

Today, bidirectional power transfer is needed in many applications that include battery based energy storage. Serving a compact solution for this problem is crucial in order to reduce the total size of the system where the physical size is a critical subject. Various types of bidirectional DC/DC converters are implemented for this purpose in literature.

However, a stable and efficient operation is urgently needed due to the complex relationship between multiple subgrids and bidirectional power converter (BPC). In this paper, a flexible virtual inertial control method with equalization algorithm is proposed for AC/DC hybrid microgrid with hydrogen storage, which firstly calculates the battery state of charge (SOC) difference coefficients according to operation state and the initial SOC of the battery by employing equalization algorithm, so that the power between AC and DC subgrids can be allocated in accordance with the battery SOC, and the SOC balance can be achieved, battery service life can be prolonged. After that, the proposed method adopts the virtual inertia control based on virtual capacitor voltage for bidirectional DC/DC droop control by comparing with the VSG control strategy, which enhances the system inertia under power disturbance and improves the system stability. Then, the system operation is divided into four modes. Aiming at the situation that the AC and DC subgrids are at the same time in the condition of power deficiency or power sufficiency, the hydrogen storage system is now utilized to absorb power to produce hydrogen or to supply power by consuming hydrogen, so as to improve the system reliability. Finally, an RT-LAB-based real-time simulation platform verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","AC/DC hybrid microgrid; hydrogen storage; SOC balance; virtual inertia","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); DC-DC converters; Equalizers; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Storage as a service (STaaS); System stability; Battery state of charge; Bi-directional power converter; Difference coefficients; Equalization algorithms; Micro grid; Real time simulation platform; Renewable energy source; virtual inertia; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079066628

To accurately and efficiently evaluate the reliability of MES, this paper proposes a fast MES reliability evaluation method using multi-parametric linear programming (MPLP). The energy conversion, transmission and storage in MES are compactly and linearly descried by energy hub model, making the load curtailment optimization problem of MES a linear programming (LP) problem. MPLP is introduced to avoid computational burdens caused by iteratively solving LP problems for a large number of samples during the evaluation process. Case studies are conducted on both imaginary MES and SES. The results show that the proposed method improves the evaluation efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the traditional LP method and the reliability of energy supply is distinctly improved due to energy integration. © 2019 IEEE.","energy hub; Monte Carlo simulation; multi-parametric linear programming; multienergy systems; reliability evaluation","Energy conversion; Energy resources; Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Reliability; Computational burden; Energy hub modeling; Energy hubs; Energy infrastructures; Multi-energy systems; Optimization problems; Parametric linear programming; Reliability Evaluation; Linear programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079031822

Mathematical models of individual consumer usage as well as demand of electricity are explored.

In this paper, a small-scale hybrid renewable microgrid (MG) based DC-bus scheme is presented. This kind of configuration eliminates issues related to frequency stability, synchronization and reactive power flow. Both the solar power generating system (SPGS) and the wind power generating system (WPGS) are manipulated to extract their maximum available powers. A battery storage system (BSS) is used to supply the loads during critical periods to certify supplying loads round-the-clock. Operation of the battery is moderated using a battery control unit (BCU) based PI controller which supervises the different modes of operation. Moreover, the BCU ensures a fixed DC-bus voltage at different circumstances such as variable wind speed, variable radiation and loading events. Furthermore, the continuous load feeding at constant voltage amplitude and frequency for balanced loading conditions is accomplished using the prime inverter controller. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Storage System; DC-bus Microgrid; Hybrid Microgrid; MPPT Techniques","Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric machinery; Microgrids; Reactive power; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Wind; Wind power; Battery storage system; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Integration of renewable energies; Micro grid; Modes of operation; Power generating systems; Reactive power flow; Wind-power generating systems; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077116892

Consequently, the monitoring of this component is a key point to increase the reliability, security and avoiding serious damage in machine. Vibration signal is widely used for diagnosis which is considered as a powerful tool for detecting mechanical defects. In this paper, a rolling bearing fault-diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. First, the processing methodology of bearing diagnosis starts with the decomposition of the vibration signal by VMD technique into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). According to the aim of fault diagnosis, the selected fault indicator is calculated from the energy related to the most sensitive IMFs to the bearing defect. Second, the extracted feature is then used as input to the ANN. the proposed approach is then validated using data from the bearing data center of Case Western Reserve University.

However, the wireless channel states between mobile devices vary rapidly and are difficult to predict, which makes it difficult to determine the computation offloading strategy. In this paper, we propose a parallel reinforcement learning based computation offloading (RLCO) scheme, which enables offloading nodes to learn the computation offloading strategy distributedly based on the historical channel states. In our proposed RLCO, each offloading node is considered as an agent to learn how to satisfy the latency of computation and transmission and the SNR of both offloading node and cooperative node while minimizing the energy consumption based on Q-learning. After training, the Q-values of each agent are used to form their preference lists used in the matching stage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RLCO has a good performance in reducing the system energy consumption. © 2019 IEEE.","Computation offloading; Device-to-device communications; Matching theory; Reinforcement learning","Computation theory; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Machine learning; Signal to noise ratio; Computation offloading; Computation resources; D2D communications; Device-to-Device communications; Matching theory; Parallel reinforcement learning; Storage resources; System energy consumption; Reinforcement learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074064755

This energy is extremely useful in various industrial applications ranging from electricity generation and desalination to refrigeration and hot water consumption. The ability of a pond to collect and store thermal energy in storage zone is dependent on effective stratification to suppress natural thermal convection. This stratified region is formed as a result of injection of a solution of varying salinity densities into a saline region. Once formed, maintenance of this stratified region is of utmost importance to trap maximum heat in the pond. This is carried out through injection of saline water through diffuser in specific regions to overcome the effects of dissociation. Diffuser design remained an area of utmost interest in the evolution of solar pond and detailed research has been carried out to overcome the effect of buoyancy in the stratified region and extend the range of plume emanated from the diffuser. Diffusers of varying designs and shapes including diffusers with round and rectangular outlets have been employed in solar ponds over the past few decades. Although researchers have concluded that semi-circular diffusers with rectangular slots are more efficient, yet limited research has been carried out to validate these results using Computational Fluid Dynamics. In research focus has been laid on diffuser designs and comparison of these designs followed by computational analysis of their effect on the emanating flow. Various CFD modeling approaches from the family of Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) have been discussed in this research including the semi empirical k-E model based upon the dissipation rate and turbulent kinetic energy. Based upon these results optimum diffuser design for stratification in a salinity gradient solar pond has been established using CFD technique which has previously been studied on a limited scale. This has enabled in design of optimized gradient formation and maintenance mechanism. © 2019 IEEE.","Buoyant jet; Diffuser; Isohaline layers; k ϵ model; Reynolds average Navier Stokes; solar pond","Buoyancy; Computational fluid dynamics; Desalination; Diffusers (optical); Heat convection; Industrial refrigeration; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Lakes; Navier Stokes equations; Saline water; Thermal energy; Buoyant jets; Computational analysis; Electricity generation; Isohaline layers; Reynolds average Navier-Stokes; Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes; Salinity gradient solar ponds; Turbulent kinetic energy; Solar ponds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073684511

This energy is used in various industrial applications ranging from electricity generation and desalination to refrigeration and hot water consumption. The ability of a pond to collect and store thermal energy in storage zone is dependent on effective stratification to suppress natural thermal convection. Diffusion and high temperature gradients result in encroachment of convective zones and development of additional internal convective zones. This results in degradation of stratification hence reducing the thermal efficiency of solar pond. In this scenario, maintenance of salinity gradient comes into play which involves monitoring of different parameters of the stratified region and injecting the fluid through diffusers controlled by feedback and control mechanism. Over the past few decades various methodologies have been developed for optimized maintenance of the stratified region. This research has thoroughly analyzed the gradient maintenance techniques, specifically focusing on injection mediums and their effects on the salinity gradient maintenance. The two configurations of injection medium i.e. injection of highly turbulent columnar jets into homogeneous convective zones and the injection of low exit Froude number fluid through a disk-shaped diffuser (most common) are elaborately analyzed and compared. Moreover, the effect of size shape of the injector slots and followed by fluid velocity of injector on the flow pattern exiting the injection medium has been thoroughly analyzed. The analysis and comparison of different gradient maintenance and formation techniques show that flow discharge through a half disc shaped diffuser with rectangular slots at Froude No ranging from 12-18 is optimum for the stratified region. The analysis of an optimized injection mechanism has enabled formation and maintenance of a linearly distributed stratified region in the non-convective zone (NCZ) resulting in more heat collection in the lower convective zone (LCZ). © 2019 IEEE.","buoyant jets; gradient establishment; nozzle design; Salinity gradient solar pond; turbulent jets","Desalination; Diffusion in liquids; Flow patterns; Heat convection; Industrial refrigeration; Lakes; Maintenance; Nozzle design; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Buoyant jets; Electricity generation; High temperature gradient; Injection mechanisms; Lower convective zones; Salinity gradient solar ponds; Thermal convections; Turbulent jet; Solar ponds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073669427

Among those cached data, inactive data and suspension data account for a large portion during the execution. These data remain in memory until they are expelled or accessed again. During the period, DRAM needs to consume a lot of refresh energy to maintain these low profit data. Such a great energy waste can be terminated if we use NVM as alternation. Meanwhile, NVM is smaller cell-sized that it provides more in-memory room for caching data instead of disk access in DRAM setting. However, NVM can not completely take the place of DRAM due to its superiority in terms of access latency and endurance. So, hybrid DRAM/NVM memory architectures turns to be the optimal solution and have a promising prospect to solve the memory capacity and energy consumption dilemmas for in-memory big data computing systems. With this observation, in this paper, we propose a data caching framework for Spark in hybrid DRAM/NVM memory configuration. By identifying the data access behaviors with active factor and active stage distance, cache data with higher local I/O activity is prioritized cached in DRAM, while cache data with lower activity is placed into NVM.

However, in areas with poor or lack of infrastructure, the deployment of 5G is a challenge for mobile operators because of the potential low return on investment. One of the promising technologies for low cost computing networks is fog computing, which selectively moves resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking at the edge of the network closer to the users, thereby improving the speed of decision-making, network cost, and the performance of the system. In this paper, we aim to investigate how fog computing can enable cost-efficient solutions in underserved areas to compensate for the economic drawback of low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), and at the same time provide good quality service for users that meets essential performance requirements. We propose a fog-based architecture that exploits local computation, storage, communication, control, and decision making as a means to reduce communication costs and energy consumption and thus overcome the cost issue in 5G deployment. Preliminary simulation results show that the architecture performs better than cloud-only deployments in terms of energy consumption and delay in a smart agriculture system. © 2019 IEEE.","5G; edge computing; fog architecture; fog computing; Internet of Things","5G mobile communication systems; Computer architecture; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Fog; Green computing; Internet of things; Investments; Network architecture; Wireless networks; Average revenue per users; Communication cost; Computing architecture; Local computation; Network ecosystem; Performance requirements; Smart agricultures; Under-served areas; Fog computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073188617

In case of an external fault, the variation of the line storage energy, the distributed resistance energy loss, and the energy injected from both ends of the transmission line satisfy the energy balance equation, and in this case the energy balance is independent of the line length. However, in case of an internal fault, the energy dissipated by the fault resistance breaks the energy balance. Based on the theory of energy balances, this paper proposes a novel pilot protection principle. Compared with the existing long-distance transmission line protection principles, the proposed pilot protection principle has the advantage of not being influenced by the distributed parameters of the long line, and in addition it is suitable for identification of high-resistance grounded faults. A simulation based on EMTDC/PSCAD illustrates the benefits of the proposed approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy balance; Half-wavelength transmission lines; Identification of high-resistance faults; Line protection; Pilot protection","Electric fault currents; Electric power system protection; Energy balance; Energy dissipation; Current differential protection; Distributed capacitive current; Half wavelength; High resistance faults; High-resistance grounded; Line protection; Long distance transmission; Pilot protection; Electric lines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072983519

To improve its dynamic characteristics in the case of fluctuations at the input and output ends, a new control strategy is proposed. The strategy is based on direct power control (DPC) which obtains the transmission power deduced from the single phase shift control and the virtual current is introduced to amend it. This strategy eliminates the need for device parameters to participate in the control and only samples the input and output voltages which significantly simplifies the controller structure and improves its compatibility.

In such infrastructures, energy hub is an interface among different energy systems, playing the role of energy production, conversion and storage. The capacity of energy hub largely determines how tightly these energy systems are coupled and how flexibly the whole system would behave. This paper proposes a data-driven two-stage robust stochastic programming model for energy hub capacity planning with distributional robustness guarantee. Renewable generation and load uncertainties are modelled by a family of ambiguous probability distributions near an empirical distribution in the sense of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure. The objective is to minimize the sum of the construction cost and the expected life-cycle operating cost under the worst-case distribution restricted in the ambiguity set. Network energy flow in normal operating conditions is considered; demand supply reliability in extreme conditions is taken into account via robust chance constraints. Through duality theory and sampling average approximation, the proposed model is transformed into an equivalent convex program with a nonlinear objective and linear constraints, and is solved by an outer-approximation algorithm which entails solving only linear program. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Approximation algorithms; Convex optimization; Digital storage; Energy resources; Life cycle; Linear programming; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Probability distributions; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Capacity of energies; Distributional robustness; Empirical distributions; Integrated energy systems; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Normal operating conditions; Outer approximation algorithm; Stochastic programming model; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069964159

Steady, laminar and incompressible air flow inside a vented cavity representing a realistic cold room model has been investigated numerically in the present work.

Two and three dimensional governing Navier-Stokes and energy equations in non-dimensional form are solved numerically by using finite element method with discretization by triangular mesh elements. In this study, numerical solution is obtained for different Richardson numbers (Ri = 0.1-10) and Reynolds numbers (Re = 1-280) in laminar flow regime. Heat transfer and flow characteristics are presented in terms of isotherms, streamlines and average Nusselt number for all the heat sources. All the simulations were performed for both the 2D and 3D models of the cold room keeping Grashof number at a fixed value. Variation of average Nusselt number of the heat sources and average temperature of the flow field inside the room have been plotted against Reynolds and Richardson numbers to understand the contribution of these parameters on mixed convection heat transfer inside the room.

It is one of the most important parts of the food cold chain and has tremendous potential for improvement in terms of energy savings, fuel economy and emission characteristics. However, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the existing refrigerated transport system in Bangladesh, which is largely unstructured with a clear lack of understanding and standard in this field. Often this leads to an over or under-cooled refrigerated space without any regard to the chilling requirement of the perishable goods being transported. The current study attempts at a detailed assessment of the existing refrigerated transport system in Bangladesh. This mapping includes parameters such as the number and type of refrigerated vehicles, size, design, fuel consumption, type of refrigeration system, refrigeration performance, and energy efficiency. Most recent data on transport refrigeration vehicles obtained from the government regulatory authority are analyzed systematically and present trend in the capacity, type, and use of these vehicles are clearly identified. Moreover, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling is carried out to examine the effects of commonly practiced storage pattern on the performance of the transport refrigeration system. It is found that the use of crates in storing products results in a non-uniform air-flow distribution within the chamber which subsequently results in an uneven and improper cooling of the stored perishable goods. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069777510

However, their suitability is based on various criteria, which include thermo-physical and mechanical properties, stability and compatibility with both the heat transfer fluid and the container. This work aims to investigate the potential of three natural rocks namely (leuco-gabbro, dolerite and wherlite), which were collected from the region of Kettara near to the site of Green energy park Benguerir Morocco from where the prototype of dual thermocline will be constructed. This prototype will be related to Fresnel collectors with an operating temperature from 100°C to 300°C with thermal oil as heat transfer fluid. For that, a deep literature review was summarized to determine the parameters influencing the mechanical and thermal stability of rocks. Additionally an experimental study was conducted to define the petrographic characterizations by using the optical microscopy light. Moreover, the SEM/EDX techniques were used to analyze their chemical compositions and structures. Finally, their thermo-physical properties (density, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity) were measured. As a conclusion, all the studied rocks are good potential candidates for this target application, yet their long-term stability and compatibility must be determined to confirm their suitability. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069772723

In recent years, many researchers have highlighted the use of Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (LHTES) systems, this is especially because the high energy density can be stored during phase change. Notwithstanding this great potential, the feasibility of LHTES with PCM is still limited, mainly due to a low thermal conductivity. In this sense, the exchanger with fins is the most effective proposal which is based on the increase of the exchange surface. After a review of recent advances in LHS systems with a focus on methods for improving the thermal conductivity of MCPs, and a selection methodology (Exchanger + PCM) adequate. The main objective of this paper is to develop, perform and compare a numerical study of a new finned exchanger (double pipe with Longitudinal fins on the external pipe, Phase Change Material in the annular space between the two pipes and HTF in the inner pipe) with a classic exchanger without fins. This comparative study was done according to the process of heat transfer during melting (charging) at average temperature (180-280°C). In addition, the results obtained were adapted for an implementation of Fresnel solar power installed at Green Energy Park (1 MWe) in Morocco. This study has shown that the first exchanger has a good compactness, can store enough latent energy, and significantly overcome the problem of low thermal conductivity related to the second heat exchanger. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069765003

However, the high computational complexity and energy consumption of NNs impede their deployment on embedded and mobile platforms, where computational resources and energy are limited. Most of the existing accelerators are based on traditional Von Neumann(VN) architecture, which separates computing from storage, and the massive data movement between the processor and off-chip memory causes great power consumption. In-memory computing (IMC) architecture integrates computing and storage together to eliminate explicit memory access, reducing energy-hungry data transmission. On the other hand, binary neural network (BNN) restricts the weight and activation value to either-1 or +1, converting a large number of multiplications into simple bit-wise XNOR logical operations, and significantly reduces the complexity of computation and amount of memory access. We propose an energy efficient in-memory BNN architecture that performs matrix-vector multiplication (M×V) of FC layers. The bit-wise XNOR operation is realized on the bit line of SRAM, making the data fetching is part of the computation. The accumulation and binarization are performed in time domain with analog and digital mixed-signal processing, which can be blended with SRAM to minimize the data transmission overhead.

They employ perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJs) as non-volatile backup storage elements and explore the spin-orbit torque (SOT) with the assistance of the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect (VCMA), referred to voltage-gated SOT (VGSOT), to perform the backup operation. Owing to the aid of the VCMA effect, the critical SOT write current for 1-ns backup operation can be significantly reduced, thus resulting in high speed and low power consumption. Moreover, such small write current allows to be driven by the cross-coupled inverters in the SRAM cell, instead of a dedicated write driver, thereby leading to low cell area overhead. By using a commercial CMOS 40 nm design kit and a physics-based VGSOT-MTJ model, we have demonstrated their functionalities and evaluated their performance. Compared to previous MNV-SRAM cell circuits, the proposed MNV-SRAM cell circuits can achieve lower backup energy dissipation, smaller backup delay and less cell area overhead. Additionally, the proposed MNV-SRAM cell circuits can achieve field-free backup operation, thus being suitable for practical applications. © 2019 IEEE.","field-free; Magnetic Non-volatile SRAM (MNV-SRAM); magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ); spin-orbit torque (SOT); voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA)","Cells; Cytology; Delay circuits; Energy dissipation; Integrated circuit design; Logic design; Low power electronics; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Nanotechnology; Spin orbit coupling; Tunnel junctions; Backup operations; Backup storages; Cross-coupled; Low-power consumption; Magnetic tunnel junction; Nonvolatile SRAM; Voltage-controlled; Write currents; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084949325

These kinds of applications generally need to be implemented on the smart terminals, which means that a kind of hardware platform with high energy efficiency and real-time performance is required. However, CNNs for semantic segmentation usually contain some symmetrical encoders and decoders, corresponding to the down-sampling process (e.g., pooling, convolution) and the up-sampling process (e.g., unpooling, deconvolution). All of these processes are computing and storage intensive, which limits their applicability in the resource constrained embedded systems. In this paper, an FPGA-based accelerator programed by OpenCL is proposed. We evaluate its performance on the CamVid dataset. The global accuracy only drops by 2.04% with 8-bit quantization.

However, unlike the forward mode, proper controls of both the output and input sides are required for reverse H3IMC. Based on the mathematical model of the reverse H3IMC system, a double closed-loop control strategy is proposed in this paper, by which load voltage and input current are both under control. By this strategy, satisfying load voltage and input current can be still achieved even under light load condition, which has been proved to be difficult for reverse traditional indirect matrix converter (IMC). For better feasibility, the design of the PI regulator for the outer voltage loop control is included by limiting the value ranges of PI parameters Kp and K in this paper.

Users of electric vehicles require high-quality distribution and well-covered charging network. The obstacles in electric mobility are small mobility of electric cars due to the lack of charging stations. The main objective of the paper is to encourage the growth of electric mobility through the development of electric vehicle charging stations. Integration of EV charging stations in public lighting infrastructure with proper demand side management (DSM) is a step forward to microgrid system deployment. It can contribute to microgrid stability and decrease distribution network dependence. Electric vehicles have a significant role in peak load shaving in microgrid due to its threefold role. They can be observed as demand side, supply side or storage. As a consumer or storage, they can take over energy surplus from a distributed generation or provide stored energy in key moments as flexible supply. In that way, they actively participate in the microgrid. Technical possibilities of EV charging stations integration in public lighting infrastructure are explored through this paper. Special attention is devoted to conditions and limitations of charging stations integration regarding power system grid, public lighting system and legislative framework. Paper provides fundamentals of EV charging stations and public lighting system where possibilities and limitations of integration are presented. Furthermore, the paper deals with limitations from the perspective of transformer capacity and cable cross sections which are obtained through analysis of calculated results. © 2019 IEEE.","electric vehicle; electromobility; EV charging station; microgrid; public lighting infrastructure","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Integration; Lighting; Lighting fixtures; Microgrids; Electric vehicle charging; Electromobility; Ev charging stations; Legislative frameworks; Micro grid; Public lighting; Technical conditions; Transformer capacity; Light electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080945895

The number of electric vehicles (EVs) is growing fast, which leads to a decrease in fuel consumption, emissions, and helps keep the environment clean. However, this will have an effect on EPN's operation owing to uncontrolled charging, especially during peak hours. PV systems belong to renewable energy sources (RESs) and have spread in most of the world recently. PV systems generate power intermittently during the day, solely depending on sunlight. To overcome these issues, controlled energy storage systems are used widely with PV systems and EVs. The superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) is considered to be one of the vital methods to solve the power mismatch between load and generation power. Here a fuzzy logic control (FLC) system is proposed to determine the charging/discharging level of SMES with two inputs: (ii) the power line and (ii) the SMES current controlled by a DC-DC chopper.

Most batteries are connected at the point in the network where the power of renewable energy sources is produced. These battery storage systems serve primarily to power electricity to households. They are most often used in cooperation with renewable energy sources, especially photovoltaic power plants. When installing renewable sources without using battery storage in distribution networks, there are several problems in the production of electricity from renewable sources. At a time of low power consumption and high electricity generation at the point of connection of renewable energy sources, a change in power flow occurs. The power generated from the sources flows into the distribution network or up to the superior network. If a distribution company installed battery storage at the point of connection, the power from renewable sources would not flow to the rest of the distribution system and would be stored on that distribution network node. Once the capacity size has been correctly determined at a given node, the distribution company could benefit from such solution. The distribution company could lease the capacity of the batteries to customers who have the renewable energy sources to store their produced energy or could cover part of the electricity consumption at the time of lack of production from the renewable energy sources. The paper deals with this issue, the location of battery storage is simulated on a standardized distribution network. © 2019 IEEE.","battery; distribution system; renewable energy sources; storage systems","Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; battery; Battery storage system; Distribution companies; Distribution systems; Electricity-consumption; Photovoltaic power plant; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080858358

In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed for optimal electric energy use in a building, considering a balance between energy saving and a comfortable lifetime in combination with maximizing the exploitation of the excess energy of the renewable energy sources (RES). The proposed control algorithm is based on a mixed objective function that considers the real time electricity price, the state of charge (SoC) of the battery-based energy storage system (ESS), the weather forecast, the system constraints and the user preferences ensuring reduced utility bills and optimal task scheduling for programmable loads and energy sources. Also, the proposed GA-based control scheme has generalized utilization at smart building applications and can be used either if the feed-in tariff policy is adopted by the electric energy provider or not. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, several simulations were performed under different scenarios using real data and the obtained results were compared in terms of total energy consumption cost and users' comfort level. © 2019 IEEE.","Building management systems; buildings; energy management system; genetic algorithms","Battery management systems; Buildings; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy conservation; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Weather forecasting; Building applications; Building management system; Conflicting objectives; Energy storage systems; Integrated energy management; Objective functions; Renewable energy source; Total energy consumption; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075350100

The scientifically grounded development of hydropower engineering is impossible without improving the technology of design new and modernization the existing units of the hydroelectric pumped storage power plant with the use of new methods for calculating the flow in the elements of the water passage. In this paper, the simulation of the spatial flow motion in the water passage of the low-speed pump-turbine ORO500-V-100 was carried out on the basis of two numerical calculation methods. Energy losses was detected in the elements and the energy balance was made up. As a result of the calculations by the method of averaged dimensionless parameters expected characteristics were received. There are the isolines of the hydraulic efficiency and the line of angles β1 and α2, which characterizes the flow before and after the runner, on them. A further analysis of the energy balance showed that energy losses in the inlet of the water passage (spiral casing, stator and wicket gate) of the low-speed high-head pump-turbine are up to 62 % of total. Therefore, increasing the power characteristics of the pump-turbine is possible due to the modification of the inlet elements.

The limited computational, memory, and storage capabilities of these devices, together with their small energy budget, indeed, restrict the number of features that can be embedded into an update system and make it also difficult to build a generic and compact solution. As a result, existing update systems for constrained IoT devices are often not portable, do not perform a proper verification of the downloaded firmware, or focus only on a single phase of the update process, which exposes them to security threats and calls for new solutions. In this paper we present UpKit, a portable and lightweight software update framework for constrained IoT devices encompassing all phases of the update process: from the generation and signature of a new firmware, to the transmission of the latter to an IoT device, its verification and installation. UpKit employs a novel update architecture that is agnostic to how new firmware images are distributed and that introduces a double-signature process to guarantee the freshness of a new firmware. This, together with an additional verification step, allows also to reject invalid software at an early stage and to prevent an unnecessary reboot of the device. We keep UpKit's design modular and provide an open-source implementation for several operating systems, hardware platforms, as well as cryptographic libraries. We further include support for differential updates and flexible memory slots, which allows to significantly increase the efficiency of the update process. An experimental evaluation shows that UpKit can be used to efficiently update highly-constrained IoT devices, and that it has a comparable memory footprint to state-of-the-art solutions, despite the introduction of several features. © 2019 IEEE.","Constrained devices; Contiki; Internet of Things; Pull and Push approach; RIOT; Software Updates; Zephyr","Budget control; Distributed computer systems; Firmware; Open source software; Open systems; Verification; Constrained devices; Contiki; Pull and push approach; RIOT; Software updates; Zephyr; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074815617

Firstly, the virtual impedance is dynamically adjusted by balance control to eliminate the influence of mismatched line impedance for the accuracy of current sharing. Then, each distributed energy storage unit can adjust current through SoC balance control according to its capacity and state of charge (SoC), make the error of SoC decrease, and gradually realize the SoC balance of DESUs during charging and discharging process. Finally, three simulation schemes based on Matlab are normal charging and discharging of DESUs, fluctuation of photovoltaic power and load change in DC microgrid.

By strategically choosing the passive output for each subsystem in the PLS and augmenting each local Model Predictive Control(MPC) controller with a special passivity-reinforcement constraint, local passivity of each closed-loop subsystem can be guaranteed. If the subsystem is zero-state detectable(ZSD), local stability can be ensured by local passivity, which is characterized by two parameters that can define the upper bound of L2 gain of the subsystem. The structured and passivity-preserving coupling between subsystems in the PLS can be used to prove the passivity property of the global system, which can be expressed by the transition of the two parameters. Then, the L2 gain bound of the entire PLS can be guaranteed as well.

These interventions typically include measures such as, lowering hot water set point temperatures and implementing hot water drawoff and heating cycle scheduling. Utilities can, furthermore, implement demand response measures by automated control of hot water loads. These scheduling interventions generally give rise to lower average water temperatures inside the storage vessels, which can encourage the growth of pathogens such as Legionnaire bacteria. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation to determine the internal temperature distributions of a domestic water heater for predetermined hot water draw-off and heating cycle scheduling. The development of a dedicated system for measuring the internal water temperature distribution of a cylindrical water heater is discussed. Measured temperature distribution results are presented for horizontal and vertical distributions, using daily draw-off and heating cycle patterns aimed at reducing standing losses.

DERMS consists of a set of software management tools that allow distribution companies and operators to manage a range of DERs, and offer almost real-time network control. DERMS can help tremendously in integrating, managing, and controlling flexible and intermittent DERs and electric demand. These analyses contribute to keeping the transmission and distribution system in sync with the efficient and reliable balance of supply and demand that should lead to ideally optimization of power flows, electric demand, DERs, and traditional centralized generation.

Dynamic, automated, and cost-effective management of the distribution system is achieved with DERMS tools that are presented in this paper.

An important factor, which impedes the economic development in Northeast China, is its severe cold weather. Consequently, the Northeast China faces a series of issues, for example, less attraction to youth, decline of population, aging of population, lack of investment, out-of-date infrastructure, etc. In this study, we propose to restructure the economy in Northeast China from the labour-intensive heavy industry to the high-tech industry based on data storage and computing. This is possible because the severe cold weather is good for cooling data storage and computing facility, which is highly energy-demanded. Taking this economic advantage, it could transform the Northeast China into the largest data storage and computing centre in China, which would promote the development of green economy in China, and even in the world. © 2019 IEEE.","Data and computing centre; Northeast China","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Fiber optic networks; Green computing; Investments; Population statistics; Transparent optical networks; Computing facilities; Data and computing centre; Economic advantages; Economic development; Heavy industries; High tech industry; Labour-intensive; Northeast China; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073077577

These fluctuations require predicting the share of solar energy and its requirements in energy supply systems for optimal use. These predictions form the basis for various solar management options such as storage and control. However, before predicting the production of solar systems, it is necessary to focus on predicting solar radiation. The global prediction of solar radiation is divided into two broad categories of prediction methods: cloud images associated with physical models and automated learning models.

This process occurs due to the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule and the diffusion of the hydrogen atoms into the interstitial space of the crystal lattice of the metal. As a result, it is necessary to provide cooling of this storage unit in order to eliminate the pressure and temperature fluctuations. Therefore, a cooling device was constructed, applying the principle of Peltier thermopiles, which facilitates continuous regulation and optimal temperatures of a metal hydride container. For the purpose of describing the cooling power, a numerical calculation was carried out for constant cooling and for cooling with alternate switching between the Peltier thermopiles.

Hydrate is generally a substance containing water and hydrocarbons (or other gases). Natural gas hydrate is found in the solid state, which constitutes about 85% water and 15% gas bound in the clathrate lattice. The gas hydrate can be a great source of energy that begins to be included in the considerations of gas supply for the next decades. In terms of perspective, the accumulation of standard natural gas in the form of synthetically generated hydrates appears to be very advantageous. The storage of natural gas in the form of hydrates and releasing it in the case of peak consumption is beneficial not only in terms of storage capacity, the medium used, but also in terms of the safety of hydrate storage. It is possible to store gas in such a form at relatively high temperatures and low pressures compared to other gaseous hydrocarbon storage technologies. Saving energy in a convenient form for safe storage and its subsequent release is a challenge in processes where energy is needed to accumulate. At present, a high emphasis is placed on the overall efficiency of these processes, in terms of energy use, energy efficiency and energy storage. Hydrates have the potential to provide peak coverage in cogeneration of electricity and heat by natural gas released from hydrates. Hydrate can be produced from a mixture of water and natural gas in a prototype hydrate plant. This paper describes the conditions under which hydrate formation, utilization potential, and experimental equipment design for generating natural gas hydrates. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068358280

To address the challenge, we adopt Multi- Access Edge Computing which is a new paradigm that transforms and localize Cloud services and capabilities at the Edge of Radio- Access Network based on proximity for mobile subscribers. In this paper, we proposed a Resource-Aware Decentralized Computing and Caching framework for Multi-Access Edge Computing. So, smart end-user devices work collaboratively and independently with resourceful edge devices or peer devices in close proximity during the unreliable network. Moreover, those devices can offload intensive application or access completed cached tasks to provide efficient resource utilization & Quality of User Experience. The drawback is expressed based on Non-Cooperative Game Theory which is NP-hard to solve and we show that the game concedes a Nash Equilibrium.

A promising paradigm to alleviate this data movement bottleneck is near-memory computing (NMC), which consists of placing compute units close to the memory/storage units. There is substantial research effort that proposesNMCarchitectures and identifiesworkloads that can benefit from NMC. System architects typically use simulation techniques to evaluate the performance and energy consumption of their designs. However, simulation is extremely slow, imposing long times for design space exploration. In order to enable fast early-stage design space exploration of NMC architectures, we need high-level performance and energy models. We present NAPEL, a high-level performance and energy estimation framework for NMC architectures. NAPEL leverages ensemble learning to develop a model that is based on microarchitectural parameters and application characteristics. NAPEL training uses a statistical technique, called design of experiments, to collect representative training data efficiently. NAPEL provides early design space exploration 220× faster than a state-of-the-artNMCsimulator, on average, with error rates of to 8.5% and 11.6% for performance and energy estimations, respectively, compared to the NMC simulator. NAPEL is also capable of making accurate predictions for previously-unseen applications. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,"Computer aided design; Design of experiments; Energy utilization; Green computing; Accurate prediction; Computing applications; Design space exploration; Early stage designs; Energy estimation; Simulation technique; Statistical techniques; System architects; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067833914

In this work, we found in addition to zero patterns, a larger group of repetitive patterns and values exists in the working-set of CNN inference task, which is defined as computation redundancy and induces unnecessary performance and storage overhead in CNN accelerators. Based on this observation, we proposed a redundancy-free architecture that detects and eliminates the repetitive computation and storage patterns in CNN for more efficient network inference. The architecture consists of two parts: the off-line parameter analyzer that extracts the repetitive patterns in the 3D tensor of parameters, and the dataflow accelerator. The proposed accelerator at first preprocesses the weight patterns and the dynamically generated activations, and then cache these intermediate results in special P2-cache banks for further usage in convolution or full-connection stage. It is evaluated in experiments that the proposed Cavoluche architecture removes up to 89% of the repetitive operations from the layer inference process and reduce 77% of on-chip storage space to store both redundancy-free weight and activations. It is seen in experiments that the implementation of Cavoluche outperforms the state-of-the-art mobile GPGPU in both performance and energy-efficiency. When compared to the latest sparsity base accelerators, Cavoluche also achieves better operation elimination effects. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Accelerator; Cache; CNN; Sparsity","Acceleration; Chemical activation; Computer aided design; Convolution; Data flow analysis; Network architecture; Neural networks; Particle accelerators; Program processors; Redundancy; Cache; Computation overheads; Convolutional neural network; Intermediate results; Repetitive computations; Repetitive operations; Repetitive pattern; Sparsity; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067793092

In this paper, a low frequency (LF) positioning method based on eigenvector lookup is proposed, which is suitable for complex environment and easy to implement with simple algorithm. To reduce the calibration work and data storage, this paper proposes a simple method to decoupling the position and the rotation angle of vehicles by finding an eigenvector only corresponding to the position, independent of the angle. The real-time position is determined by comparing the similarity between the target vector formed by current induced voltages on sense coils and the eigenvector. A simple method of calculating rotation angle is also proposed. The feasibility of the proposed methods has been verified by simulation and experiments.

Computational memory is one such approach where the physical attributes and state dynamics of memory devices are exploited to perform certain computational tasks in place with very high areal and energy efficiency (Fig. 1) [1].

Simultaneous increment of both parameters always leads to power consumption growing, mostly defined by signal regeneration activities, which in its turn stays in contradiction with green network methods. In addition, by existence of the spectral band limitations appropriate for data transmission, the initial system settings and requirements changes from one network to another and can be fulfilled by different network designs with different power efficiency levels. The Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems had been developed with the aim to increase information transmission speeds, where the transmission speed of single channel and channel spacing becomes the defining factors for the overall system's capacity. Nevertheless, on the grounds of cross-channel interference, sub-band spacing reduction and usage of high-capacitive signals can adversely affect the system's transmission reach, which will lead to the more frequent signal regeneration. Therefore, the trade-off between transmission speed, quality of transmission and power consumption must be evaluated. In this work authors compare the Single-Line-Rate (SLR) and Multi-Line-Rate (MLR) WDM systems, which uses the most common transmission signals, to demonstrate relation between the enchased spectral efficiency and its impact on the relevant systems power consumption by means of power efficiency and evaluation of 3Rs' (re-amplification, retiming, reshaping) power ratio. The power efficiency was manipulated by different channel spacing.

Alternatively, low cost thermal energy storage (TES) exists, but relies on expensive concentrated solar power (CSP). A photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technology, able to efficiently unify PV conversion and TES, may usher in the era of efficient base-load renewable power plants. Spectral splitting, one PV/T option where inefficient photons for PV conversion are redirected and thermally utilized, is economically limited by the low yield of each generator. Operating PVs at high temperatures while utilizing the thermalization induced heat for the thermal cycle is another possibility; yet, while conceptually supporting full utilization of solar thermal and free energy, it too is limited by PV efficiency reduction with temperature increase. Here we introduce the concept of luminescence solar power (LSP), where sunlight is absorbed in a photoluminescent (PL) absorber, followed by red-shifted PL emission matched to an adjacent PV band-edge. The PL absorber temperature rises due to thermalization, allowing spatial separation between heat and free-energy, for maximal harvesting of both. We solve the material challenge by experimentally demonstrating tailored luminescence with PL efficiency of up to 90% while operating at 600°C. At such high temperatures, LSP efficiency offers a 50% enhancement over conventional side-by-side PV/CSP efficiency under real-world conditions, leading to a potential reduction in solar energy storage levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to below 3C/kWh. Such a low LCOE complies with the 2030 SunShot goal, enabling future US solar energy production to reach 50%. © 2019 IEEE.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074626946

Optimal schedules achieve a balance between local energy production and grid prices, exploring periods of higher generation to attenuate non-controllable demands and favouring night periods (during which energy is cheaper) for controllable appliances operations. © 2019 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cyber-Physical Systems; Home Energy Management Systems; Mixed-Integer Programming; Smart Homes","Automation; Cloud computing; Costs; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy management; Energy management systems; Integer programming; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Cloud architectures; Electrical appliances; Home energy management systems; Mixed integer programming; Photovoltaic panels; Scheduling computations; Sensor data collections; Smart homes; Domestic appliances",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074325386

Unfortunately, IoT is not far from security risks since it is an heterogeneous network comprising different nodes status. Malicious nodes impact harmfully on IoT network stability. In addition, IoT objects have limited capacities in processing, storage and batteries. To improve their batteries lifetime, objects workload should be bend down. Taking into consideration these IoT issues, we propose in this paper a clustering mechanism based on trust management and edge computing for IoT. The security intervention is based on excluding malicious nodes from an IoT network as well as by disseminating reliability between worthy nodes in favour of trust management. In order to minimize energy consumption, we established a one hop clustering mechanism based on density of nodes in an IoT network, trust and energy levels of nodes. All clusters are supervised by base stations in the edge of the network. We also integrate edge computing to migrate data processing and storage to base stations. © 2019 IEEE.","Clustering; Edge computing; IoT; Trust management","Base stations; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Digital storage; Edge computing; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile computing; Trusted computing; Clustering; Clustering mechanism; Distributed intelligence; Identification technology; Internet of Things (IOT); Limited capacity; New clustering algorithms; Trust management; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073903513

Sensor nodes (SNs) that arranged in WSNs will create some of IoT data and transmit their readings to Gateway (GW), which driving the sensor nodes to quick expenditure their energy and storage. The low costs of SNs impose a restriction on their energy and storage. To handle these problems it's prefer to carry out reduction on data at the source nodes to reduce both of utilized storage and consumed energy. A large portion of proposed solutions implement data reduction just at one level of the IoT design (e.g. at gateways). A Two-Tier Data Reduction (TTDR) technique is proposed to work at two tier of the network that are: sensor nodes and the gateway. At the sensor node tier we use a simple and suitable data compression methods for constrained IoT sensor nodes. The techniques exploit the temporal correlation in sensor data and use Delta Encoding followed by Run-Length Encoding (RLE). At the gateway tier we apply the hierarchical clustering for grouping data sets received from sensor nodes dependent on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. If any pairs of received data sets can be compressed by the MDL principle, they will be combined into one cluster. Consequently, the amount of data sets is decreased gradually, and the merging of sets in clusters is stopped if the discovery of any match of sets to compress is impossible. Finally, the TTDR performance is evaluated based on real sensory data and using OMNeT++ simulator. The acquired outcomes illustrate the proficiency of the proposed system in regarding data transmission and energy. © 2019 IEEE.","Data Compression; Data Transmission; IoT; MDL; Sensors; WSNs","Data communication systems; Data compression; Data transfer; Digital storage; Encoding (symbols); Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Mobile computing; Reduction; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Signal encoding; Compression methods; Hier-archical clustering; Internet of thing (IOT); Minimum description length principle; Reduction techniques; Run-length encoding; Temporal correlations; WSNs; Data reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073887705

However, because of the limited processing, storage, and communication capabilities of these devices as well as their proprietary technologies, SHNs are getting vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. Granting access to the legitimate users/entities is, therefore, essential to prevent illegitimate users from unauthorized use of the available resources. We argue that current access control schemes are not suitable for IoT-based SHN. We, therefore, propose in this paper a novel Secure Multi-Level Authentication Scheme (SeMLAS) based on software mobile agents. In addition to enabling secure authentication between external peers and nodes at different hierarchical level of the SHN, our scheme can shorten the authentication process and detect malicious nodes via an appropriate use of mobile agents. The performance analysis of the implementation of SeMLAS with the NS2 tool is showing promising results.

In case of expected risk, regulatory mechanisms, such as new market clearing rules or incentives to new flexibility sources or to new generation and storage technologies, could be required. This paper looks at the possible evolution of the Portuguese power system focusing on the net demand ramp problem. The historical and expected evolution of the hourly ramps of the net demand are analyzed considering different scenarios of high wind and solar PV penetration, according to different degrees of convergence to the EU energy strategic objectives. © 2019 IEEE.","Flexibility decarbonization; Net load; Ramps","Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Photovoltaic cells; Plant shutdowns; Solar power generation; Energy strategy; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Quality of supply; Ramps; Regulatory mechanism; Renewable energies; Storage technology; Strategic objectives; Decarbonization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072329933

The possibility of operating the system under these conditions is assured by grid-forming inverters connected to battery energy storage systems, that are responsible for performing frequency and voltage control tasks either in parallel with synchronous units or when synchronous units are disconnected.

However, the PV power generation is fluctuated by cloud movement, weather conditions, and wind speed which directly affect the excessive operation of voltage regulation devices such as the on load tap changer (OLTC). This excessive operation will decrease the expected life cycle and increase maintenance requirements. This paper proposed an optional operation of the battery energy storage system (BESS) in microgrid by optimizing BESS active and reactive power with Cuckoo Search optimization (CSo). The main objective aims to minimize the OLTC tap operation under PV fluctuation. The CSO is implemented in MATLAB while DIgSILENT PowerFactory is used for load flow evaluation. Simulation case studies are performed using system data from the Mae Sa Riang microgrid in Thailand. Results show that the optimal operation of BESS using CSO can effectively reduce the number of OLTC tap operations in microgrid when compared to the results with the base case and microgrid controller. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Cuckoo search; Optimal operation; Photovoltaic fluctuation; Tap changer","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Life cycle; MATLAB; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wind; Battery energy storage systems; Cuckoo searches; Optimal operation; Photovoltaic; Tap changers; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072322373

A large fraction of DRAM dynamic energy is spent on fetching the data bits from a DRAM page (row) to a small-sized hardware structure called as the row buffer. The data access from this row buffer is much less expensive in terms of energy and latency. Hence, it is preferred to reuse the buffered data as much as possible before activating another row and bringing its data to these row buffers. Our thorough characterization of several GPGPU applications shows that these row buffers are poorly utilized leading to sub-optimal energy consumption.

The lost energy of the VRBs will eventually dissipate in the form of heat and lead to temperature rise. Previous studies often neglected the electro-thermal coupled relationship, which could not reflect the change of battery temperature accurately. In this paper, an electro-thermal coupled model of VRBs is proposed. The second-order RC circuit is adopted to characterize the overpotential characteristics, and the impact of shunt current and ion diffusion is considered. A dynamic model describing thermal behavior was set up based on a second-order Cauer network. The Trust Region algorithm is used to identify the model parameters. Experiments under constant current and pulse charging and discharging currents were carried out based on a 5kW/3kWh battery experimental platform. The results show that this model can reflect the coupled relationship between temperature and the dynamic electrical behavior accurately under different operation. The model proposed is also applicable for battery operation optimization. © 2019 IEEE.","Cauer network; Electro-thermal coupled model; Electrolyte temperature; Trust Region; Vanadium redox flow battery","Battery storage; Distributed power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Power electronics; Vanadium; Coupled modeling; Electrical characteristic; Electrolyte temperature; Energy storage systems; Experimental platform; Trust region; Trust region algorithms; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071939966

With the help of quasi-single-stage architecture, the low-voltage distributed generation, e.g., PV modules or energy storages, can directly supply active power to the ac grid or ac load within single power conversion stage. Therefore, in comparison with traditional two-stage UPQC-DG, the power conversion stages are reduced and the overall conversion efficiency is enhanced. A modified SVPWM strategy aiming at realizing most active power transferred within single power conversion stage is discussed. Besides, the power flow through the quasi-single-stage UPQC-DG is analyzed in detail to understand the system operation and design the power converters properly.

Thus, there is an interest in developing highly usable and portable solutions. The primary stakeholders of performance monitoring solutions for buildings are building/facility managers as end users. There is a high diversity in buildings' types, degrees of instrumentation in buildings, buildings' management tasks, educational background of managers, etc. Each of these factors can impact a manager's preferences for functionality and visualization of a performance testing application. Our prior work establishes a generic performance testing framework for automatic instantiation and execution of applicable performance tests. To gain qualitative feedback and insight regarding usability requirements for our framework, we conducted a series of structured interviews among seven building managers, covering 8 commercial buildings in Scandinavia and China, with a total area of 346500m2. Each interview was conducted with a questionnaire on the building's type, degree of instrumentation, current setups of metering and sensing hardware, data storage, certification etc., featuring examples of visualising performance evaluation data for open-ended discussions. The results show an interest for simple visualization techniques, requiring little to no expertise in building management to understand. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents have expressed interest in live performance evaluation, regardless of building type, supporting the movement towards smart energy. © 2019 IEEE.","building managers; performance testing; smart buildings; structured interview; visualization","Digital storage; Edge computing; Flow visualization; Intelligent buildings; Managers; Office buildings; Visualization; Building managers; Performance monitoring; Performance testing; Performance testing framework; Qualitative feedback; structured interview; Usability requirements; Visualization technique; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071658912

In this paper, a novel nested simulation model of static random access memory (SRAM) processed with 65nm bulk technology is built. The average charge collection coefficient of each sub-sensitive volume (SV) is calculated by point charge integration. The vulnerability of SRAM due to proton strike is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation method based on the Geant4 simulation toolkit. The simulation results of protons with different energy show that the low energy protons can generate enough energy due to direct ionization and lead to high SEU cross-sections. For high-energy protons (>10MeV), SEU cross-sections increase with the increasing incident angle. For low-energy proton (<10MeV), the cross sections of SRAMs reach the maximum at 63.4°. Moreover, multiple cell upsets (MCUs) can be caused by the recoil-ions generated from reactions of protons and tungsten layer. Finally, the SRAM cell spacing can evidently influence SEU cross-sections. Simulation results show that the mitigation effect of increasing cell spacing is weakened as the increase of incident proton energy. Thus, more attention must be paid when adopting the method that increasing cell spacing to mitigate the impact of proton radiation. © 2019 IEEE.","direct ionization; Monte Carlo simulation; multiple cell upset (MCU); nuclear reaction; Single event upset (SEU)","Cells; CMOS integrated circuits; Cytology; Electric network analysis; Intelligent systems; Ionization; Microcontrollers; Nuclear reactions; Radiation hardening; Static random access storage; Transients; Geant4 simulation toolkit; Integrated circuits (ICs); Low-energy protons; Mitigation effects; Monte Carlo simulation methods; Multiple cell upset; Single event upsets; Static random access memory; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071470291

Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) can mitigating wind power fluctuations by adjusting their charging/discharging rates if they are integrated into WFs. In this paper, we design a strategy for the BESS, aiming to enhance performances on mitigating wind power fluctuations. The strategy optimizes charging/discharging rates of the BESS to minimize the energy of the fluctuating component extracted from the output power of the BESS-integrated WF. Based on the optimized results, a charging/discharging power instruction is generated for the BESS with considerations of random forecast errors on wind power. We also design two special indices to evaluate performances on mitigating wind power fluctuations respectively from aspects of fluctuating energy and fluctuating power amplitudes.

By the transformation of buildings into nearly or net zero energy ones (nZEBs), they will likely play a pivotal role in the smart grid context, being able to both produce and consume energy on-site and even acting as small nanogrids. In order to achieve that, a move towards smart and more energy efficient buildings with increased energy autonomy is mandatory for the existing and new properties. In this direction, the project ""Enhancing storage integration in buildings with Photovoltaics"" of ""INTERREG Balkan Mediterranean 2014-2020"" aims at both modelling and validating methods of optimal energy management in buildings equipped with Photovoltaics (PV) and storage systems. In this paper, a simple and accurate thermal model based on ISO 52016-1:2017 is proposed for the calculation of both heating and cooling energy needs in residential properties. The model has been tested in residential buildings in various European locations, but can be used in any type of building as well. From the comparison of the model with other simulation tools, it is concluded that slight deviations occur due to differences in climate data, the operative temperature, as well as the different approaches of ventilation and shading effects. © 2019 IEEE.","cooling; energy balance; heating; temperature setpoint; U-values","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cooling; Digital storage; Energy balance; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heating; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Smart power grids; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy efficient building; Heating and cooling; Operative temperature; Residential building; Setpoints; Total energy consumption; U values; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070840389

Most common applications consider the ability of a BESS to decouple electric power generation and consumption in different contexts which is usually desirable from the grid operator point of view. A microgrid consisting of renewable energy sources connected with power electronic converters can experience difficulties with harmonic voltages and reactive inrush currents. Reactive currents may cause a voltage drop in the line impedances. Voltage fluctuations and harmonics can cause issues such as equipment tripping, overheating and malfunctioning. The stability of the microgrid is dependent upon the microgrid units' abilities to mitigate and compensate for these phenomena. A BESS can be used to simultaneously exchange active power between the battery and the grid and improve the power quality of a microgrid. With independent cascaded control of currents and active and reactive power, a BESS can control the reactive power balance in a microgrid and therefore ensure voltage stability. In addition, a BESS can serve as an active harmonic filter. Due to the transient nature of the described phenomena, these control schemes require control in real time. All the applications mentioned above can be realized simultaneously with suitable control design where the different controlled quantities are superposed. This paper reviews the technology of a BESS and the required control systems to realize the power quality features and presents simulation results as proof of their feasibility. The simulations demonstrate how a BESS can greatly contribute to microgrid stability while also performing active power exchange. © 2019 IEEE.","active harmonic filtering; battery energy storage system; BESS; dynamic reactive power compensation; microgrid; power quality","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Harmonic analysis; Power converters; Power quality; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Voltage control; Battery energy storage systems; BESS; Dynamic reactive power compensations; Harmonic filtering; Micro grid; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070837611

The problem is analyzed by means of a mathematical model, based on the system's energy production units such as heat pumps, micro Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP) units, conventional oil-fired burners, photovoltaic panels (PVs), wind generations and batteries for storage. Co-generation is gaining much of attention lately, especially when integrated to microgrid communities that may use the energy produced in a more flexible and hence way. Additionally, heat pumps are used extensively, as they seem to achieve greater efficiencies and cost reduction compared to the conventional energy production. For that reason, the objective function of the system is designed so as to minimize the total cost of the system and support the selection of the most effective energy production combination. The problem is solved based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is created and used for the representative input and output presentation of the optimization results in a comprehensive and attractive way.

The rural area network is weak and needs capacity expansion planning as the load demand of this area are going to increase due to penetration of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Such type of rural network can also be operated as a micro-grid, and therefore load analysis is required for appropriate operation. The load analysis will also be useful for finding proper sizing of distributed energy resources including energy storage. In this work, load demand analysis of a typical Nordic holiday resorts, connected in rural grid, is presented to find out the load variation during the usage periods. The load analysis is targeted for demand prediction. The demand forecasting has been considered through integrating Regression Tools with Artificial Neural Networks due to the low amount of data available from the Holiday Resorts. Collected data is from a rural area in Norway consisting of 125 holiday cabins, with maximum load of 478 kW in the period of 2014 to 2018. This work is presenting the analysis on the total electric load consumption of cabins during typical short and long term holidays. It is observed, during the longer time holiday period, the loads are significantly higher compared to shorter time holiday period.

A stochastic energy hub model is developed to schedule the energy supply and storage components in day-ahead basis. The PV supply, electrical and thermal demand are considered as the uncertain parameters. In order to model them statistically, three different types of Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) have been applied including uniform, normal distributions and Gaussian Mixture Model. The main objective is to minimize the amount of electrical energy purchased from the grid, where the stochastic outputs are compared with deterministic output. Two distinct parameters have been used to quantify the differences. Relative Mean Absolute Error (RMAE) represents the accuracy of the approach and bound deviation represents the reliability of the stochastic approach. Simulation analyses on the neighbourhood surrounding VU Medical Center and University campus in Amsterdam reflect that the GMM model representation is the most accurate and reliable. © 2019 IEEE.","distribution; energy hub; probability; scheduling; stochastic","Distribution functions; Energy management; Gaussian distribution; Normal distribution; Probability; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Day-ahead scheduling; distribution; Energy hubs; Gaussian Mixture Model; Statistical representations; stochastic; Uncertain parameters; Uncertainty characterization; Stochastic systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070807016

This design presents features that are suitable for multiple voltage electrical systems. The three-port power exchange is multi-directional which can be delivered either separately or simultaneously. In consideration of the safety requirements, electrical isolation is achieved between any of the two ports. Besides the power-flow concept, different operating principle stages, power flow equations, small signal model, network simulation model, and control strategy are discussed. Furthermore, the steady-state analysis are evaluated to determine the power flow equations. The control strategy proposed is based on single-phase shift control, with the small signal model for optimized controller design, which can predict the accurate frequency response and obtain a fast dynamic response. Meanwhile, this can be used in many applications of electronic power converters. The simulation results have been provided under various operating conditions, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

The micro grid is connected to the utility through a high impedance feeder to consider poor contribution. Thus, the dynamic of the sources and loads connected will be greater to obtain a more complex operating scenario allowing the interaction between different types of non-regulated sources and energy storage systems. The microgrid can operate on island due to some contingency, by a normal operating condition or with a weak link; any of these conditions the energy required to supply the loads will depend meanly on the renewable and nonrenewable sources. The interconnection of the BESS in strategic points will allow to improve the regulation of energy. The latency times of battery charging and discharging and the limit of daily operations are shown as a real consideration in the control of the energy of the micro grid systems.

For photovoltaic (PV) energy applications, the BESS may be connected to the dc-link of the converter system to inject the deficit or to absorb the surplus of generated power. One of the main issues in such systems is the voltage variation at the dc-link, especially under grid imbalance, distorting the current fed to the grid. This paper studies a method to control the BESS to emulate a capacitance, thus mitigating the dc-link voltage fluctuation, for example, under heavy imbalance.

This paper proposes an autonomous control of flexible power electronics loads (FPELs), whose objective is to make the FPELs to automatically participate in supply and demand balance and reduce the response cost with various response prices taken into consideration.

For vibration measurement and detection of irregular operating states, portable system consisting of the laser source, affordable telecommunication optical fiber, signal conditioning and processing unit, notebook for storage and data analysis is presented in the paper. The fiber optic sensor, based on the principle of interferometer, is used as a passive vibration detector of very low amplitudes instead of ubiquitous piezoelectric, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) or noncontact capacitive proximity sensors due to strong electromagnetic fields especially near high power energy sources as is the case in HPPs. Developed portable measuring system is experimentally verified on small scale laboratory setup and obtained results are compared to the ones obtained by traditional sensors. Through research and on-site measurements, the goal is to develop an algorithm that will allow off-line as well as on-line early detection of abnormal operation of hydro turbine generator unit. In this paper preliminary results obtained in HPP Dale for various operating conditions showing regions of increased vibrations are presented. The intention of this study is to develop a novel embedded vibration monitoring unit closely connected to other monitoring and protection systems compatible with emerging smart grid standards. © 2019 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER).","electric machines; optical fiber applications; optical signal processing; spectral analysis; vibrations","Capacitive sensors; Digital storage; Electric equipment protection; Electric machinery; Electric power transmission networks; Electric windings; Electromagnetic fields; Embedded systems; Fiber optic sensors; Fiber optics; Hydroelectric generators; MEMS; Optical data storage; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Optical signal processing; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Spectrum analysis; Stators; Thrust bearings; Turbines; Vibration measurement; Capacitive proximity sensors; Generating equipments; Hydro-turbine generator units; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Monitoring and protections; Optical fiber applications; Smart Grid Standards; vibrations; Vibration analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067100764

For analog neural network weight storage, OxRRAM resistance variability poses a significant challenge at low currents. However, alternative 'cortical' learning algorithms can tolerate or even exploit the stochastic behavior of the device at low power. This paper aims at providing an accurate kinetic description of the low voltage transients in OxRRAM. To model the relevant stochastic effects, we extend the hourglass model with a power-dependent filament shuffling rate and a normally distributed activation energy. Including these elements improves the original hourglass model and allows for resistance distribution simulations at low voltage as well as reproducing resistance-time transient RESET traces with inclusion of the intrinsic stochastic variability. © 2019 IEEE.","Component; Hourglass model; Low voltage gradual RESET; Neuromorphic; OxRRAM; Stochastic learning","Activation energy; Learning algorithms; Normal distribution; Power quality; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Component; Low voltages; Neuromorphic; OxRRAM; Stochastic learning; Transients",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066759242

The drive mechanism in ABSS is an important equipment to control the dropping of absorber balls. The working environments for ABSS are high temperature 150°C and high pressure helium for 7 MPa. The drive mechanism will drive the valve on the bottom of ball storage capacity to open by a drive rod when ABSS is put into operation, and then the absorber balls in storage capacity will drop into the channel inside reflector to help shut down the reactions in nuclear reactor. Therefore, the smooth operation of drive rod under high temperature and high pressure environments is essential to achieve the performance of drive mechanism in ABSS. Finite element method (FEM) was carried out to achieve static analysis of the deformation and stress in the drive rod under external load caused by the harsh environments with the software ANSYS. The numerical results showed that the relative deformation was less than the gap between different components of the drive rod, and the maximum stress in drive rod was within permission.

The traditional generation II+ nuclearpower plant is proposed to be improved with some passive systems to enhance safety performance. There are two series of passive safety systems for this kind of nuclear power plant in this paper, one of them contains: (1) the RMT (reactor makeup tank); (2) the A-ACC (advanced accumulators); (3) the IRWST (in-containment refueling water storage tank); (4) the PDS (passive depressurization system); and (5) the PRHRS (passive residual heat removal system), which is installed on the reactor coolant system (RCS) loop;the other contains:(1) the RMT (reactor makeup tank); (2) the A-ACC (advanced accumulators); (3) the IRWST (in-containment refueling water storage tank); (4) the PDS (passive depressurization system); (5) the PEFS(passive emergency feed water system), which is installed on the secondary side of SGs. In this research, the transient characteristics of SGTR accident with the two different passive residual heat removal systems which are PRHRS and PEFS is investigated using the best-estimate transient simulation code Relap5/MOD3.3. The calculation results show that both of PRHRS and PEFS could remove the decay heat from the primary loop efficiently to ensure the reactor safety and reduce the radioactive leakage to mitigate the accident impact during the SGTR accident. Due to the significant cooling effect of PRHRS and PEFS, the water level of broken SG would not be overfilled in both conditions, which is different with the SGTR accident of traditionalgeneration II+nuclear power plant. Compared with the PEFS, the PRHRS performed better in cooling efficiency, long-term cooling performance, reducing radioactive leakage capacity and mitigating accident effect.

The SPX start-up core benchmark specification (Ponomarev, et al., 2018) was used for calculation of neutron physics data employed as input in the TRACE simulations. The analysis covered transient simulation before sodium boiling onset. The influence of control rod drive lines (CRDL) expansion reactivity effect on the grace time before boiling was found to be significant. Series of calculations have been performed in order to assess sensitivity of the results to the core specification data and modelling details in both thermal hydraulics and neutronics inputs.

Its influence on the environmental safety and public dose attracts more and more attention from various research fields worldwide. This paper investigates the production mechanisms of tritium in different types of nuclear facilities. The sources and proportions of tritium in light water reactors (LWRs), heavy water reactors (HWRs), high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), and liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs) are investigated and comprehensively compared. The discharge standards of the liquid and gaseous effluent on tritium among different countries are also presented, which may provide suggestions on the tritium treatment and disposal in future. Due to the small modular weight, the permeation and diffusion of tritium to the secondary circuit and the storage and disposal of H-3 liquid are worthy issues, which are investigated in current paper. The existing problems of tritium during cogeneration process of electricity and hydrogen are discussed as well.

Because of some reasons, for example the radioactive content decay, the new technology application or the operator bankrupt, disused sealed radioactive sources (DSRS) will be produced and shall be managed well because the activity of some SRS and DSRS is still higher and the potential risks may happened. SRS and DSRS must be sustainably managed for the protection of individuals, society and the environment. DSRS management options usually include transfer to SRS producers/original suppliers, long term storage, disposal, reuse and recycle, exempt or clearance. In Ghana, some DSRS have been transferred back to SRS producers/original suppliers, DSRS that cannot be transferred back to SRS producer/original suppliers are been stored in related facility. Ghana is planning to carry on DSRS disposal project with other countries. The disposal options include near surface disposal, borehole disposal, or geological disposal. An optimized disposal option in Ghana shall be verified considering the total amount of DSRS, the radionuclides of radioactive content, the safety and economy of the disposal options and other factors. Among these factors, safety assessment on DSRS disposal must be carried out.

As one of the fourth generation nuclear power plants with inherent safety technology, HTR-PM adopted dry in-site storage technology for spent fuel based on unshielded canister and dry storage silo, which is different with the wet storage method used in PWR. So all of the design, installation and commissioning of the spent fuel residual heat removal system for HTR-PM are innovative technologies. From the point of view of commissioning technology, this paper will study the key technologies and solutions in commissioning process of the spent fuel residual heat removal system. The spent fuel elements of HTR-PM are stored in the stainless steel spent fuel canister, and the transfer and hoisting of the spent fuel canister are realized through the operation of the ground crane and shield cover equipment set. The storage canister full of spent fuel would be stored in spent fuel storage silos, each silo could lay five spent fuel canisters. The spent fuel repository is composed of buffer storage region and intermediate storage region. In normal operation, active ventilation is adopted in the spent fuel buffer storage region, and active ventilation is carried out through the centrifugal blower to discharge the spent fuel residual heat. The main test object described in this paper is the residual heat removal system in the spent fuel buffer storage region. The spent fuel residual heat in the intermediate storage region would be removed through natural ventilation completely. All of the spent fuel residual heat removal system in the spent fuel buffer storage region and intermediate storage region has inherent safety characteristics. The main purpose of the commissioning test of the spent fuel storage residual heat removal system in HTR-PM is to investigate the ventilating system commissioning characteristics for the spent fuel storage silo under the centrifugal blower operating condition. The ventilation test in the silo includes all kinds of operating conditions with different number of spent fuel canisters in each silo. The flow measurement in silo under the condition of non-uniform flow in silo is realized through the commissioning test. The movement and hoisting of the spent fuel storage canisters in silo are realized through the operation of the ground crane, so as to realize the wanted distribution condition of different number of storage canisters in the spent fuel storage silo. The residual heat removal centrifugal blower would be in operating condition, and the air flow rate in the storage silo and the typical differential pressure between inlet and outlet of the silo would be measured. All of the working conditions of the test could be realized through the operation of the canister and other equipment, or through the usage of special designed equipment, to achieve the simulation of the real operating conditions. The commissioning technology of the spent fuel storage residual heat removal system of high temperature gas cooled reactor demonstration project is the key to verify the safety of large-scale spent fuel residual heat removal ventilation cooling technology. As one of the basic test for spent fuel dry storage system, it will provide important basis for the design, commissioning and operation in subsequent developing stage of the spent fuel dry storage system.

It is essential to realize multi-regional IES collaborative planning and scheduling to further improve its economic and environmental benefits. The primary issue for this is the modeling of regional cold and hot networks. In order to improve the economic and environmental benefits of the system, the economic environmental protection scheduling optimization model is established. The objective function includes the fuel cost, the cost of purchasing electricity and the environmental cost of paying penalties for considering the emission of pollutant gases. The energy flow function is constrained by the energy balance equation. The constraints include supply-demand balance, cold/heat/electricity coupling, power substitution, equipment installation and operation, etc. The optimal variables are the capacity of electric/thermal energy storage equipment and the dispatch value of equipment in typical scenarios of the system. The numerical results show that the model can reasonably distribute the output and purchasing power of the combined power supply system.

The proposed control strategy aims to eliminate frequency fluctuation caused by the dynamic behavior of load and intermittent nature of renewable sources (RESs). Due to the limitations of a conventional source to respond important changes in generation or load, BESS is employed to regulate the frequency within an allowable limit by supplying and consuming active power to/from the grid. However, BESS may not cover all changes in active power, and moreover the conventional source has a slow response. Consequently, the frequency may lose stability due to an imbalance between generation and load resulting in a severe situation in the smart grid. To circumvent this issue, in this paper, PEVs are therefore coordinated with BESS and adopted to be an ancillary service for frequency regulation. The proposed control allows PEVs to only operate under charging state, and hence PEVs are controlled to reduce their charging power via an aggregator according to droop characteristic. The proposed control strategy is validated in the simplified smart grid performed by DIgSILENT powerfactory software. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can improve frequency regulation effectively using comparative study. Finally, the proposed control strategy can reduce the BESS energy capacity related directly to decrease in power utilization. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; coordinated control; frequency regulation; plug-in electric vehicle; smart grid","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Plug-in electric vehicles; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Co-ordinated control; Comparative studies; Droop characteristics; Frequency fluctuation; Frequency regulations; Smart grid; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067047396

The details of different tracking systems, their performances and their extra yields tend to exhibit high variances strongly depending on the location where it is implemented. Based on this, there is an argument that there is no significant requirement for implementing solar tracking for solar parks in equatorial regions like Sri Lanka, that experience a good solar irradiance throughout all months of the year. The paper presents the results of a techno-economic feasibility analysis of implementing solar tracking, carried out for a utility scale solar photovoltaic plant of a selected site location in Sri Lanka.

This provides an opportunity to decreases the reliance as well as the cost of electricity from the grid in the commercial sector. However, in cases where all the PV production cannot be consumed by the commercial entity, the excess energy can either be sold to the grid, stored for later used, dissipated using dumping loads, or even shared with other neighboring loads; depending on the applicable supporting policies.Therefore, in this work, an optimal energy management model between a commercial prosumer and a residential consumer is developed and simulated in the south African context with the aim of maximizing the potential energy saving costs. For this purpose, a model is developed to minimize the resulting cost of energy consumed, associated to the Time of Use tariff, while optimizing the power flow between the generation, loads as well as storage of the prosumer.

In this paper, we present RAGra, a 3D ReRAM-based graph processing accelerator, which has two significant technical highlights. First, monolithic 3D ReRAM usually has the complexly-intertwined feature with shared input wordlines and output bitlines for different layers. We propose novel mapping schemes, which can guide to apply different graph algorithms into 3D ReRAM seamlessly and correctly for exposing the inherently-irregular parallelism of 3D ReRAM. Second, consider the sparsity of real-world graphs, we further propose a row- and column-mixed execution model, which can filter invalid subgraphs for exploiting the massive parallelism of 3D ReRAM. Our evaluation on 8-layer stacked ReRAM shows that RAGra outperforms state-of-the-art planar (2D) ReRAM based graph accelerator GraphR by 6.18× performance improvement and 2.21 ×energy saving, on average. In particular, RAGra significantly outperforms Grid-Graph (a typical CPU-based graph system) by up to 293.12×. © 2019 EDAA.",,"Energy conservation; Different layers; Graph algorithms; Graph processing; Massive parallelism; Massively parallels; Real-world graphs; State of the art; Storage densities; RRAM",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066601484

To integrate low renewable voltage with high voltage DC microgrid, a high gain DC converter is essential. Moreover, to enhance efficiency and reduce the cost, multiport converters play a pivotal role. Various topologies proposed in the literature achieve only low voltage gains from source to load. This paper presents a DC converter that achieves both a high gain output as well as multiport operation. The converter also integrates a storage device (battery) with renewable resource to provide backup in the absence of renewable energy. Bidirectional voltage flow is achieved through buck operation for battery charging. The proposed topology presents a four port converter with a voltage source, battery and asymmetric bipolar outputs, suitable for interfacing with DC microgrid and hybrid electric vehicles. Two inductors are used in the topology to achieve high voltage gain. Circuit operation, simulation, voltage gain and efficiencies are critically analyzed.

However, most renewable sources are intermittent in nature and generate a lower level voltage than is required by most applications to operate. Hence, a DC-converter becomes essential to boost the lower level voltage to a higher application level voltage. Moreover, a battery port becomes mandatory for backup storage application for load support. Multi-Port Converter (MPC) can integrate both the converter and the battery port within a single structure. This paper proposes a novel DC-DC MPC with a backup battery port. The proposed converter supports five ports including three renewable inputs, one battery and a single output port. The port is designed to support the grid and will generate an output voltage of 400 V. A PIC control-based scheme is also implemented for the proposed converter to make the outputs stabilized for fluctuating input voltage. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery; Bidirectional; Boost; DC-converter; Multiport; Renewable","Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Global warming; Battery; Bidirectional; Boost; DC converter; Multi-port; Renewable; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066462424

Power usage is kept low by investigating the use of Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol for streaming environmental noise. Beyond merely detecting noise levels, the proposed system can classify the source of the measured noise.

Through these accounts we introduce the relational concepts of Blockchain Assemblages and Whiteboxing. Blockchain assemblages comprise configurations of digital and analogue artefacts that are entangled with imaginaries about the current and future state of the Blockchain information infrastructure. Rather than being a black box, Blockchain assemblages alternate between being dynamic and stable entities. We propose Whiteboxing as the sociomaterial process which drives blockchain assemblages in their dynamic state to be (re)configured, while related artefacts and imaginaries are simultaneously transformed, creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing historical accounts demonstrating technologies in the making, the contribution of this paper, proposes whiteboxing as an analytical concept which allows us to unpack how contemporary technologies are created through entrepreneurial activities. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Assemblages; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Embeddedness; Entrepreneurship; Information infrastructures; Renewable energy; Sociomaterial","Digital storage; Electronic money; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Quantum entanglement; Assemblages; Embeddedness; Entrepreneurship; Information infrastructures; Renewable energies; Sociomaterial; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067622374

The FDD techniques are well established for steady state modes, however the continuous intermittent operation of EVs demands the development of new fault recognition approaches which are able to cope with the effects of large transient dynamics. In this paper an adaptive Morlet Wavelet-based method is proposed which is capable of on-line fault detection of induction motors under fast-varying transient regime via Motor Current Signature Analysis. The fundamental frequency of the phase current is removed by using the Hilbert transform. After, the Adaptive Morlet Wavelet Transform is performed in a sliding window. In each window the central frequency of the Morlet Wavelet is adaptively fitted to the estimated error frequency of the phase current determined by using rotor speed measurement data. The State-of-Health of the motor is evaluated by the Wavelet index composed from the adaptively filtered residual current and the original signal's energy. Simulation investigations are performed with the motor operating load conditions prescribed by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The results validate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method in diagnosis of rotor bar faults. © 2019 IEEE.","adaptive filtering; broken rotor bar; Fault Detection and Diagnosis; fault frequency; Morlet Wavelet; Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA); transient operation","Digital storage; Dynamic loads; Induction motors; Intelligent computing; Traction motors; Wavelet transforms; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fault detection and diagnosis; Fundamental frequencies; Intermittent operation; Morlet wavelet transform; Motor current signature analysis; New european driving cycles; On-line fault detection; Fault detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089133423

This paper presents an optimal operation method for hybrid AC/DC distribution network to achieve safe and economic operation, in the case of uncertain renewable energy (RES) output and load demand. The proposed model is formulated based on a novel two-stage robust model. The first stage of the model optimizes the work states of the on-load tap changers (OLTC), capacitor banks (CBs) and energy storages (ESs) at one cycle. The second stage of the model optimizes the AC/DC converter stations (CSs) output to suppress the overvoltage problem and further reduce the operating cost by using corrective control policy. Furthermore, this paper adopts an ambiguity set to represent uncertainties of RESs and load demand, which makes the model less conservative and also shortens the model solving time.

These renewable energy power stations are using the entire power systems as their storage which will eventually influence the safe and stable operation of the power grid. In order to address this problem, the electricity market considers the fluctuation penalty which can incentivize investors to take measures on fluctuation reduction. Therefore, this paper proposes two strategies on fluctuation penalty reduction which are: 1) Integrating battery into the wind farm, 2) Integrating electrolyzer into the wind farm. Based on the objective of the income, the optimal operations of the two strategies are presented and investigated on the two typical days. The results reveal that the battery performs better than the electrolyzer on mitigating fluctuation penalty but the electrolyzer can obtain more income than the battery. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery; Electricity market; Electrolyzer; Fluctuation penalty; Wind farm","Commerce; Electric batteries; Electric industry; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Electrolytic cells; Investments; Power markets; Power plants; Smart power grids; Wind power; Battery; Electrolyzers; Fluctuation penalty; Operational optimization; Penalty reduction; Renewable energy power; Renewable energy technologies; Wind farm; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074932885

To enhance the economic and technical performance of second-used VRLA batteries, the estimations of battery's residual capacity before and during second-use are essential, which are the two main topics of this paper. First, based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of retired VRLA batteries, an equivalent circuit model is established as the basis for subsequent research. Then, the relationship between the EIS and the residual capacity of the retired VRLA battery that has not been put into second-use is studied by theoretical analysis and experiment research. It is found that the impedance at 0.01Hz (capacitance) and 50Hz (resistance) can be used to select batteries that need restoration and the irreparable batteries respectively. Moreover, the test results of charge-discharge cycles show that the residual capacity of the retired VRLA battery that has been put into second-use can be estimated using battery's open-circuit voltage and DC impedance, both of which are easy to measure for batteries in operation.

To improve the operation economic efficiency and acceptance of renewable energy source of the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid, it is necessary to configure battery energy storage system for distributed generation. In this paper, a mix integer optimization model of generation and storage is proposed for the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid to determine the optimal configuration of generation and storage. Taking the minimum cost of generation and storage investment as well as the minimum operation cost of power generation and purchase and sale of electricity, the dynamic characteristics of generators and storage devices are taken into consideration, and the power loss through AC/DC converter is taken into account. The model is solved as a mixed integer optimization based on Benders Decomposition algorithm. The numerical study shows that the optimal configuration of coordinated generation and storage can effectively save the investment cost of AC/DC hybrid micro-grid, which verifies the validity of the proposed model. © 2019 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Energy storage system; Hybrid AC/DC micro-grid; Mix integer optimization","Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Grid computing; Integer programming; Investments; Rectifying circuits; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Battery energy storage systems; Benders decomposition algorithm; Dynamic characteristics; Energy storage systems; Integer optimization; Micro grid; Mixed integer optimization; Renewable energy source; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074921018

Ltd, Jinan, China","Nowadays, power system often faces the intractable problem of power fluctuation due to the intermittency and stochasticity of renewable energy, such as wind and photovoltaics, generation system. The energy storage system, such as the battery energy storage system (BESS) is an effective way to smooth the power fluctuation so as to increase the allowed penetration level of renewable energy generation in power grid. However, the cost of the energy storage system is still very high and the efficient control strategies are needed to improve the benefit of per unit energy storage as high as possible. In view of that, this paper proposed a novel control strategy for BESS based on the common moving average filter (MAF) and ultra-short-term wind power forecast. By adding future wind power data predicted into inputs of the filter, the MAF could possess the characteristic of nearly zero phase delay, which almost eliminates the low-frequency components in the load of BESS. The control strategy proposed enables BESS to focus on the compensation of the high-frequency components of the wind power, therefore obtaining better smoothing results for given BESS and improving its economic efficiency. Simulation results in various scenarios verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; first-order moving average filter; power fluctuation smoothing; wind power forecast","Battery storage; Digital storage; Smart power grids; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Battery energy storage systems; High frequency components; Low-frequency components; Moving average filter; Power fluctuations; Renewable energy generation; Short-term wind power forecast; Wind power forecast; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074913656

For the regional autonomy multi-microgrids which are out of the power distribution network, the paper proposes a real-time control strategy based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). Based on multi-microgrids distributed and hierarchical control architecture, the proposed strategy considers the three-phase unbalance and the minimum deviation between the actual tie line power and the given reference value, which builds a dynamic prediction model with multi-input, multi-disturbance and multi-variable. Then transform it into a mixed integer nonlinear programming and solve it. With the introduction of feedback correction for prediction error correction, it finally realizes rolling finite time closed loop optimization. By the simulation results, the proposed strategy can adjust power of sources, loads and energy storage systems (ESSs) for the regional autonomy multi-microgrids as well as stabilize power fluctuation of sources and loads.

However, the conventional convolution operation required in processing the output of the frame-based vision sensor makes SNN inefficient because the convolution requires full-image processing. Frameless vision sensors (also called event-based vision sensors) can address this problem because they produce spikes only when events occur in the image. The image encoding of frameless vision sensors is Address Event Representation (AER), an emerging asynchronous protocol. AER events are particularly well-suited for SNN processing. Indeed, computation and communication in SNN are asynchronous because of the asynchronous nature of AER events. This paper presents an SNN hardware inference engine based on an asynchronous Processing Element (PE) array with AER events as input. The engine uses a convolution algorithm based on AER events. This design also uses distributed storage in the PE array to reduce the cost of memory access. The experimental results show that the design can achieve a recognition accuracy of 97.5% for the MNIST AER dataset. This design reduces by 9 the computing activity compared to a baseline systolic array based accelerator. © 2019 IEEE.","AER; Asynchronous circuit; Event-driven; Frame-based; Neuromorphic computing; Spiking Neural Networks; Systolic Array","Asynchronous sequential logic; Convolution; Energy efficiency; Engines; Green computing; Image processing; Neural networks; Asynchronous circuits; Event-driven; Frame-based; Neuromorphic computing; Spiking neural networks; Systolic arrays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073315665

A multi-level comprehensive assessment framework is established, which incorporates both the operation benefits and electrical features. As for the SLBES operation benefits, the amount and volatility of exchanging power between the ADN and utility grid are adopted. Moreover, the voltage volatility, three-phase unbalance and harmonic content at the point of common coupling are taken as the main quantitative indices of electrical features. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process method is utilized to determine the relative weights of intra-level indices, and then the comprehensive assessment index is obtained via the linear weighted summing of sub-level quantitative indices orderly.

A promising alternative is to use flat address space, hybrid memory systems of two or more levels, each exhibiting different performance characteristics. One such existing approach employs a near, high bandwidth 3D-stacked memory, placed on top of the processor die, combined with a far, commodity DDR memory, placed off-chip. Migrating data from the far to the near memory has significant performance potential, but also entails overheads, which may diminish migration benefits or even lead to performance degradation. This paper describes a new data migration scheme for hybrid memory systems that takes into account the above overheads and improves migration efficiency and effectiveness. It is based on the observation that migrating memory segments, which are (partly) present in the Last-Level Cache (LLC) introduces lower migration traffic. Our approach relies on the state of the LLC cachelines to predict future reuse and select memory segments for migration. Thereby, the segments are migrated when present (at least partly) in the LLC incurring lower cost. Our experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the art migration designs improving system performance by 12.1% and reducing memory system dynamic energy by 13.2%. © 2019 IEEE",,"Bandwidth; Dynamic random access storage; Three dimensional integrated circuits; 3D-stacked memory; Improving systems; Lastlevel caches (LLC); Migration efficiency; Performance characteristics; Performance degradation; Performance potentials; State of the art; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072829344

The shoot-through solution and the boosting capability of such converters make them an excellent solution for photovoltaic (PV)application. Furthermore, energy storage integration in these inverters does not require any additional components in the converter; indeed, a battery can be directly connected in parallel with one of the capacitors of the Z- or quasi Z-network.

The simulation shows that our evaluation criteria improve the frequency quality, activate BES regulation, contribute docking with existing standards precisely. © 2019 IEEE.","Automatic generation control (AGC); Battery energy storage (BES); Battery life; Evaluation standard; State of charge (SOC)","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Secondary batteries; Automatic generation control; Battery energy storages (BES); Battery life; Evaluation standard; State of charge; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071535271

At present, under the policy guidance that wind power and photovoltaic power generation need to be completely eliminated, microgrids have further increased the peak-to-valley difference than the simple load due to the irregularity of their internal source, network, load and storage configuration. The trend presents a random two-way, which causes difficulties in the configuration of relay protection and uneconomical operation of the line. This paper considers the probability characteristics of wind power and photovoltaic output, and the economic operation conditions of integrated power lines. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to give the internal configuration optimization model of the networked microgrid. This paper establishes the optimization goal from the perspective of the external characteristics of the networked microgrid, and views the microgrid configuration optimization problem from the perspective of global economy. It avoids the external system burden caused by the internal efficiency and performance of the microgrid. The method is robust and has certain guiding significance for the development and configuration of the microgrid in the later stage. © 2019 IEEE.","External characteristics; Microgrid; Optimization algorithm; Probability; Renewable energy","Artificial intelligence; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Probability; Solar energy; Wind power; Configuration optimization; External characteristic; Micro grid; Optimization algorithms; Optimum configurations; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Photovoltaic power generation; Renewable energies; Electric power system protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071141632

However, many of them are powered by external energy and require separate actuators with corresponding control modules, which increase the overall quality while reducing the portability and wear-ability. In this paper, through the gait kinetic energy analysis, we summarized the movement rules of each joint in lower extremity to improve the walking efficiency. Considering that ankle joint whose movement rules are apparent has a significant influence on human gait performance, we proposed that there is a negative work stage in dorsiflexion, whereas plantarflexion does positive work by consuming muscle energy to drive the body forward. Therefore, we designed an unpowered walking assistant device, which imitated the normal gait by using the characteristics of energy storage under pressure of torsion spring in dorsiflexion and energy release in plantarflexion. The biodynamic simulation of the proposed design was conducted to verify the function of walking-assistant. © 2019 IEEE.","Gait; Kinetic energy analysis; Unpowered assistive device; Walking efficiency","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Quality control; Assistive devices; Energy analysis; External energy; Gait; Lower extremity; Overall quality; Torsion Springs; Walking efficiency; Walking aids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071095078

Since the problem is non-convex, we first transform it into some equivalent forms and then design a Dinkelbach's programming-based method to solve it. Some semi-closed form results are obtained.

Since both file placement and data exchange among mobile devices consume energy, the energy status of devices has a significant effect on the caching utility of the whole system. This work considers the caching optimization in a cellular network where mobile devices are served by one base station (BS). As the devices can collect the file segments from the local storage, via device-to-device (D2D) links, and via a cellular link, we aim at minimizing the percentage of file segment that should be collected from the BS by optimizing the file placement scheme at devices to improve caching performance. Due to the difficulty of solving the optimal caching problem, we propose a residual energy-aware file placement algorithm based on the popularity distribution of contents and causality of energy arrival.

In practice, these batteries suffer from degradation in the usable capacity when they are repeatedly charged after being partially discharged and vice versa. The capacity can be recovered by imposing the full-cycle constraint, which says that a battery must be charged only after it is fully discharged and vice versa. Further, practical batteries cannot be charged and discharged simultaneously. With the above constraints, we consider and compare EH communication systems under two cases: (a) the single-battery case and (b) the dual-battery case, in which the transmitters are equipped with a single battery of capacity 2B joules and two batteries, each having capacity of B joules, respectively. Under (a) and (b), our goal is to obtain the long-term average throughputs and throughput regions in a point-to-point (P2P) channel and a multiple access channel (MAC), respectively. For the P2P channel, we derive the optimal solution in the single-battery case, and propose optimal and suboptimal power allocation policies for the dual-battery case, assuming Bernoulli energy arrivals. Based on these policies, we obtain long-term average achievable throughput regions in MACs by jointly allocating rates and powers. From numerical simulations, we find that the optimal throughput in the dual-battery case is significantly higher than that in the single-battery case, although the total storage capacity in both cases is 2B joules. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Energy harvesting; Achievable throughputs; Average throughput; Multiple access channels; Optimal solutions; Optimal throughputs; Power allocations; Storage capacity; Throughput regions; Electric batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070191268

In this paper, we propose the framework of EC-based smart grid networks, in which EC servers are deployed at the gateways between the remote cloud center and the terminal smart meters. The EC servers perform energy scheduling and renewable energy generation(RG) output forecasting, based on the collected power demand data of terminal devices and monitoring data of RG equipments. According to the inherent collaboration features of the monitoring data offloading, that the outputs of the same size/type RG equipments in a limited area are the same in a short time, we consider an efficient cooperative task offloading and resource allocation scheme. Not all of the monitoring data should be offloaded. Then, an optimal problem is formulated, the transmission powers and channels, computation resource allocation and task offloading fraction of devices are jointly optimized.

Particularly, our goal is to maximize the end-to-end throughput by a deadline subject to the finite data and energy storage.

However, TLC crossbar ReRAM suffers from high write latency and energy due to the IR drop issue and the iterative program-and-verify procedure. In this paper, we propose Tiered-ReRAM architecture to overcome the challenges of TLC crossbar ReRAM. The proposed Tiered-ReRAM consists of three components, namely Tiered-crossbar design, Compression-based Incomplete Data Mapping (CIDM), and Compression-based Flip Scheme (CFS). Specifically, based on the observation that the magnitude of IR drops is primarily determined by the long length of bitlines in Double-Sided Ground Biasing (DSGB) crossbar arrays, Tiered-crossbar design splits each long bitline into the near and far segments by an isolation transistor, allowing the near segment to be accessed with decreased latency and energy. Moreover, in the near segments, CIDM dynamically selects the most appropriate IDM for each cache line according to the saved space by compression, which further reduces the write latency and energy with insignificant space overhead. In addition, in the far segments, CFS dynamically selects the most appropriate flip scheme for each cache line, which ensures more high resistance cells written into crossbar arrays and effectively reduces the leakage energy. For each compressed cache line, the selected IDM or flip scheme is applied on the condition that the total encoded data size will never exceed the original cache line size. The experimental results show that, on average, Tiered-ReRAM can improve the system performance by 30.5%, reduce the write latency by 35.2%, decrease the read latency by 26.1%, and reduce the energy consumption by 35.6%, compared to an aggressive baseline. © 2019 IEEE.","compression; flip scheme; Incomplete Data Mapping; IR drop; TLC crossbar ReRAM; write latency and energy","Cache memory; Compaction; Drops; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mapping; Memory architecture; Cross-bar structures; flip scheme; Incomplete data; IR drop; Leakage energies; Resistive memory (ReRAM); Storage-class memory; write latency and energy; RRAM",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069178136

In view of the above problems, considering the probability distribution characteristics of wind power, a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based probability-interval method is proposed to describe the uncertain wind power in this paper. Then, besides traditional facilities, electricity storage system (ESS) is introduced to improve the flexibility of IES.

Single-source renewable energy systems (RES) are associated with low capacity factor, high capital costs and intermittency. Combining two or more power sources, whether renewable or non-renewable, increases the system's reliability in terms of power consistency, reduces fuel emissions and is a more sustainable and financial viable solution overall. A grid-connection and a battery storage system can further increase the dispatchability of the system. The design of each HPS can become more complex due to the location and stochastic availability of renewable energy sources. A GA is developed to solve this sizing problem. The objectives of the algorithm are: minimizing the loss of power supply probability, maximizing usage of renewable energy and minimizing capital and life cycle costs. A GA is developed to incorporate operational and dispatch strategies and a techno-economic and trade-off analysis is done to study the advantages and disadvantages of different combinations. This can help develop a methodology to choose the most suited HPS for the location and resource availability. The in-house GA will be compared with HOMER design software to highlight the similarities and differences between the two design strategies. © 2019 IEEE.","genetic algorithm; HOMER; hybrid power supply; multi-attribute trade-off analysis; optimisation","Availability; Costs; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Battery storage system; HOMER; Hybrid power supply; Loss of power supply probability; Multi-attribute trade-off analysis; Optimisations; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems (RES); Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065820758

Mayjend Haryono 167, Malang, 65145, Indonesia","Gas hydrate represents a mixture of natural gas and water molecules formed at high pressures and low temperatures near the freezing point of water. Physically, the hydrates are ice-shaped and among the water molecules, there is a cavity filled by a hydrate gas called clathrate. The hydrates can be formed because there is gas injected in water molecules at high pressure condition having temperature above the freezing point of water. Then it is exposed to a force that can dissolve gas inside the water. A lot of research has been conducted to investigate the performance of the gas hydrate itself. The performances include the rate of hydrate formation, the hydrate stability, and the hydrate storage capacity. Several studies have been studied, among others, to observe the effect of initial gas injection pressure on gas hydrate process, the effect of rotation in a vessel tank as a container for gas hydrate formation, and the hydrate formation process on stirrer tank. One of the most important things in the gas hydrate process is how the hydrate can be formed, which can be seen from the rate of hydrate formation by investigating how much the gas pressure will penetrate into water molecules. It is due the hydrate formation requires low temperature and high pressure. However, a conditioning of the gas hydrate formation at high pressure and low temperature is a matter that requires considerable energy. Therefore, it is needed a system in which the pressure of hydrate formation is not too high. One method to lower the hydrate pressure in order to the hydrate-forming pressure is not too high, CO 2 will be mixed to the gas hydrate. It is because CO 2 is soluble in water molecules. It make an effect that the pressure of gas formation will be lower. In the previous research, it is showed that CO 2 was able to make the pressure in methane gas mixture lower. By decreasing its pressure, CO 2 is expected to improve the hydrate performances. The study was conducted by varying the percentage of CO 2 volume from 0% to 100%. Each percentage of CO 2 will be seen as its effect on the gas hydrate performance. The gas used in this experiment were propane-butane gas mixture of 50% each. The mixture of propane-butane gas and CO 2 were then fed into the water molecules. The water used was a demine water of 50 cm 3 . The initial pressure of the formation rate was 0.3 MPa and the temperature formation was 273 K. Meanwhile, the temperature used to stabilize the hydrate was 268 K. The vessel tank, used to process the occurrence of hydrate has the capability of high pressure has a cavity diameter material of 4 cm, height 12 cm, 0.5 cm thick and total volume of 150 cm 3 . The vessel tanks were inserted into the cooling bath that was set at a temperature of 273 K. The results showed that as greater the CO 2 content, as smaller the initial hydrate initiation phase, However, it has an impact to decrease the hydrate stability. For hydrate storage capacity performance, pure CO 2 hydrate has the highest storage capacity, while the lowest storage capacity was CO 2 with gas-CO 2 mixed percentage of 50%. It shows that CO 2 is capable to decrease the pressure effect on 50% composition variation. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064973125

High penetration of renewable energy resources makes it difficult to make decisions on restoration strategies because the power injections become uncertain. This paper proposes a chance-constrained program with relaxed second-order cone constraints (SOCC) to formulate the critical load restoration problem. The joint probability density function of power outputs of PVs and WTs is represented by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Using the sample average approximation method, an approximate analytical form of the chance constraints is proposed, which transforms the probabilistic program to a deterministic mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP). The MISOCP can be solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the simulation of the IEEE 33-node test system. © 2018 IEEE.","distributed generation; Distribution system; resilience; restoration; uncertainties","Distributed power generation; Gaussian distribution; Image reconstruction; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Probability density function; Restoration; Approximate analytical; Distributed generations (DGs); Distribution systems; Joint probability density function; resilience; Sample average approximation; Second order cone programs; uncertainties; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064969711

Due to the randomness and intermittency of the output power of PV generation, the frequency stability of power system deteriorates and the difficultly of frequency regulation increases. In this paper, by simulating the traditional frequency regulation process, a hierarchical frequency regulation strategy of PV power plants is proposed. Firstly, Energy storage system (ESS) based on virtual synchronous generator (VSG) provides inertial support to the system at the beginning of the frequency fluctuations. Then, the primary frequency regulation is achieved by PV units based on the droop control. The droop character are reasonable designed to ensure the orderly participation and fully utilization of each PV units. Finally, the emergency frequency control is provided by ESS when the frequency beyond the allowable range.

So there is the basic need to mitigate the emissions of CO2 to avoid the global warming. To decrease the amount of CO2 being released into the air in near future, the carbon capture and storage is now considered an effective and practical way. Integrated gasification Combined cycle (IGCC) power plants are considered relatively advanced fossil fuel based power generation system due to higher net power efficiency, ease in CO2 capture and cogeneration opportunities. Liquid absorption is the widely used and matured technology for gas separation. Physical solvents are mainly used for pre-combustion CO2 capture. The main objective of this paper is to search the most suitable solvent or combination of their mixture. Performance comparison and economic evaluation for two different physical solvents including Selexol process and Sulfinol Process has been made for the optimal selection of the capture process. The performance of Sulfinol hybrid solvent (a mixture of Sulfolane, MDEA and H2O) is compared with the Single Stage Selexol process. When both the Dual Stage processes were compared, Dual Stage Selexol was found to be economical over Dual Stage Sulfinol process. © 2018 IEEE.","CO2 Capture; IGCC; Physical solvents; Selexol; Sulfinol","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Cogeneration plants; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Mixtures; Precombustion; Renewable energy resources; Solvents; CO2 capture; IGCC; Physical solvent; Selexol; Sulfinol; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065041345

New studies show that in the future the major drawback of WSN will be energy storage, harvesting and processing. WSN are placed remotely which are powered by PV (Photovoltaic) Panels and batteries. The power source is variable in both cases; the output voltage of a PV panel fluctuates due to the environmental parameters such as intensity of light, dust, ambient temperature, cloud factor and humidity etc. While the output voltage of a battery drop due to the continuous use. On the other hand a regulated voltage is required for a load driven by a PV panel. DC-DC converter is a device which regulates the output voltage of a PV across the load. The converter design technique is based on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). With PWM technique battery can be fully charged with less charging stress so prolonging the life time of a battery and reducing the cost. To maximize the accuracy and further reduce the cost analog control system will be used instead of an expensive microcontroller chip.

However, several issues related to inverter interfaced microgrids exist. These issues include intermittency of renewable energy based generations sources which leads to the voltage, frequency mismatch that eventually disturbs the grid quality and affect the loads. This paper develops a sub-microgrid approach i.e. Sub-grid within a microgrid using load switching mechanism (LCM). The LCM switches the load from one distributed generation to the other using central controller. The loads are divided into three groups i.e. Heavy loads, light loads and critical loads. Two distributed generators, solar power and wind power along with the central storage are the generation sources. The central controller checks the power generation from the two sources and connects the heavy and light loads to the distributed generator appropriate for the loads. In case of no power available from any distributed generators, demand response program is initiated to supply the critical loads only. Three scenarios have been tested based on the frequency deviations during transition state from one source to the other source. © 2018 IEEE.","energy management; Microgridt; Frequency; Stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Energy management; Solar energy; Wind power; Conventional power; Demand response programs; Design and analysis; Distributed generators; Frequency deviation; Frequency mismatch; Microgridt; Frequency; Renewable energies; Distributed power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065033814

Our approach is to generate energy at home through renewable energy (RE) resources and store surplus energy in the battery bank. If RE generation sources and battery reserve fails to satisfy the load, then power is supplied by the main grid. The major work is to develop an autonomous system that can manage all these sources effectively and efficiently. Despite many advantages of renewable energy sources its drawback is that these sources are weather and climate dependent. Night hours, clouds, wind speed, fog, etc are the factors that effect the performance of renewable energy sources with big impact. This research is based on a group of three prosumers who can generate energy via RE sources at home, stores it in a battery bank and takes the extra energy from nearby grid to fulfill the local demand if it is required.

Earlier research implemented the subject Control Strategy of VSC on a Laboratory scale System with a constant DC Voltage Source. This research replaces DC Voltage Source in Laboratory Setup with a 700 Volts DC Bus, with DC Voltage being controlled by Lead-Acid Battery based Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). DC Bus also includes a 40 kW Fuel Cell and 41 kW Photovoltaic (PV) System. The Control Strategy is tested for balanced Loads, unbalanced Loads and nonlinear Loads in Grid-connected and Islanded Modes. In Islanded Mode, the Voltage of DC Link can be controlled by BESS with smaller Discharge Power. In Grid-connected Mode, large Power Exchanges occur between Grid and DC Link at start up, due to slow response time of Repetitive Controllers, resulting in unacceptably large deviations of DC Link Voltage. To settle DC Link Voltage within reasonable time, BESS with Discharge Power equal to sum of Microgrid's local Load and main Grid's Demand is needed. Moreover, the DC Link Voltage has ripples at low frequency with unbalanced local Load in Grid-connected and Islanded Modes, despite presence of independently controlled Neutral Leg.

When the loader arm is lifting, the peak power of the hydraulic pump is high, and when the boom is falling the gravitational potential energy of the boom is dissipated by the hydraulic valve port. Then, the dissipated energy is converted into thermal energy, which increases temperature of the hydraulic oil and reduces the energy efficiency of hydraulic system. In order to improve energy efficiency, a potential energy recovery and wheel loader boom dead-weight hydraulic-gas balance system is proposed in this paper. In the system, the three-chamber hydraulic cylinder and accumulator are used to recycle the potential energy by balancing the weight of boom. In this paper, The co-simulation model of original boom hydraulic system of wheel loader was built in SimulationX firstly. After the model had been verified by experiments, the potential energy recovery and loader arm dead-weight hydraulic-gas balance system is stablished, in which the original two-chamber cylinder of boom hydraulic system is replaced by the three-chamber hydraulic cylinder. Operating characteristics and energy consumption are compared during the lifting and falling simulation process of boom system in no-load conditions. The results show that the proposed system has same operating characteristics with the original machine when the initial pressure of accumulator is 6Mpa, the peak power of pump can be reduced by 57.1 %, and the energy consumption can be decreased by about 39.5%. © 2019 IEEE.","Hydraulic-gas energy storage; Potential energy recovery; Three-chamber hydraulic cylinder","Balancing; Construction equipment; Cylinders (shapes); Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Fluid Power; Hydraulic accumulators; Hydraulic equipment; Loaders; Mechanical actuators; Mining machinery; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Wheels; Dissipated energy; Gravitational potential energy; Hydraulic cylinders; No-load conditions; Operating characteristics; Operation characteristic; Simulation process; Simulation research; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083033002

When the hydraulic excavator boom lowers, the gravitational potential energy is converted into heat, which results in poor energy efficiency. To solve this problem, a novel flywheel based energy recovery system (FESS) is proposed in this paper. A hydraulic pump/motor (PM) is employed as the energy conversion element and a flywheel is used as the energy storage element. To reduce the power loss when the flywheel is idling, a clutch is installed between the PM and the flywheel. The working principle of the system is analyzed in detail. A 4 t hydraulic excavator is taken as the research object, and the key parameters of the system are matched. The model of the FESS is developed in AMESim. The influence of the key parameters such as the PM displacement and the moment of inertia of the flywheel on the energy recovery and reutilization efficiency in the typical working cycle are simulated and analyzed, and the specific value of the energy recovery and reutilization is obtained, up to 65% for 4 t excavator and 60% for a 21 t excavator. The simulation results show that the FESS can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the hydraulic system. © 2019 IEEE.","Boom; Energy recovery system; Energy saving; Flywheel; Hydraulic excavator","Construction equipment; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Excavation; Excavators; Fluid Power; Flywheels; Hydraulic equipment; Potential energy; Recovery; Wheels; Construction machinery; Emission standard; Energy recovery system; Gravitational potential energy; Hydraulic excavator; Hydraulic pump/motor; Moment of inertia; Storage elements; Hydraulic energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077814767

A MG system includes renewable energy sources (RES) for energy production, storage devices for storing energy excess, and control strategies for orchestrating all components and for improving the efficiency of the system. However, forecasting methods are required to develop predictive control strategies in order to tackle the uncertainty and intermittency of energy production and consumption. The State-of-Charge (SoC) of batteries is one of the main parameters used in predictive control algorithms, because it indicates how much energy is stored and how long a MG system can be relying on the deployed storage devises. Several methods have been developed for SoC estimation, but little work has been dedicated for SoC forecasting in MG systems. In this paper, we introduce a predictive approach for SoC forecasting using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm.

As Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely deployed in smart tags, smart-phones, and smart-devices, adding functionality to support localization and asset tracking is crucial. In order to locate a device, either the angle or range to the device needs to be calculated. In this paper, we focus on a phase-based solution to calculate the range between devices. We introduce a multi-carrier phase-based ranging solution compatible with the BLE standard that utilizes BLE channel hopping to exchange tones in the entire 2.4 GHz frequency band to mitigate the multi-path fading problem. We recognize that in the BLE standard, slow channel-hopping, long packet size and frame spacing between two consecutive communications (named TIFS) affect ranging error/accuracy, in the case of crystal offset and phase-noise. Therefore, we introduce a new mathematical model to analyze the impact of the BLE link layer protocol on the ranging error.

Moreover, Photovoltaic (PV) systems at the LV level have been constantly increasing as well. Buildings with PVs on their roof and EVs as the main transport means may well become the norm the following years, considering additionally that all new buildings in the EU should be Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). Such NZEBs should cover the majority of their low energy demand by Renewable Energy Sources, and PV technology is the main candidate to achieve that. Both these facts pose considerable challenges on the LV networks. In this context, this paper examines the potential of efficiently utilizing the stored energy of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in order to face the increased load demand by the penetration of EVs in LV Distribution Networks (DNs), with the presence of PVs. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed in order to perform optimal charging schedule for the EVs under the aim of optimizing the DN voltage profile.

In this study, we investigated the effects of harmonic distortion resulted from VFD on the measurement accuracy in the distribution system operated by state-owned electric utility. The results showed that the VFD that employed the pulse width modulation (PWM) technique has adjusted the supply frequency of 50 Hz into specific number to control the speed of motors.

In terms of maintenance process, if there are a large number devices of Public Street Lighting, the problem of efficiency arises. The maintenance becomes inefficient if the process has to be conducted one by one for each point and carried out for a time continuously. In this paper, one alternative method is proposed by using a data logger developed using an ATmega328 microcontroller on the solar module of Public Street Lighting.

A microgrid is a cluster of distributed energy resources (DER) along with energy storage devices in the premises of load, which provides the opportunity to employ renewable energy resources (RES), along with the traditional power system. In most of the developing countries like Pakistan, ageing and overloading of the transmission lines is one of the major problem in energy system. The old infrastructure of electric power grid is not proficient of compensating the increased demand of power. However, these effects can be encountered by deploying the distributed energy resources nearby to the load. Apart from technical constrains, there are certain non-technical issues regarding deployment of microgrids in Pakistan. This survey investigates the problems associated with the implementation of microgrid and its challenges, which hinder its deployment in Pakistan. In this paper microgrid policies of Pakistan, challenges and driving factors of microgrid have been investigated. This will help to motivate the people to implement DER's and MG. Ultimately it will accelerate the implementation process of MG and will improve the overall power system of Pakistan. © 2019 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resources (DES); Microgrid (MG); Net Metering (NM); Renewable Energy Resources (RES); Renewable Energy Technology (RET); Smart Grid (SG)","Developing countries; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Distributed Energy Resources; Micro grid; Net metering; Renewable energy resource (RES); Renewable energy technologies; Smart grid; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071430371

The MG faces different challenges during isolated mode of operation, such as load voltage fluctuation on the demand response, MG steadiness while supplementing of distributed generation (DG), and power flow instability. This paper proposes a robust control technique for superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) in isolated mode of operation of MG with the insertion of solar power generation (SPG) and the unexpected loading event as well.

In our case, under term 'objects' we understand the day-time (more precisely, twenty-four hours) periods, in which the necessary measurements of informative, from the standpoint of the task, values (the energy generated by the components of the system, its current cost for each type of generator, etc.) were performed. We assume that systems Smart Grid are based on renewable generation sources such as solar radiation and wind energy in combination with such system components as high-power storage batteries and power generators based on autonomous power station. The obtained statistical information formed the basis of constructing models that describe certain optimal in terms of developed criteria of a subset of 'objects' using bi-clustering algorithms.

This reference frame is employed to design the proportional controllers to support voltage and frequency profiles on time-varying loads through a combination of small distributed energy resources and battery energy storage systems. The proposed approach avoids using frequency measurements and reduces the complexity of the control problem. PBC theory exploits natural port-Hamiltonian formulations of the power electronic converters to design controllers, guaranteeing stability for closed-loop operation. Two passivity-based proportional controllers are proposed and compared with conventional proportional actions reported in specialized literature.

As a result, when the intensity of solar radiation is high, the voltage output converter is high so that the motor-rotation becomes faster. and the water volume be produced also becomes more. On the contrary, when the intensity of solar radiation is low, the voltage output converter goes down that the motor rotation is slowly and the water volume is pumped is also low.

In the UDN architecture, the proposed strategy can obtain access information based on the combination of user preferences and file attributes to cache high-popularity files on the Radio Access Network (RAN) side.

In addition, filtering of junk files is taken into account to increase the utilization of cache storage space. Finally, we assess the proposed scheme by plenty of simulations.

A high voltage gain is achieved at low duty cycle by using a switched capacitor cell. The proposed topology is light weight and less expensive due to usage of a single inductor and less component count. On the basis of possible directions of power flow different operating modes are defined and are analyzed in steady state.

Therefore, a strategy for optimal energy consumption and bidirectional power trade between the building and utility grid, is required for this class of customers. However, such control functions under uncertainties such as unpredictable solar irradiance and unplanned electric and natural gas network outages. These uncertainties adversely affect the performance (cost, emission and deviations) and resilience (capability to recover from disturbances). The objective of this paper is to develop a linear bi-level risk averse macro energy hub (MEH) control for a cluster of large commercial building μGs, to minimize network load deviation, while satisfying building owner specified total μG energy cost and the GHG emission constraints. To attain risk aversion, conditional value at risk (CVaR) is added in the objective function. Analysis shows that inclusion of CVaR increases the energy retaining capability of electric storages. Stored energy acts as a reserve during carrier outages and μG islanding to provide better quality service with improved performance. Results show that under risk averse mode, an improvement of 21.03% and 24.10% in charge retaining capability is witnessed for electric vehicle and stationary battery, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Bilateral stakes; Conditional value at risk; Energy hub control; Risk aversion","Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Office buildings; Outages; Risk analysis; Value engineering; Bilateral stakes; Commercial building; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Energy hubs; Natural gas networks; Objective functions; Risk aversion; Stationary batteries; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064111073

Microgrid is a small power grid that can be a solution to electrify remote areas. Weriagar Village, which is located near Tangguh LNG, is one of the villages that still need continuous power and water supply. The majority of people who work as fishermen also need a room to store and to preserve their fish. This research intends to conduct technical and economic analysis on microgrid development by utilizing LNG to power Weriagar Village, to provide fresh water, and cold storage. Electricity is generated through a mini gas engine power plant, clean water is produced by reverse osmosis module, and cold storage uses a vapour compression cycle and cold energy from LNG regasification. The simulation of each system is done with UniSim Design R390 to evaluate the technical performances of each systems and its economic analysis is carried out using cash flow method with several schemes of financial and fiscal incentives. The main result of analysis shows that the natural-gas fired microgrid capacity is 55 kW with an electrical efficiency of 34.18%, the volume of cold storage is 301.5 m 3 with specific energy consumption of 42.11 kWh/m 3 -year, whilst the reverse osmosis capacity is 94.6m 3 /day with specific energy consumption of 7.12 kWh/m 3 . The total electricity consumption with and without utilizing LNG cold energy in cold storage are 306,822.41 kWh/year and 309,414.61 kWh/ year respectively. There are 3 business schemes that are able to turn the project to become feasible: the provision of grant, joint cost scheme, and joint cost with fiscal incentive scheme. These business schemes are able to lower the cost of electricity generation below the regional electricity generation cost of Rp 2,790/kWh. This research proves the integration of electricity generation business and productive zone i.e. cold storage is able to bring mutual benefits to each entity. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063545015

Several methods have been investigated to store hydrogen effectively and adsorptive approach is one of the best methods proposed. Porous carbon is among adsorbent materials that have the potential to be used. Unfortunately, on its own, carbon showed a low hydrogen storage capacity. One way to improve the hydrogen uptake is to impregnate carbon with metal. This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of adsorbent based on nickel oxide/porous carbon for hydrogen adsorption. The porous carbon employed was polymer-derived carbon synthesized by pyrolysis of phenolic resin (1170m 2 /g specific surface area and 6.05nm mean diameter). As comparison, a commercial carbon of biomass-derived carbon was also studied (1320 m 2 /g specific surface area and 1.80nm mean diameter). Both porous carbons were impregnated with a 20 wt.% nickel or a mix of 10 wt.% nickel and 10 wt.% magnesium in their oxide forms. To load metal in carbon, a wet incipient method was implemented to disperse nickel precursor inside pores of carbon followed with a calcination process at 375°C. The characterization by scanning electron microscopy-EDX showed a successful dispersion of metals on carbon. Adsorption measurement was performed at ambient temperature and resulting in an enhancement of hydrogen uptake by metal oxide-loaded carbon compared to only pristine carbon. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063437365

Different from the conventional scientific computing, big data applications are usually simple computing patterns with massive input data, which makes current general-purpose processors suffer poor performance and huge energy consumption. Among various computing patterns in big data applications, string operations are common but very important parts of data processing. Dealing with simple and fixed computing patterns with high-performance processors is wasteful. In this paper, we propose WEAVER, a high-efficiency, general-purpose acceleration architecture for string operations, which can be integrated into current processors and work beside on-chip memory controller.

By employing the unique crossbar structure, ReRAM can be constructed with extremely high density. However, ReRAM's crossbar structure suffers from an IR drop issue, which causes the asymmetric access latency in crossbar arrays. Moreover, without access transistors in the crossbar structure, read and write disturbances lead to serious data reliability problem. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric-ReRAM (A-ReRAM) to overcome the challenges of crossbar ReRAM. By reducing the IR drops along both wordlines and bitlines, leveraging the asymmetric access latency in crossbar arrays and exposing the most appropriate write latency to the memory controller, A-ReRAM effectively reduces the access latency. By applying the circuit-architecture level solutions, A-ReRAM addresses the read and write disturbances, and significantly improves the reliability. The experimental results show that, A-ReRAM improves system performance by 29.7% and 19.2%, and reduces the energy consumption by 21.1% and 11.3% on average, compared to the baseline and the state-of-the-art crossbar ReRAM design. Meanwhile, A-ReRAM significantly improves the reliability of ReRAM-based memory systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Asymmetric access latency; Crossbar; IR drop; Read and write disturbances; ReRAM","Big data; Cloud computing; Drops; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Reliability; Ubiquitous computing; Access latency; Circuit architectures; Cross-bar structures; Crossbar; IR drop; Resistive memory (ReRAM); Storage-class memory; Write disturbances; RRAM",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063879341

Due to the development of the diversity and scale, there has been an ever-increasing need of data transmission algorithms in both academia and industry. Past research shows that with the increasing types and number of sensors deployed, there are problems such as low transmission efficiency and excessive energy consumption. When the collected data are transferred back to the background server, sensor nodes face the problem of high storage pressure. Distributed technology can alleviate the transmission and storage pressure of signal nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimization algorithm which can reduce the amount of data, energy consumption and improve transmission rate. In addition, for further improving the accuracy of restored data, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to generate adaptive sparse matrix for different types of sensors. Through selecting different sparse matrices, our experiments show that the technology can significantly reduce the transmission of data and ensure the accuracy of data reconstruction. © 2019 IEEE.","compressed sensing; distributed; principal component analysis; smart grid; sparse matrix","Artificial intelligence; Compressed sensing; Data transfer; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Principal component analysis; Sensor nodes; Smart power grids; Data reconstruction; distributed; Distributed technologies; Optimization algorithms; Smart grid; Sparse matrices; Transmission efficiency; Transmission of data; Matrix algebra",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063919553

A potential solution is to construct a home/neighbourhood energy management system (HEMS) to coordinate all available electrical equipment together using AI. As a portion of HEMS, peak demand prediction is critically important on triggering load scheduling among the household power environment to achieve better electricity usage curve.

However, these materials are extremely vulnerable to oxidation at exalted temperatures. Efforts have been made to shield such materials from oxidation at high temperatures by the introduction of dense and crack free surface coatings, impregnates and oxidation retardants. Some refractory carbides, borides and silicides offer potential coating systems for such materials. Metal carbide coatings have been found useful for carbon base materials. This coating is formed at high temperature normally above 1500°C. The present work is related to the formation of a high temperature oxidation and wear resistant coating of Titanium Carbide (TiC) on polycrystalline graphite substrate at lower temperatures.

Also, cost, operability and material availability must be considered. Based on what has already been investigated in previous studies, metal fuels can be combusted with water or even with air as oxidizers to generate heat for many applications. Furthermore, when they are burned with air, low-net-carbon emissions can be achieved by capturing and recycling the combustion products. When metals react with water under specific conditions, it produces hydrogen on demand in exothermic reactions. Metals can be produced with clean primary energy through electrolysis, or other methods, and then store this energy as a chemical one in the metal fuel that can be released through oxidation by air, water, or even carbon dioxide, amongst other oxidants. Metals represent a promising solution for the future of propulsion and energy-conversion applications due to their reactivity with water, high energy densities and wide availability. However, as it is demonstrated in other studies, there are key limitations about the waste of the thermal energy in the case of low-temperature reactions and the waste of the chemical energy contained within the generated hydrogen as a reaction product in the case of high-temperature propulsion applications. Also, this concept when applied for onboard vehicles presents a number of difficulties related to storage systems and reaction rate kinetics. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate relevant, recent alternatives for developing clean energy with high performances based on hydrogen generation from metal-water reactions, focusing basically on rocket propulsion. The main characteristics of energy from metal fuels are numerically investigated and compared to the ones of the conventional, existing fuels. The techniques that are to be possibly used for exploiting the energetic potential of metal-water reactions are as follows: low-temperature metal-water reactors for fuel cells or other power systems, and high energy densities metals and water mixtures as propellants for underwater and aerospace propulsion. Thus, the exhausted hydrogen as a reaction product can act as a secondary fuel, enhance the combustion performance and produce thrust. © 2019 IEEE.","energy conversion; hydrogen generation; Metal-water reaction; rocket propulsion","Aircraft propulsion; Carbon dioxide; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; High temperature applications; Metal fuels; Metals; Propellants; Reaction kinetics; Reaction products; Rockets; Temperature; Waste incineration; Combustion characteristics; Combustion performance; Environmental footprints; Hydrogen generations; Low temperature reactions; Propulsion applications; Rocket propulsion; Water reaction; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064109219

These grids help increase power quality and are known by their reliability and efficiency. Micro-wind turbines are one of the most commonly used in microgrids due to its efficient power generation and are emerging as one of the most up and coming technologies in the energy system field. To ensure the safety of these systems and proper grid integration, a control system must be implemented to guarantee that the wind turbine is adequate for operation. This paper presents the testing results of a proposed control system for a 400W micro-wind turbine. Experimental setup and testing procedures are explained in detail.

DEFC uses ethanol in the fuel cell instead of the more toxic methanol. Ethanol is more attractive than methanol by many reasons. Ethanol is a hydrogen-rich liquid and it has a higher specific energy (8.0 kWh/kg) compared to methanol (6.1 kWh/kg). Ethanol can be obtained in great quantity from biomass through a fermentation process from renewable resources like from sugar cane, wheat, corn, or even straw. The use of ethanol would also overcome both the storage and infrastructure challenge of hydrogen for fuel cell applications. The experimental apparatus on the micro direct ethanol fuel cell for measuring the cell performance has been set for this research. The goal of the DEFC study in this research was studied on the performance of the micro direct ethanol fuel cell (Micro-DEFC). The experimental performance testing were studied about three kinds of the ethanol blended. There are the ethanol was blended with pure distilled water, the ethanol was blended with conventional drinking water and the ethanol was blended with normal tap water. The effect of operating temperature change on the electrical production is also study too. The cell performance is specified in the terms of cell voltage and power of the cell. By observing for all three experiments, increasing the volume of ethanol and the cell operating temperature effect on the electrical production of the fuel cell. By increasing the volume of ethanol and the temperature, the fuel cell gradually produce the electrical value and gradually increase to the maximum value, and then gradually decrease until the fuel has been depleted. Increasing the volumetric of ethanol and cell operating temperature effect on the electrical current production and power of the fuel cell but do not affect on the electrical potential or have a little effect. Compared to the three experiments, the third experiment that the ethanol was blended with normal tap water. Due to the impurity of the water, the crossing of the water from the electrode to the electrode within the electrochemical reaction zone of the fuel cell results in the abrasion of the electrochemical reaction of the fuel cell. So, it is given the low fuel cell production capacity. © 2018 IEEE.","Drinking water; Ethanol; Fuel cell; Pure distilled water; Tap water; Temperature","Bioethanol; Electrochemical electrodes; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Methanol; Potable water; Sugar cane; Temperature; Cell operating temperature; Distilled water; Electrical potential; Electrochemical reactions; Experimental apparatus; Hydrogen for fuel cells; Operating temperature; Tap water; Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064217205

In this study Microgrid consists of energy storage, renewable energy based sources that consists of solar pv, microhydro and Biomass with their respective power electronics converters. We have chosen multiple options and tried to find-out the trade-off among cost, stability, reliability and the availability of renewable resources. Strictly, for more stable and reliable operations, cost would be higher. Thus, we have proposed design of an off-grid solution such that all the power sources i.e. solar pv, biomass and microhydro will be stored and supplied through batteries using converters in order to ensure frequency stability for PV, microhydro and biomass. We have considered a two pronged approach i.e. 1) switch battery banks to dump the excess energy and maintain the frequency of the system (similar to dummy loads in electronic load controller-an electronic governor for microhydro). 2). Energy from microhydro can either be used directly or through batteries. Where, the biomass will always be used from batteries and as a backup source.

Solar PV and micro-hydro are the primary sources to serve load demand, while biomass and battery provide backup in peak hours. A bi-directional converter is used, when load demand decreases battery bank gets charged from micro-hydro and solar PV. Battery bank will provide electricity to consumers in first priority, when state of charge (SOC) of battery drops biomass will be brought online to serve the peak load and charge the battery.

Nevertheless, it suffers from higher write energy. According to a given data-access frequencies, the previous studies focus on data allocation technique for utilizing the benefits of both NVM and DRAM. However, data-access frequencies is often obtained with probability, which could not be effectively applied on the previous techniques. To address this issue, this paper proposes a probability-based data allocation strategy for hybrid DRAM/NVM memory in real-time embedded systems. The basic idea is first to obtain the probability-based data-access frequencies of a given embedded program by exploiting its application-specific feature. Combining with the maximum data-access frequencies and the data-access frequency expectations of each data in a given program, this paper proposes a novel and simple data allocation algorithm, named PBDA, to minimize the energy consumption of real-time embedded system. Finally, compared to the Greedy algorithm and an existing optimal data allocation algorithm, the experiments show that our technology can reduce energy consumption by 45.01% and 10.49% on average. © 2018 IEEE.","data allocation; DRAM; hybrid main memory; nonvolatile memories(NVMs); probability; real-time embedded systems","Application programs; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Probability; Real time systems; Data access frequencies; Data allocation; Data allocation algorithms; Greedy algorithms; Hybrid main memory; Nonvolatile memory; Real-time embedded systems; Reduce energy consumption; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063631143

However, the movement of massive amounts of data prevents CNN's from being integrated into low-power IoT devices. The recently proposed binaryweight network (BWN) reduces the complexity of computation and amount of memory access. A conventional digital implementation, which is composed of separate feature/weight memories and a multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit, requires large amounts of data to be moved [3]. To reduce power the weight memory and the computations are integrated together, into an in-memory computation architecture [1, 2, 5]. However, feature data is still stored externally, so data movement has only been partially addressed, especially for BWN. This paper blends feature and partial-weight memory with a computing circuit together, like a sandwich, that achieves significantly less data access (Fig. 24.4.1). It also uses a reconfigurable analog-computation engine, based on pulse-width modulation, that is small and flexible enough to be inserted into the memory. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Analog computers; Energy efficiency; Indium compounds; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pulse width modulation; Random access storage; Voltage control; Analog computation; Computing circuits; Convolutional neural network; Digital implementation; Large amounts of data; Memory computations; Multiply-and-accumulate; Traditional computers; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063483033

The system typically spends most of the time in a low-power sleep state and only briefly wakes up to transmit and receive data. Due to the high Q (>100k) of the crystal resonator the start-up time of a typical crystal oscillator is relatively long (approx 0.5 to 5ms) which causes a substantial amount of energy to be consumed by the crystal oscillator in a transmit/receive event. As the system usually is in an active state when the crystal oscillator ramps up (multiple sub-systems are powered up) not only should the start-up energy of the crystal oscillator be optimized, but also the startup time. As the crystal resonator is one of the most costly components in IoT sensor nodes, a wide range of crystal resonators should be supported by the circuit. This work proposes a synchronized signal injection (SSI) start-up mechanism that can drive the crystal up to any amplitude in a minimum amount of time, does not require a high-precision RC oscillator, is insensitive to PTV and is effective for a wide range of crystals: the technique does not require the shunt capacitance or the load capacitance to be small. A programmable capacitor-bank is included to support a range of crystals (load-capacitance) and allow for the customer to calibrate the frequency but is not required for the SSI technique. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Crystal resonators; Digital storage; Modulators; Resonators; Sensor nodes; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Load capacitance; Low power sensor; Low-power consumption; Low-power sleep state; Shunt capacitance; Signal injection; Start-up mechanism; Crystal oscillators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063441988

However, these resources have a little or no water storage, which require operations over a wide range of water flow conditions throughout the day and the year. As the natural fluctuations of the resources avoid a constant energy exchange, the system needs to be evaluated with different flow rates to be as efficient as possible. Thus, this paper focuses on designing and evaluating the capability of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) working at a variable rotational speed due to coupling with a Propeller Hydraulic Turbine (PHT). The methodology established to reach this design was set up in three steps: First, to define the maximal available energy of the water resource. Second, to calculate the rotational speed range of the PHT. Third, to design a PMSG able to transforms all the variable mechanical energy delivered by the shaft. Finally, with this methodology different magnet's capabilities of the PMSG could be analyzed to better exploit the available hydraulic energy of a variable hydraulic resource. © 2018 IEEE.","Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator; Propeller Hydraulic Turbine; Rotational speed range; Ultra Low Head hydraulic resources; Variable hydraulic resource","Flow of water; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulic turbines; Hydroelectric generators; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Permanent magnets; Propellers; Synchronous generators; Electrical potential; Hydraulic resources; Hydroelectric plant; Mechanical energies; Municipal wastewaters; Natural fluctuations; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Rotational speed; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063860327

The fuel cell and electrolyzer system depends on each other and functionally interrelated. Fuel cell is an electrochemical device which produces electricity without combustion by combining H2 and O2 gas. It's function is to produce electricity and makes plenty of water as a by-product which is recyclable. These water and stored water (e.g., rain water) are used by electrolyzer. It's function is to produce pure hydrogen and oxygen gas cracking water molecules by dint of electricity. H2 gas is stored to keep active fuel cell and fresh O2 gas is released to the environment in order to keep balanced. The frequency control system is dependent on the fluctuating of loads. Whenever the load demand rises high then the fuel cell will be on and when the load demand falls down the fuel cell will be turned off and thus electrolyzing process will be on. The BGG will always keep the frequency of the micro grid balanced. In daytime, solar cells which remain active but in night period, the three energy sources are kept back-to-back. The overall frequency control technique is simulated by using detailed algorithm of solar cells, wind turbine, electrolyzer and hydrogen storage tank. © 2018 IEEE.","fuel cell and Bio gas generator (BGG); Micro grid (MG); Solar energy; Wind Turbine (WT)","Biogas; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolytic cells; Engineering research; Gas generators; Gases; Hydrogen storage; Molecules; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Bio-mass energy; Electrolyzers; Energy source; Horizontal winds; Hydrogen storage tank; Micro-grid systems; Microgrid; Water molecule; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063574508

A simple greedy control policy can achieve the optimal performance. However, this greedy approach cannot be straightforwardly generalized to other types of ToU pricing.

In this study, a simple and robust prototype of the so-called potentiostat, electrochemical instrumental system, with a wireless data acquisition and user control is demonstrated. With a wide range of potential applications, the developed system can be conveniently customizable to detect chemical of interest in food safety, continuous at-home diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and low-power energy storage. The device is comprised of two major units: a modified front-end sensor (Texas Instrument, LMP91000EVM), and a development board (Espressif, ESP32) implementing with a programmable saw tooth waveform to assess cyclic voltammetry (CV), the most common electrochemical measurement with the three-electrode configuration, namely working electrode, reference electrode and auxiliary electrode. In particular, the prototype shows a good agreement of CV in a standard electron transfer experiment by monitoring the interchange state of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ion in ferricyanide solution with potassium chloride supported, in comparison to that of the commercial potentiostat. Furthermore, the effects of different scan rate (0.05 to 0.15 V/s) and different ferricyanide concentrations from 1 to 7.5 millimolar are also evaluated to quantify sensing performance. Based on the obtained results, the calibration curve of anodic peak and cathodic peak current are linearly correlated with R2 of 0.9987 and 0.9990, respectively, providing a cost-effective (less than USD 80) and portable solution to the future integration of sensing technology. © 2019 IEEE.","Biosensor; Electrochemical device; Wireless potentiostat","Biosensors; Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Cost effectiveness; Cyclic voltammetry; Data acquisition; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electrochemical devices; Food storage; Internet of things; Medical applications; Potash; Potassium chloride; Voltage regulators; Biomedical applications; Electrochemical measurements; Environmental Monitoring; Ferricyanide solution; Internet of Things (IOT); Potentiostats; Technological platform; Wireless data acquisitions; Electrochemical electrodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077958768

Off grid renewable energy systems (HRES) are becoming promising alternatives to those regions and can replace conventional power systems such as diesel generators or grid power. They incorporate two or more renewable energy systems which complement each other making the system more efficient and reliable. In addition to the HRES, a battery storage system and a diesel generator (DG) can be added for uninterrupted power supply [2][3] when neither renewable energy power sources can meet the load demand. However, the components of the system must be sized optimally to provide a cost effective and reliable solution. Therefore, a techno-economic analysis comprising of various hybrid configurations is required. In this paper, eleven HRES systems comprising of solar PV, wind turbines, diesel generator and battery storage were designed using HOMER for the electrification of two rural villages in Sub Saharan Africa namely Ncera and Boipuso. Optimization was carried out using HOMER and based on the results, a Solar/Wind/Diesel Generator/ Battery system was selected as the most cost-effective solution for both villages. The optimal system for Ncera consists of a 7.80 kW rated PV system, a 20-kW rated wind turbine, a 50-kW convertor, a 44-kW dw capable of supplying electricity with a LCOE of 0.173/kWh.

This paper examines the economic feasibility of a 100 m3/day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant design in the city of Tripoli - Libya. The paper draws a comparison of using three different types of powering systems: The National Electric Grid (Grid), a Standalone (Off-Grid) Photovoltaic System, and a Grid Connected (On-Grid) Photovoltaic System.ROSA Software was used to determine suitable membrane units for the SWRO plant and the membrane element SW30XLE-440i was chosen based on its low feed pressure requirements of 55.5 bar and 35% recovery with total dissolved solid (TDS) of 133 ppm. The electrical consumption of the plant was 26.2 kW and the specific energy consumption (SEC) was 6.28 kWh/m3. The Cost of product water for the plant powered by the Grid, Off-Grid PV and On-Grid PV were 2.07, 2.82, and 1.21 /m3 respectively at 8% interest rate.The study showed that the use of Grid Connected (On-Grid) photovoltaic system to power a 100 m3/day capacity SWRO plant yielded the lowest levelized cost per cubic meter of produced water. The study also revealed that despite the high cost associated with energy storage in Off-Grid PV systems, the cost of generating electricity from Off-Grid PV systems in high solar insolation regions such as Libya is only marginally higher than that of purchasing electricity from the national electric grid, 0.186 /kWh versus 0.176 /kWh. Due to the nature of operation of the desalination plant, however, 37% of the generated electricity from Off-Grid PV goes unutilized either due to battery charge/discharge cycle losses or as a result of energy overproduction at times of peak irradiance. © 2019 IEEE.","Desalination; Economic Analysis; Photovoltaic; SWRO","Desalination; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Potable water; Reverse osmosis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Water resources; Alternative energy source; Charge/discharge cycle; Drinking water production; Electrical consumption; Photovoltaic; Seawater reverse osmosis; Specific energy consumption; SWRO; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069472709

The study analysis was based on existing infrastructures on which a data monitoring and analysis have been made. The PV system provided 15 kW of energy while the CST was powering a 16-kW double effect absorption chiller. The approached solution was to consider an electrical chiller in addition to an existing absorption chiller which they will provide the needed cooling energy during day and night. The load of the cooling system will be mainly covered by the PV output while the CST technology is principally in storage mode during the day time in order to be used later at night time.

The governing thermal equations concerning the hybrid solar air conditioning system was applied and solved using engineering equation solver (EES) Software. The results showed that the compression ratio of the uncontrolled hybrid solar system is lower than the compression ratio of the conventional one by 5 %, and this ratio could be increased to 28 % when the control system has been used. Also, the minimum value of the power consumption is 830 W at R=0.1 and Tamb =45 °C, while the maximum value is 994 W at R=1 for the same conditions.

Different renewable off-grid systems can be considered depending upon the available renewable resources. However, all of them required energy storage facilities to deal with the unpredictable nature of their outputs power.

This paper looks at the use of an automated heat pump system to decrease a household's electrical energy costs. A heat pump system was built in 2013, and optimized in 2018. The system contains a heat pump, hot water storage tank, measuring instruments and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which is used to switch the heat pump on. The PLC in the system records the data generated by the measuring instruments and uses the data to calculate and predict a coefficient of performance (COP) value for the present and near future. Different methods of calculating the COP were evaluated for implementation in a real-time system. Various methods to predict ambient temperature, water temperature and the energy usage patterns were also investigated given the limitations of a small industrial PLC. An algorithm that uses these calculated COP values and the water usage pattern of the household decides which time of the day would be best to turn on the heat pump to achieve the highest efficiency. By using the new algorithm the electrical energy of the system could be reduced by 51.6% compared to the standard control algorithm of the heat pump itself. © 2019 cape peninsula university of technology.","Ambient temperature; Calculated COP; Geyser temperature; Heat pump system; PLC; Predicted COP; Wet bulb temperature","Coefficient of performance; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Heating; Interactive computer systems; Programmable logic controllers; Pumps; Real time systems; Temperature; Calculated COP; Electrical energy costs; Hot water storage tanks; Measuring instruments; Predicted COP; Programmable logic controllers (PLC); Residential heat pumps; Wet bulb temperature; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068381605

This is caused by the fluctuation in the power output of these renewable energy resources. Particularly, the common fluctuation of PV power output causes a temporal discrepancy between generation and demand which results in frequency variation. However, several researchers have investigated different methods that can be used to regulate the frequency of the network. Some of such methods are the inclusion of super-capacitors and flywheels. Therefore, it has become imperative to consider the frequency of the grid at high PV penetration level. This paper considers a battery storage system to provide frequency regulation service in a grid connected PV system. Hence, a flowchart is presented on how load imbalance, frequency variance, battery state of charge (SOC), and available power can be used to maintain network nominal frequency. A well-defined algorithm for determining how the flow of active power based on set parameter limits is presented. The system consists of a PV, DC-DC boost converter, battery storage system, and DC-AC bi-directional converter. The PV plant and the battery storage system are connected to the grid through a DC-AC converter in a manner that bi-directional flow of active power is achieved.

Such concerns demand an urgent consideration of renewable energy sources as a means of addressing carbon emission challenges. Very limited research studies have been carried out to demonstrate/analyze the techno-economic benefits of battery storage coupled directly to a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation system. However, none of the studies demonstrates the benefit of operating PV-battery based system with a feed-in-tariff (FiT) incentive, especially in South Africa. This paper contributes to the ongoing studies about grid-connected PV-battery based system. It draws attention to the optimal design and sizing by considering techno-economic factors such as net present cost and cost of energy under time-ofuse (TOU) and FiT incentive. The annual real-time load demand data from a typical residential consumer, has been used in this study. The data was acquired using Efergy monitoring system. HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) Pro Version 3.6.1 software is employed to model the energy system. Based on the optimal sizing results, it was found that the annual average electricity production from PV is about 70% (6,514 kWh/year) of the total generation, while the remainder of the necessary power is purchased from the grid. Therefore, the major share of the power is obtained from the PV to meet the load requirement and to keep zero unmet energy by the system. © 2019 cape peninsula university of technology.","Feed-in-Tariffs; HOMER; Solar-photovoltaic; Techno-economic; Time-of-use","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Feed-in tariff; HOMER; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-economics; Time of use; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068360410

In such a situation conventional sources of power may not meet the need. The importance of renewable power sources is considered as the alternative suitable energy sources nowadays. This paper deals with the simulation of the solar power system which is the main source and that has a fuel cell backup power source. Therefore, no charge storage device is interfaced. The proposed method has four major parts: Solar cell as the main supply, fuel cell as a backup source, the control device for switching power from the main source to backup source and vice versa and the final part is a load. The load is energized by the solar energy directly through the control device. When the solar power is insufficient concerning the demand, then the load gets power from the fuel cell through the control device. However, if the solar power becomes sufficient to provide power to the load, the control device changes over the source from fuel to solar cell. The outcome of the simulation shows that the load always gets an uninterrupted power supply. The complete simulation has been accomplished using MATLAB Simulink environment (Math Works, Inc.

Secondly, using Walsh function interpolation theory and generalized Walsh function system theory, a reconstruction method of PSWF pulse based on three-valued Walsh interpolation functions is proposed. Finally, through theoretical analysis and simulation, it is considered that comparing with the reconstructing method based on Walsh function system, using this paper's method can achieve more ideal reconstruction results, although it will pay a small increase in the computational cost. The ideal reconstruction results mainly reflected in: the accuracy of the reconstructed signal is higher, the pulse waveform is relatively smooth, the orthogonality between the reconstructed pulses is more stable, and the frequency domain energy concentration of the reconstructed signal is substantially the same as the original signal. This method provides an effective theoretical reference for the hardware design of PSWF pulse real-time generation. © 2019 IEEE.","Cyclic shift copy theory; PSWF; Three-valued Walsh interpolation functions","Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Frequency domain analysis; Interpolation; Walsh transforms; Wave functions; Analysis and simulation; Cyclic shifts; Energy concentration; Interpolation function; Prolate spheroidal wave functions; PSWF; Real time performance; Reconstruction method; Signal reconstruction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067862752

Modern technology addresses the need of a more competent environmental monitoring through Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of System-on-Chips (SoCs) such as Environmental Sensor Platform. One of the critical components of SoC is a Random Access Memory (RAM) which presents a sizable fraction of power consumption. This makes memory inappropriate for energy-constrained applications such as environmental monitoring. The purpose of this study is the development of low power full-custom 8T SRAM for sensor platforms. Different SRAM topologies were evaluated to identify which among has the lowest power consumption. Verified through simulations, a fully functioning schematic that can read and write data were designed in 90nm CMOS process technology. Layout of each block were created using Synopsys design tools yielding power consumption of 21.0405mW and static noise margin of 520mV achieved by eliminating sense amplifier and pre-charge circuits.

SensorNet is scalable with respect to different types of multi-channel time series data, and does not require expert knowledge for extracting features for each sensor data. Additionally, it can achieve very high detection accuracy for different case studies, and has a very efficient architecture which makes it suitable to be employed at IoT and wearable devices.

Among these types, the copper-halide laser is by far the more commonly used today, due to its much lower discharge tube operating temperature and less stringent driving circuit requirements. A fast, high-voltage pulsed power circuit has been developed for driving copper halide lasers. This circuit utilizes the principle of the resonant charging of a load capacitor from a storage capacitor by means of a charging inductor, a technique which offers a more efficient transfer of energy and a higher output voltage magnitude than resistive charging. In order to operate the laser driving circuit at high-voltage, fast pulse rise time and high-repetition rate requirements, a hydrogen thyratron was employed as a switching device. The circuit is capable of producing output voltage pulses in excess of 10kV, with a rise time and duration of 30ns and 70ns (Full Width at Half Magnitude-FWHM) respectively, and is fully controlled from single shot up to a maximum pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 150Hz. © 2018 IEEE.","Copper halide lasers; pulsed power; resonant charging; thyratron plasma closing switches","Copper compounds; Energy transfer; Pulse repetition rate; Thyratrons; Timing circuits; Closing switches; Copper halide; Full width at half magnitudes; Higher output voltages; Operating temperature; Pulse repetition frequencies; Pulsed-power; Resonant charging; Pulsed lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063079211

Since then, the contribution of coal to the supply has been driven to a very low level. Some of the coal-fired stations have been converted to biomass, using imported wood pellets. Most have been replaced by combined-cycle gas turbine stations that are inherently more efficient and also, using natural gas as the fuel, less carbon intensive than coal. Nuclear makes a stable contribution, and hydropower and pumped storage make small contributions. Wind power has grown, and there were periods when it contributed over 8000MW to the grid - but also periods when it contributed less than 100MW. Latterly solar has entered the supply mix. These moves are tracked using the 5-minute data of Gridwatch, which also allows an assessment of the impact of non-dispatchable power on grid performance. Solar power appears to present particular challenges. The role of interconnections to Europe is also significant in the overall supply picture. These results are discussed in terms of plans to increase the nuclear contribution significantly in the near future, and the implications these findings might have for South Africa's desire to reduce its reliance on coal power for generation of electricity. © 2018 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","Gridwatch; Power grid; UK electricity","Coal; Combined cycle power plants; Combustion; Digital storage; Gas turbines; Solar energy; Wind power; Coal-fired power; Coal-fired stations; Combined cycle gas turbine; Grid performance; Gridwatch; Nuclear contribution; Power grids; Pumped Storage; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062821464

However, power consumption is also gradually becoming one of the important constraints that affects the design and implementation of the system. At present, research on optimization with energy constraints is mainly focused on optimizing the energy of the processors, but the energy consumed by off-chip memory accounts for a large proportion of the total consumed by the whole system. In this research, we investigate the coordinated optimization of the performance of the processors and memory for a heterogeneous system subject to energy constraints. A communication-computation pipeline for parallel programs is constructed to optimize program performance by simultaneously scaling the voltage and frequency of the processors and memory using a task partition strategy.

Traditionally, cloud service instances commonly use shared storage architecture. Nowadays, data and I/O intensive applications are preferred in this big data era and are used in the majority of Internet companies, much more attention has been paid to the local storage that offer perform better in I/O at a lower price compared with shared storage clouds. But these cloud instances usually contain much more data than shared storage cloud instances. Thus, in such local storage based clouds, the migration cost can be really high. Unfortunately, most existing work about did not consider integrating the demand prediction algorithm that plays a significant part in server consolidation, especially for local storage based cloud, where the migration cost is very high and is in badly need of an efficient resource pre-allocation mechanism. To address this issue, we proposes Aricon, a consolidation method based on local storage. Our approach uses a time series model to forecast the CPU or memory utilization of instances within servers. We investigate the effectiveness of instance and server resource utilization prediction in server consolidation performance in workload traces from real world. To validate the performance of the proposed Aricon, we test the prediction accuracy and compare it several existing consolidation method, and the results show that Aricon not only has low prediction error rate in 10.7% but also schedules computing resources efficiently. © 2018 IEEE.","ARIMA; Cloud Computing; Consolidation; Local Storage; Resource Demand Estimation","Cloud computing; Consolidation; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Memory architecture; Allocation mechanism; ARIMA; Consolidation methods; Energy-saving technologies; Prediction error rates; Resource demands; Server consolidation; Time series modeling; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063678134

Various accelerators based on FPGA platform have been proposed because of the high performance and high energy efficiency. However, limited to the on-chip memory resources, only small networks can be accelerated by these accelerators. Due to the fact that 2D convolution operation is the most computing-intensive part, accelerating large-scale 2D convolution operation has become the key to accelerating large-scale CNNs on FPGA platforms. This paper presents a method of rotary data-storage and a design of the new PE (processing unit). Compared to the traditional Z-type PE, it performs non-redundant calculations when the stride of convolution operation is greater than 1, which significantly reduces the calculating time. At the same time, in order to reduce the external memory bandwidth with limited on-chip resources, two optimization architectures and a block-calculation method have been proposed, which can reduce the usage of on-chip memory resources. As a case study, we select some convolution layers of ResNet-34 and compare it with a previous accelerator. Under the condition of same consumption of resources, the result shows that the proposed framework needs only 29.9% time and 51% external memory bandwidth of the previous accelerator. © 2018 IEEE.","Acceleration; Convolution; FPGA; Memory bandwidth","Acceleration; Bandwidth; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image coding; Neural networks; Calculating time; Convolutional neural network; External memory; High energy efficiency; Memory bandwidths; Optimization architecture; Performance frameworks; Processing units; Convolution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063671573

BESS is considered a vital source for microgrid operation. The most important challenge faced by the DC microgrid is the growth of fault current and consequently the rising rate. Because of the BESS has larger fault current contribution, fast detecting and isolating for the faults at BESS are required. The developed protection scheme is based on local measurements without the need for communication channel. Consequently, the relay operation is enhanced from avoiding the delay and any failure can be occurred in the communication media. For an accurate and fast protection scheme, the current derivative at BESS is analytically derived. During high impedance faults, the current derivative can fail in fault detection. So, the relay sensitivity is improved by taking the voltage derivative as a complementary feature for fault detection and discrimination in such critical cases.

The storage can assist in the demand side management as well as to reduce the electricity bill of the consumers. In this case, consumers would purchase electricity during off-peak pricing periods to charge the batteries, and during peak pricing periods, the energy stored would be used to supply the demand or sold back to the grid. Therefore, the two objectives are to minimize the cost of energy drawn from the utility, while maximizing the energy injected under the Time-of-Use and Feed-in-Tariff schemes. Thereafter, the performance of the developed model to maximize the proposed grid-interactive system's economic profitability is analysed through a case study which is simulated using Matlab.

While sliding shoes may offer a method for harvesting energy during gait, it is important to know their influence on the expected energy harvesting rate and metabolic cost rate. In this paper, we develop two multivariate linear regression models based on subject height, weight, and walking speed to predict energy harvesting rate and metabolic cost rate for walking with custom energy harvesting sliding shoes. Eight healthy subjects performed 200 meter overground walking trials at normal and fast speeds while wearing the custom sliding shoes to harvest energy and a portable gas analysis system to measure metabolic cost. The metabolic cost rate model performed well with only 6.9% error, while the energy harvesting rate model was less accurate with 29.9% error. Future research should focus on improving the models by adding additional features such as step frequency, speed of sliding and length of sliding to capture more of the variance. These findings could help to serve as a foundation to facilitate widespread adoption of wearable devices by reducing the required amount of onboard energy storage. © 2018 IEEE.","machine learning; metabolic cost; wearable systems","Cost benefit analysis; Energy harvesting; Learning systems; Metabolism; Regression analysis; Wearable technology; Harvesting energies; Healthy subjects; Metabolic cost; Modeling and predictions; Multivariate linear regression model; On-board energy storage; Potential power sources; Wearable systems; Digital signal processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062800849

In addition, the scenario of EI is presumed to be disconnected with the main grid. We formulate a generalized connection topology for the considered EI scenario. Each MG is assumed to be composed of a combination of distributed wind turbine generators (WTGs), photovoltaic (PV) units, micro-turbines (MTs), fuel cells (FCs), battery energy storage (BES) devices and local loads. Then we formulate the dynamics of the above components as a class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with parameter uncertainty and time-varying delay in the state. To alleviate frequency fluctuation in each individual MG, the coordinated frequency control problem is formulated as problems of robust stabilization and robust H∞ control.

Electric tricycles have become a revolution in the mass transportation system in the country. Not only have they reduced the transport cost but also, they have created jobs and developed local automobile industries with no carbon emission and air pollution. The battery bank used by these tricycles gets energised from the utility grid. The conventional chargers that use iron core transformer have efficiency lower than 80%. These inefficient chargers consume huge power from national. A partially solar powered electric tricycle can really help in mitigating the pressure on grid and at the same time be a green transporting solution for the country.

With limited parking area on the ground, vertical parking system become one of the solutions to increase parking capacity within the same space as the conventional parking space. The proposed vertical parking in this research was focused on rotary parking since it requires the most minimum space of ground area. Furthermore, to reduce the high of the vertical parking, installing the vertical parking deep down into the underground has been another solution for increasing parking capacity. The parking system designed on this paper was installing the rotary parking semi underground which means the upper half of the rotary parking is still above the ground while the lower half of the rotary parking is buried under the ground level. The proposed parking lot was equipped with an energy storage system, power backup generator, intelligent control, and renewable energy source. Aside from the cost aspect in constructing this underground structure, this paper considers the energy saving scenarios which can be performed in this semi underground rotary parking system. Energy saving on this semi underground parking lot was facilitated using a smart inverter energy management system which was implanted with energy saving algorithm, intelligent control, spike absorber technique, and parking lots integration. The algorithm was calculating the intrusion from external factor, integrate it with internal sensor, and real time monitoring system. The result was shown to have 30 to 40 % energy saving which can be increased depend on certain parking structure and environment. It was concluded that additional equipment in semi underground rotary parking need a certain manner and algorithm so the parking operator could have a proper level of energy saving. © 2018 IEEE.","energy saving; intelligent control; rotary parking; semi underground; smart inverter","Energy conservation; Energy management; Intelligent control; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Underground equipment; Underground structures; Additional equipment; Commercial building; Energy storage systems; Real time monitoring system; Renewable energy source; semi underground; Smart inverters; Underground parking lots; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062626647

This study reveal that the concept is viable when the demanded power is low and reduce the costs by omitting the requirement of a battery backup and a diesel generator.

Reasonable capacity design can improve system reliability and reduce economic costs. On the basis of establishing a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) DC microgrid system, a mathematical model of each unit is established. The annualized cost, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and excess electricity ratio (EER) are the optimization targets. The PV rated capacity, diesel generator rated capacity, battery capacity, supercapacitor capacity and PV tilt angle are optimized variables. The goal is establishing the system's optimal capacity design model in order to increase the system's renewable energy penetration ratio (REPR) as much as possible. First, sensitivity analysis is performed on each target to determine the intrinsic connection between them. This gives the ideal value for each target. The multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem by the weighted average method, and the optimal solution is obtained by a genetic algorithm. The integrity of the design results can be demonstrated by the power balance of the system and the capacity change trends of the energy storage components. This shows that the system can maintain power balance and provide correct guidance for stand-alone DC microgrid capacity design. © 2018 IEEE.","capacity optimal design; multi-objective optimization; PV DC microgrid; sensitivity analysis","Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Dc micro-grid; Energy storage components; Loss of power supply probability; Multi-objective problem; Optimal design; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Weighted average method; Sensitivity analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062528437

Four houses were chosen to represent different socioeconomic groups (one large villa-high income, two mid-size villas-middle class, and one low-income family) and their electricity consumption were recorded at every five minutes with non-intrusive energy monitors for a twelve month period from July 2017 to June 2018. Moreover, to estimate solar energy production, global horizontal index (GHI) values were obtained from the solar test facility located in Qatar. Energy storage size is calculated based on average reverse energy flow. The results show that due to the cooling load, residential electricity consumptions is quite high for the large building and no storage is needed. On the other hand, in medium-size buildings storage could be used in winter months when the local consumption is low. Finally, for the low-income family due to low electricity consumption, storage units can be used for twelve months.

Yet, in the coming years, the network is expected to accommodate more of these and other technologies of 'clean' power productions. The deployment and efficient utilization of various flexibility options are certainly required in a system experiencing such levels of dynamic changes so as to ensure a standard level of service provision in terms of security, stability and reliability. Among these is a battery energy storage system (BESS), which is emerging as one of the most viable and effective options of increasing the much-needed flexibility in power systems. This work aims to assess the impact of deploying BESSs on the operational performance of the Portuguese transmission grid, mainly in terms operational flexibility and variable RES power support. In particular, the potential benefits of strategically placed BESSs are investigated using a stochastic optimization framework. Numerical results show that integrating BESSs leads to a more efficient use of renewable power by considerably minimizing curtailments, and a 10% reduction in system-wide cost. Energy losses are moderately increased as a result of the BESS deployment. But this is offset by the savings in operation and emission costs. © 2018 IEEE.","Battery energy storage systems; renewable energy sources; stochastic MILP.; transmission grid operation","Energy dissipation; Integer programming; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage systems; Operational performance; Renewable energy source; Stability and reliabilities; stochastic MILP; Stochastic optimizations; Transmission grids; Variable renewable energies; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062512184

Grid disturbances are the most known challenges of microgrid control, which may lead to destabilize the DER behavior, and can produce a discontinuity in power generation. In this paper, neural network based controllers for an alternative current (AC) microgrid composed of WP, SP, BB, and load demand (LD) connected to utility grid are studied. A neural sliding mode linearization (N-SM-L) controller controls the powers injected to utility grid through the power electronic converter controller of each DER. By using a recurrent high order neural networks (RHONN) identifier, wich is trained with an extended kalman filter (EKF) online, an adequate model is obtained under different grid conditions, which helps to reject the disturbances, ensuring stability, and improving robustness.

In these robots, series elastic actuator (SEA) is widely used due to its compliant property and energy storage capacity. However, robots that are equipped with SEA have drawbacks of substantial delay and limited bandwidth. Additionally, high speed locomotion also engenders severe vibration and cause noise pollution in posture measurement of the robot. These inevitable features make the efficient robots hard to demonstrate precise control and perform dynamic balance. To cope with these problems, beside traditional hopping and foot hold selection algorithms, two methods are proposed in this paper for consecutive hopping: (l)a position controller which generates active damping to stabilize the joint position;(2)a learning algorithm for body balance control. The learning algorithm discretizes the continuous control problem into phases and adopts integration form of body dynamics to maintain balance. Instead of empirically tuning the control parameters, model identification and learning algorithms are employed to automatically tune these proposed controllers. Experiments were conducted on SEA based single leg robot by swinging leg between two demanded position and maintaining body balance during consecutive hopping. By combining the proposed algorithms, stable and efficient hopping was implemented. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Actuators; Anthropomorphic robots; Controllers; Noise pollution; Control parameters; Efficient locomotion; Energy storage capacity; Model identification; Position controller; Posture measurement; Selection algorithm; Series elastic actuators; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062273483

However, vehicle speed prediction is influenced by various factors such as driver's habits, traffic conditions, weather conditions and route geographical features. Therefore, it's difficult to accurately predict speed profile for a specific route. In this paper, two prediction models based on neural networks are established from two perspectives. One is Time-Based Neural Networks Model (TBNNM) and the other is Distance-Based Neural Networks Model (DBNNM).

Because of the unstable and intermittent nature of PV power generation, it is normally considered as a risk to incorporate PV powers into the main grid. One solution is to predict the output of PV station in advance and adjust the output of energy storage resource accordingly. This paper proposes a method to realize one-day ahead forecast of PV power output based on weather classification and Deep Belief network (DBN). Firstly, different weather conditions are clustered into four weather types based on the average values of historical PV power outputs and K-means clustering algorithm. Then all historical PV output data of the station are divided into four groups according to the weather type. Different DBN models are built for each of the four weather types. The inputs of each DBN models are historical PV power output value of the similar day about forecasting day and the meteorological value of the forecasting day. Experimental results with a Baoding PV station prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep belief network (DBN); Forecast; K-means; Photovoltaic power output; weather classification","Digital storage; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Photovoltaic cells; Thermoelectric power; Deep belief network (DBN); Deep belief networks; K-means; Photovoltaic panels; Photovoltaic power; PV power generation; Storage resources; Weather classification; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062773917

It is increased applications in food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. However, potential applications are limited by its instability owing to hydrolytic rancidity. In this study, rice bran obtained from Klong Yong Rice Mill was stabilized with the natural organic acid mixture and a novel extraction technique. It was conducted to find the suitable ratio of rice bran (RB) with natural organic acids (vinegar and lime juice) for stabilization and to compare the conventional and microwave extraction method in controlling the lipase activity and retrieved the highest protein content. The response surface methodology as Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was used to optimize free fatty acid and protein contents from stabilized rice bran (SRB) using microwave extraction. The minimum value of free fatty acid was 1.93% free fatty acid as oleic acid for 30-days storage with the optimum conditions of microwave extraction as follows: 2 min, rice bran was treated with 48.49ml of natural organic acids mixture with the ratio of solid to 95%EtOH as 1:4 wt./lvol. at energy 750 W.

Traditional high stiffness system can ensure precise positioning of actuators, and accomplish repetitive tasks efficiently. Nevertheless, it has great hardness and is easy to cause impact, which seriously affects the stability of robot while walking and jumping. The previous approach to solve this problem adopt variable impedance actuators. They can absorb impact shock and store energy but typically have a very low intrinsic damping for efficient energy storage and retrieval. This paper introduces a novel MR-based damper that can change intrinsic damping by adjusting the current in the coil.

Today, the smart grid concept involves many subjects from the efficient use of electrical energy resources to the planned and programmed consumption of energy, from the integration of distributed renewable energy sources into the system to the domestic productive consumers (prosumers), which are much related to local or regional development. Smart grid concept, which emerges a product of interdisciplinary studies ranging to many fields of engineering such as power systems, control, artificial intelligence and communication, can be briefly viewed as a development process towards the internet of energy. Especially in recent years, the decrease in reserves of fossil-fueled energy sources has led researchers to find out new energy sources, more efficient and ecological production and distribution methods. In these studies, the energy sources, which are renewable, sustainable, and economical have become major priorities due to reducing carbon emissions. However, the scope of smart grid studies has been continuously enriched and it has begun to include the fundamental components of production-centered sustainable development models, which are the providing of low-cost production supplies, continuity of these supplies, efficiency in production and consumption, generation based on renewable or recyclable resources, and applications of ecological generation and consumption methods. In this context, the positive effects of smart grids on the regional development are expected to occur in the following topics: Smart city applications, intelligent transportation, renewable and local energy generation, smart homes and building concepts, energy efficient cities, control of carbon footprint, automated electricity, gas, water and waste networks, loss and leakage control, application of demand side energy management system to reduce power consumption, self-healing electricity distribution, smart energy pricing, smart energy storage are some emergent topics that can contribute to sustainable regional development models. Because, modern grid components developed within the scope of smart grid are expected to support sustainable production models via smart energy management and increasing efficiency, reducing the energy costs, improving energy continuity. In this study, a projection for possible contributions of smart grid concept with its continuously expanding scope to the sustainable regional development is discussed under several major headings. © 2018 IEEE.","Intelligent transportation; regional development; renewable energy; smart cities; smart grid; urban planning","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Carbon footprint; Costs; Data handling; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power system control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Environmental impact; Intelligent buildings; Proven reserves; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Waste management; Demand side energy managements; Electrical energy resources; Intelligent transportation; Inter-disciplinary studies; Regional development; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Sustainable regional development; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062540756

A ball screw is a linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion or vice versa. Monitoring ball screws in a timely manner is important to ensure availability of machines and therefore productivity. The method is developed in a data-driven approach by analyzing annotated measurement data of different ball screws from different manufacturers and identifying the significant differences between good and worn ball screws. This produces three meaningful indicators for wear, related to failure modes. One of the indicators is obtained via vibration analysis. Signals from an accelerometer are transformed to frequency space by fast Fourier transformation, and certain frequency bands are observed for abnormalities like a permanently increased spectral energy. Another indicator is obtained by observing the temperature of the spindle, which is affected by higher internal friction due to the damage. Increased friction also affects efficiency of a ball screw. Hence, the engine that drives a ball screw has to deliver more power to produce the same output power. Each of these three indicators delivers a characteristic value related to the fault state of a ball screw. Long term test measurements at different ball screws show the capability of the method. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Cybernetics; Digital storage; Fasteners; Friction; Linear actuators; Vibration analysis; Wear of materials; Characteristic value; Data-driven approach; Fast Fourier transformations; Frequency spaces; Long term tests; Measurement data; Rotational motion; Spectral energy; Ball screws",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062214605

A wide range of power converters are used either buck converter, boost converter, buck boost converter, ZETA converter, CUK converter and so on. The technology development is done to produce the battery charger as efficiently as possible. However, the use of these converters can only be used for battery charging only while for load sharing still requires a converter again so that the resulting voltage is constant. In addition some converters still generate losses on the switching process. Bidirectional DC-DC Converter is an appropriate topology to be used as battery charging and load sharing converter with automatic switching using automatic switch. To improve efficiency, Bidirectional DC-DC Converter uses an interleaved topology that connects in parallel two similar topologies. In addition to avoiding the occurrence of spikes during switching then this converter also uses ZVRC circuit (Zero Voltage Resonant Circuit) M-Type. Voltage source used is supply from PLN that is equal to 220 VAC-50 Hz. The voltage is lowered and rectified using a transformer and also a rectifier to 24 VDC then down again using interleaved buck mode. The magnitude of the battery input voltage will be adjusted based on the SOC (State Of Charge) battery used. The output voltage to supply the BES (Battery Emergency Supply) load is 24 VDC and obtained from the interleaved boost mode output. © 2018 IEEE.","Bidirectonal DC-DC converter; Interleaved Topology; Zero Voltage Resonant Circuit","Charging (batteries); Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Resonant circuits; Secondary batteries; Timing circuits; Topology; Appropriate topology; Automatic switching; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Buck boost converter; Design and implementations; Interleaved boost; Technology development; Zero voltage; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062080141

Among the most used metaheuristic, we used the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), considering the Loss of Load Probability (LLP), Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) criteria and the system cost indicator. The suggested method determines the system optimum configuration, which can achieve the desired LLP and LPSP with minimum cost. To reach this aim, an objective function is formulated for the system cost. It must be kept to a minimum while respecting the reliability constraint. The effectiveness of the PSO in solving a hybrid system optimization problem is scrutinized and its performance is analyzed.

In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, relays in the considered network have no embedded energy supply, they need to rely on the energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the source for their cooperative NOMA transmission. Based on this structure, a new relay selection scheme is proposed, considering both channel state information (CSI) and battery status of relays. Assuming each relay has infinite energy storage for accumulating energy, we use the infinite Markov chain to capture the evolution of relay batteries. The approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the proposed scheme are derived therefrom. All theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.

A good grounding grid status is related to the stable operation of the power system. Therefore, when a corrosion problem occurs in the grounding grid, the grounding resistance will increase, and the discharge of electrical energy will become unsmooth. This may lead to spark discharge between devices. What's worse, it may lead to device damage, resulting in a large area. Finally, it may affect the safe and stable operation of the power system. In grounding grid corrosion diagnosis, fault parameter identification method is one of the commonly used methods. By measuring the port resistance and performing inverse calculation to obtain the branch resistance change value, it also be-longs to fault parameter identification method. When measuring port resistance for ground grid corrosion diagnosis, since the digital DC bridge wire is not long enough, auxiliary wires need to be added between the digital DC bridge wire port and the down conductor steel. The contact resistance between the auxiliary wire and the down conductor steel will greatly affect the measured value of the port resistance, resulting in inaccurate inversion of the ground grid branch resistance. Therefore, in this paper, the influence of contact resistance on the corrosion diagnosis of grounding grid is studied by taking the grounding grid of the oil storage area as an example. The influence of the contact resistance on the inverse calculation is analyzed. The suppression method of the influence of the contact resistance in the corrosion diagnosis is also put forward and verified by the field test. © 2018 IEEE.","Contact resistance; Corrosion diagnosis; Grounding grid; Inverse calculation; Suppressing method","Bridge cables; Contact resistance; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Inverse problems; Parameter estimation; Steel corrosion; Corrosion diagnosis; Corrosion problems; Electrical energy; Grounding grids; Grounding resistance; Inverse calculation; Suppressing methods; Suppression method; Electric grounding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062076658

The BESS is connected with Voltage Source Converter (VSC) for active and reactive power sharing in grid-connected mode. Two control scheme algorithms are presented. Firstly, inner current control loop and secondly outer active/reactive power (PQ) control loop is presented. Also the charging and discharging control of BESS is designed to maintain the SOC. In islanded-mode, Power-frequency (P-f) control of BESS is proposed to maintain the frequency of MG and supply power to the load. P-f control provides reference power for PQ control. BESS provide primary frequency control to MG; however, the low power capacity of BESS demands for a backup. Diesel generator provides a backup frequency control in islanded-mode, supply active/reactive power to loads and charge the BESS. The control is designed in dq reference frame.

However, its high penetration reshapes the system's power flow and causes high fluctuations in voltages and frequency. To overcome the uncertainty and variability issues faced by the solar systems, storage plays a vital role. In this paper, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are used as a Demand Side Management (DSM) tool to mitigate the solar fluctuations. The behaviour of EV's battery to act as a load/source is controlled by three parameters; State of Charge (SoC), output power from PV and system's voltage. Different scenarios have been analysed on a 2MW distributed solar generation system integrated with an IEEE-33 bus radial network using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the over/under voltage conditions are mitigated and excess energy generated is utilized effectively by using EVs as a DSM tool. © 2018 IEEE.","demand side management; Electric vehicles; medium voltage distribution network; smart loads; solar generation","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Demand side management; Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; MATLAB; Solar power generation; Voltage distribution measurement; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Medium-voltage distribution networks; Power system networks; Smart loads; Solar generation; Three parameters; Uncertainty and variability; Voltage conditions; Electric load distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061911764

The system consists of four sources of energy: the unreliable utility supply of Electricité du Liban (EDL), a diesel generator, PV solar panels, and a battery bank for energy storage. System operation is simulated over one year using SSDP to deduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for a given set of source sizes. The OO approach offers an efficient methodology to evaluate alternative designs in order to select the best source sizes that minimize the LCOE of the system. As per OO theory, order is more robust than value, and thus the alternative designs will first be evaluated using a 'simple model' that simulates system operation using SSDP over two typical winter and summer weeks to save computational time. The alternative designs are then sorted in an ascending order based on an estimated LCOE and the top-S designs are selected. Then the top-S designs are evaluated using an 'accurate model' simulating system operation over a year, and the 'optimum' design is identified with a high alignment probability. The model is tested to determine an 'optimum' design of a hybrid power system for Qaraoun village, in the West Beqaa, given data on power consumption trends, available space and solar radiation. © 2018 IEEE.","EDL; Hybrid Power System; OO; Optimization; Renewable Energy; SSDP","Computation theory; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric energy storage; Optimization; Alternative designs; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Levelized cost of electricities; Optimization methodology; Ordinal optimization; Renewable energies; SSDP; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061655610

Currently, the main data storage technology is still magnetic recording, which needs to maintain a high density growth rate for exponentially increased data volume. The conventional ways to keep a high density growth rate is realized by scaling down both the grain size and the number of grains per bit. However this is limited by the superparamagnetic effect [1]. To solve this issue, the recording media should have increasingly higher anisotropy energy that in turn demands stronger head fields in order to write desired information into recording media. While the strongest writing field is limited by the available materials, being about 2.4 Tesla. New configurations of magnetic recording have to be implemented to enhance the write-ability. Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) and Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) are the two main technologies that were put forward to enhance the write-ability [2], [3]. At this moment, HAMR is mainly pursued by Seagate Technology, while Western Digital works on MAMR. It is believe that the MAMR has similar recording potential as HAMR. Furthermore, MAMR consumes less energy (no or negligible heating), and is easier to integrate with the current recording system with slightly modifications on the head [4], [5]. The centre part of MAMR is the use of spin torque oscillator (STO) for the generation of localized ac magnetic field in the microwave frequency regime of 20-40 GHz for effectively assisted writing on high anisotropy recording media [6]. Therefore the development of STO is one of the key enabling technologies that take MAMR drives to the market. However, the close proximity of STO to the writing head, together with ultralow flying height of 2-3 nm, puts STO in a very complex magnetic environment, which inevitably disturbs the STO behavior, leading to its instability. This is one of the key concerns for MAMR to take off. In this paper, we will present the materials selection, layer stack and geometry optimization for STO to enhance its stability against stray field for microwave assisted magnetic recording. Our recent experimental work on STO materials will be presented as well. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Anisotropy; Digital storage; Magnetic recording; Magnetism; Microwave oscillators; Data storage technology; Heat-assisted magnetic recording; Microwave assisted magnetic recordings; Microwave assisted magnetic recordings (MAMR); Spin-torque oscillator (STO); Spin-torque oscillators; Superparamagnetic effect; Ultra-low flying height; Magnetic storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061842697

A group of students in Tsinghua University founded a charitable project called 'Dream Grid' in 2014, aiming at building power systems that meet basic electricity demand of schools in remote areas. The project has been running for 4 years so far, attracting more than 80 students to participate in. More than 150,000 dollars has been raised by sponsorships and crowdfunding to support the construction of 60kW photovoltaic micro grids in 5 different areas. This paper takes one of these projects in Zamthang, Sichuan Province, China, as an example, and explores the design process of a hybrid solar-hydro microgrid for a rural primary school isolated from the national grid. Zongke Village Primary School, the electricity of which is usually supplied by small-capacity hydropower, is one of the largest village school in Zamthang County and has more than 100 students. However, the small capacity and lack of stability of hydropower makes it difficult to solve the electricity supply problem there. The power system design hopes to meet the basic daily teaching loads mainly with a solar system and the lighting demands at night by introducing a battery storage system. The original hydropower and one additional gasoline generator are considered as backup power when PV output is low and energy storage system cannot cover all loads. The size of solar panel and battery storage system is based on the load and insolation analysis. The power system operation is controlled by an energy storage bidirectional converter, which could dynamically adjust the energy distribution based on solar outputs and load power. The design plan which is composed of 10.5kW solar panels, 39kWh battery bank, 5kW gasoline generator and 20kW converter, is actually applied to the project in Zongke, and the entire system has been running for 12 months and produced more than 13MWh electricity so far. Economic analysis is also carried out in this paper, which shows that PV panels, batteries and converter makes up the most of total costs, and the system would yield a cost of 0.296/kWh over the 10-year lifespan. In addition, by providing electricity for the lighting of neighboring households at night and charging an appropriate fee, the cost of power generation at the school can be further reduced by approximately 0.042/kWh. © 2018 IEEE.","China; Dream Grid; hybrid solar-hydro microgrid; village school","Cost benefit analysis; Design; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Gasoline; Hydroelectric generators; Hydroelectric power; Lighting; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Secondary batteries; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Students; Battery storage system; Bidirectional converter (BDC); China; Dream Grid; Energy storage systems; Micro grid; Power system operations; village school; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061791457

As load clusters and local operators, CIESs are modeled based on conventional heat exchange stations and distribution substations for adaption to existing central heating system. Besides, extra peak shaving equipment such as electric boilers and energy storage is applied to CIESs.

Therefore, it is urgent to carry out evaluation and analysis on the subareal independent power supply capacity (SIPSC) of a SDN. This study proposes a minimum bending distance (MBD)-based evaluation method to achieve a quantitative assessment of SIPSC of multiple subareas in a SDN. It converts the evaluation of SIPSC into the calculation of the MBD between two samples. Accordingly, it can scientifically and reasonably evaluate the SIPSC by using the spatial distance metrics and sequential pattern recognition. Firstly, the evaluation index system is constructed by analyzing the influencing factors of SIPSC, including the capacities and control modes of the DGs and energy storage systems (ESSs). The corresponding weights are assigned to the indicators by improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP). The MBD-based algorithm is then used to measure the similarity between the standard sample and the unevaluated sample. Finally, the scoring function (SF) is established to quantitative evaluation results. The proposed method quantifies the SIPSC under the condition of certain safety criteria while considering characteristics of DG and distributed ESS units. The reliability and applicability of the method are verified by representative simulation cases. © 2018 IEEE.","Minimum bending distance; Scoring function; Smart distribution network; Subareal independent power station capacity","Belt drives; Pattern recognition; Distributed generations (DGs); Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Minimum bending distance; Power station; Power supply capabilities; Quantitative assessments; Scoring functions; Smart distribution networks; Function evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061751085

The incorporating of the active DC distribution network into AC grid has added complexity into the optimal power flow problem, yet the intermittence of PV output and the randomness of electric vehicles loads lead to a significant increase in the uncertainty and complexity of AC-DC hybrid power system. At present, the study of optimal power flow (OPF) for AC/DC systems containing DC distribution network is still in its infancy and none of them have taken the uncertainties of PV power generation and EV loads into account. This paper firstly establishes the DC grid connected power function for photovoltaic power and electric vehicles by Monte Carlo simulation; secondly the power functions are used to build a probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) model for an AC/DC hybrid distribution network case consisting of voltage source converters (VSC), DC distribution network and traditional AC network. At last the three-point estimation method (3PEM) using the center distance information of random variables is applied based on existing deterministic optimal power flow algorithm in order to realize the POPF calculation. The results show that the mathematical model and 3PEM used in this paper can take the uncertainties of photovoltaic power generation and electric vehicle load into consideration effectively on the basis of traditional static power flow optimization and the results obtained are of high accuracy and low computational burden. The obtained POPF results reflect more actual operation status of the power grid than static optimal power flow results so it could be used as the planning and operation theoretical basis of AC/DC hybrid distribution network and it could be a useful reference for the further development of electric vehicles. © 2018 IEEE.","AC/DC distribution network; electric vehicles; point estimation method; probabilistic optimal power flow","Acoustic generators; Complex networks; Electric load flow; Electric losses; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Estimation; Hybrid vehicles; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Probability distributions; Rectifying circuits; Solar energy; Electric vehicle charging; Optimal power flow problem; Photovoltaic power generation; Photovoltaic power stations; Point estimation method; Probabilistic optimal power flow (P-OPF); Probabilistic optimal power flows; Uncertainty and complexity; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061746740

To cope with the uncertainty of wind power construction, this paper proposed a coordinated flexible planning method based on the bi-level optimization model. A probabilistic method is used to analyze uncertainty of wind power. Considering variable flexible resources from generation, grid, demand side and energy storage, a bi-level optimization model is built for planning, with the upper layer making investment decisions considering both wind accommodation benefit and economic cost and lower layer simulating operation status in detail and maximizing flexibility supply. A maximum net benefit/increment ratio method is used to solve the model, basing on the unified evaluation indicator of different flexible resources. Case study shows that the bi-level model and the planning method can take wind power construction uncertainty into consideration and obtain an economic and credible planning result, thus achieving efficient accommodation of renewable energy. © 2018 IEEE.","bi-level model; coordinated planning; flexible resource; uncertainty; wind power construction","Investments; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Bi-level models; Bi-level optimization models; Coordinated planning; Evaluation indicators; Flexible resources; Investment decisions; Probabilistic methods; uncertainty; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061738512

They all are mainly PI-based controllers and have been proved to provide stable and controllable power to the output. These inverters are known as Synthetic inverters because they provide synthetic inertia to the power system. The main problem arising from implementing the Synthetic inverters is that the renewables cannot always work on MPPT, some power must be reserved that can provide inertia to the system. In many ways, this residual power is wasted during the low demand, which means that cost of electricity would be increased. A new research has been carried out on BESS to provide the synthetic inertia. BESS can emulate the internal response just like conventional power plants (CPP) as well as synthetic inverters.

On the other hand, some conventional units are replaced by new energy units, which lead to the decline in peak load regulation ability. In order to make full use of the water storage capacity of hydropower to improve system's peak load regulation ability, this paper proposes a method of optimizing the day-ahead generation scheduling based on the coordinated operation of new energy and hydropower. This method comprehensively considers the constraints of hydro-plants generation constraints, power balance, unit output, new energy output prediction, and can prepare unit combinations and output plans. In the objective function, new energy accommodation is given greater weight. This will implicitly achieve the goal of the first priority of accommodating new energy and the second priority of accommodating hydropower, which can reduce the start-stopping of thermal power units and is particularly suitable for power systems with high start-up costs and high operating costs of thermal power units. The example results show that the method can make full use of hydropower and new energy to regulate peak load, which can not only promote accommodation of new energy and guarantee the safety of power safety, but also ensure the stability of thermal power plants operation and increase the economic efficiency of power system. © 2018 IEEE.","cooperate in harmony; hydro power; new energy; regulating peak load","Fossil fuel power plants; Hydroelectric power; Operating costs; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Thermoelectric power plants; cooperate in harmony; Coordinated operation; Generation scheduling; Hydro power; New energies; Peak load; Peak load regulations; Water storage capacity; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061719862

If the day ahead prediction is far from accuracy, the real time dispatch may fail. To improve it, this paper proposes a multi-time scale coordinated real time dispatch model of CCHP-based microgrids. The proposed model is conducted based on the boundary information offered by a rolling schedule with a larger time resolution. To mitigate the influence of the cumulative prediction error, a feedback model is also integrated into the model. The main advantage of this model is that the state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage systems (ESSs) can be tightly controlled while the total cost can also be reduced. The real time dispatch model is converted into a mixed integer second order core programming (MISOCP) problem, which could be solved by mature algorithm.

To solve this problem, a coordinated control method based on the main power supply and other distributed generators (DGs) is designed in this paper. Firstly, an AC/DC hybrid microgrid model with PV, PMSG, an energy storage system (ESS) and micro gas turbine (MT) is established; according to the characteristics of the different DGs, the control strategies, such as MPPT control and PQ control, are adopted. Secondly, the application of virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control in the MT and ESS is studied. A seamless switching strategy for the MT and ESS is proposed in view of the potential power outage when the MT is out of operation. In addition, the phase angle seamless switching method and a switching time sequence are designed. Finally, verification of the simulation is carried out using Matlab/Simulink.

However, the reactive power and voltage control is a big challenge to the islanded micro-grid, due to the small capacity of the master source or lack of a diesel generator with a large load fluctuation. In the interest of more economical and flexible adapting to various operation modes in an islanded micro-grid with renewable sources, it is necessary to utilize the reactive power potential of existing DGs as much as possible. In this paper, a comprehensive index for evaluating the reactive power and voltage control capability of DGs is proposed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The comprehensive index is determined by five subindices, including Voltage Deviation, Voltage Fluctuation, Voltage Harmonics, Static Reactive Power Support Capability, and Transient Reactive Power Support Capability. The proposed indices are utilized to evaluate the reactive power and voltage control capability of islanded micro-grids with various combinations of DGs such as wind turbine, photovoltaic and energy storage, while the difference between master-slave control and peer-to-peer control is mainly analyzed in this way.

The On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC), as the only movable part in power transformer, plays an important role in the stable operation of the transformer and even the whole power system. At present, the fault diagnosis of the OLTC based on the vibration signal has become the focus of scholars. In this paper, the vibration signals of the OLTC including good condition, tap loosening, tap abrasion and insufficient energy-storage are obtained by simulating experiment. Meanwhile, in order to characterize OLTCs in different conditions, a characteristic parameter Marginal Phase Space Distribution Coefficient (MPPDC) is proposed based on phase space reconstruction technology. Furthermore, based on MPPDC and fuzzy set, a fault diagnosis strategy of OLTC is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that based on the method proposed in this paper, the fault types of the OLTC can be effectively identified, which provides the theoretical basis for the on-line monitoring technology of OLTC. © 2018 IEEE.","Fault diagnostics; Marginal Phase Point Distribution Coefficient (MPPDC); On-load tap changer (OLTC); Phase space reconstruction; Vibration signal","Electric fault currents; Electric power systems; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Phase space methods; Power transformers; Distribution coefficient; Fault diagnostics; On-load tap changers; Phase space reconstruction; Vibration signal; Voltage control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061692874

In this paper, based on the system of distribution network, variable load and energy storage device, a collaborative optimization strategy of network-load-storage system considering the response mechanism of price is proposed. The strategy takes fully into account the time shift capacity of energy storage devices for power and energy as well as the physical characteristics of the complementary electrical and thermal systems. The agent system and the electricity price mechanism are introduced to construct the coordination and optimization framework. The framework includes the distribution network agent (DNA), the source-load agent (SOLA), the storage-load agent (STLA) and the target function of the minimum operating cost of the agent. Under the energy balance constraint, the unit operation constraint and the energy storage constraint of the agent, the function is solved by golden section method and the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm.

The CHs upload data to nearby UAV, which help to save network energy while expanding network coverage. Secondly, the broadcast mode of the Ring Broadcast message can effectively guide search direction of the sensor node routing. Meanwhile the inner-collection nodes select the optimal next-hop node by the fitness function, which helps to balance the energy consumption of each node and search optimal path.

However, the presence of oftentimes sizable Carbon Dioxide contents in the gas reservoir (can be up to 80% volumetric) introduced a huge technical and economic challenges towards the field exploitation. Over the last few years, several studies have been conducted on cryogenic technologies such as cryogenic distillation and supersonic nozzle in CO2 separation for fields containing more than 40% of CO2. Based on the studies, these new cryogenic technologies have shown to have high potential in separating CO2 from natural gas offshore to be utilized under carbon, capture, storage and utilization (CCUS) project. The new cryogenic technologies are currently being tested for the proof of concept. Hence, a pilot plant, which is a scaled down version of the technology was developed. One of the major challenges faced during the pilot plant testing is the emergency depressurization philosophy as the process involves CO2 solids handling which is uncommon to the industry standard. Depressurization of high CO2 fluid at cryogenic temperature would lead to possibility of CO2 solids formation, hence potential blockage of process equipment and venting line. Therefore, this paper will focus on the design of the pressure relieving system of such a facilities. It would also touched on the implementation of the pressure relieving system during the operation of the pilot tests and as well as the tests designed specially to test the pressure relieving system. Finally the paper would give a few proposals on improvements to be made to such system. It is also the ultimate aim of the authors and the team to introduce a new philosophy for Cryogenic CO2 Blowdown system to the process industry.

These resources usually refer to energy consumption, locally distributed electricity generation, and energy storage. The building structural mass has an inherent potential either to modify consumption or to be used as a storage medium. In this paper, the energy flexibility potential of a residential building thermal mass for the winter design day is investigated. Various active demand response strategies are assessed using two flexibility indicators: the storage efficiency and storage capacity. Using simulation, it is shown that the available capacity and efficiency associated with active demand response actions depend on thermostat setpoint modulation, demand response event duration, heating system rated power and current consumption. © 2019 by International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) All rights reserved.",,"Electric energy storage; Housing; Building structural; Current consumption; Distributed electricity generation; Energy flexibility; Financial incentives; Residential building; Residential consumers; Storage efficiency; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107513862

Due to the intermittent nature of most renewable energy sources, energy mismatch problems between on-site generation and demand both in hourly and seasonal levels are unavoidable. This problem is more significant in Northern latitudes, as in summer there is high solar availability despite low or no electricity demand for cooling and in winter the solar availability is low when there is a high demand for heating. In addition, energy-pricing policies are leading to less or no Photovoltaic (PV) feed-in-tariffs in the near future and/or even providing incentives to uphold self-consumption. Therefore, it is important to enhance the energy flexibility potential of a building to improve utilization of on-site generated energy. In this study, a performance optimization of various residential building designs with differences in energy demand, on-site energy generation and storage sizes is carried out considering future policy scenarios. The objective is to minimize the dependency to the nearby energy grid and maximize the self-consumption. To achieve this, a performance-based design support framework is proposed and demonstrated using a case study. © 2019 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

Wastewater extraction flowrate and temperature, as two design parameters, were studied in detail by employing two types of wastewater storage tanks. The suggested outdoor air preheating systems equally reduced the defrosting period to 26% compared to the mechanical ventilation with heat recovery system (MVHR) without air preheating. The system that utilized a temperature stratified wastewater storage tank provided a higher ratio of heat output to electricity input. The other outdoor air preheating system, which was equipped with an unstratified wastewater storage tank, provided a lower ratio of heat output to pumping power.

These studies have raised important issues and identified possible scenarios that could contribute to reliability problems during winter peaks, but have not evaluated the economics of specific solutions to winter-time fuel deliverability. This paper describes an expansion to a new modeling framework for gas and electric power transmission planning problems (the Combined Electricity and Gas Expansion, or CEGE model) that allows centralized or distributed natural gas storage to be evaluated alongside traditional planning alternatives such as transmission network expansion. Using a test system based on the gas and electric transmission topology in New England, we develop a a simple two-period gas storage model and use this model to evaluate economically valuable locations for distributed natural gas storage and compare the economic merits of increasing storage within New England versus expanding pipeline infrastructure to increase fuel deliverability to New England power plants within our test system. Initial simulations using this storage model suggest that the optimal placement for gas storage may be co-located with power plants to relieve binding pressure constraints in areas of the gas network close to gas-fired generation. Moreover, the economic consequences of extreme winter peak scenarios may be ameliorated at a lower cost with a mix of gas storage and pipeline expansions rather than via pipeline expansion alone. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

They are often challenged by complex and aggressive mechanical and geochemical conditions, affecting their integrity, efficiency and reliability. This is exacerbated in geothermal fields due to the extreme temperature conditions at depth, repeated thermal cycling, fluid manipulation and the presence of corrosive chemicals. Wellbore integrity is of paramount importance to safe and effective geothermal energy extraction. Assessments for wellbore integrity relies almost entirely on downhole logging tools currently. Such tools typically require borehole occupation which interrupts the operation of the wells. Because of the relatively high cost, these measurements are only performed occasionally, typically when problems are suspected, limiting their usefulness for borehole degradation trajectory prediction for potential failure warning. We developed and tested a new generation of borehole monitoring tools using only wellhead based approaches. These approaches are (1) non-intrusive and does not require behind-casing or in-casing sensor installation or deployment; (2) cost effective, which allows frequent monitoring of the well during its life cycle; and (3) fast and easy to use, which facilitates its better acceptance and application by regular customers. Our approach integrates transient and steady state electromagnetism (EM), tubular seismic wave propagation and electrochemical sensing. Specifically, steady state EM and electrochemical sensing can provide fast and low cost casing integrity screening, and guided transient EM and tubular seismic wave sensing can provide higher precision targeting of wellbore irregularity in geothermal wells. Both experimental and numerical experiments were conducted at both laboratory and field scales, and our results demonstrated the sensitivities of these approaches to casing length and damage induced geophysical anomalies. These results revealed the potential of these approaches which could lead to a new set of non-invasive, fast and economic tools for borehole integrity accessed in geothermal as well as other subsurface applications. © 2019 Geothermal Resources Council.

The IPCC special report (2018) estimates that the atmospheric temperature should not rise more than 2° if we want to avoid major consequences associated with climate change. This can be achieved by reducing CO2emissions through capture and sequestration, either at the emission point source or from ambient air. Direct air capture (DAC) technology answers the latter challenge but is to date hindered by high thermal requirements which effectively limit the net removal of atmospheric CO2. One solution may exist in geothermal energy, which represents a large, low-carbon source of heat. This work outlines the potential of integrating DAC plants with geothermal power plants to optimize net CO2removal through use of a low-carbon heat source and minimize cost through exploitation of existing infrastructure. Full integration of DAC plants with all existing geothermal power plants in the contiguous U.S. could capture 12.8 MtCO2/yr. Other options have been considered and include combining DAC plants with direct use geothermal or building new infrastructure near geothermal springs and wells. Following capture, reliable storage of CO2is vital to climate change mitigation. Several types of geological formations are suitable for longterm CO2storage in the pore space of subsurface reservoirs. The most mature technology to date involves sequestration in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. This work will focus on California due to its leadership in strong environmental policy and abundance of high temperature opportunities. Several works have assessed reservoirs for CO2storage in California (e.g. USGS, 2013), through which minimum cost pathways may be defined for CO2sequestration. The result of this analysis is a cradle-to-gate economic analysis of DAC/geothermal plus storage options within the state of California. © 2019 Geothermal Resources Council.

Among many available options, advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) are considered mature and affordable options for grid-scale applications. However, the relatively high capital cost hinders the development of AA-CAES system. As a result, the cost-benefit analysis of AA-CAES application is studied in this paper. The thermodynamic characteristics of AA-CAES system are carefully studied and modeled. An optimal configuration method of AA-CAES capacity considering energy arbitrage is proposed and the optimal capacity of each component of AA-CAES is demonstrated. Simulation results indicate that the application of AA-CAES in arbitrage market is profitable but the payback period is long. The profit estimations are more realistic compare to conventional battery model. Profitable cost range of AA-CAES is found through sensibility analysis. Augmenting electricity price to improve economic of AA-CAES is discussed at the end. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The reasons behind this trend are mainly the decreasing unit price of battery systems and the increasing need for adding resilience in the modern power systems. In this context, an optimization problem is formulated to investigate PV+battery systems from both economical and reliability aspects. Using real demand and solar irradiation data, a case study for a hospital in Orlando, FL has been conducted and analyzed. The objective is to minimize the total system cost given specific reliability constraints and the decision variable is the size of the battery which is going to be attached to a given PV array. The metrics of Total System Cost (TSC) and Chance Constraint Probability (CCP) have been adopted to assess the performance of the system. The results are presented in numerical terms for the considered scenario and a comparison between the proposed and two other methods has been conducted to highlight the importance of optimally solving the problem under discussion.

In contrast to the traditional huge power grids, in which the synchronous machine play a significant role in producing power, the renewable energy sources do not have any rotating mass. The synchronous machine is the key source of inertia in the conventional power systems. The impact of low-inertia on the microgrid (MG) stability and operation is a hot topic in these days. One solution to address this issue in a stand- alone MG is to provide supplementary inertia, virtually. In simple terms, virtual inertia is able to be applied for the high penetration power system by utilizing energy storage devices among with power electronic circuits as well as an appropriate control algorithm. Hence, this study proposes a new intelligent virtual inertia control based- superconducting magnetic energy storage to maximize the secondary load frequency stabilization of modern AC power grids. In order to address this problem, a new structure of the fuzzy system is suggested. Finally, by using real-data, the performance and robustness of the proposed controller technique over other controller approaches have examined by the dSPACE real-time simulator. © Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Control and Optimization of Renewable Energy Systems, CORES 2019.

The inexhaustible solar energy is the most suitable available energy source to substitute those toxic conventional energy sources. but for many year's solar energy downs sides are that it is often unpredictable and peak solar irradiations is mismatched with peak's demands. So, it's essential to develop efficient, economical solar thermal energy storage (TES). in most patterns of domestic application such as solar water heating systems that have been widely used around the world for many years and maintaining buildings comfort levels, there are still many options to increase the efficiency of these systems using thermal energy storage (TES). As such an introduction of a novel hybrid composite PCM/concrete wall integrating a plan solar water heater is presented. The studied system consists of a three layered composite PCM/concrete wall, the middle layer is the paraffin wax PCM with a thickness of em = 2 cm the total length of the wall is L = 20 cm the outer interface is directly coupled with a solar water heat absorber. The boundary conditions on the outer surface of the glass cover are due to the combined effects of solar radiation and ambient air convection. Meteorological data for every one hour in Casablanca city, Morocco (33°360N, 07°360W) are used. the transmitted heat is transferred to the water causing a gradual increase in its temperature which causes the melting of PCM inside the concrete wall leading to the maximum benefit of using latent heat storage techniques. in such solar thermal energy systems. A mathematical model has been developed to assess the effect of PCM position on its latent heat storage. The equations that govern the problem are treated using the finite volume method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A passive house can be defined as an energy efficient construction, which ensures an optimal indoor microclimate both in summer and winter time, thus ensuring an optimal indoor microclimate, without the need for a conventional heating or cooling source. Although the design concept of passive houses is a well-structured one, defined by a low energy consumption and a high degree of thermal insulation, as with any construction well insulated from the external environment, it is subject to the phenomenon of overheating of the interior environment, because of the heat gains inside the building, but also due to the insulation from external environment. The overheating phenomenon is a common problem found in most well-insulated buildings, such as passive houses, where although overheating prevention systems can be implemented, such as additional mechanical ventilation, natural-organized ventilation or the implementation of an active cooling system, these additional systems lead to additional energy consumption and additional running costs, or they can create an imbalance within the interior microclimate. The results of the study present the main relevant advantages that quantify the benefits of integrating phase change materials in the construction of passive houses, and the effect they have on reducing the overheating phenomenon, by creating a thermal management system through which the internal energy will not be lost, but will be stored and rendered to the environment without disturbing the interior microclimate and without the need for additional ventilation or active cooling systems. © SGEM 2019.","Energy efficiency; Passive house; Phase change materials; Thermal energy storage","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heating; Houses; Phase change materials; Thermal insulation; Thermoelectric equipment; Ventilation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Conventional heating; External environments; Interior environments; Low energy consumption; Mechanical ventilation; Prevention systems; Thermal management systems; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092513771

Nuclear energy is expected to be the main source of electricity production by the end of the XXI century. Electricity, however, has some disadvantages related to storage and losses in case of long-distance transmission. Among other sources of energy, the use of which can be possible in the nearest future, hydrogen is the most promising one. The advantages of using hydrogen as a fuel can be summarized as follows: using hydrogen as fuel can be one of the comprehensive solutions to the problem of environmental protection; hydrogen is an excellent energy carrier; as of today, society is largely dependent on fossil energy, while the contribution of sustainable fuel to global energy demand is limited. Taking into consideration the above, and the possibility of using a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas as a source of energy, the research has been aimed in the following directions: - Influence of hydrogen impurities on the physical properties of natural gas; - the effect of adding hydrogen into natural gas on the metrological characteristics of metering systems. © FLOMEKO 2019.",,"Energy resources; Flow measurement; Gases; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Petroleum deposits; Petroleum prospecting; Physical properties; Electricity production; Global energy demand; Hydrogen impurity; Hydrogen influences; Industrialized countries; Long distance transmission; Metrological characteristics; Oil and natural gas; Hydrogen fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091429625

We use an integrated approach to provide a more realistic geometry and architecture of faults. In this approach, fault imaging through seismic attributes is integrated with comparable outcrop studies. Using frequency decomposition and choosing higher frequency seismic data for the attribute analysis, we image faults beyond seismic resolution. Our data covers both siliciclastic and carbonate rocks. Utilizing the compiled fault geometric attributes data measured on outcrop and seismic and comparing them with the previously published data; we investigate the fault scaling relations. The scaling relations are to predict fault dimensions and to better understand the fault growth mechanism.

It dissolves in oil and reduces its density (i.e., swells the oil) and viscosity, giving oil a higher mobility. However, when the reservoir condition is not suitable for the CO2 to become miscible in oil, the high mobility and low density of the CO2 causes channeling and gravity override, and as a result a poor sweep and early breakthrough. These problems can be addressed by dissolving the CO2 in water, a fluid with lower mobility, and injecting it into the reservoir, known as carbonated water injection. It is observed experimentally that the injection of a water-soluble solvents such as CO2 or DME into a chalk core (in tertiary mode) mobilizes a large fraction of the remaining oil and vastly improves the recovery factor. Moreover, the injected CO2 if trapped in the reservoir, can mitigate the harmful impact of the CO2 that is otherwise released to the atmosphere. This work tries to quantify the effectiveness of the carbonated water injection into a North Sea chalk reservoir in terms of the extra oil recovery, the overall process energy balance, and the net amount of stored carbon dioxide. The prerequisite to a successful implementation of the carbonated water flooding is the availability of the CO2. Different options are considered in this work, viz., pipeline transport of the captured CO2 from the nearby fossil-fuel power plants, liquefied CO2 transported by a ship, and the wind-farm electricity-driven separation of CO2 from the atmosphere. All the energy requirements for the separation, transport, and injection of CO2 are included in the energy analysis. The carbonated water injection into the chalk reservoir is modeled using an in-house finite volume solver. The amount of the stored CO2 in the reservoir is quantified from the simulation results. It is assumed that the produced CO2 in the production wells is separated and re-injected into the reservoir. The final results is presented as the net amount of recovered hydrocarbon energy from the reservoir and the net amount of captured CO2 per unit recovered energy. The effectiveness of this process is compared to other CO2 capture and storage processes in terms of the energy requirement per unit mass of captured carbon dioxide. The energy analysis in this work, which is founded on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, can be easily converted to economic analysis. © 2019 European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, EAGE.

These hoses are mostly contaminated with hydrocarbons or other heavy metals and disposed of as hazardous waste. With the aim of ""zero waste to landfill"" and adoption of a waste upcycling approach, better and appropriate disposal methods for used hoses in market were evaluated and selected to support the achievement of the target. Typically, used hoses are disposed of by secured landfill. To avoid the high negative impacts of landfill, used hoses from the Company activities had been accumulated in storage over many years while the Company sought out the best available process to manage them. Burning the waste in a Cement kiln, an alternative waste disposal method, cannot dispose of the hoses completely because they are made with reinforced steel wires; in fact, the hoses must be shredded into smaller pieces prior to burning them in the kiln. As a solution and an endeavor to develop new methods with hose manufacturers, waste disposers and other waste generators, a combination of decontamination and pyrolysis process was selected as the answer. The former is a process of removing contaminants that have accumulated in the hoses and that are critical to health and safety, while the latter is a new way of getting value from burned materials through thermochemical decomposition of organic material at high temperatures while they are in chamber absent of oxygen; this causes the materials to break down into smaller molecules. As a result of this combined process, we are able to convert hoses with reinforced materials into alternative valued products: carbon black, steel wires, and pyrolysis oil, which can be further used as raw material or an energy source for other industries. In terms of commercial use, this new method has resulted in lower cost when compared to using a secured landfill. It serves as an alternative waste disposal method and is considered to be the most efficient process to replace secured landfill. This method may also help the Company in disseminating future best practices on the disposal process to other oil and gas companies who are considering alternative processes and help the Company in promoting the waste upcycling scheme for a better environmental value.

In order to deal with these challenges and realize the benefits of tapping in old area, the new idea of ""group fracturing"" was proposed basing on the concept of volumetric fracturing, starting from the reconsideration of reservoir geology, injection production unit for the smallest study unit, and integrating multiple fracturing method, we conduct a series of technical studies and field experiment in the old area of Jilin oilfield.

The active hard coal mines were finally shut down in 2018 in Germany and lignite mining is expected to take place only until 2038. The so-called long-term liabilities of the mine operators in Germany include, among other things, the long-term guarantee of stability and thus the monitoring of ground motion. So far, the economic use of underground mining in Germany was mainly the supply of raw materials. In the future, the underground storage of compressed air, methane, or hydrogen will play an important role in renewable energy supply and climate change. Therefore, underground storage space will become more important and spatial planning is essential to ensure availability of safe underground openings for the various options of environmentally friendly energy storage. However, this renewed usage of underground openings may also bring new and sometimes unknown challenges of geomechanical influence. On the one hand, the aftermath of hard coal and lignite mining will be an increasing challenge in mining subsidence engineering. On the other hand, new possibilities due to underground spatial planning may lead to subsidence and/or heaving of the upper surface. © Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Ground Control in Mining, ICGCM 2019.

Simultaneously, the demand should ideally be able to be adapted to the renewable generation availability, directly with demand response or indirectly using energy storage technologies. The transport sector with electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly an important consumer of electricity, and as fleets increase, EVs can be used as controllable loads, charging in periods of high renewable generation or low prices, using the Grid to Vehicle (G2V) system. With adequate technology, in addition to absorbing power from the grid, EVs can also use some of their storage capacity to inject energy into the grid, in order to ensure the balance between the generation and demand, using the Vehicle to Grid (V2G) system. However, the additional charging cycles due to V2G will accelerate the degradation of batteries and therefore its associated cost must be taken into account. This paper discusses the technologies and methodologies for the implementation of Grid to Vehicle and Vehicle to Grid systems, as well as their potential benefits for the grid in a scenario with large-scale penetration of renewable generation. To assess such impact a case study for the Portuguese grid is presented, considering three scenarios of penetration of EVs in the Portuguese vehicle fleet (in which EVs constitute 10 %, 25 % or 50 % of the fleet). The obtained data allowed to assess the potential of V2G to transfer the generation surplus between hours of low and high demand. Additionally, the economic benefits from the grid and user point-of-views were assessed considering the degradation of the batteries (evaluated through a model developed in Simulink environment), associated with the use of V2G, and their replacement cost. The results show a high impact on the compensation of renewable generation surplus, as well as economic benefits from the grid point-of-view. Even considering the battery degradation, in some scenarios, there is also a potential economic benefit for the user. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

In Norway, it is being modified from a two-part tariff, where the cost is divided between a fixed installation cost (EUR/ installation) and a cost for consumed electricity (EUR/kWh), to a three-part electricity tariff where customers additionally pay demand charges for capacity usage (EUR/kW). To combat demand charges, commercial customers are looking into supplementing PV installations with batteries to more efficiently reduce peak electricity demand, i.e. peak shaving. A crucial part of the complete energy system is also the energy management, where forecasting improves efficiency and economics. The objective of this work was to investigate the profitability with peak shaving in Norway for a commercial building. A forecasting algorithm for load prediction was developed, and the economic value of forecasting was determined for a PV-battery system. The load forecasting was developed using component-wise gradient boosting and the results from the model were verified against a renowned benchmarking load forecasting model. The economic value of forecasting was determined through simulations with Homer Energy Software that optimizes the net present cost of the systems. The results showed that battery storage was only economically beneficial when forecasting was deployed. Moreover, the cost savings came mainly from reduced demand charges, not from increased self-consumption of PV electricity. It was also discussed that the application of forecasting in an energy management system could be divided into three phases. One phase where forecasting is deployed to dimension energy system components in an early stage, one monthly forecast overview that identifies height and frequency of maximum peaks, and finally one high-resolution forecast that operates the battery on an hourly basis. Altogether, such an energy management system could additionally also be used by utility grid owners to schedule demand response actions for power quality control. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

There is a lot of experience available, which can make it difficult when one looks for answers to specific questions. The EPATEE project (https://epatee.eu) developed a toolbox to support stakeholders to find the right resources that fit their needs. The toolbox helps defining their evaluation approach with an interactive user interface that provides users with practical guidance tailored to 30 combinations of sector, policy instrument and method for evaluating energy savings. The toolbox is primarily focused on ex-post impact evaluation. The specific guidance for energy savings calculations takes into account the diversity of situations (e.g. evaluation objectives, level of expertise, data availability) and covers methodological (e.g. defining the baseline, factors to take into account) as well as practical (e.g. data collection, quality, resources needed) aspects. Other guidance was developed or gathered about cross-cutting issues, such as evaluating net energy savings or comparing estimated and measured energy savings. In addition, links to or storage of existing resources have been arranged to provide an easy access to guidance about general principles and approaches of evaluation other than impact evaluation (e.g. process evaluation, cost-benefit analysis, market transformation). Likewise, this deals with evaluation of impacts other than energy savings. Feedback from stakeholders also showed the importance to include guidance about how to integrate evaluation into the policy cycle. This short paper describes briefly the background and how the toolbox was developed. It is illustrated with examples of evaluations that can be done with the toolbox. The display will make it possible for participants to test and comment on the toolbox.

The current model of ensuring demand-supply match mainly by investments into supply and transmission infrastructure needs to be complemented by demand-centric solutions - usually summarised under the term demand response (DR). Due to digitalisation the technical possibilities to integrate small- and medium-sized prosumers (residential, tertiary, decentral power and heat storages, micro-grids etc.) into DR activities are continuously expanding: innovative platforms allow for bundling of small/medium-sized capacities; transaction cost are reduced through automated dispatching; communication with switchable, “smart” appliances is becoming cheaper; new technologies are available to ensure secure data handling for easier forms of “smart contracts”; etc. But hand in hand with expansion of DR potentials, there is also a need to adapt and further develop current DR business models to cope with new challenges. Against this background, this paper • gives a brief summary on the most current technological developments that will lead to a continuous expansion of DR potentials over the next decade • presents an overview on the core elements of the regulatory framework in EU countries which are relevant for DR activities • describes business models that are currently applied on the market and analyse the limitations of these business models • derives from there new business models that enable increasing flexibility on energy markets, including a clarification of roles and responsibilities of future DR service providers and their position as a market facilitators.

Box 8242, Utrecht, NL-3503 RE, Netherlands","For long time energy efficiency and renewable energy have been treated separately, but the need to decarbonize the (electric) power system brings them together. In a decarbonized power system, any demand must be met in a sustainable, zero-carbon way. Therefore, the relation could be simply formulated as follows: energy efficiency is about reducing demand so that this can be met by electricity generated by renewable energy sources. However, competing claims from the two sides arise. The renewables claim that with the abundant availability of renewable energy there is less or no need to focus on energy efficiency. On the other hand, energy efficiency claims that it is the “first fuel” that is much cheaper than renewable energy (or any other energy source) and therefore should get priority. It seems that both claims are rooted in the current situation in which the power system in most countries is still highly carbonized and centralized, and efficiency is deployed in a modest way only. This paper provides a framework to explore relations between energy efficiency and renewables in the electric power system. The elements of the system - generation, connection, storage, control and efficiency - are in competition with each other. Different system designs will put emphasis on different elements; however, simple, single focused solutions will not realize a decarbonized power system. By looking at the extreme situation - an electric power system with renewable generation only - the consequences for energy efficiency will become clearly visible. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Of particular interest is its application to manufacturing bigger objects where laser treatment is required over surfaces on the centimetre scale or larger. Using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM), such parallelisation has been studied over the last few years by splitting the input beam into multiple beams (up to 1000 beams [1]) for simultaneous machining on a plane (x→ − y→) perpendicular to the propagation axis (z→). This method is primarily based on holographic femtosecond laser processing [2] where computer-generated holograms (CGH) are displayed on an SLM.

Large industries such as oil and gas have also transformed their vision to ensure utilization of renewable energy sources to provide a cost effective, clean and reliable day to day operations. This paper will therefore present a case study where renewable energy became the enabler for clean oil extraction and economic growth more broadly. Renewable energy technologies have been at the forefront amongst South Australia's commercial and residential consumers. Large industries such as oil and gas have committed to green, clean methodologies to support their operations when extracting crude oil from wells. The use of solar and battery storage has presented an obvious solution given the proof and reliability of the technology to enable a reduction in carbon emissions and cost while extracting resources from deep wells. A pilot renewable energy off-grid project was successfully completed in South Australia and has proven successful which has now resulted in significant funding being allocated to convert an additional 56 sites. The successful trial conducted in the State of South Australia allowed for oil pumps to be powered 100% using renewable energy which resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions and operational costs incurred from the supply and transfer of fuel to the pumps. It is estimated that the adoption of renewable energy for oil extraction will result in an approximate saving of 140 barrels of oil per day which is currently used to fuel pumps and generators at these remote sites. Assuming an average price market of $50 (US) per barrel, this equates to $2.25m (US) per day with consideration to approximately 10% unavailability due to maintenance. The forecast saving of $2.25m (US) is intentionally calculated using market value to reinforce the potential additional revenue to be had from savings on oil consumption during the crude oil extraction process. In addition to the above forecast savings, a further $70,000 (US) per annum could be saved purely from the use of diesel generators currently being used to supply pumps, this assumes the cost per generator is $190 (US) per day for operations excluding maintenance costs and associated overheads. With the above in mind and the successful trials under way in Australia, there are a further 208 pumps which are currently in scope across the continent to be converted in an effort to reduce production costs, emissions and ensure a low maintenance operational strategy is in place as well as a low carbon strategy. (Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), 2019). The financial savings above are forecast to increase with decreased requirements for high cost operational maintenance when compared to conventional sources being used to date in the oil industry. When considering the financial viability of renewable energy solutions, in addition to the environmental and social benefits, it has been determined that for a single oil pump, the forecast payback period on investments made does not exceed 4 years. Considering solar systems have a lifespan of 25 years, this means that the remaining operating of solar panels, that is in excess of 20 years will be solely revenue generating years. Taking also into account the 25 years of running for both systems, conventional vs. renewable energy, the forecast levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is $1.3 (US)/kWh vs. 14c (US)/kWh respectively. This means over a 25-year period, with renewable energy it is forecast that the cost to maintain supply to oil pumps would be 10% of what it could be if conventional sources were used, notwithstanding the lack of electrical redundancy on site, associated maintenance costs and also the forecast reduction of carbon emissions per site. By applying some of the analyses and key findings, it is necessary to see the oil and gas industries adopt renewable energy strategies to ensure low cost and reliable technologies for oil and gas productions and enable new opportunities for economic growth while ensuring continued commitment to address environmental and social challenges of tomorrow.

The latest innovations in the field comprise floating wind turbines deployed in deep waters that are capable of intercepting the stronger, less turbulent winds farther away from the landmass. Despite being able to augment the power harnessed, wind resources remain intermittent in nature, and so unable to satisfy the energy demand at all times. Energy storage systems (ESS) are therefore being considered a key component to smoothen out the supply-demand mismatch when wind penetration into electricity grids increases. Yet, multiple issues pertaining to the integration of ESSs on large-scale projects arise, including economic, environmental and safety considerations. This paper presents a novel concept for integrating a hydro-pneumatic energy storage (HPES) system within a spar-type floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platform. It aims to assess the technical feasibility of integrating the storage unit within the floater. A preliminary investigation on the influence of integrated storage on the static stability and hydrostatic response of a conventional ballast-stabilised FOWT is conducted, followed by numerical simulations for the dynamic response using ANSYS® AQWA™. Based on the results presented, several conclusions are drawn on the implications of integrating energy storage with floating wind turbine structures. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the thermal efficiency of the storage system based on this specific embodiment is also presented and discussed.

These risks have led to an increasing dependence on more sophisticated mathematical models. This paper refers specifically to energy storage in the offshore wind farming industry and has the objective of proposing an adiabatic compressed air energy (A-CAES) system which would be integrated on a semi-submersible offshore wind turbine (OWT) platform. Calculations in respect to the sizing of the main sub-components of the system are included and estimates for the overall round trip efficiency are presented. Preliminary calculations to size the various parts of the energy storage system (ESS) have been carried out based on the energy availability of an offshore 8 MW wind turbine with real wind data from the North Sea. The load data to determine the lowest 12-hour demand period was taken from the Nordpool database. The calculations of the proposed conceptual design are based on an operational scenario in which the 24-hour period of a particular day is split in a 12-hour charging and 12-hour discharging cycle. For charging, a 5-bank, 2-stage compressor train is used to pressurize a number of steel cylindrical vessels with compressed air. This is followed by a process in which the compressed air is discharged across 12 hours using a 2-bank, 2-stage expander turbine. The multiple compression banks enable a modular power delivery to the air storage vessels, with the number of compressors utilized varying subject to wind availability. The two stages allowed for the air to be cooled in between the stages using heat exchangers, transferring the heat of compression to a pressurized sea water circuit. The hot water would be stored in thermally insulated vessels at 3500C to heat the inlet expanding air in the discharge period. A 70 and 100 Bar charging scenarios, both with a cushion pressure (CP) in the air storage vessel (ASV) of 10 Bar at the end of the discharge cycle have been considered. Standard performance criteria are calculated such as compression and expansion ratios, inlet and outlet temperatures for the respective expansion and compression air streams and flow rates within the heat exchangers to come up with an indicative sizing proposal for the respective turbo machinery and storage vessels making up the system. Round trip efficiencies are also calculated. The study determined that a CAES system consisting of 9 compressed air storage vessels operating with a peak pressure of 100 Bar should meet the storage requirements. It is also estimated that the entire CAES system would require around 1082 m2 of deck area on the platform to accommodate the pressure vessels, the compressor and expander trains, the heat exchanger and the hot water storage vessel.

However, the crude oil containing light hydrocarbons has better flowing properties and rheological properties under low temperature. Compared with degassed crude oil, the viscosity, yield stress and freezing point of dissolved-gas crude oil have been improved obviously. On the basis of analyzing energy consumption of the gathering system and total energy cost of pipeline operation, the improved gathering and transportation process without the device in stabilizing crude oil will be considered. The new process mode not only makes the overall upstream of the gathering and transportation system be airtight, but also has the advantages of simple process, less equipment, high degree of automation and convenient management. It helps to form an integrated three-links structure among joint station, pipeline and refinery, which is of a huge energy-saving potential to the environment and safe operation of the gathering and transportation system with crude oil pipelines.

These applications always involve complex fluids exhibiting obvious non-Newtonian behavior. Droplet generation has been extensively addressed, while the complete understanding of droplet generation in non-Newtonian fluid system is still nascent. Here, we present the study of non-Newtonian droplet generation in a flow-focusing microchannel. Polyethylene oxide aqueous solutions are used as the dispersed phase, while olive oil serves as the continuous phase to induce the generation. The molecular weight of polymer is constant while the concentrations are varied from dilute to semi-dilute regimes that are rarely explored in existing studies. The main features of non-Newtonian droplet generation are first identified, after which the concentration-dependent dripping to jetting transitions are clarified. The effects of shear thinning and elasticity on droplet generation are then separately investigated. We finally propose a scaling relation to predict the primary droplet size with the satellite droplets neglected. These results can not only extend the fundamental theory of droplet microfluidics but also facilitate the practical applications.

Previous studies have shown that a vehicle's air conditioning(A/C) system is the most energy-intensive non-propulsive system and significantly reduces fuel economy. This study aims to design and validate a new method of improving fuel economy estimates obtained on non-climate-controlled chassis dynamometers, as such laboratories are limited to measuring fuel economy with the A/C system deactivated. The methodology proposed herein uses a chassis dynamometer to measure the fuel economy penalty caused by the A/C system at different steady-state conditions. The hypothesis is that these penalties can be imposed accordingly for a given drive cycle to obtain an additional fuel consumption due to A/C. To validate the proposed methodology, a vehicle was outfitted with a data acquisition system and was driven 50 times around a predefined route using varying A/C settings. The proposed method was then used to estimate the additional fuel consumption due to A/C usage for each of the runs. Comparing the calculated and actual fuel economies showed an average error of 1.924%. It was concluded that the proposed methodology is a viable alternative to existing procedures.

A quantitative criterion for the long-term stability evaluation in the spatial-temporal non-equilibrium evolution process of gas storage caverns is established based on the T~∆E curve, where T is time and ∆E is plastic complementary energy (PCE). The T ~ ∆E curve provides a unified quantitative criterion of stability evaluation under various external disturbance factors. The driving force of the spatial-temporal non-equilibrium evolution process is revealed and its engineering value is demonstrated especially for reinforcement design. PCE is the quantitative indicator of instability. Over force is the internal effective driving force of unrecoverable time-dependent deformation or damage evolution during the spatial-temporal non-equilibrium evolution process. Deformation stability and control theory is implemented by finite element method to analyze the time-dependent deformation, long-term stability and local failure of gas storage caverns in salt rock. It is indicated that deformation stability and control theory proposes a more effective stability evaluation criteria of gas storage caverns in salt rock.

However, the sector has a reputation for being conservative, insular in its collaborative efforts and reluctant to adopt new technology. As a way of addressing this, the TechX programme at the Oil & Gas Technology Centre has launched TechX Ventures in July 2018 – a partnership with Deep Science Ventures (DSV) – that combines deep science with engineering to create the next generation of start-up companies with technologies that will position the oil and gas industry for a sustainable future in a low carbon economy. The start of the programme was a workshop held with industry, academia and the scientific community, to identify areas where new thinking and technology could open up significant opportunities. Three challenge themes were developed, each of which became an opportunity areas for DSV to address. These are: Carbon negative operations - Effective, large scale, affordable carbon capture and storage solutions are essential to meet global emissions targets. TechX Ventures seeks to create new technologies that will allow the capture of carbon at source, safe storage and conversion to other useful products such as graphene and hydrogen. Automated oil and gas - Oil and gas is playing catch-up with other industries, such as automotive and aerospace, when it comes to adopting robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. TechX Ventures aims to apply recent advances in these areas to North Sea operations to improve safety, enhance production efficiency and automate the decommissioning process. Energy movement/storage - Extracting, transporting, storing and using oil and gas presents many challenges. TechX Ventures wants to revolutionise the movement and storage of energy from well to customer by creating technologies which convert the reserves to electrical energy at source, store and transport electrical energy and convert currently wasteful processes e.g. gas flaring to electrical energy. As part of the TechX Ventures programme, DSV recruited thirty scientists and engineering experts from across the world to tackle the opportunity areas and at the end of the nine-month programme a total of six new start-up companies with new intellectual property were created and invested in by DSV. Of these six, two were selected to join the coveted TechX Pioneer accelerator programme run by OGTC in Aberdeen. These companies are called Eltera and Optic Earth.

Today, the industry is saddled with the task to sustain world hydrocarbon resources to meet current and future energy demands. This has resulted in prospecting for hydrocarbon in deep hydrocarbon plays or accumulations at much deeper depths in the Earth's subsurface. These deep hydrocarbon plays are sometimes below brown fields with significant production from reservoirs that are depleted and below hydrostatic pressure. Exploiting these deep plays requires wells that could traverse these depleted reservoirs, as well as other virgin reservoirs. These plays are often associated with abnormal formation pressures, with reduced drilling margins, defined by elevated formation pressures and fracture gradients. These pore pressures and fracture gradients information drive the well design and delivery (i.e. mud schedule, casing scheme, and rig/wellhead equipment selection). Thus, in well design and delivery, drilling operations should be planned to manage the different pressure regimes and transition zones to be encountered during drilling. Recently, several Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) incidents have been recorded across the globe from well control related incidents that affected lives, assets, and the environment, because formation strength integrity was compromised during oil/gas well operations. One key factor in ensuring that wells are drilled and completed to desired depth without well control incidents is a proper estimation of the formation strength or pressure containment of the open-hole formation during well operations – this is defined by the formation fracture gradient. The main objective of this paper is to propose a new methodology to estimate fracture gradients based on the application of two different methods for virgin and depleted reservoirs: i.e. the Effective Stress Ratio and the Stress Path methods, respectively. These methods were adapted to the Niger Delta in an integrated modeling workflow as proposed in Reservoir GeoMechanics literature (see ref. #6). Uncertainty management relating to their broad application of this workflow to all onshore/shallow offshore wells/fields has been managed by incorporating a new calibration function to validate the estimated fracture gradients using the actual Leak-Off Test (LOT) data, taken from offset or nearby wells in the formation of interest or its analogue. In this paper, 120 LOT data from existing wells drilled across 36 onshore fields in Niger Delta were used to determine a correlation between the ratios of the horizontal/vertical effective stresses and depth. This was then used in the Effective Stress Ratio (ESR) workflow for fracture gradient estimation to obtain the in-situ/original fracture gradient of the formation. This defines the static condition and stress state of the formation and sets the scene for the estimation of the current fracture gradient in the Reservoir Stress Path modeling workflow, that considers the dynamic condition/stress state of the formation, providing a more robust and accurate estimate of the fracture gradient, considering post production and time lapse effects. Furthermore, this new methodology is a significant improvement from the use of depth-dependent fracture gradient models to one that integrates field parameters; i.e. LOTs, overburden/in-situ stresses, pore pressure changes, and related rock properties, which describe the geomechanical state of the formation. This methodology was validated in some oil/gas fields in the Niger Delta and results were compared to measured values obtained from LOT data from these fields. The results compared very well, giving good confidence in the new methodology. Application of this methodology allows prediction of reliable and robust pre-drill fracture gradient values for planned wells. Its significance is in the design and safe delivery of a well, where the well will traverse virgin and depleted formations, in normal and abnormal pressure regimes with large to small drilling windows across pressure transition zones.

Consequently, the petroleum industry has been ensuring affordable supply to match demand through exploitation and production of oil and gas. Nonetheless, there is increasing drive to shift towards renewables being an energy source that is ‘inexhaustible’, while decreasing the intensity of anthropogenic greenhouse gases as well as mitigating other negative environmental impacts of hydrocarbon field development. However, this shift is a threat to the upstream sector of the petroleum industry, specifically to petroleum engineering (PE), given its potential to lower hydrocarbon demand while raising carbon taxes of oil and gas companies. Against this background, this paper takes a closer look at what lies ahead for PE in an emerging renewable energy (RE) world. It is shown that RE can be integrated into some conventional PE activities such as the use of solar energy for thermally enhanced-oil recovery and the application of its skillsets to advance the body of knowledge in geothermal engineering. Despite RE's comparative advantages, it faces challenges in energy storage and intermittency of supply. The paper examines the influence of PE in some industries that depend on its products and relevant skill sets. It also explores the interplay between PE and other apparently remote industries is explored. In conclusion, the future of PE is considered promising, though it needs to continuously re-invent itself. The reality is that it contributes not only to energy production, but many aspects of daily life. Compared to petroleum derivatives, the alternative products are yet to attain sufficient maturity for sustained large-scale utilisation. In principle, the breadth and depth of challenges that RE faces suggest that the world's dependence on PE is not likely to shift dramatically in the next couple of decades.

This is particularly adapted for single line long tie-backs, thanks to regenerative power management but the complexity of subsea architecture, flow conditions & fluids services raises some challenges. The ILR development is programmed over five phases (Feasibility study, Preliminary Systems design & Energy Balance Assessment, Flow Loop Bench Testing, Prototype Testing and Commercialisation). Phase 2 utilised Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models to assess power extraction levels from production flow across various scenarios whilst minimising pressure drop. The results obtained included the turbine CFD models that were coupled to power conversion and storage modules in order to ensure that system drive and power managementwere captured in a closed loop. An operational envelope was established considering the preliminary turbine design simulations as well as the associated energy balance.

Existing and emerging technologies that are inherently carbon-neutral and potentially carbon-negative are increasingly attractive, given the challenge of meeting climate targets to prevent climate change and build a clean growth strategy. The integration of clean energy technologies across the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) can increase the flexibility of the energy system, driving efficiency, cost reduction and enhancing the value of natural resources. There are over 250 platforms and 45,000 kilometres of pipeline installed within the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS). As these assets near the end of their economic life oil and gas operators are planning to decommission these facilities in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Current cost forecasts for this activity exceed £58bn with approximately 50% borne by the operators and 50% borne by UK taxpayers. The Hydrogen Offshore Production (HOP) project identifies an alternative to decommissioning by providing re-use options for offshore infrastructure while addressing the national challenge of a low carbon energy supply. In doing so, the project will prove the feasibility of several decentralised hydrogen generation, storage and distribution options that collectively provide a scalable offshore hydrogen production solution, whilst offsetting a portion of decommissioning costs that are currently forecast for all offshore assets and infrastructure. HOP will tackle the challenge of bulk hydrogen production by (1) proposing viable environmental and economic technology solutions to be deployed offshore, (2) developing a new Industrial Hydrogen Production test site to both prove the industrial benefits and to aid commercialisation of emerging technology and, (3) conducting market analysis and producing the business case for the transformation of existing offshore infrastructure, re-purposing assets and demonstrating the viability for decentralised generation of hydrogen. As part of the project, an Industrial Hydrogen Production test site will be established with Flotta (Orkney Islands) being proposed as the location. This will provide a test bed for technology, fast-tracking its development and providing a route for accelerated commercial deployment. Within a region of considerable renewable energy generation, the island of Flotta is ideally placed to benefit from local expertise, existing supply chain and advanced technology solutions. For example, the Industrial Hydrogen Production test site would greatly benefit from lessons learnt at the nearby Orkney Water Testing Centre.

The comparison between CCS and the other future alternatives or options relies mainly on the CCS cost -which is the main focus of this paper- removal of CCS deployment barrier in addition to the barriers and costs for the alternative options for CO2 emission reduction. This study gives an insight comparison between the electricity cost for five different options of power generation including Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) without and with CCS, coal and finally the nuclear power plants. In addition, it determines the ranges of fuel and carbon prices at which each option can be economically deployed The recent coal CCS for Nth of a kind power generation plant cost estimates lie in the region of 60 to 100 $/ton of avoided CO2 which is higher than the previous CCS cost estimated and also greater than the accepted range of the forecasted carbon prices in the upcoming years. The higher costs of coal CCS would suggest the following: 1. Coal CCS power generation plants is way less economical than gas ones for the range of carbon prices less than 60-100 $/ton of avoided CO2 2. Even at carbon prices higher than 100 $/ton of CO2, coal CCS power plants still produces higher cost electricity when compared to the gas CCS ones as long as the natural gas prices are still lower than 9 $/MBTU 3. Coal CCS electricity costs are still higher when compared to a nuclear power plant option It is widely believed that the CCS power plants (Gas or Coal) are not expected to be economical over the upcoming years, however introduction of subsidized forms of CCS are likely to take place. Also, CCS technology components are expected to be economically implemented in operations like Enhance Oil recovery (EOR), so, in this paper, an economic evaluation is provided for using of CO2 extracted from natural gas plant into EOR operations. CO2 separation cost in the natural gas processing industry is less than the capture cost of CO2 in power plants as a result of its high gas pressure and the fact that CO2 removal is mandatory to increase the value of a natural gas resource On the other hand, this is not the case for the CCS of the most industrial emissions, as they are expected to be higher than those of power plants as a result of the smaller scale and wider distributed CO2 streams compared to power generation plants. This shows the importance of the realistic CCS cost estimation as a significant factor in the R&amp;D projects and implementation trials that try to overcome the tackles that face the application of such promising technologies.

When working point transition is required, then process in turbine mode must be fast, efficient and reliable. Especially during start-up, the machine must operate at a stable speed close to the no-load condition (i.e. close to the runaway characteristic) in a large operating head range while not involving a special stabilizing technique and all synchronized guide vanes are open slightly. When pump turbine operates in “S” zone, two direction flow phenomena such as turbine direction and pump direction coexist in the flow passage together and the interaction effect between turbine and pump flow is responsible for “S” zone. Many vortexes are formed because the interaction, furthermore, the vortex cause energy loss and discharge fluctuation. In order to improve the “S” characteristics of model pump-turbine and improve the safety margin of prototype pump-turbine, a criterion which can be used to justify whether pump turbine may operate in the “S” zone on model design is proposed. The criterion is the guide vane outflow angle is larger than impeller installed angle at no-load working point at different guide vane opening. When the guide vane outflow angle is larger than runner blade geometry installed angle at leading edge (high pressure side), the “S” zone will be removed from operation zone. How to explain this phenomenon? In fact, when the guide vane outflow angle increases, the flow discharge increase, so the main flow at turbine direction covers the main passage and the instability source such as pumping effect (the partial flow is from runner to guide vane which is like the pump mode, but at the same time the main flow is turbine mode) is suppressed, finally the S-shaped is improved. © Open Archives of the 16th International Symposium on Transport Phenomena and Dynamics of Rotating Machinery, ISROMAC 2016.

Cryogenic storage temperatures make the suitable material selection for the construction of such applications difficult. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) thermoplastics are selected for this research to investigate their shear behavior performances with nanoadditives. Composites made of UHMWPE and carbon nano tubes (CNTs) are subjected to shear loading at room and liquid nitrogen (LN2) temperatures. Considering that UHMWPE films do not bond to other materials easily, significant attention is paid to selecting the correct manufacturing conditions to achieve good bonding between the CNT and the composite plies. Herein, paper formed of CNT, also known as CNT buckypaper (CNT BP), and melt mixed CNT/high density polyethylene (HDPE) are integrated to the structure. The results show that the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of UHMWPE composites improved 5% by interleaving the CNT BP with the lowest percentage which is 0.05 with respect to the reference and 8% by adding the melt mixed CNT/HDPE film at room temperature. Under the cryogenic condition, ILSS showed 3% increase with the CNT/HDPE film addition, but no improvement with the CNT BP addition. © 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Using the information of adsorption energy of alkali atoms at different adsorption sites of a germanene supercell, it has been observed that the position at the center of one of the hexagons of the honeycomb structure is the preferred site for the adsorption of the alkali atoms. On comparing adsorption energy per H2 molecule on pristine and alkali atoms-adsorbed germanene, we find that the presence of alkali atoms enhances the binding strength of H2 molecules. The adsorption energy of the H2 molecules to the alkali atoms is in the range of physisorption. The K-decorated germanene has the largest storage capacity, being able to bind up to seven H2 molecules. These results may lead to materials with more hydrogen storage capacity for use in alternative energy sources. © 2019 Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.All rights reserved.","2D materials; Density Functional Theory; Germanene; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy storage","Atoms; Calculations; Density functional theory; Environmental impact; Honeycomb structures; Hydrogen storage; Molecules; Physisorption; Adsorption energies; Adsorption properties; Alternative energy source; Binding strength; First-principles study; Geometrical structure; Hydrogen molecule; Hydrogen storage capacities; Gas adsorption",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083281152

It has been demonstrated that the silicon carbide (SiC) monolayer has a sp2 hybridization which makes it an alternative to graphene. In this work, the hydrogen adsorption properties of a silicon carbide monolayer decorated with alkali and alkaline earth metal atoms are analysed by means of first-principles calculations. The results suggest that the adatoms cause little distortion to the monolayer, and they tend to be adsorbed on sites above Si atoms. The adatoms act as adsorption sites for H2 molecules: up to seven molecules can be adsorbed by K, Mg and Ca. The adsorption energies suggest that H2 molecules are physisorbed over the decorated SiC monolayer, which means that no chemical bonds are created between H2 and the adatoms. This is beneficial because the breaking of chemical bonds, which would be needed to make use of the stored H2, is energetically expensive. These results add to a continuing effort to develop efficient means of reversible hydrogen storage. © 2019 Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.All rights reserved.","2D materials; Alkali metals; Density Functional Theory; Hydrogen storage; Silicon carbide","Adatoms; Alkaline earth metals; Alkalinity; Bond strength (chemical); Calculations; Environmental impact; Fuel cells; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Molecules; Silicon carbide; Adsorption energies; Alkaline earth metal atoms; Computational studies; First-principles calculation; Fuel cell system; Hydrogen adsorption; Silicon carbides (SiC); Surface-to-volume ratio; Monolayers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082739269

In this paper, we proposed a model predicted control (MPC) based demand-side building energy management framework in the energy-hub structure. Simulations in four scenarios with dynamic electricity price were conducted on a building to investigate the energy saving potential under the proposed framework. In scenario 1 and 2, building climate control and economic control were employed to track the indoor temperature setpoint and minimize the cost respectively. In the scenario 3, a typical demand response problem with electric storage device was studied while an additional on-site generation component was considered in scenario 4. The results demonstrate that scenario 2 can achieve 21% cost saving compared to scenario 1.

Water-based graphene oxide nanofluids with concentration of 20mg/(100ml) and 50mg/(100ml) are prepared by one-step method, and their zeta potential are measured by Laser Size and Zeta Potential Analyzer to analyze the stability of nanoparticles suspension. The correlation models of supercooling degree of deionized water and nanofluids with nucleation rate are established. According to the models, the supercooling degrees of deionized water and two nanofluids are obtained. The results show that the supercooling degree of nanofluid is reduced significantly, and compared to deionized water, the supercooling degrees of 20mg/(100ml) and 50mg/(100ml) nanofluids decrease by 74.8% and 90.3%, respectively. It can be concluded that the graphene oxide nanofluid can be a well alternative cold storage material for energy saving. © 2019 International Institute of Refrigeration.

During this period, up to 30% of the products are lost. The goal is to reduce the diseases, the product loss and energy consumption, in addition to increase shelf-life and storage period. Twenty-eight commercial root vegetable cold-stores were instrumented to measure air temperature, relative humidity and product temperature. The study was done over two years. The cold-stores were located in four different regions of Norway. The three focus-products carrot, swede and celeriac were harvested from one field in each region in open wire nets. The nets were placed in the various cold-stores in the respective regions and put in the wooden bins together with the producer's own products. The quality and yield of the products were determined and correlated to the storage condition.

This study investigates how different parameters related to the cooler cabinet and ice storage affect the autonomy time. A dynamic model of the vaccine cooler cabinet including the ice storage was used for the investigation. The model was calibrated using measurements from three different experimental setups, and the calibrated model showed a good agreement with the measurements. The results show that the mass of ice in the storage was the most promising parameter to consider for prolonging the autonomy time. Furthermore, it was shown that reduction of the thermal bridges in the cabinet also is of great importance. © 2019 International Institute of Refrigeration.

The use of a co-generation heat pump system enables the simultaneous production of both utilities within one single, electrically driven unit. Within this work, the addition of a tank system at the hot end of different heat pump systems was investigated. The tank system consists of a stratified storage tank for the storage of hot water and a smaller charge tank, which allows for multiple circulations of the water through the condenser. This leads to a gradual heating of the water, leading to a higher COP compared to heating in one step. Using numerical modelling and simulation, a screening was carried out investigating the influence of different working fluids and heat pump configurations, different temperature glides in the heat sink and different temperature lifts on the performance of the heat pump system. The largest improvement, compared to a conventional heat pump, was achieved with a one-stage heat pump with R600a, increasing the COP by 35 %. © 2019 International Institute of Refrigeration.

An adequate model is necessary to predict the behaviour of these systems. However, there is a scarce in detailed models available used to describe the performance of an ice storage evaporator and its use in a refrigeration cycle. Most existing models approximate the working principles with a steady analysis, not considering the sub cooling of ice and thickness distribution along the length. The developed model in this article uses a discretisation in length and radial direction together with an adapted thermal resistance matrix method to limit the calculation time. It has a great variability of boundary conditions and the ability to implement different types of refrigerants. The simulation results are in good agreement with the data of the manufacturer.

This paper proposes a layered and distributed control framework to address the optimal operation problem of distribution networks. We first introduce a 'DSO-aggregator-end users' architecture and formulate the corresponding optimization problem, where DSO communicates with aggregators and each aggregator interacts with its distributed end users, e.g., EVs and residential loads. Then, a layered and distributed algorithm based on dual decomposition is proposed, which divides the original problem into subproblems to be solved by agents in different layers. In this way, the computation and communication burden is relieved, and users' privacy is preserved. Finally, the IEEE 33-bus distribution system is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The traditional centralized modeling idea has higher requirements on model assumptions, communication parameters and market model, and has gradually failed to adapt to the demands of individual autonomous optimization. Therefore, a self-optimizing operation of DBESS using reinforcement learning is proposed, which could avert the intricacy that the centralized model is difficult to accurately physically model due to the above high requirements. Firstly, based on periodism and volatility of electricity price, the objective function was established for realizing maximum benefits by the help of storage aggregators; Secondly, Q-learning which is the most widely used reinforcement learning and considering the DBESS cost of a single call as iterative penalty function, to figure out the optimal charging/discharging strategy by iterative calculation. Thirdly, tested by the electricity prices of Ontario, Canada in 2018, the algorithm always keeps reasonable profitability with the different parameters of DBESS and gained more 40% earnings than Self-set price segmentation algorithm of DBESS.

Because of the limitation of superconducting material development level, the capacity of a single SMES can hardly meet the energy storage demand at present, so the energy storage of the power system needs a distributed layout. Modular superconducting magnetic energy storage system (M-SMES) can effectively improve the utilization and economy of SMES by rationally configuring its capacity and planning its layout. For the typical micro-grid with renewable power generation, an optimization method for configuring capacity and planning location of M-SMES is proposed and verified by a case. Firstly, a multi-objective mathematical optimization model is established. Then the capacity and steady-state layout of M-SMES are optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the function of SMES is verified in transient analysis. Finally, a micro-grid with renewable power generation - three-generator and nine-bus system is taken as a case to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed M-SMES capacity and layout optimization scheme. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The multi-terminal flexible interconnected distribution network can realize power interaction and power mutual support between the AC systems based on the DC power distribution center, which provides the possibility of multi-end load optimization. In order to fully consider the multi-objective optimization problem of economic benefits such as Peak Load Shifting optimization in flexible interconnected power distribution networks, this paper proposes a research on Peak Load Shifting optimization technology based on flexible interconnected power distribution network. Aiming at the effect of Peak Load Shifting, and the economics of time-sharing electricity price, a multi-objective optimization model of Peak Load Shifting based on flexible distribution network based on energy storage system was constructed. Considering the difference in the dimensions of the sub-objective functions, the multi-objective problem is optimized by adjusting the dimension function of the sub-objects to the dimensionless function through the normalization idea.

However, the conventional scope of DR with only electricity carrier cannot fully explore the interaction capability due to users' must-run loads. By integrating various forms of energy, smart energy hubs (SEHs) make it possible for more users to flexibly participate in DR programs. In this paper, we explore the flexibility of this novel vision, termed as integrated demand response (IDR). An SEH model is formulated comprised of various kinds of distributed energy resources (DERs) including plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), photovoltaic systems and gas-fired micro-turbines. With the help of the internet of things technology, an SEH can manage these DERs to bid in electricity markets without violating electric load. In the SEH, a number of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)enabled PEVs are aggregated to act as a controllable battery storage, thereby further improving the responsive capability of IDR. A two-stage stochastic market bidding model is developed to schedule the operation of the SEH against the uncertainties in PEVs, solar power and market prices. Case studies based on real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed market bidding framework. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Lately, MMC based battery energy storage system (MMC-BESS) has been introduced with batteries integrated into the submodules. This paper provides a comparison between the MMC-HVDC and MMC-BESS structures with half-bridge submodule topology. It focuses on the dynamic performance of MMC-BESS and the special features of its modulation method, main circuit voltage level, connection inductor, and submodule voltage control. MMC-HVDC requires circulating current control, inrush current control and submodule voltage equalization while the MMC-BESS only requires state of charge (SOC) control for battery units integrated into a submodule.

It is found that, in CSG, there is no scenario where BES is competitive to facilitate renewable energy accommodation due to low utilization. The initial investment of BES is huge and the payback period is very long. In comparison, most of abandoned wind and solar power could have been accommodated by building additional substations or altering operation mode of existing substations with much lower cost. In the future, BES could become competitive when curtailment of renewable generation is more evenly distributed through a year and the cost of batteries declines. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It can improve system performance and power supply reliability, and is advantageous to the complementary advantages and coordination control between various micro-sources. Ring topology is adopted with more flexibility and higher reliability. Then three different operation modes are proposed, that is energy storage voltage regulation mode, wind/pv power reduction mode, and load shedding mode. According to the regulation of DC voltage operating range, the voltage segment control strategy is proposed, to ensure energy storage units, power generation unit and loads are all involved in the coordinated control. They can adjust the DC voltage automatically according to their priorities. For multiple energy storage units, droop coefficient of droop control is adjusted dynamically based on load power share. In addition, control methods of converters in each voltage segment are analyzed to meet different operation requirements, such as changes of wind speed, intensity of light and loads, or energy storage reaching limit value. The control strategy can be extended to other distributed power-based DC microgrids.

Unified droop control strategy can ensure better stability of the system, but it has poor dynamic regulation ability for stochastic fluctuating power and has steady-state error. Based on the analysis of the relationship between the output impedance of the converter and the system inertia of the DC grid and the influence of the system inertia on the control characteristics of the DC grid, this paper proposes a control strategy to change the virtual system inertia by changing droop coefficient. Changing the virtual inertia of the system by adjusting the output impedance of the converter through exchanging the state information of online converters by low-speed communication, improves the dynamic and steady-state control characteristics of the system.

Secondly, as unidirectional variation of SOC in a single time step, the BESS life loss can be calculated through integration of the life loss coefficient-SOC relation function. A linear BESS life loss calculation model is established through self-optimal piecewise linearization of the primitive function of the life loss coefficient-SOC relation function. Thirdly, the proposed life loss calculation model is incorporated in the BESS-integrated wind farm scheduled power tracking optimization. Case studies demonstrate that with the proposed method, the BESS life loss item can be incorporated in the optimization model effectively, and the scheduled power tracking cost of the BESS-integrated wind farm can be determined and optimized more comprehensively. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In view of this, the physical accessibility of solar and wind resources has encouraged the application of RETs in the microgrid (MG) systems. The feasibility assessment of a MG system is investigated in this work with the aim of promoting the photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) and battery storage system (BSS) for power generation application in a standalone MG system. The optimal configuration of a MG system is achieved with the application of an fmincon optimization function. The research work is carried out by using a typical load profile of low-medium sized residential buildings in Cape Town, South Africa. This study is designed to evaluate the technical and financial viability of a MG system. This leads to the minimization of the net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) as well as the maximization of cost of net energy purchased, benefit and benefit-cost ratio (BCR).

Therefore, an experimental investigation with latent heat thermal energy storage, utilizing sodium nitrate (NaNO3) with a melting point of 306 °C as phase change material, was carried out in the present study. The heat source and sink for the experimental setup is a thermal oil plant using Therminol VP1® as heat transfer fluid. To increase the heat flux into the storage material, a bimetal tube consisting of a circular steel tube and an aluminum tube with fins was used. The storage operates around the melting point to use the enthalpy of fusion as primary storage mechanism. The temperature distribution in the storage is measured, as well as the heat transfer fluid temperatures and mass flow. For the experiment a novel fin-geometry, based on the combination of transversal and longitudinal fins, was introduced. A more than 40 % lower melting time compared to former fin geometries (equal bimetal tube with only longitudinal fins) was observed. The heat transmission coefficient from the heat transfer fluid into the storage material was determined. Storage parameters like power, capacity and heat losses to the surrounding were logged. Different mass flows of the heat transfer fluid and different temperature spreads were tested in order to determine the storage behavior. Reliable storage parameters for the latent thermal energy storage were gained. © 2019 Begell House Inc.

Taking BESS as the research object, a plug-and-play information interaction mechanism is established according to IEC61850 communication model and protocol mapping. The mechanism is based on information modeling and self-description of the terminal-layer device. The mapping relationship between IEC61850 meta-model and IEC60870-5-104 protocol is formed by extending IEC61850 meta-model. The heterogeneous model mapping and data conversion module is designed for interactive data conversion between IEC61850 information and IEC61968 message. In this way, the information interaction path between the master station layer and the terminal layer is formed. On that basis, a plug-and-play information interaction architecture is established. The architecture consists of three parts: the monitoring master station layer, the distributed terminal layer and the communication network. Taking a typical feeder segment from distribution network as a case, the consistency test is conducted to verify the validity of the self-describing information and the information interaction mechanism. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are being considered as a countermeasure for this issue. Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) is expected as a promising topology for large capacity BESSs because the state of charge (SOC) of battery clusters can be controlled independently by H-bridge power units, and the harmonic current of the system is low enough to remove the ac filter. This paper describes the development of the Y-connection CHB-BESS and a power control strategy for the BESS. A real-scale 2MW/10kV CHB-BESS was constructed in Shenzhen, China and its successful operation verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Based on the system, the power control strategy was verified by three parts of the experiment, which are decoupling power control test, emergency shutdown test and step response test.

From the perspective of how to use the battery energy storage system (BESS) to smooth the wind power fluctuation, the control scheme for two BESSs using the alternative charging/discharging strategy to smooth the wind power fluctuation is proposed at first. Then, the design method for determining the capacity of the two BESSs based on the statistics of wind power fluctuation is studied. Due to the adaptive neural network (ANN) has the excellent ability in setting up the non-linear mapping between the input and output of the controlled object whose model is difficult for building, the ANN is therefore used to generate the reference command for BESSs smoothing the short-term and strongly random wind power fluctuation. At the same time, the improved method for adaptively adjusting the weight of neurons based on modifying deviation latch is proposed to improve the accuracy of ANN on predicting the short term wind power fluctuation. Finally, both the feasibility of both the proposed charging and discharging strategy in saving the battery cycle life and the effectiveness of the proposed ANN control strategy in smoothing the short-term wind power fluctuation is validated by simulating in the improved 11-bus wind power system. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Maintaining the voltage at load connection is one of the critical aspects of voltage regulation in the isolated microgrid. The power generation from renewable generators is not constant as well as load parameters. Also, the power flow control between renewable generators is another major issue in an isolated microgrid. In this study, the intelligent fuzzy-logic based inverter control (FLIC) is used to regulate the voltage at the load connected considered the change in load-parameter and variation in the renewable power generation. The power output from the renewable generators is converted in DC to make the DC-bus, which helps to maintain the power flow control between renewable generators and battery storage. The variation in the DC bus voltage is kept within acceptable limit using PI battery controller.

Legacy plants have qualified, aged cable near retirement or life extension and may require condition monitoring. Some of the new cable designs have improved materials, construction and advancements. Regulations have been developed and improved upon for various reasons to better assure public safety. There have been examples of gaps - but still in compliance - in considering the Technical or the Quality requirements of the Environmental Qualification to which the cable is qualified, how well the Environment was defined, how it the cable was installed. Examples discussed include risks from shipping, storage or installation of cable, cable submergence as an unforeseen environment and the post LOCA severe accident condition.

The ROV robot is used for stretching and is distributed by the motor to drive the drum to rotate. In order to ensure the reliability of long-distance data transmission and simplify the circuit, the design uses RS-485 (RS-485 is a serial bus standard that uses balanced transmit and differential receive.) for communication, and the data is transmitted to the upper computer for reconstruction to obtain the terrain of the test mining area. In the end, two experiments were designed to simulate the operation of the device on the seabed, which proved that the device can work normally under the complicated conditions of the seabed. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).","Gas hydrate; MEMS accelerometer; Submarine terrain monitoring; Terrain reconstruction","Accelerometers; Arctic engineering; Digital storage; Hydration; Landforms; Submarines; System buses; Topography; Winches; Green energy sources; Marine environment; MEMS accelerometer; Multiple sensors; Online monitoring; Pressure chamber; Seabed topography; Submarine operations; Gas hydrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079821496

It typically refers to two types of interventions: the first pertaining to interventions on the building envelope, for instance by enhancing the thermal insulation of a building’s walls, and the second to energy system replacements. The latter includes not only the installation of a more efficient heating system, with the necessary capacity to meet the building's heat demands, but also the integration of renewable energy technologies and energy storage. Thus, there is a huge array of retrofit measure combinations to select from with different economic and environmental impacts. Even though there are tools and methodologies to handle the complex problem of deriving optimal retrofit solutions, they typically require increased level of expertise and highly heterogeneous building data, which are usually not available or challenging to obtain. As a result, building owners can find themselves in a quandary about how to further proceed with retrofitting their buildings. In this paper, we answer the question whether a machine-learning algorithm could be used as a surrogate model that can: (a) mimic the functionality of the retrofit process, and (b) derive near-optimal solutions with the use of building features that can be easily extracted, such as the building's ground floor area or age. To answer this question an artificial neural network-based model is trained with data collected from the case study of the city of Zurich. Results show that the proposed approach can approximate very well some dimensions of the building retrofit, such as the retrofit costs (R2 ≅ 0.971) and the energy system selection (f1 score ≅ 0.894), while for others, such as the electricity storage capacity (R2 ≅ 0.505), there is still room for improvement. Such surrogate retrofit models can be more easily shared with building owners, and can contribute towards accelerating the adoption of retrofit measures. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

Storage devices utilizing such PCMs can be used in power-to-heat-to-power (P2H2P) systems, to store heat in high temperature and use it for electricity production. Prior to manufacturing such a device, there is a necessity to scrutinize the complex heat transfer mechanisms occurring during the phase change of the contained PCM and indicate a flexible vessel design that enables quick charge/discharge rates and low heat losses during storage period. The CFD model, which is developed in Fluent v17.0 platform, combines the volume of fluid method with the enthalpy porosity approach and an adaptive local grid refinement method, able to achieve a sharp gas/PCM and solid/liquid PCM interface. In contrast to analytical or other CFD models available in the literature, this one takes into account the PCM volume change during solidification/melting, possible dendrites formation and buoyancy-driven natural convection effect on heat transfer mechanisms. Numerical results unveil that the system charge/discharge rates are highly dependent on the PCM permeability and vessel design. Between five shapes investigated, i.e. cylinder, cube, truncated cone, sphere and cut-off sphere, of volume Vvessel=3.75E-03 m3, the truncated cone is the most suitable solution for a P2H2P application, considering design flexibility, melting rates and heat losses. Actually, the PCM melting time achieved with the cone is 21% quicker compared to sphere and only 6% slower compared to cube; the latter is the optimum geometry, as concerns charge rates, but it should be avoided because of its excess lateral losses during storage period. During discharging, when heat is extracted from the vessel bottom, the truncated cone results in the lowest solidification rates, almost 50% lower than the cut-off sphere, which is the optimum shape in terms of discharge rates. Nevertheless, the truncated-cone discharge rates can be further improved by altering its height, without increasing its volume. In practice, the current model is of high accuracy and can give optimization guidelines for the design of such and similar LHTES systems. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

A driving pattern is the way drivers drive their vehicles in a region and it is related to the human aspect involved in the vehicles usage. Driving patterns are described trough characteristic parameters (CPs) which are variables resulting from any combination of speed-time such as the average speed, average positive acceleration, among others. Thus, it is customary to describe how people drive in a given city specifying their average speed and average acceleration. However, it is still unknown which set of CPs properly describe the driving patterns. Driving patterns are also described by driving cycles (DCs). They are speed-time series that can also be described by their characteristic parameters (CP*s). Then a DC represents a driving pattern when CPi=CP*i. Existing DCs are used by carmakers to evaluate the performance of their vehicles as part of the regulatory process to sell a new vehicle technology in a market. However, the DCs currently used by carmakers do not represent the local driving patterns. The correct description of driving patterns is a requirement to assess the real energy and environmental performance of the vehicles in that region. Errors in the description of the driving patterns have led to large differences between fuel consumption and the emissions reported by manufacturers and the observed in the normal use of the vehicles. This study focus in the identification of the minimum CPs that properly describe a driving pattern, from the point of view of their use to correctly evaluate the vehicle energy consumption and tailpipe emissions. Twenty-five widely used CPs were considered. We used measurement data of fuel consumption, emissions and speed, of a fleet of 15 vehicles operating in two different urban regions during two months. Using that database, we constructed the representative DCs using Micro-trips method and selecting any combination of 2 or 3 CPs as assessment criteria. We also used the methodology proposed by [1] to evaluate the degree of representativeness of the resulting DCs. More than 1140 iterations where performed considering different combinations of CPs. Results showed that by using standard deviation of the acceleration, the percentage of time in idling, the average speed and the vehicle specific power (VSP) as CPs as assessment criteria, the resulting DC represents the driving pattern in the region of interest with an average-average relative difference (ARD - ) lower than 10%. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

Lyngby, Denmark","A future fossil-free energy system based on intermittent renewable energy sources will require efficient and flexible large-scale electricity storage systems, as well as alternative solutions for the heating and transport sector. Electricity storage systems using reversible solid oxide cells (SOCs) have shown to be promising solutions for large-scale electricity storage, in terms of cost and efficiency. The combination of pressurized SOCs and catalytic reactors is a particularly interesting option, enabling the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) during electrolysis mode and allowing the use of the existing natural gas infrastructures for SNG storage. In fuel cell operating mode, the natural gas is reconverted to electricity and the produced CO2 is stored in an underground cavern for later use in electrolysis mode. Previous analysis indicate this solution can achieve roundtrip efficiencies of up to 80%. In this work, a hybrid electricity storage system using pressurized solid oxide cells and a biomass gasifier is analyzed by thermodynamic modelling. By using the syngas produced by a gasifier in both fuel cell mode and electrolysis mode, the system has the ability to produce extra SNG, which is not reused in fuel cell mode, and can be used instead for transportation or industrial processes. This also means that the operational time in electrolysis mode will be greater than the operational time in fuel cell mode, and by adjusting the size of the gasifier, the system can match the need of the electricity grid – e.g. 80% of the time in electrolysis mode and 20% of the time in fuel cell mode. Finally, it is expected that the system will operate non-stop, as it can choose to operate in part-load based on only converting the syngas to either SNG or power. Compared with the pure electricity storage system, the system design is simplified, as a pre-reformer is not needed in fuel cell mode as syngas is mixed with the SNG input. The SOC operating conditions are also improved. The results show that the overall syngas to SNG upgrading efficiency of the hybrid system is 87-88 % for different input syngas mass flows, which is higher than for syngas upgrading by hydrogen addition and methanation to SNG, which has a maximum upgrading efficiency of 78 %. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

However, the physical solvents regeneration is carried out at the same temperature as the absorption, whereas the chemical solvents require higher regeneration temperature. Thus, in both cases, the solvent regeneration is an energy consuming process. The theoretical work necessary to remove CO2 from the synthesis gas is small, but the real energy consumption in separation processes is much higher than the theoretical work consumption. As the chemical solvent regeneration is mainly a low temperature heat consuming process, while the physical solvent regeneration is power consuming, a thermodynamically correct comparison of the efficiency of these two processes could be made only by exergy method. An exergy-based approach is used also to estimate and compare some aspects of the environmental impact, namely the cumulative exergy of natural resources consumed in the process itself and also in the power and heat generation, including these for obtaining of concentrated CO2, ready for storage and/or utilization in other chemical processes. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

Especially, hot water systems are dominating the solar-thermal market with non-pumped systems gaining more and more importance. In recent years attempts have been made to open up a mass market for solar thermal energy and thereby promote the use of renewable energies with novel, more cost-effective materials, and production processes. For emerging markets in developing countries, the competitors of solar thermal systems are in the main wood stoves, gas- and electric boilers or ‘cheap’ Chinese thermosiphon systems. These water heaters either have a negative environmental impact, are too expensive in costs of purchase or too expensive in costs of operation or have a rather short product lifetime. To address these markets, it is vital to provide an affordable ultra-low-cost system with high reliability and low technology. A system suitable for compact distribution and easy installation. To put it in a nutshell, this system must be a very simple thermosiphon system based on cheap polymeric membrane technology for both, the absorber and the storage.

The European Union has set climate goals targeting 80-95 % GHG emission reductions by 2050. There is a strong focus on reducing CO2 emissions from transport fuels. Refining industry can effectively contribute by gradually transitioning to e.g. new feedstock's hence reducing product-related CO2 emissions (in combination with more efficient vehicles); integration with chemicals; further increasing CO2 efficiency in refineries and Green Hydrogen. The Concawe study explores these so-called Low-Carbon Pathways with the potential to reduce the CO2 emissions associated with the production and the use refined oil products [Concawe, 2018]. Options for CO2 emission reduction in refining are e.g. energy efficiency, low carbon electricity and carbon-capture &amp; storage (CCS) and carbon-capture &amp; usage (CCU). CO2 emissions savings up to 70 % towards 2050 could be possible. Other pathways explored for future refining are e.g. the use of green hydrogen and the impact of fuel quality and bio-feedstock into the refinery. The use of advanced biofuels will play a significant role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transport. This paper being a summary of the FuelsEurope Vision 2050 [FuelsEurope, 2018] presents the latest results of the ongoing study by Concawe showing possible pathways and CO2 reduction potential for EU refining, site-specific factors will determine individual refineries preferred routes to contribute.

However, it does not give detailed information about energy flow in the drilling system and lacks the resolution to identify the root cause of energy loss. The drilling operation is a dynamic process. Energy input may be from a surface-drive system (top drive or rotary table) or a mud motor placed downhole. In a perfect world, all of the energy is used to drill the rock. However, some of the input energy may reside in the drillstring as strain and kinetic energy due to the deformation and motion of the drillstring. Drilling energy is dissipated due to shock, vibration, fluid damping, and frictional contact between the drillstring and wellbore. A novel method has been developed to calculate the drilling energy flow in the drillstring and to enable better drilling energy management by maximizing useful energy consumption and reducing energy waste. The method provides a new way to understand and improve drilling efficiency. The method is based on an advanced transient drilling dynamics model which simulates the full drilling system from surface to bit. The entire drillstring is meshed using 3D beam elements, and its dynamic response history is solved by the finite element method (FEM). The energy input can be calculated from surface drilling parameters, such as torque, rotation speed, flow rate, and motor differential pressure. With the simulated history of forces and dynamics of the drillstring, the corresponding strain energy and kinetic energy of the drillstring can be evaluated. The detailed cutting structure model can provide insight on the energy amount consumed by the rock cutting action of the bit and reamer. Putting all the components together leads to a holistic calculation workflow of drilling energy. Field case studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of this method. The studies showed the drillstring strain energy and kinetic energy are good performance indicators for drillstring reliability and stability because these energy variables reflect the severity of loading and vibration in the drillstring. The energy variables possess clear signatures for interpretation of different downhole vibration modes. Currently, the drilling efficiency is normally evaluated by MSE, which represents the amount of energy needed to remove a unit volume of rock using the surface drilling data. In this study, the energy loss is calculated to understand the percentage of input energy dissipated due to the interaction of the drillstring with the environment. In contrast to MSE, the calculation provides a more direct and detailed measurement of drilling efficiency. It gives a methodology for understanding detailed energy flow in the drilling system under different drilling vibration modes. It can be applied to bit selection, bottomhole assembly (BHA) design, and drilling parameter optimization to achieve better drilling energy management and improve drilling efficiency. The novel approach calculates drilling energy based on the transient dynamics simulation of the full drilling system. It provides a detailed and holistic view of drilling energy input, propagation, and consumption. This method could help identify the inefficient drilling conditions and optimize drilling operation through evaluating and comparing different options. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Bottom-hole assembly; Computer aided software engineering; Digital storage; Drills; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Oil wells; Strain energy; Waste management; Differential pressures; Drilling efficiency; Drilling operation; Drilling parameters; Mechanical specific energies; Performance indicators; Reliability and stability; Transient dynamics; Infill drilling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079180263

Budget reductions on national organizations and growing interests of private organizations result in a space program with increasing interest on commercial opportunities. Self-sustainability and profitability are now keywords in the space business. In this direction the Lunar In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) is rising interest among agencies. The ISRU program allows the reduction of mass transportation and storage costs, by extracting and manipulating the resources directly in situ, and the Moon represents the closest opportunity to establish a scientific outpost that will later make way to permanent and self-sufficient settlements. ESA called for a Commercial ISRU Mission Preparation Phase A/B1 Study and for technologies demonstrations needed to establish ISRU outposts on the Moon by 2025. Space Applications Services is actively involved in this opportunity, on one side as payload developer and on the other side to perform a study for defining a cost effective lunar mission operations concept. The study is planned to provide its final outcome by the end of 2019, and it is the subject of this paper. Revenue and cost reduction are the key components of the profitability of a project. ISRU missions attract new type of customers that were not looking at space opportunities before. Mining, energy and material manipulation companies are now looking at space opportunities, together with a renewed interest from academic and research organizations. At the same time, new technologies, synergy and re-utilization, and in-house systems take a key role in reducing the costs of mission operations. Today technology allows more automation and the use of Artificial Intelligence. Re-utilization includes the use of Open-Source software, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) elements and the synergy with other missions, such as sharing Operations Centre and experienced operators. After a brief introduction to the overall concept of ISRU and the study, the paper will present the outcome of the analysis to achieve a cost-effective operations concept describing the various aspects, including the applicability to smaller and staged missions. It will also address the more general operations challenges and typical cost drivers. Copyright © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Continuous permeability logs in these wells are typically derived using tools that measure electrical, nuclear, magnetic or acoustic signals, using empirical relations that are often formation dependent. The permeability logs derived using these empirical relations often show significant differences when compared to the permeabilities obtained from core samples or well tests. A new technique is proposed in this paper in which the open hole is scanned with an interface between two fluids with a large viscosity contrast. The injection rate into the formation depends on interface location and well pressure history. An inverse problem is solved to estimate permeability as a function of depth from the evolution of flow rates with time. During the test, the well is equipped with a central tube, typically a drill string, and the scanning is done by injecting in the central tube a liquid that is different from the liquid in the annulus, at a constant wellhead pressure. Injection and withdrawal rates are measured at the tubing and the annulus wellheads, respectively; the difference between these two rates gives the formation injection rate. Interface location is also estimated from the flow rates and pressure at the wellhead and an injection profile in the open hole is derived. A permeability log is derived from this injection log by considering a radial, monophasic flow in each layer and same skin value for all formation layers. Initial formation pressure and storativity, estimated from other logs, are also used as inputs. The sensitivity of the permeability log to these inputs is estimated using analytical expressions. The proposed methodology is applicable to oil or water bearing formations drilled using oil or water-based muds, respectively. A continuous permeability log is estimated from the synthetic test data using the proposed interpretation workflow; it shows a correlation of 0.95 (on a scale of 0 to 1) when compared to the input permeability log. A laboratory model that mimics a multi-layered formation is used to study the repeatability of the technique and the validity of the uniform skin assumption by creating a mudcake at the inner radius. Four consecutive tests were performed on the same set of samples and the interpreted permeability logs are compared to the benchmark permeability log; correlations are greater than 0.94. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Aquifers; Drill strings; Geothermal energy; Infill drilling; Inverse problems; Oil bearing formations; Oil well logging; Oil wells; Well pressure; Well testing; Wellheads; Analytical expressions; Constant pressures; Empirical relations; Formation pressure; Interface locations; Viscosity contrast; Water bearing formation; Wellhead pressures; Acoustic logging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079159629

One key element for the development of such facilities will be energy, in terms of its generation, storage, distribution, and usage. Space conditions, in particular, those of the Moon and Mars, impose restrictions to the implementation of some of the traditional energy generation methods on Earth, which has led to the development and use of alternatives such as solar panels and nuclear thermoelectric generation. For future human settlements, redundancy will be fundamental, apart from systems such as Oxygen generation and heating that have a brief natural buffer, electric supply is key for a station. It is important to consider the fact, within varying architectures, that different systems are vulnerable to different phenomena, and can endanger the mission, as recently happened to the Mars Rover Opportunity. This work presents the different current options for energy generation for human settlements in planetary surfaces. Three topics were reviewed for this work, first, the size of energy requirements on a planetary station is made, as well as a prospect for usage distribution, including life support systems, research systems, and future systems for in situ manufacturing, among others. Second, energy systems used currently and in the past, with their possible expansion towards the future, and their usability in Moon and Mars missions, stating their advantages, as well as their vulnerabilities. Next, future concepts for space energy generation -understood as systems that have not been used on space broadly or are currently prototypes or concepts- are also presented. Finally, a parametric measurement is proposed, considering metrics such as capacity, complexity, required maintenance, in order to generate a viable comparison, which would allow for an easier selection of systems within architectures for planetary stations. As a result, this review brings together a panorama of the alternatives for the development of space architecture concepts for future settlements on planetary surfaces.

Based on the manned lunar exploration mission, the characteristics of pressure control were analyzed for the uniform heating of the orbit transfer vehicle and the non-uniform periodic external heat flow. In order to explore the influence of non-uniform heating on the operating characteristics of liquid hydrogen TVS, the proportion of the heating amount of the corresponding wall in the gas phase zone is 30% and 60% respectively. Under the condition of constant total heat leakage, the temperature change of the air pillow is more sensitive, frequent exhaust times, the relative amount of single-discharge is relatively reduced, but the amount of exhaust loss under the two conditions is unchanged with time, obeying the law of conservation of energy, that is, in the thermodynamic exhaust mode. The effect of uniform heat leakage on the total amount of final evaporation is small. The main reason is that the gas-liquid heat-mass exchange intensity increases under the action of TVS, which breaks the balance of the original self-pressurization process and weakens the influence of non-uniform heat leakage. Further analysis of the influence of different working fluids such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen on the pressure control characteristics, the effect of TVS on the pressure control of the low temperature tank under various working conditions was obtained by one dimensional calculation. The self-pressurization law was affected by the liquid mass and the initial period. The effect of coldness is very obvious. In the short term, the liquid oxygen weight scale and subcooling become important advantages of evaporation control. Therefore, considering the engineering practice and cost, liquid hydrogen should adopt TVS technology, while liquid oxygen needs more consideration of the full over-cooling method to improve its own cold storage capacity and delay the on-orbit storage time.

Also, cost, operability and material availability must be considered. Metal combustion has been studied since the 1960s as a viable solution for propulsion, power and storage systems. Metals can react with air, carbon dioxide or water to generate thermal and chemical energy for various applications. These reactions generate metal-oxides when metals are reacting with air, hydrogen when reacting with water and carbon monoxide as well as a small amount of carbon when reacting with carbon dioxide. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate relevant, recent alternatives for developing clean energy with high performances based on metal-air reactions, metal-water reactions that can generate hydrogen as a secondary fuel; or even metal-carbon dioxide reactions that can be conducted on-site in Mars for exploration missions. The main combustion and propulsion characteristics of these metal fuels are numerically investigated through the Rocket Propulsion Analysis software and compared. When metals are reacting with air or iced water, metal-oxides can be captured and recycled to achieve low-net-carbon emissions while hydrogen can act as a secondary fuel to enhance combustion. Such fuels can be applied for Earth to Orbit missions and Moon missions. Metal fuels can also react with carbon dioxide which is the main component of the atmosphere of Mars. The optimum oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio is typically that which will deliver the highest engine performance, however, in some situations a different O/F ratio results in a better overall system. A high value of specific impulse means that the propellant is more efficient at producing thrust and that less is the consumed quantity. Therefore, it is true that the engine with the higher specific impulse is more efficient because it produces more thrust for the same amount of propellant.

Despite their lightness, ARSWs carry very high live loads, by far higher than their self-weight, in contrast to what happens in typical civil engineering structures. Thus, standard design approaches are not applicable, especially when one considers lateral loading, i.e. seismic and wind loading. In the frame of the STEELWAR project, the behavior factor (q) as well as the seismic fragility shall be assessed for a number of archetype warehouses. FEM modelling for such structures is a tedious task; they consist of hundreds or thousands steel members and nodes connected to each other through simple and semirigid joints. Modern computers accompanied with efficient computational algorithms can handle linear systems with ease and thus, linear analysis can be performed by including all structural components in the analysis model. Problems arise when one considers nonlinear phenomena i.e. material and geometric nonlinearity. Simulations that take into account all ARSW members and their nonlinear response may lead to prohibitive computational costs, while introducing convergence and numerical stability problems. As a direct remedy, a reduced-order physical model is proposed that enables accurate assessment of nonlinear behavior without compromising convergence performance. © 2019 The authors.","Automated rack supported warehouses; Nonlinear analysis; Pallet racking systems; Simplified models; Steel racks","Computational efficiency; Engineering geology; Linear systems; Seismic design; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Warehouses; Civil engineering structures; Computational algorithm; Convergence performance; Geometric non-linearity; Non-linear phenomena; Racking systems; Steel racks; Structural component; Nonlinear analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079088955

A prototype was successfully manufactured using 3D printing technology. This continuously evolving technology enables the rapid production of prosthetics that are individually customized for each patient. Our prototype was developed after conducting a topology optimization study that interestingly converged to the shape of the biological human foot. Afterwards, a design was envisioned where a simple energy storage and release mechanism was implemented to replace the Achilles tendon, which minimizes the metabolic energy cost of walking. Our mechanism can successfully manage 70% of the energy compared to a normal person during each walking step. A finite element (FE) model of the prosthetic was developed and validated using experimental tests. Then, this FE model was used to confirm the safe operation of the prosthetic through simulating different loading scenarios according to the ISO standard. Our study clearly showed that customizable prosthetics could be produced at a fraction 1/60 of the cost of the commercially sold ones.

Smart electrochromic windows that used for building exterior wall will largely reduce building energy consumption, which can regulate heat entering the building by controlling the transmittance of light, thereby reducing the consumption of air conditioning and lighting equipment. Electrochromic device (ECD) refers to the external alternating electric field that controls the ion movement inside the device to change the microstructure, and then changes the light transmittance of the device within a certain wavelength, showing color change in appearance. In this paper, a triple-layered ECD based on multifunctional hydrogel is proposed, which consists of hydrogel layer, electrochromic layer and electrode layer. The single hydrogel layer simultaneously processes good conductivity and high ion mobility, replacing the conductive layer, ion storage layer and electrolyte layer in traditional ECD, which simplify the device architecture and then greatly reduce the production cost. The transmittance of hydrogel is about 95%, which greatly improves the transmittance of the transparent state of the device, in favor of the better performance. Amorphous tungsten trioxide (WO3) was used for the EC layer, prepared by sol-gel method. Compared with magnetron sputtering and electrochemical deposition, this sol-gel method is more simple, lower cost and more stable material properties. The assembled ECDs have 80% contrast at a wavelength of 800 nm at a voltage of -2.8 v, which is higher than most ECDs. For the characteristic of light transmittance modulation of electrochromic devices, which can be used in intelligent chromic window, reflector mirrors, display equipment and so on. This proves a way to develop an electrochromic device with high contrast, low production cost and fast response time. © 2019 SPIE.","Electrochromic; Hydrogel; Sol-gel method; Tungsten trioxide","Air conditioning; Costs; Electric fields; Electrochemical deposition; Electrochemical sensors; Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Electrolytes; Energy utilization; Global warming; Hydrogels; Ions; Light; Reduction; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Storage (materials); Tungsten compounds; Alternating electric field; Building energy consumption; Device architectures; Electrochromic layers; Electrochromic windows; Electrochromics; Protection of the environments; Tungsten trioxide; Display devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077968561

However, each request has to go through each layer across the I/O stack, which moves tremendous irrelevant data between secondary storage, DRAM, and the on-chip cache. This leads to high response latency and rising energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose Cognitive SSD, an energy-efficient engine for deep learning based unstructured data retrieval. In Cognitive SSD, a flash-accessing accelerator named DLG-x is placed by the side of flash memory to achieve near-data deep learning and graph search. Such functions of in-SSD deep learning and graph search are exposed to the users as library APIs via NVMe command extension. Experimental results on the FPGA-based prototype reveal that the proposed Cognitive SSD reduces latency by 69.9% on average in comparison with CPU based solutions on conventional SSDs, and it reduces the overall system power consumption by up to 34.4% and 63.0% respectively when compared to CPU and GPU based solutions that deliver comparable performance. © Proceedings of the 2019 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, USENIX ATC 2019.

Silicon Pore Optics (SPO) are a new type of X-ray optics enabling future X-ray observatories such as Athena and are being developed at cosine with ESA as well as academic and industrial partners. These high-performance, modular, lightweight yet stiff, high-resolution X-ray optics shall allow missions to reach an unprecedentedly large effective area of several square meters, operating in the 0.2 to 12 keV band with an angular resolution better than 5 arc seconds. As the development of Athena mission progresses, it is necessary to validate the SPO technology under launch conditions. To this end, ruggedisation and environmental testing studies are being conducted to ensure mechanical stability and optical performance of the optics before, during and after launch. At cosine, a facility with shock, vibration, tensile strength, long time storage and thermal testing equipment has been set up to test SPO mirror module components for compliance with the upcoming Ariane launch vehicle and the mission requirements.

Therefore, the improvement of the BESS operational reliability is of great significance to ensure the operation safety of the grid. However, the BESS is composed of a large number of batteries. This fact suggests the BESS reliability depends not only on the battery operating state but also on the strategy of battery networking reconfiguration. In this paper, the analysis of the operational reliability research of largescale BESS is carried out in-depth. The research status of reliability of large-scale BESS is investigated, and some thoughts on the obstacles to the BESS operational reliability evaluation are given.

The renewable energy (solar and wind power) induces a fluctuating component of the electrical grid. The solution to compensate fluctuating energy is provided by the hydraulic turbines in order to produce energy in a short time and the pumps units in order to use the energy excess. In order to ensure higher flow rate for the storage pumps, the units have constructive differences besides regular. Consequently, the complex shape of the suction-elbow with symmetrical geometry generates unsteady flows which are ingested by the impeller. These phenomena induce stronger unsteady flow conditions, such as stall, wakes, turbulence and pressure fluctuations, which affect the overall behavior of the pump providing vibration, noise and radial and axial forces on the rotor. Alternatively, an axial rotor can be installed in front of the impeller. In this case, the flow non-uniformity will be decreased and the static pressure will be increased at the pump impeller inlet. Consequently, the efficiency behavior practically remains unchanged while the cavitational behavior is improved. Recently, a new concept was explored in order to assess the cavitational behavior on a wide range operation of the pump. The new concept proposes variable speed for the axial rotor, while the speed of the pump impeller remains constant. Accordingly, this new concept is experimentally and numerically investigated in the paper. First, the paper presents the 3D numerical investigation of the pump impeller combined with an axial rotor. The axial rotor is investigated at variable speed (between 2000 and 3000 rpm) while the pump impeller has constant speed of 2500 rpm. The minimum static pressure and the static pressure coefficient are analyzed in order to assess the new method. Second the mechanical design of the solution, for testing on the laboratory is presented. The solution contains an innovative clutch for controlling the variable speed of the axial rotor using magneto-rheological (MR) fluids. Thirdly, the experimental results concentrates on MR clutch operating regimes and the pump efficiency analysis. The MR clutch was installed between the driven electrical motor and the pump, three regimes were investigated: runaway speed for the axial rotor, clutch with MR fluid inside with and without magnetic field applied on it. The conclusions are drawn in the last section.

The operating range of the turbine is often limited by the occurrence of flow instability, such as distinct vortex and load deterioration. In specific situations, the development of aerodynamic instabilities at low inlet pressure operating conditions can lead to lower turbine efficiency, even lead to turbine choke, limiting the wide operating range of the turbine. Specifically, the high-pressure stage turbine of the expander, namely the first stage turbine, will not only bears a sharp change of inlet pressure but also experiences the maximum and variable pressure drop. In this paper, Real Gas Property (RGP) file for supercritical air is used for simulations. The CFD method and RGP file are validated by the turbine in the NASA report. A detailed 3D CFD analysis is performed for the preliminary designed first stage turbine under variable inlet pressure. With the purpose of improving the aerodynamic performance of the first stage turbine under extreme working conditions, a series of simulations are conducted to examine the effects of the IGV parameters (i.e. different types of IGVs, the nozzle-impeller radial gap distance and the nozzle blade installation angle) and blade thickness, which led to the optimization in overall turbine stability. The results show that IGV TC-2P have good aerodynamic performance, and the matched rotor can achieve an isentropic efficiency of 80% under off-design working conditions. The optimal blade installation angle blade is 35°. And there exists an optimal nozzle-impeller radial gap distance Δr. The turbine efficiency obtains a maximum value at Δr = 5 mm. In all cases for blade thickness, the different configurations have a significant change in inlet total pressure of 4.5 MPa compared to the design pressure of 7 MPa. The maximum efficiency is reached at the ellipse ratio is 1:1 for Case-2. The results of the optimal IGV TC-2P performance optimization is essential to improve the isentropic efficiency at low inlet pressure.

Concentrating solar power (CSP) has the possibility of thermally storing this energy to be used in times of higher demand at a more feasible storage price. The number of concentrated solar energy related projects have grown rapidly in recent years due to the advances in the associated solar technology. Some of the remaining issues regarding the associated high investment costs can be solved by integrating the solar potential into fossil fuel generation plants. An integrated solar combined cycle system (ISCCS) tends to be less dependent to climatic conditions and needs less capital inversion than a CSP system, letting the plant be more reliable and more economically feasible. In this work thus, two technologies of solar concentration (i) parabolic trough cylinder (PTC) and (ii) solar tower (ST) are initially integrated into a three-pressure levels combined cycle power plant. The proposed models are then modeled, simulated and properly assessed. Design and off design point computations are carried out taking into account local environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and direct solar radiation (DNI). The 8760 hourly-basis simulations carried out allow comparing the thermal and economic performance of the different power plant configurations accounted for in this work. The results show that injecting energy into the cycle at high temperatures does not necessarily imply a high power plant performance. In the studied plant configurations, introducing the solar generated steam mass flow rate at the evaporator outlet is slightly more efficient than introducing it at cycle points where temperatures are higher. At design point conditions thus, the plant configuration where the referred steam mass flow rate is introduced at the evaporator outlet generates 0.42% more power than those in which the steam is injected at higher cycle temperatures. At off design point conditions this value is reduced to 0.37%. The results also show that the months with high DNI values and those with low mean ambient temperatures are not necessarily the months which lead to the highest power outputs. In fact a balance between these two parameters, DNI and ambient temperature, leads to an operating condition where the power output is the highest. All plant configurations analyzed here are economically feasible, even so PTC related technologies tend to be more economically feasible than ST ones due to their lower investment costs.

Under the combined loads from wind, wave and current, it is difficult for the prediction of the dynamic response for such FSRU-LNGC (Liquified Natural Gas Carrier) side-byside mooring system, because of the complicated hydrodynamic interaction between the two floating bodies. In this paper, a non-dimensional damping parameter of the two floating bodies is obtained from a scaled model test. Then the numerical analysis is carried out based on the test results, and the damping lid method is applied to simulate the hydrodynamic interference between floating bodies. The dynamic response of the side-byside mooring system including six degrees of freedom motion, cable tension and fender force are provided and analyzed. According to the comparisons between numerical results and the test results, it is shown that the proposed coupled analysis model is reliable, and the numerical analysis can properly describe the dynamic response of the multi-floating mooring system in the marine environment. Moreover, the nondimensional damping parameter which is used in numerical analysis can act as a good reference to the dynamic response analysis of similar multi-floating mooring systems. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

High-pressure hydrogen storage technology is widely used in hydrogen storage. It has advantages of easy operating, quick charge and discharge, simple equipment structure and low cost. The multi-layered steel vessel (MLSV) was developed for stationary hydrogen storage, which was flexible in design, safe in operation and convenient in fabrication. MLSV has been used in several hydrogen refueling stations in China. With the construction of hydrogen refueling stations accelerated, the vessel was required to be larger, lighter and cheaper. First, the basic structure of the MLSV was presented. Second, two light-weight methods were proposed and compared, including reducing the safety factor and increasing the strength of the steel band. Finally, the stress in the cylindrical shell of the MLSV using light-weight design were compared with the previous one. In addition, a MLSV using the light-weight method of reducing safety factor has been designed and fabricated, which can store 211 kg gaseous hydrogen at 50MPa.

In order to meet the increasing energy demand, China has established a number of oil depot in recent years, whose largest capacity reaching up to tens of millions of cubic meters. Due to the flammable and explosive nature of the stored medium, the risk of fire in the oil depot area has increased dramatically as the tank capacity of the storage tank area has increased. The intensification of the oil depot and the development of large-scale oil storage tanks have brought convenience to the national oil depot, but also brought many catastrophic consequences. In recent years, there have been many fires and explosions in the oil depot, causing major casualties and property losses, which seriously endangered the ecological environment and public safety. Based on the constructed oil depot fire risk index system, the fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM) and fuzzy maximum support tree clustering algorithm is introduced. Through the two fuzzy clustering mathematical models, key factors in the established index system are identified. Firstly, the expert scoring method is used to evaluate the indicators in the oil depot fire risk index system, and the importance degree evaluation matrix of oil depot fire risk factors is constructed through the fuzzy analysis of expert comments. Then, the fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM) and the fuzzy clustering tree algorithm are used to cluster the various risk indicators, and the key factors of the oil depot fire risk are identified. Through the comparative analysis and cross-validation of the results of the two fuzzy clustering methods, the accuracy of the recognition results is ensured. Finally, using an oil depot as a case study, it is found that passive fire prevention capability and emergency rescue capability are key factors that need to be paid attention to in the oil depot fire risk index. The fuzzy clustering algorithm used in this paper can digitize the subjective comments of experts, thus reducing the influence of human subjective factors. In addition, by using two fuzzy clustering algorithms to analyze and verify the key factors of the oil depot fire risk, the reliability of the clustering results is guaranteed. The identification of key factors can enable managers to predict high-risk factors in advance in the fire risk prevention and control process of the oil depot, so as to adopt corresponding preventive measures to minimize the fire risk in the oil depot, and ensure the safety of the operation of the oil depot.

Although many methods have been proposed for system reliability assessment, the functional heterogeneity of components and the influence of hydrothermal parameters on system reliability are neglected. To overcome these problems, we propose and apply a framework to assess UGS system reliability. Combining two-layer Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique with hydrothermal calculation, the framework integrates dynamic functional reliability of components into system reliability evaluation. To reflect the state transition process of repairable components and their impact on system reliability, the Markov model is introduced at system level. In order to improve the calculation speed, artificial neural network model based on off-line MCS is established to replace the on-line MCS at components level. The proposed framework is applied to the reliability assessment and operation optimization of an UGS under different operation conditions. Compared with the traditional single-layer MCS method, the proposed method can not only reflect the variation of UGS reliability with hydrothermal parameters and operation time, but also can improve evaluation efficiency significantly.

One of the most promising routes for this mid- to long term storage, is to produce hydrogen through electrolysis using excess electricity and store it. Instead of using this hydrogen then to generate electricity in a conventional, large, power plant, a more efficient route is to use it in a Decentralised Energy System (DES) using micro Gas Turbines (mGTs). Although the mGT presents itself as a promising option to convert pure hydrogen into electricity in this DES framework, several challenges, linked to the necessary increase of Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) for efficiency increase to make the unit compatible and the use of pure hydrogen in the combustor, still need to be overcome. In this paper we present the first steps towards a fully hydrogen fuelled mGT. Firstly, a full thermodynamic cycle analysis was performed to determine the optimal operating parameters, such as compressor pressure ratio and mass flow rate, air-to-fuel ratio and TIT. Secondly, a full CFD design and optimisation of the compressor and the combustion chamber was performed (steady and transient RANS and LES). CFD simulations of the compressor and combustion chamber matched the 1D performance calculations and also reached the desired performance goals. This CFD supported validation of the component performance shows that the design of a pure hydrogen combustion chamber for mGT applications is possible.

The second aspect is the inside view of the author, who has both shaped and suffered these gas turbine developments in several job positions allowing direct contact to both top management and shop floor workers. These two aspects will be integrated in the historical sequence. As a rule the roles of the persons acting after the seventies are given but not their names.

Energy consumption reduction on urban streets also contribute to lower emissions level and cleaner city air. To evaluate the influence of traffic organization and car technologies on traction energy and fuel consumption test drives were run in Riga city on selected route including three main arterial streets in both directions at various day hours having traffic densities from free flowing traffic to congestion driving. The fuel consumption is calculated from car OBD data. The position on the street grid and car speed for data synchronisation and OBD speed data calibration is recorded by GPS logger. The energies are calculated from OBD logs and car specifications. This paper deals with methodology of test results processing. The route has been divided in street sections. The shortest sections selected are between traffic lights on successive street intersections. The longest sections selected correspond to street sections where traffic management system provides a green wave for traffic in any driving direction. The problem analysed is that the traction energy consumption is affected by car speeds at section endings therefore various terminations of sections have been compared to reduce or take into consideration the different speeds. The shorter street sections are suitable for local energy consumption evaluation and selection of specific section termination points are not useful, the longer sections may allow to evaluate traffic management systems and sections with closer car speeds at termination points may be more advantageous. The research findings will be used for further development of urban traffic analysis. © 2019 Kaunas University of Technology.

Offshore large-scale terminals as Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) type are becoming commercially competitive and effective alternative for the areas where onshore gas supply infrastructure is not feasible. LNG production consumes energy (around 850 MJ per ton) and it is stored in the form of “cold energy” which is dumped into seawater or the atmosphere during LNG regasification process despite reusing as extra energy source in many processes. In this research work, mathematical model is performed to determine influence of LNG composition and regasification process parameters to quantity of released LNG cold energy in a large scale FSRU type terminal. It was determined that the potential of LNG cold energy at FSRU could vary from 20 to 25 MWh depending on LNG regasification flow rate, pressure, BOG recondensation as well as composition of LNG. © 2019 Kaunas University of Technology.

When ignited, they can burn rapidly and result in a considerable explosion force, when in mixture with air in proper proportions. Therefore, for establishing with certainty the requirements of the technical equipment which can be used in potentially explosive atmospheres generated by air/ combustible dust mixtures, it is necessary to know the type of dust, as well as a series of parameters defining its sensitivity to ignition by different sources, defined as the minimum ignition energy – MIE. One of the ignition sources of the explosive dust/ air atmosphere is electrostatic discharge. The ignition risk assessment of the explosive mixture by electrostatic discharge is done by comparing the electrostatic discharge energies with the minimum explosive atmosphere ignition-MIE. Therefore, knowledge of the minimum ignition energy of processed, transported or stored dusts in installations is very important in the process of ignition risk assessment and for establishing the measures for explosion prevention and/ or protection. This paper presents a comparative study having in view the methods used for the determination of the minimum ignition energy of the air/combustible dust mixtures with different apparatus on the same types of dust. By knowing this parameter of the air/combustible dust mixtures, there can be correlated the protection/ prevention measures and the safety features according to the specific application. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

However, the methane and carbon dioxide emission from flowback process during shale gas production remains unclear. The withdrawn of fracture water both from underground and surface water, and the relatively high gas pressure from the wellhead have made flowback water highly potential as a significant greenhouse gas emission source. Methods, Procedures, Process: In this study, the estimation of greenhouse emission potential was provided based on the flowback water samples collected from shale production sites of China. The buffer capacity of carbon dioxide was estimated based on the parameters measured including temperature, pressure, conductivity, salinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, chloride etc. The possible methane emission was also estimated based on the solution/dissolution curve from gas-water equilibrium during the flowback process. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The results showed that: the relatively high salinity of the flowback water has provided a considerable buffer capacity for carbon dioxide. The water residence time in the water tank/pond largely determines air-water greenhouse flux. When the flowback water pass through the three-phase separator to the water outlet, the dissolution capacity of methane reduced sharply dropped. By switching to a higher water level in the separator, methane emission could be reduced. However, a higher water vapor ratio may be detected in the gas phase, as well. Besides the fugitive methane emission from pneumatic pumps, valves, etc., greenhouse gas emission from flowback water is a significant source which needs to be reduced in future shale gas production. Novel/Additive Information: The determination of greenhouse gas emission from flowback could better defined the life cycle of shale gas, while provide baseline analysis for the development of greenhouse gas control technology during flowback water treatment and three-phase separator optimization. © 2019, International Petroleum Technology Conference","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas emission; Methane emission; Shale gas production; Three-phase separator","Air; Buffer storage; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Chlorine compounds; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Life cycle; Methane; Separators; Shale gas; Surface waters; Water levels; Water tanks; Water treatment; Carbon dioxide emissions; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Gas productions; Greenhouse emissions; High gas pressures; Methane emissions; Three phase; Water residence time; Wellheads",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073261527

These materials are of special interest for solar-thermal collectors and other solar applications. In total, five different irradiation doses in the range of 0 kGy and 200 kGy were applied and the resulting various cross-linked PA grades were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile tests. The thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the specified glass fiber contents and exhibited similar decomposition temperatures. Morphological changes in the irradiated samples were detected using differential scanning calorimetry comprising a shift to lower melting temperatures in irradiated samples. Furthermore, irradiation leads to increasing storage moduli and higher glass transition temperatures in dynamic mechanical analysis and to higher Young’s moduli and higher strengths in tensile tests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Poultry industry waste is produced in large amounts and cannot be always used as a fertilizer. Its storage needs large sites, but if they are improperly designed could affect the phreatic groundwater. The paper is organized as it follows. The first part presents the energy characteristics the waste samples analyzed (they come from a poultry farm, which beds the floor with cereal straw or sawdust; relatively to the waste mass, the bedding represents about 5% to 15%). The samples are taken from an intermediate warehouse located between the production halls and the central warehouse of a large capacity poultry farm. Regarding the location, the poultry farm is placed in the center of the historical region of Moldova, in Romania. From an exclusively energetic point of view, differences between the two beddings are not significant, since they both belong to the biomass class; if the biomass bedding lacks (very rare), the energy characteristics of the poultry manure get worse. The second part introduces a technology suitable for this kind of waste combustion. Starting from the energy properties, thermal conditions for ignition and flame support are investigated. The boiler types adequate for the process are specified, appropriate thermal power range is indicated. Considering the very difficult manipulation of this particular waste, its use is recommended for thermal energy production. Local utilization is taken into consideration, especially for heating purposes, for instance of the production halls. According to the results of this study, boilers equipped with mobile grate combustion installations and using gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons fuel aid are expected to have good yields for energetic valorization of poultry waste. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Some drawbacks of these materials, like slow hydrogen sorption kinetics and high absorption-desorption temperatures, can be overcome using different additives and high energy ball milling. In this study, the hydrogen sorption characteristics of the Mg-Ni-C composites, prepared by ball milling under Ar atmosphere, are investigated. Polyolefin wax (POW, a waste product of polyethylene production at low pressure) was submitted to pyrolysis and steam activation, in order to prepare nanoporous carbon CPOW, which is further used as additive in the preparation of MgH2-Ni composite. Structure, phase and surface composition of the starting compounds, and the sample before and after hydriding are determined by XRD and TEM. The maximum absorption capacity achieved for composite containing ACPOW, after 60 min of hydriding at 573 K, is 5.3 wt. %. The presence of the additives-Ni and nanoporous carbon-has positive influence on both hydrogenation kinetics and the capacity achieved. The results from TEM characterization show the presence of graphite, Mg and monoclinic Mg2NiH4. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The digital era brings about a fast and continuous production of information, whose management becomes a challenge for both large companies and users worldwide, in their private environment. The huge amount of data needed to carry out day-to-day operations means a continuing need for increased storage space, which translates into high hardware costs. Thus, cloud services have emerged as an optimal and long-lasting solution to this problem. According to a simplified definition, the term ""Cloud Computing"" refers to the storage, processing and use of data outlying and Internet-accessed systems. In this way, in order to achieve their goals, users can dispose of almost unlimited computing power on request, without having to make significant capital investments and can access the data via an Internet connection from wherever they are. The benefits of Cloud Computing consist mainly in the reduction of spending for IT users and the promotion of the development of a large number of new services. Using Cloud Computing, even the smallest businesses can address increasingly larger markets, while administrations can increase the attractiveness and efficiency of their services, while keeping their spending under control. The cloud’s unexpected economies of scale reduce overall costs and increase efficiency, especially when replacing locally-run servers of an organization. A fundamental concept of Cloud Computing is that through this model information technology is made available to users in the form of services (as by analogy, communications technology is made available to users in the form of voice/ voice services, data, etc.) used in the form of periodic subscriptions (as telephone services are used as a monthly subscription). However, the new technologies bring with them their own challenges. Today, much as ever, cloud providers are facing challenges to be able to deliver the energy efficiency of their services, but also their sustainability. Using a large number of cloud data centers increases costs as well as carbon emissions, which still affects the cloud services' sustainability. The main requirement for Sustainable Cloud Computing is energy efficiency which can be acquired mainly by using renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions. This will ensure continuity and security in the process of energy supply, while preserving traditional resources, but at the same time will significantly reduce imports of primary energy resources. Cloud computing technology has its name in the form of a cloud, often described in the graphical representation of a network. Cloud Computing was developed as a consequence of the rising access to IT resources. If in previous years, in traditional outsourcing models, either customer or provider would own the physical resources, Cloud Computing comes with the novelty of being able to access to technological capabilities without owning the software used by the payee. Another important aspect is the fact that by using renewable energy one can also stimulate the economic development starting at the local level, but also at the regional and global level, thus creating new jobs and, implicitly, employment opportunities. [7] Given this economic and social context, the European Commission has developed a set of energy strategy aimed at ensuring an economy characterized by greater safety and durability, but also significantly reduce carbon emissions. The increased use of renewable energy will not only combat climate change as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but it will also have an impact on the reduction of air pollution and it will most probable create new jobs in the environment and renewable energy sectors. Nowadays, in many European countries including Romania, it is necessary to encourage the usage of renewable energy resources as they offer a wide range of advantages [6], [10]. Consequently, nowadays, there is a growing concern for developing computer systems in order to predict, analyse and monitor the performance indicators of renewable energy technology processes. The results of this endeavour have a great importance to the green energy producers as they are required to submit the estimates of alternative energy production requested by the Romanian National Energy Regulatory Authority (ANRE) but they are also relevant to developing decision support systems for a more efficient management of electricity generation from renewable sources [9]. Among the renewable energy sources one can mention solar and wind energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, sea energy, biofuels, and renewable waste. If we take into consideration the figures from Eurostat, the use of renewable energy in the EU has increased strongly in latest years. More exactly, the percentage of energy obtained from renewable sources has almost doubled the number in recent years, reaching 17.0% in 2016 from an approximate of 8.5% in 2004. This was brought about also by the legally binding targets set by the EU through Directive 2009/28/ EC in trying to promote the use of energy from renewable sources. This will have a major impact on the long run as some of the benefits of renewable energy consist of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, but also the dependency on fossil fuels markets [2]. However, the main problem with the renewable power supply is that it is usually intermittent and unpredictable and hence one should try to adopt measures for making the renewable supply constant. In the research work for this article, we have used both quantitative methods (which aim at obtaining statistical, percentage or numerical data, measurable) but also qualitative, which is based not on calculations but on the interpretation of different types of content. The use of qualitative research methods in this paper was based on the fact that qualitative research does not seek to obtain generic information about certain subjects of interest but rather seeks to reach deeper information levels related to them. Moreover, it always implies a holistic approach. Starting from the idea that qualitative research is based more on textual interpretation, which requires the correct definition of the concepts or their scientific substantiation, thus emphasizing the importance of the chosen subject, I consider that the qualitative research is the most suitable for the field addressed whose study is based on the tools and methods of research specific. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Starting from this European directive, the authors propose to develop a method of assessing the wear and operating status of hydraulic pumps, rotary hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders, without necessity to remove them from the hydraulic drive systems they belong for testing them on high-energy laboratory stands. To achieve of the proposed goal of expanding the infrared thermography in the field of hydraulic drive systems, three directions of action are addressed: the infrared thermography of the main families of volumetric machines (pumps, rotary motors and hydraulic cylinders) without wear; making thermograms of the same volumetric machines with different degrees of wear; comparative analysis of the two sets of thermograms. The authors have developed an incipient data base, which they intend to develop in the future, containing the witness thermograms of the non-worn volumetric machines, made on laboratory-stands, respectively the thermograms of the volumetric machines with different wear degrees, resulting from the simulation on the stands of some causative wear operating modes. It is intended to develop this database by: raising of the volumetric machine manufacturers' in the direction of inclusion the standard thermograms in their product catalogs; raising the beneficiaries of hydraulically operated machinery and equipments in the direction of periodic control, by making thermograms of the volumetric machines operating state from those drive systems. The authors express their opinion that by attracting of the two mentioned factors and by developing of some interpretation methods/ comparative analysis ""standard thermogram"" vs. ""real thermogram"", the infrared thermography method may have a in the field of hydraulic drive systems, a similar success to that from medicine (the human body is a much more complex system than a hydraulic drive system). © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The increasing focus on harmful emissions (NOx, SOx, PM) and carbon emission reduction leads to the need of using alternative, cleaner fuels. Royal IHC is a front runner on the adoption of cleaner fuels, with a track record on LNG fueled dredging vessels sailing and on order. Although certainly a cleaner option, LNG is still a fossil fuel. In the future, fossil-free alternative fuels will have to be adopted by the maritime sector. The use of alternative fuels is expected to be accelerated by the emission legislation developments, climate agreements (such as the Paris Agreement) and the introduction of future taxing systems, e.g. carbon taxing. This will be added to the total costs in the economic figures. The shift to zero emission dredgers (zero CO2, SOx, NOx and PM emissions) is expected to accelerate as a consequence of societal acceptance and legislation developments. Royal IHC expects that these developments will lead to a shift in the balance towards clean technologies and carbon-neutral fuels. In this paper alternative fuels are compared on availability, feasibility and C02-equivalent impact. Also alternative drive systems are discussed such as electric drives, batteries and fuel cells. The assessment of alternative fuels requires an approach of Total Cost of Ownership, as each fuel has advantages and disadvantages and a trade-off must to be made between prime mover technology, storage and bunkering technology, investment and fuel costs, and exhaust emissions regulations. The paper will discuss some of the most promising carbonneutral energy carriers for the maritime sector: • Hydrogen • Ammonia (hydrogen carrier) • Renewable methanol • Batteries • Solar panels (PV) In order to anticipate to these developments, Royal IHC has taken the challenge to design a hydrogen powered hopper dredger.

In Fthiotida region (NUTS 3, Central Greece), an integrated harvester/ shredder (FACMA COMBY TR 200) was used to harvest the local olive groves of Agios Konstantinos. The pruning value chain included: i) windrowing prunings in rows on the olive groves; ii) harvesting and shredding the prunings (leaves included) from the rows with the harvester; iii) discharging prunings on platforms and finally iv) transporting prunings to a storage site where the loads were weighted via a weighbridge. The harvesting demonstration lasted for 14 days where around 54 ha of olive groves were harvested that amounted to 232 wet tons of harvested prunings (25% w/w average moisture content). The harvesting cost resulted to 58 €/harvested dry ton of pruning and produced emissions calculated at 36 gCO2eq/kg of dry harvested pruning. Aim of the current paper is to evaluate the whole pruning value chain during the harvesting demonstration in terms of biomass productivity (tons of prunings per ha), performance of harvester (working times, fuel consumptions) and transportation of prunings (fuel consumptions) into nearby storage area. Furthermore, an economical evaluation of the whole demonstration is performed along with a cost-breakdown of the pruning logistics. The costs include cost of the harvester, fuel costs of the harvester and the transportation platforms, renting costs of tractors and platforms, and labor and driver costs. Finally, samples of harvested prunings were collected for key fuel properties analysis. Harvested olive prunings were analyzed in order to investigate their potential for energy use and examine how has the harvesting methodology influenced their fuel properties. The fuel characterization was performed by applying established standards and the results will be presented on the current paper. © 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Agricultural residues; Demonstration; Harvesting; Olive tree prunings; Solid biofuel",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071064732

All stakeholders will have to seek solutions to reach the reduction of GHG emissions across sectors - not only in the electricity and heat generation, but also in the public and especially private transport sector. Mainly the field of new vehicles should change. The European Parliament specified that 40% of new cars are to be zero- or low-emission vehicles by 2030 targets. With the increase of electric vehicles (EVs), it will be important to find suitable points of charging with regard to transport infrastructure as well as to complete the existing system of energy network with superchargers. The existing literature and research have so far mainly focused on the location of the charging sites in the primary transport nodes, such as gas stations along the highways and roads outside cities and have rarely considered the fact that in the first stage, most EVs will be used as city vehicles. It is highly likely, that due to the parameters of current batteries and small distance, which the EVs are able to achieve, the EVs will initially be used for urban and suburban transport. However, at the same time, many places, which have an excellent location in terms of transport infrastructure in the city, such as gas stations or large parking spaces, usually do not have a sufficient capacity of the electrical connection for EVs charging. Lower capacity of electrical connection can be the reason why it is not possible to create a charging site in the required place, or it is not possible to use sufficient number of charging stations with adequate power. One of the solutions to this problem may be an installation of battery storage at these points. This paper evaluates the costs and benefits that the system with shared battery storage brings and compares the battery solution with the alternative of investing in increasing the capacity of the electrical connection in the required area. From technical and economic points of view, the model takes into account a number of economic aspects and the cheaper option is not always the better one. During the final choice, it is important to consider also other benefits for the owner of the charging site. For instance, elimination fines for exceeding the pre-determined value of the power absorbed can be imposed as well as the possibility to install more supercharger stations within the sites which will allow charging more EVs at the same time. © Technical University of Košice 2019.","2030 targets; Battery storage; Charging site; Consumption diagram; Electric taxis; Electric vehicles; Fast-charger station","Battery storage; Electric automobiles; Electric connectors; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Superchargers; Urban transportation; Construction of charging stations; Consumption diagram; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical connection; European Parliament; Fast chargers; Low emission vehicles; Transport infrastructure; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070272156

The basis of the new generation network is the use in the general power system of numerous various distributed energy sources, which include low-power stations and installations that operate, including renewable energy sources. Using distributed energy sources makes it possible to reduce power losses during power transmission. In today's market conditions, in financial calculations between the energy system and consumers, it is important to analyze the energy balance, which includes the technological consumption of electricity for its transmission. Therefore, the issues of determining electricity losses are very relevant. However, with introducing information-measuring systems, the information security of calculations increases, so it became possible to take into account additional factors while calculating losses, determining the structure of losses in the entire transmission and distribution system of electricity, and identifying the place of increased losses. Gathered information makes it possible to take measures for the rational reduction of losses. Energy storage systems are rapidly developing a class of high-tech devices that open new opportunities in the energy power industry. They make electricity stored and portable, eliminating the need for strict simultaneity of its generation and consumption - the fundamental constraint of power balance, which was a key factor to make a modern architecture of energy systems operating around the world. Electric power storages are fundamentally new element of their architecture, complementing the objects of generation, transmission, and consumption and opening wide opportunities for the effective realization of the potential of new types of distributed generation. The new active consumers will be using already commissioned and new energy capacities and operate energy systems in general. © Technical University of Košice 2019.","Electricity storage systems; Renewable energy sources; Smart Grid","Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Low power electronics; Natural resources; Network architecture; Renewable energy resources; Security of data; Distributed energy sources; Electricity storage systems; Fundamental constraints; Information measuring system; New Generation networks; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Transmission and distribution systems; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070265421

Moreover, the heat increases the rate of unwanted chemical reactions inside the battery, which in turn increases the risk of swelling, sparking or even catching fire. This study measures the effect of temperature on the performance of the battery power output. The battery is connected to an electric ducted fan that draws approximately 150 Amp DC. The rapid discharge of the Li-Po battery generates heat that affects the power output of battery, and in turn affects the Electric Ducted Fan performance. The temperature of the battery is managed by either emerging it in a cooling bath or by the room HVAC system. The performance of the battery is measured by analyzing the thrust obtained by the electric ducted fan in relation to the power provided by the battery. Once the data is obtained, an artificial neural network is trained to obtain the relationship between the temperature to the battery performance. © SPIE.

In this paper, the pronounced effects of Sn doping (0%, 10%, 30%) on crystallization behaviors of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) film induced by a picosecond pulsed laser were investigated in detail. The TEM observations presented the crystallization threshold, melting threshold and ablation threshold all decreased with the increasing of Sn doping while the crystal structure and crystallization behavior has not been changed. After single pulse Gaussian laser irradiation, the morphology of crystallized films for GST and Sn-doped GST all presented an ingot-like microstructure at higher laser fluence and equiaxed crystal microstructure at lower laser fluence, which was mainly caused by the temperature gradient. The local grain refinement was found in GSTSn30% films because weaker Sn-Te bond (359.8 kJ/mol) replaced the stronger Ge-Te bond (456 kJ/mol), which was also proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

As a result, smart grid technology is being developed to address these new challenges. In order for a smart grid to achieve its full functions, it requires a number of integral parts to play key roles, not least the performance of Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). In HEMS, in order to optimally schedule the residential loads to achieve minimum electricity consumption, a popular meta-heuristic method called Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm is often utilised. In this paper, a HEMS is developed to model the combined performance of an air conditioner, a solar PV system, an energy storage system and grid integration. This paper details a comparison of different improved versions of PSO for the application of HEMS. Additionally, in this work, the operational cost of an air conditioner is minimised while maintaining end-user comfort levels. Real measured data from a large study of energy performance measurements of domestic dwellings in Austin, Texas is used. The measured data is used to validate the effectiveness of the chosen algorithms. The findings of this important work will assist with more efficient use of energy and a method to reduce the cost of energy in a building by effectively optimising time-of electricity purchase. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

The S-S3BF topology is derived from its parallel counterpart (P-S3BF), which was proved to offer the maximum energy harvesting capability when three bias-flip actions are implemented. The S-S3BF is a little bit less capable than P-S3BF. However, it eliminates the circuit components by removing the bridge rectifier connected in parallel, such that can use only one capacitor to realize the bias voltages and energy storage simultaneously. Compared to the other single capacitor designs, the S-S3BF makes the best energy harvesting capability so far. Moreover, S-S3BF can automatically shift among single, double, and triple bias-flip operations under heavy, medium, and light load conditions, respectively. Therefore, it is more adaptive than previous designs. Theoretical and experimental results show that the harvested power can always follow the envelope (best case) of the single, double, and triple bias-flip operations during an entire charging process. © 2019 IEEE",,"Electric rectifiers; Piezoelectricity; Timing circuits; Bridge rectifiers; Charging process; Circuit components; Interface circuits; Light loads; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Single capacitor; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066800346

Looking at SSLNG terminals, for instance, some elements of the CAPEX are driven by components that are size-independent like jetty, tanks, utilities. On the opposite, the requirement of a SSLNG terminal offers potential for savings because some equipment or even part of the installation, typical for a “standard” LNG terminal are not necessary. • Full understanding of technology differences including the related safety issues. One clear advantage of SSLNG is a more simple construction. Some operators offer the opportunity to build these terminals in modules, remotely. On the other side, several aspects related to safety should be deeply investigated, like risks related to the LNG bunkering of the gas-fueled ships. This requires to assess the risks on a given port, against specific risk acceptance criteria, considering geo-morphological and meteorological characteristics of the ports and their operational profiles. • Adjustment of codes and regulations. Some Countries already developed specific regulations to simplify the approach and facilitate the adoption of SSLNG. Interesting examples coming from US, where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed SSLNG terminals to be developed without the long approval process applied to standard projects, despite the apparent lack of a specific simpler regulation. Also, The Netherland promoted the Dutch LNG safety program with the aim to set appropriate standards. Italy published the local application of the DAFI European Directive, that should open to administrative simplification and define as strategic the LNG storage infrastructures. © 2019 Offshore Mediterranean Conference (OMC).

It relies on a retention feedback loop added to the TSPC FF and controlled by the clock-gating module. When the clock is gated, the retention is enabled, which drives the FF in retention mode. This limits the energy overhead induced by the added feedback loop and makes the FF contention-free. Moreover, as several FFs typically share the same clock-gating module, the control signal generation overhead is also kept low. The proposed 19T TSPC FF with retention mode was implemented as a standard cell in 65nm LP CMOS. The FF energy is 0.5fJ/cycle at 0.4V, from post-layout simulations and for a typical 25% activity factor, which is 62% reduction compared to the conventional 24T master-slave FF.

The branch-based analysis assigns the corresponding branch prediction for conditional branches of a program. Since the branch prediction may change the Worst-Case Execution Path (WCEP), branch-based analysis is iterated for several times until WCEP is stable. After branch-based analysis, the energy consumption can be calculated according to memory access, by which the data variable allocation determines how to migrate data variables.

Energy efficient use of ammonia or hydrocarbons in equipment relates to a number of aspects already realised; this also applies to CO2, which is under further development. In the case of fluorocarbons, it is different since direct emissions (i.e., from high GWP HFCs) are typically to be considered in light of the Kigali Amendment. However, even with the ""Kigali"" HFC phasedown, addressing of energy efficiency related indirect GHG emissions often receives a lot of emphasis in that context. ""Kigali"" is strictly related to regulatory measures to phase down and to compliance; ""Kigali"" and efficiency are two different things. If one aims at a substantial reduction of all climate relevant emissions for all applications, efforts need to be undertaken from a broader perspective. Priorities are on energy efficiency, but even more on initiatives focused to achieve capacity reductions within comprehensive frameworks. Lowering demand via influencing outside parameters, guaranteeing adequate, high-efficient equipment operation, shall be considered priority number one, and can be defined as using energy efficiently. Even though the total capacity of large units is lower than the capacity in other sectors, food production, cold storage and chillers can contribute to savings via efficient energy use. While the efforts under the Montreal Protocol are important, a different or perhaps enhanced framework will be required to effectively address a more efficient use of energy in R/AC equipment, aiming at the highly emphasised 'low carbon profile' for the R/AC sector. © 2019 IIF/IIR.","Climate relevant emissions; Efficient use of energy; Energy efficiency; HFC phase-down; Kigali Amendment; Low GWP refrigerants; Natural refrigerants; Refrigeration load","Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Cold storage; Fluorocarbons; Food storage; Greenhouse gases; Refrigerants; Refrigeration; Regulatory compliance; Efficient use of energy; HFC phase-down; Kigali Amendment; Natural refrigerants; Refrigeration load; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065514440

In this work, two kinds of organo-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) DK5 and I.34TCN, and unmodified MMT DKO were added into the PA6-66 matrix through melt blending to prepare PA6-66/montmorillonite (PA6-66/MMT) nanocomposites. The effect of MMT modification on the structure and properties of PA6-66/MMT nanocomposites was investigated using rheometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), tensile and impact tests. From the TEM images, it is observed that the MMT dispersed homogeneously with in the polymer matrices, showing an exfoliated nanostructure. It was found that the storage modulus of PA6-66 is obviously improved by the incorporation of OMMT. The result of DSC illustrates that the crystallization temperature of matrix materials are average about 3°C higher than that of pure PA6-66. Results showed that the PA6-66 nanocomposite incorporated with DK5 to pure PA6-66 increases the tensile strength over 26%, while nanocomposite incorporated with I.34TCN has better toughness and higher storage modulus than other materials. © 21st IAPRI World Conference on Packaging 2018 - Packaging: Driving a Sustainable Future.All rights reserved.","Melting blend; Montmorillonite (MMT); Nanocomposites; PA6-66","Clay minerals; Differential scanning calorimetry; Elastic moduli; Energy utilization; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mechanical properties; Packaging; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Crystallization temperature; Low energy consumption; Melting blends; Montmorillonite (MMT); Organo-modified montmorillonites; PA6-66; Packaging industry; Structure and properties; Nanocomposites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064964510

The behavior and self-healing of cementitious materials with synthetic microfibers and superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) during and after a static four-point-bending test have been proven successful. Itwas however not known howthis material reacts when subjected to impact loading. In this study, a reference mixture and a mixture containing 1 m% of SAP were tested at an age of 28 days and stored in different healing conditions (Wet/Dry cycles and at 95 ±5% RH). After 28 days of healing the specimens are impacted and healed again. The applied impact test is a Drop- Weight-Test (DWT) and the healing is microscopically monitored and studied by means of natural frequency analysis. Specimens containing SAPs showa more ductile behavior during impact loading compared to reference samples. This ductile behavior enhances multiple cracking of the strain-hardening cementitious materials causing a possible higher amount of autogenous healing, which was confirmed by natural frequency analysis.

Some of the carbonate formation is composed by small vuggs with radius of about or less than 1-meter, big caves with radius that can reach tens of meters, natural fractures and matrix. The current well testing models that assume dual or triple mediums cannot give reasonable interpretation such as the volume of caves and the connectivity between caves. Also, it's hard to analyze the effect of caves' morphology on flow and pressure dynamics. We proposed a model for the well connected to one cave in the carbonate formation based on the three laws of mass conservation, momentum conservation and energy conservation mechanics. The concept of wave propagation is introduced and the model incorporating fluid flow and pressure wave propagation is built in the caves. Three key parameters including the wave coefficient, damping coefficient, and cave shape factor are definied to characterize caves. Parametric study of the three parameters are conducted to analyze the effect of the caves on flow dynamics and bottomhole pressure transient. For the cave connected to the wellbore, its volume can be obtained by history match of the log-log plot of the pressure and pressure derivative. The matrix is considered as storage medium and it provides fluid to the caves by crossflow. Field cases are conducted to validate the proposed method. Results show there are four flow regimes in the log-log plot of the pressure and pressure derivative. The flow regimes include wellbore storage, transition flow from wellbore storage to cave storage, wave propagation and fluid flow in cave, formation flow. The four regimes can be used to characterize the features of fluid fow in carbonate reservoirs with caves. All of wave coefficient, damping coefficient, and cave shape factor present big influence on the bottom transient pressure and pressure derivative, especially in flow regime III which reflects the flow in caves. The volume of the caves connected to the wellbore for the field case is diagnosed. Both of the Log-log plots of the pressure and pressure derivative show good agreement with the pressure buildup data, therefore, the new method is validated and the results interpreted are accurate and confident. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Boreholes; Bottom hole pressure; Carbonation; Damping; Digital storage; Flow of fluids; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoirs; Pore pressure; Pressure effects; Wave propagation; Well testing; Carbonate formations; Carbonate reservoir; Damping coefficients; Momentum conservations; Pressure build up; Pressure derivatives; Pressure wave propagation; Transient pressures; Caves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063774798

The agreement contains the ambitious long-term global goal to limit global warming to ""well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C"". The International Energy Agency (IEA) has clearly stated that limiting global temperature rise to 2°C will require the energy sector to deploy carbon capture and storage (CCS). Hence, CO 2 capture and suitable CO 2 utilization option should be explored. In the UAE there are several emission sources available such as the power sector, cement industry, oil and gas, and iron and steel (P. Singh 2017). ADNOC has set a milestone with the first Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) project within the Middle East together with Emirates Steel, using CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. This project will assist the UAE in achieving their future energy demand while reducing its carbon footprint which is in line with ADNOC's 2030 strategy. The ADNOC 2030 strategy envisioned more profitable downstream where one of the focus areas is to deliver new, higher value products. On top of that, the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 states that economic diversification is a key pillar and the Emirate is setting ambitious targets for the performance of the non-oil sector. When considering CO 2 utilization beyond EOR, there exists several areas for CO 2 direct- or indirect utilization that could be explored for application in the UAE. Figure 1, shows different pathways of CO 2 utilization, direct and indirect. By 2030, the global CO 2 utilization market (other than EOR) is expected to be larger than 800 billion$ by utilizing almost 7 billion t CO 2 /year, which is equivalent to approximately 15% of the current global CO 2 emissions, ICEF Roadmap 2016.

In this region, there are many photochemical phenomena and dynamical processes. One of the photochemical phenomena is airglow. When excited atmospheric molecule or atom transmits to lower level, the light with some wavelength will emit. The light is referred to as airglow. Airglow is therefore a powerful tool in investigations of atmospheric composition, temperature, and density in the emission region, and mass and energy movements to or from this region. Tracing the airglow emission, all-sky airglow imagers are widely used for imaging the atmospheric airglow. The characters of the imager are: wide field of view, fast, high resolution, low cost. This paper systematically studies the basic principle of the imager, completes the calculation of the key parameters, designs the optical system structure of the imager and optimizes the system image quality to obtain an ideal design result. The main contents can be list as follow. All-sky imaging technology records the optical phenomena in the 180° range above the ground plane with imaging and storage media. Use the fisheye lens to realize the 180° of the field of view. Different airglow layers correspond to different radiation peak heights. In order to obtain the atmospheric airglow signal at a certain height, it is necessary to filter the airglow radiation of different bands. The intensity of airglow information using narrow-band filter extraction feature height region of the upper atmosphere. High-sensitivity CCD were used to record all-sky airglow intensity distributions. The system consists of fisheye lens, telecentric imaging lens, filter, imaging lens and CCD. Through the analysis of recorded images, obtained observation data of regional atmospheric fluctuations of airglow height. The central wavelength of the imaging system is 630.5 nm, the bandwidth is 2 nm, the field of view is 180° the focal length is 5 mm, and the relative aperture is 1:1.9; The modulation transfers function (MTF) is more than 0.75 at the Nyquist spatial frequency of 37 lp/mm. The root-mean-square (RMS) radius of spot diagram is less than half of the pixel. 80% of the energy is enclosed in a pixel, and the uniformity of image illumination is 89%. The design requirements are satisfied. And based on the final design, the lens is simplified and the glass material is simplified. Finally, optimization of tolerance analysis is used to guide actual production. The final system structure compact, low cost, high resolution, suitable for airglow atmospheric radiation detection. © 2019 SPIE.","airglow; all-sky; imager; middle and upper atmosphere; optical design","Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric structure; Costs; Digital storage; Fits and tolerances; Glass; Image sensors; Light; Manufacture; Optical design; Optical systems; Pixels; Structured programming; Surface waves; Upper atmosphere; airglow; All-sky; All-sky airglow imager; Atmospheric fluctuations; Atmospheric molecules; High sensitivity ccds; Intensity distribution; Telecentric imaging lens; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061183537

Meanwhile an enormous effort has been placed into lowering the cost of capture. Many R&amp;D programs have set the target to reduce cost from typically 50 $/ton to 25 $/ton, while even now this kind of reductions have not been realized, to the contrary there has been an increase in reported cost. This paper addresses the background of the situation. It gives a literature overview of different technologies and the associated cost. A cost analysis is made of the different components in a CO 2 capture plant. Comparison is made for the different technologies for post, pre- and oxy-combustion. The reasons for the high cost is analyzed and it is shown that no silver bullets exist. Several smart technologies are currently in development and the latest insights are given in how these technologies can reduce cost. A few studies are given that show why these technologies could not fulfill the initial expectations. The results show that there is a tendency that advantages of technology solutions are often off-set by disadvantages that are not foreseen at the early Research stages, often because the new systems are more complicated than the state-of-the-art. This includes engineering cost for mitigate these dis advantages. An example is the use of smart solvents with phase change involved. This process may lead to lower OPEX due to lower energy consumption, but cost is increased by the higher cost for doing the separation or for keeping the solvents from leaving the solvent. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost engineering; Cost reduction; Energy utilization; Enhanced recovery; Gasoline; Global warming; Solvents; Associated costs; Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic feasibilities; Engineering costs; Enhanced oil recovery; Literature overview; State of the art; Technology solutions; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059991455

Good production performance is gained with rate as high as 100t/d per well. The formation belongs to fault-karst carbonates and is composed by caves, natural fractures and matrix. The current well testing models that assume dual or triple mediums cannot give reasonable interpretation such as the volume of caves and the connectivity between caves. We proposed a new model for the well connected to one cave in the carbonate formation based on the three laws of mass conservation, momentum conservation and energy conservation mechanics. The concept of wave propagation is introduced and the model incorporating fluid flow and pressure wave propagation is built in the caves. For the cave connected to the wellbore, its volume can be obtained by history match of the log-log plot of the pressure and pressure derivative. The matrix is viewed as storage medium and it provides fluid to the caves by crossflow. Field cases are conducted to validate the proposed method. Results show that the sequent flow regimes including wellbore storage, transition from wellbore storage to cave storage, wave propagation and fluid flow in cave, formation flow can be diagnosed in the log-log plot of the pressure and pressure derivative, therefore, the new method can characterize the features of fault-karst carbonate reservoirs such as the volume of caves. For the field case, from pressure buildup test, the volume of the caves connected to the wellbore is estimated as 37281.41 m 3 . Log-log plots of the pressure and pressure derivative show good agreement with the pressure buildup data, therefore, the models are validated and the results interpreted are accurate and confident. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Boreholes; Carbonation; Digital storage; Flow of fluids; Gasoline; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoirs; Wave propagation; Well testing; Carbonate formations; Carbonate reservoir; Momentum conservations; Pressure build up; Pressure derivatives; Pressure wave propagation; Production performance; Well bore storage; Caves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059987923

Historically and conventionally, Operating Companies (OPCOs) do focus on energy performance and opportunities of energy efficiency improvement associated with plant operations, but do not underscore the essential soft skills and competencies related to energy performance. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) recognized the importance of energy efficiency & management and accordingly, with its functional competency management system, launched an initiative to develop energy competencies. ADNOC set the objective to develop global framework of energy competencies, encompassing complete value chain of ADNOC operations. ADNOC Gas Processing, an operating company in the ADNOC Group of Companies, was selected to lead the task. The paper presents the approach & methodology used in developing energy competencies. It also addresses the challenges faced in developing global energy competencies like diversity of operations across the value chain and relevance of energy efficiency to multiple disciplines & functions. Paper portrays details of the energy competency model and the associated key modules along with a brief on the steps involved for model execution. It also provides insight about the energy competencies library and its structure. Paper describes mapping of learning solutions, critical experiences and professional membership & accreditation to energy competencies. ADNOC Gas Processing constituted a task force with representation of major energy intensive OPCOs, key disciplines, subject matter experts (SMEs) and competencies management experts. A systematic approach was adopted, comprising sequential activities, starting by defining the competencies groups and competencies, followed by development of a comprehensive library of energy competencies statements. These statements structured into four proficiency levels for each competency. Proficiency levels for each competency were set individually, for each of the four energy positions, to specify the Job Level Requirement (JLR) for these roles. In addition to competencies, forms for Real Work Records (RWR) were produced as one of the key deliverables, including entries of all the identified tasks (real works) and their mapping with competencies. Energy competencies and the required proficiency levels were also identified, as support competencies, for selected key non-energy positions which are either directly responsible for energy performance or their performance may have significant impact on energy performance. To fill the gap between possessed and required competencies for any role, training curriculum, based on variety of learning solutions, and professional membership & accreditations from multiple international bodies was mapped to job grades. Energy competency model has been developed in line with the existing competency management system for seamless integration. Energy efficiency continual improvement is anticipated on application of this comprehensive energy competency model, addressing all pertinent aspects & dimensions of energy performance. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Electric energy storage; Energy management systems; Gas industry; Gas producers; Gasoline; Mapping; Abu dhabi national oil companies; Competencies managements; Competency management systems; Comprehensive energy; Energy efficiency improvements; Mechanical and electrical; Sequential activities; Subject matter experts; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059985301

When data is harnessed effectively and then combined with engineering insight it has the ability to radically improve how energy assets are designed, operated and optimized from concept and front end design all the way through the life of the field to decommissioning. Aker Solutions has developed a data platform and series of software applications which together form a digital twin capable of optimizing energy operations at a product, facility and field level integrating subsea and topside facilities. The digital twin, conceived during the early concept phase (or retrofit to existing assets), draws together diverse data sources into an integrated format which can be managed and enriched as the asset progresses through its lifecycle. Software applications built on this platform include: • Using knowledge-based and adaptable building blocks, our early phase software application accelerates the development of concepts with the ability to rapidly explore different options and adjust and optimize to different customer driven variables • During detailed design phase, software applications are used to drive engineering automation and ensure that safety is built inherently into the design • Simulation software applications are used to test and evaluate complex installation operations in a virtual environment before any offshore operations take place • Digital twin can add significant value during operations and maintenance activities with performance and integrity data collated and visualized helping to make informed decisions to ensure production optimization and continuity • At a product level, Aker Solutions' connected subsea equipment uses software applications and analytics to perform condition monitoring and enable predictive maintenance, maximizing production uptime This digital thread allows data to seamlessly transition across asset phases enabling engineers, operators and asset managers to make informed and confident data-driven decisions; increasing efficiency, reducing cost and reducing risk. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Condition monitoring; Cost engineering; Digital storage; Gasoline; Knowledge based systems; Offshore oil well production; Predictive analytics; Product design; Software testing; Subsea engineering; Virtual reality; Data driven decision; Offshore operations; Operations and maintenance; Optimizing energy; Predictive maintenance; Production optimization; Simulation software; Software applications; Application programs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059975426
