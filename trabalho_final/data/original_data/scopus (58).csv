Since their conception in the early 20th century, the health benefit applications of probiotics have been expanding, culminating in the recent challenge of health claim substantiation in Europe. This paper highlights the different application areas of probiotics, introduces the use of non-viable microorganisms to confer health benefits, and explains the recent regulatory challenges surrounding probiotics. It then describes in detail the different stages in the development of food products containing probiotic bacteria starting from the selection of suitable strains for industrial production. The description of production of probiotic powders with specific focus on strategies to maintain high viability during drying and storage then follows. The paper finishes with a discussion of probiotic stability in liquid products, followed by a description of the use of probiotics to improve nutrient bioavailability and digestibility of the food products, which they ferment or biotransform. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biotransformation; Health benefit; Health claim; Manufacturing; Probiotic; Stability; Storage","20th century; Application area; Biotransformation; Health benefits; Industrial production; Liquid products; Non-viable; Paper finish; Probiotic bacteria; Probiotics; Science and Technology; Biochemistry; Convergence of numerical methods; Energy storage; Food products; Manufacture; Microorganisms; Health; probiotic agent; article; bacterial strain; bioavailability; digestion; food biotechnology; food industry; food processing; food storage; health; nonhuman; priority journal; science; technology; Biotechnology; Food Microbiology; Humans; Probiotics; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871645584

Including a load in the system which requires substantial energy in a short time interval, as in the case for fast charging stations, leads to voltage flicker, resulting in a high peak power demand.

To capture transient changes it was crucial to describe NH 3 and NO adsorption. For the H-BEA model the storage of ammonia was simplified to proceed on two zeolite sites representing weak and strong Bronsted acid sites, while NO only is adsorbed on Bronsted acid sites. Furthermore, the oxidation of NH 3 and NO, and the NH 3-SCR reaction are assumed to proceed over the Bronsted acid sites. To model Fe-BEA, monomeric and dimeric iron, and iron oxide particles represent sites of three different types of iron species. Ammonia and NO adsorb on monomeric iron which is assumed to be the governing site for low temperature SCR. Dimeric iron species provide the activity for high temperature SCR and NH 3-oxidation. Furthermore, iron particles, Fe 2O 3, are not active for NH 3-SCR but for oxidation of NO. A spillover mechanism of ammonia adsorbed on Bronsted acid sites to monomeric iron sites is included in the model to simulate the inhibiting effect of NH 3 during the SCR reaction. The spillover rate was found to be independent of the site density and depends only on the fraction of free sites, indicating that a constant number of Bronsted acid sites buffer each active iron site, unaffected by the hydrothermal treatment. The model describes the experiments well for H-BEA and Fe-BEA before and after hydrothermal treatment by decreasing the site density and keeping the kinetic parameters constant except the binding energy of ammonia to Bronsted sites, which was found to decrease with hydrothermal treatment. Finally, the model was validated in separate ammonia inhibiting experiments, not used in the fitting process of the kinetic parameters.

Their role as energy storages in the electricity grid could provide local sustainable solutions to support more renewable energy. In order to estimate the extent of interaction of EVs in the electricity grid operation, a careful examination in the local electricity system is essential. This paper investigates the degree of EV penetration and its key influence on the low voltage distribution grids. Three detailed models of residential grids in Denmark are considered as test cases in this study, where alternate and flexible domestic solutions like EVs are inevitable for integrating the increasing amount of variable wind power. The result from these analyses shows that the individual feeder capabilities of handling an increasing amount of EV loads, is varied from 0-40% on an hourly basis. Also it is shown that there is enough head-space on the transformer capacity which can be used to charge many EVs during a day. The overall transformer capability of handling EV loads varies between 6-40% for peak and minimum demand hours, which is dependent on the robustness of the grids. The voltage drops are reflected as the major technical constraint to the stable operation of the electricity grids for integrating more EVs, when compared to the thermal loading on the cables. © 2012 IEEE.","charging plan; distribution transformer; electric vehicles; low voltage distribution grids; wind power","Charging plan; Denmark; Detailed models; Distribution grid; Distribution transformer; Electricity grids; Electricity system; Low voltages; Low-voltage distributions; Renewable energies; Stable operation; Sustainable solution; Technical constraints; Test case; Thermal loadings; Transformer capacity; Voltage drop; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric transformers; Electricity; Voltage distribution measurement; Wind power; Electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870608040

In Denmark, the political goal for 2050 is an energy system totally based on renewable sources. Renewable electricity production from wind power and photovoltaics fluctuates and creates a need for power production in periods with low power generation and a demand for storage of excess power production in high-wind periods. Energinet.dk has conducted studies of how to obtain efficiency in an energy system based heavily on wind power. The major conclusions are that it is possible, but intelligent integration of the energy systems (power, gas, heat and transport) is necessary to maintain high energy efficiency and security of supply. The gas system has the strength, in an economically efficient manner, to complement the fluctuating power production and deliver the balancing power production. Furthermore, the gas system may be used to store electricity over time in periods with excess electricity. This paper elaborates on the technological and economic aspects of a high-wind power scenario focusing on integration of the energy systems.

Compared to traditional wired systems, wireless solutions reduce the installation time and costs and are not subjected to breakage caused by harsh weather conditions or other extreme events. Because of the low installation costs, wireless sensor networks allow the deployment of a big number of wireless sensor nodes on the structures. Moreover, the nodes can be placed on particularly critical components of the structure difficult to reach by wires. In most of the cases the power supply are conventional batteries, which could be a problem because of their finite life span. Furthermore, in the case of wireless sensor nodes located on structures, it is often advantageous to embed them, which makes an access impossible. Therefore, if a method of obtaining the untapped energy surrounding these sensors was implemented, significant life could be added to the power supply. Various approaches to energy harvesting and energy storage are discussed and limitations associated with the current technology are addressed. In this paper we first discuss the research that has been performed in the area of energy harvesting for wireless sensor technologies by using the ambient vibration energy. In many cases the energy produced by the ambient vibrations is far too small to directly power a wireless sensor node. Therefore, in a second step we discuss the development process for an electronic energy harvesting circuit optimized for piezoelectric transducers.

It is possible to produce ammonia with no carbon foot-print: electricitygenerated by one of the renewable sources (e.g. wind or solar) can produce hydrogen bywater electrolysis while nitrogen for the subsequent catalytic ammonia synthesis can bedelivered by separation from air.The renewable energy storage aspect of ammonia can be conceptually utilized toovercome the limitations of the renewable energy generators e.g. wind and solar power.Wind power is intermittent because it depends on the wind flow. Solar power is onlyavailable at day time. The intermittent nature of wind power makes grid balancing verychallenging. The unavailability of solar power means that some sort of storagetechnology is needed to provide continuous power. Renewable electricity to ammoniaproduction can act as a chemical buffer which can efficiently absorb excess electricityfrom the grid, temporarily storing it as ammonia to deliver the electricity back to the gridwhen power generation by the renewable sources is lower than demand.The great potential of Ammonia as a zero carbon fuel has not been exploredcompletely because it is toxic, and because of very high vapor pressure of liquidammonia (~8 bar at room temperature), there are safety concerns about storing liquidammonia for end-user applications. Ammonia can, however, be stored safely as metalammines which has energy density similar to that of liquid ammonia (~110 kg H2/m3). Itenables safe use of ammonia as an energy carrier for end-user applications.

The most electric power consumers such as AC motors and electrically operated clocks depend on a certain system frequency. Actually, a malfunction of these equipments negatively affects our lives. Hence, AGC is carried out to the power system in order to maintain the constant and the stable system frequency. In this chapter, the main principle of AGC is investigated and its application based on swarm intelligence optimization for a hydrothermal power system is presented. After the explanation of AGC, the gain scheduling Proportional-pl*us-Integral (PI) control technique and the scheduling algorithm based on swarm intelligence, which is used in this application are introduced. The control technique with tunable weighted cost function is carried out to the power system which includes two control areas having a steam turbine and a hydro turbine connected together through tie lines. Both areas also include Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) units in order to improve the performance of the control. To optimize the gains of PI-controller and the parameters of the proposed cost function, Constriction Factor Approach Particle Swarm Optimization (CFA-PSO) algorithm is used. The usage of this algorithm to optimize the gains of the PI-controllers and the tunable weight coefficients of the cost function was detailed explained with the parts of its program in order to help the researchers which study on optimal AGC for multi area power system. The result of the control was also investigated and discussed. At the end of the simulations, it is seen that the proposed AGC technique improves the dynamic performances of the power system. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Automatic generation control; Gain scheduling PI-controller; Hydrothermal power system; Particle Swarm optimization; SMES unit",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891969395

Such storage is generally used in order to smooth out the time lag between the acquisition and the use of energy, for example by using heat water tanks within heating systems. In this work we use a multi-agent system in order to maintain and operate distributed thermal storage among a large group of buildings in a district heating system. There are several financial and environmental benefits of using such a system, such as avoiding peak load production, optimizing combined heat and power strategies and achieving general energy efficiency within the network. Normally a district heating system is purely demand driven, resulting in poor operational characteristics on a system wide scale. However, by using the thermal inertia of buildings it is possible to manage and coordinate the heat load among a large group of buildings in order to implement supply driven operational strategies. This results in increased possibilities to optimize the production mix from financial and environmental aspects. We present a multi-agent system that combines the thermal storage capacities of buildings with production optimization strategies. The system consist of producer agents responsible for valuing the heat load management, consumer agents managing the quality of service in individual buildings while consenting to participate in heat load management, and a market agent acting as a mediating layer between the producer and consumer agents. The market agent uses an auction-like process in order to coordinate the heat load management among the consumer agents, while the producer agents use load forecasting in order to evaluate the need for heat load management at any given point in time. A consumer agent uses continues feedback regarding indoor climate in order to uphold quality of service while participating in heat load management. Real-time data from a district heating system in Sweden is used in order to evaluate the agent system in relation to operational peak load management. The results show clear financial and environmental gains for the producer as well as participating consumers.","Coordination; Distributed decision making; Real-time agreements","Combined heat and power; Coordination; Distributed decision making; District heating system; Environmental benefits; Operational characteristics; Operational strategies; Production optimization; Buildings; Commerce; District heating; Electric load forecasting; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Quality of service; Thermal load; Water tanks; Electric load management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891820531

Because there are numerous fossil fuel reserves in the north of the Black Sea, the trend of renewable energies in this region is less than in other countries. The use of fossil fuels in this region causes an increase in both regional and global aspects of environmental pollution. The formation of the H2S in Black Sea, which is a closed sea, affects the natural life of its inhabitants and environmental flora in this region. If the H2S can be separated to produce pure hydrogen using various methods, H2S pollution in this sea will be overcome and pure hydrogen will be used in the fuel cells for alternative energy production. The amount of H2S ensures an adequate potential of energy production in multiple countries around the Black Sea. Moreover, a large amount of the world's boron reserves are in Turkey. Boron is an ideal material for hydrogen storage. Black Sea coastal countries, especially Turkey, must incline using efficient and renewable energy. Country strategies shall be issued aiming this tendency. For the realization of a more conscious use of energy in the future, education should emphasize on energy efficiency and environmental protection. Especially to create the necessary awareness by preschool and primary school students, the topic should be included in the curricula as well as in the social responsibility projects.

Beam lifetime at injection energy is equal to approximately 1 hour. In order to minimize beam losses of the stored beam it is necessary to accelerate energy ramping process. It is not very simple because power supplies of bending magnets, quadrupole lenses and sextupoles have different response time and behavior after changes in regulated current level. Magnetic elements are manufactured from non-laminated iron. It leads to slower field/gradient increasing at high current values. Complicated algorithm with 9 intermediate regimes (collections of power supplies' settings) was developed to produce fast and efficient energy ramping. First, correction of closed orbit, betatron tunes and chromaticity is accomplished in each regime in static conditions. Special file is used to provide acceleration or deceleration of power supplies in dynamic conditions. This scheme allows to compensate betatron tune shifts during energy ramping. Power supplies are not stopped on intermediate regimes; speed of current changing is continuous function of time. This algorithm allowed decreasing ramping time down to 2 minutes 40 seconds. Beam losses are not exceeding 2 - 3%; betatron tune shifts as a rule are lower than 0.01. The algorithm can easily be modified to stop in any intermediate regime.

In our previous work we proposed a thermal battery which would benefit from state-of-the-art heat pumps in order to provide useful cooling and heating. The preliminary analysis demonstrated the benefit of using excess electricity from intermittent renewable power sources, e.g. solar or wind, and converting it into the hot and cold water storage tanks typically used for residential applications. The time response of mechanical heat pumps is slow and their efficiency suffers from fluctuating electricity supplies. To overcome this issue, we propose thermoelectric (TE) co-generation systems that benefit from their fast response and scalability. Modeling has been performed to optimize the TE module for the effective harvesting of both heat and electricity from intermittent solar energy with response times in minutes. Throughout the modeling and experiments, the combined coefficient-of-performance (COP) is found to be 1.6, while the hot water is 52.5°C and cold water is 16.5°C, both from 22.3°C. The COP is moderate, but due to its quick response, the accumulated energy harvested by this thermoelectric system could be comparable to mechanical compressor systems.

Such object could be studied at an e+e-collider with about 240-GeV centre-of-mass energy. A corresponding Higgs factory - 'LEP3' -could be installed in the LHC tunnel, reducing its cost and also allowing for a second lifeof the two LHC generalpurpose detectors.

At this luminosity around 20,000 Higgs eventsper year per experiment could be obtained for a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of115-130 GeV. For the parameters considered the estimated luminosity lifetime is about 16minutes, and the synchrotron radiation losses are 50 MW per beam. High operationalefficiency requires two rings: a low emittance collider storage ring operating at constantenergy, and a separate accelerator to top up the colliding beams every few minutes. Thealternative of a larger ring collider installed in a new, bigger tunnel will also bediscussed. The LEP3 collider could as well operate on the Z resonance, where it wouldachieve luminosities above 1035 cm -2s-1.

An in-vacuum undulator is designed to have no vacuum chamber between the magnet arrays so to allow the entire magnet gap to be fully used for the dynamic aperture. An in-vacuum undulator can optimally minimize the gap to achieve continuous energy spectra. One problem of an undulator with a small gap is resistive wall heating by the image current. The heat load depends strongly on the injected mode in the storage ring; injection of multiple bunches might deteriorate the thermal performance for the magnet array.

As an energy carrier electricity has some disadvantages like its wire need for transportation and its being non-storable for large amounts. To store more energy safely and to transport it easily, new storing medias and devices are needed. Metal hydrides, carbon nanotubes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), compressed gas hydrogen and liquid hydrogen systems are being investigated to store and transport hydrogen safely and easily. To use hydrogen as renewable and sustainable energy source on board for transportation and many mobile applications economically and efficiently, USA Department Of Energy (DOE) had set targets for 2010 and 2015. System gravimetric and volumetric density should be 5.5 % wt and 40 g/L respectively according to DOE. To meet the DOE 2015 targets a novel organometallic valin-Cu(II) complex studied. After metal organic framework structured valin-Cu(II) complex synthesis, it is characterized by elemental analysis, X-Ray, FT-IR and thermo analytic TG-DTG techniques. And then hydrogen storage capacity of complex is determined by HPVA-100 adsorption analyser.","Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen Storage; Metal Organic Frameworks; MOFs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884530088

Recent evaluation of geological information has suggested that 25% of the world's remaining natural resources lie below thick ice in the Arctic offshore. Russian Arctic offshore has according to estimates 31% of the world's known and currently unexploited reserves of natural gas. Longer-term prospects are therefore promising. A six-fold increase in LNG trade from now until 2030 is expected [1]. Over this longer term it seems likely that exploitation of the giant natural gas fields of the Western Arctic regions of Russia will enhance the development of Arctic LNG shipping. Increasing energy demand is driving greater interest in the exploration and production of natural gas in the Arctic Region. This creates a challenge for shipping gas in such extreme conditions. In this paper, we mainly investigate the overall LNG market. And explore available alternative transportation options. Over the last five years there has been significant research and development done in the areas of LNG ships and ice-class tankers. In this paper the most promising ship design and power concepts of Arctic LNG ships/tankers are going to be reviewed. We will discuss in detail recent developments and trends in LNG ship and ice-strengthening tanker design such as: The first large double-acting ice-class tanker (DAT) design Double acting pusher puller barge (DAPPB) design Also, offloading systems for LNG carriers are going to be touched upon in this paper. Analysis of the mentioned above concepts will be carried out with Russian Arctic Offshore Yamal region as an example. Potential solution for the issue of Arctic-class tankers' limitation to navigate in thick ice areas is ship-to-ship LNG transfer, which is also presented in this paper. Arctic tanker could transport its cargo of LNG to the edge of the ice sheet and transfer the load to another, faster vessel, or perhaps offload at a dedicated storage site. The possible offloading concept from shore to offshore in the harsh ice condition of this region and further loading to tankers seems to be very feasible issue to observe. Comparison between two offloading system like STS (ship-to-ship) and Tandem in the Arctic condition will be given.

However, storage, transportation of large amounts of urine, as well as spreading and hygienic aspects connected to handling of urine and faeces are still main obstacles in achieving full system efficiency. A decade of academic research on struvite precipitation and zeolite adsorption techniques aimed to solve some of these problems and 3 years of collaboration with Split Vision Development AB resulted in a commercially available system developed and tested in laboratory scale and in a pilot plant. One year testing of a pilot plant installed and integrated in a family house in northern Sweden is presented here. The pilot plant is based on the combined struvite precipitation and zeolite adsorption processes. The nutrient rich end-product obtained in the unit called SplitBox is vacuum-dried (fully hygienised) and this drying process connects the SplitBox to the energy system of the house for maximal energy efficiency. The pilot study shows 90 - 98 % P and 95 - 98 % N recovery from toilet wastes using urine separating toilet and SplitBox technique and a total energy saving of ca 50 % for the household after one year operation. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

Due to logistics, these turbines are only offshore, maybe in deserts, but likely later than 2025. ""Windy Spot"" on land is judged to have mainly 2 to 7 MW WTGs depending on site-vicinity to human neighbors, etc-and due to details of the operation, best practice and economy. The authors focus on the electrical systems which are developed to meet expectations due to investors' CAPEX & OPEX aspects, wind power/energy integration, ratings, and to empower the variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar with security of scheduled energy delivery. Furthermore, system reliability and availability-low MTBF and MTTR-along with high man and machine safety on distant sites. Internet connection, possibly via satellite, is a cost-effective asset for continuous monitoring and regular non-visiting inspections many times per year. • Offshore installations have become themes for emerging energy law, agreements and treaties, e.g., jurisdiction or rules regarding offshore infrastructure to avoid trans-boundary conflicts or uncertainties in investments and operations. • Desert installations of wind turbine generators will emerge. They will be combined with solar power plants and form trans-boundary desert entities and be connected to transmission installations forming the Mediterranean Electricity Ring. With a complex mixture of mechanics, computers, EPC and environment around 'electricity', we foresee a mutual area: Wind Power and Transmission System Harmonization The onshore and offshore ""Windy Spot"" plants 2021, seen from March 2012 Future flexible electricity systems in WTGs and T&D, our specialty, comprise: • Power electronic converters where semiconductor materials as well as module layouts and detailed circuits might change due to market needs as they changed before. New demands on grid fault ride-through with new disturbance profiles come like those emerging in OECD-NEA works in the end of 00's. • Control- & switch-gear as well as power electronics are already today carriers of intelligence. These units will be accompanied by smart generators, transformers and the like having the capacity to perform some features like surveillance and diagnostics independently of central operations. • The synchronous generator with permanent magnet, PM, excitation is an obvious choice for the use in the large offshore direct-driven wind turbines. Superconducting generators remain as candidate in studies and laboratory tests. The gearbox-based combinations will employ ""cool rotor"", competing with today's DFIGs, to furnish low-weight units. All are simple to transport, erect, operate, repair & refurbish. • Safe and cost-efficient EPC is all-embracing, i.e., engineering, procurement and commissioning processes, including very stochastic procedures like collection grid EPC especially MV-cable laying and repairing in open sea and maybe in deserts, too. • Voltage quality and power quality are themes that are even more in close proximity to final solutions based on static VAR compensators and battery storage, expanding traditional FACTS devices. • The first meshed HVDC multi-terminal links are in operation for offshore wind plants and likely also for interregional/international power transmission paths. With offshore plants close to existing offshore oil-&-gas installations, there are possibilities to prime wind power into fungible/interchangeable electric power without electro-chemical accumulators. Priming offshore might give new platform arrangements. • Storage, power dissipation dumps and their immediate and automatic control are necessary to keep power quality, especially the power system frequency on various time scales. Reinforced transmission lines and energy transactions compete with physical accumulator storage embodiments. • Automation solutions will be leading also in repairing with technical specialists staying at their office desks and superior communication tools with repairs staff licensed for offshore works with safety, reliability and full survivability. Software is simple to be changed, in the twinkling of an eye, both initially and during the plant's life-time. • Research on materials is a pivotal road. This and the issues above are expanded in the full paper. Lessons learned include: • To be prepared for upgrading offerings and existing equipment for new demands, e.g., grid codes. • On components that are bought at lowest price, e.g., in an early offshore plant installation without needed, detailed hand-shaking procedures in sales and procurement. • To be aware of the risks associated with technology changes and with new users and virgin sites for wind generation plants.",,"Direct-driven wind turbine; Offshore infrastructure; Offshore installations; Power electronic converters; Power system frequencies; Static VAR compensators; Superconducting generator; Variable renewable energies; Arid regions; Automation; Control; Economics; Electric fault currents; Electricity; Exhibitions; Flexible electronics; Gas plants; Investments; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Offshore oil wells; Offshore structures; Power electronics; Repair; Solar power plants; Storage (materials); Synchronous generators; Turbogenerators; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884402180

This is usually not the case, however. Particularly when the grid is weak, unacceptable voltage gradients may occur. A centrally placed FACTS device such as an SVC or a STATCOM can provide the necessary functionality and be used as an alternative to complex and expensive equipment in each wind turbine generator. This is sometimes also the only option to be compliant with the Grid Code. When wind penetration becomes a significant fraction of the load, added regulation is required for good grid stability control to compensate the fluctuations in generated wind power. Dynamic Energy Storage may provide a valuable option for such compensating capacity. Dynamic energy storage will also prove useful as a means for storing wind power during low demand, and releasing it into the grid during high demand. The paper is treating typical challenges in AC grids powered by wind, as well as demonstrating several examples of safeguarding dynamic grid stability and availability. Some salient design features of SVC and Dynamic Energy Storage are also presented. Three recent cases of real life experience are highlighted: • Several 69 kV directly connected SVCs for grid stabilization in conjunction with a high degree of wind penetration • An SVC for integration of large wind clusters in a 400 kV grid • A Dynamic Energy Storage pilot plant for wind integration into an 11 kV distribution grid.",,"Design features; Expensive equipments; Grid stabilizations; K-V distribution; Life experiences; Voltage gradient; Wind integration; Wind penetration; Electric network topology; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Pilot plants; Wind power; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884302461

The first de-orbiting mechanism of interest uses spiral springs as energy producing mechanism for mechanical deployment as well as thin membranes which are planned to provide orbit decay as aero-brake structures. Membrane storage is provided by a storing unit with storing cylinders when the system is de-active while the deployment of the system till the end of mission life is prevented by a lock mechanism. The second system employs a simpler working principle by just involving a spiral spring mechanism. The deployment is provided through the solar panel spaces by the direct contact between springs and the deployment material. The sizing of deployable structure in both designs depends on the neccssary drag area for de-orbiting while the designs are even expected to be reliable with low mass and small volume requirements. The required drag area is calculated through maximum de-orbiting time of the satellite, which is determined as 25 years by considering the maximum orbital life time suggestion of United Nations Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). De-orbiting time values of each design are calculated in Satellite Tool Kit (STK) by considering J4 perturbation propagator and NRLMSISE 2000 as a high-fidelity atmospheric model, and finally checked whether they satisfy the specified maximum life time criterion. The final design is selected by considering reliability criteria, and is planning to be manufactured and tested in Space Systems Design and Testing Laboratory (SSDTL) of Istanbul Technical University (ITU).

This is primarily due to their attractive features such as low cost and short development time. Femto-Satellites aim to extrapolate this trend of decreasing both cost and development times, targeting for a satellite mass of less than 100 g. However, realizing feasible space application with such small satellites is not straightforward, and necessitates new approaches to spacecraft engineering and mission design. The aim of this paper is to explore novel techniques to design and develop femto-satellite system architecture for relevant space applications. Remote sensing in the infra-red (IR) spectrum is chosen as a potential space application with a femto- satellite. Characterization of IR spectrum observations has interesting applications in vegetation studies and fire monitoring. The paper presents the design of a Femto-Satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that can deliver IR images with a spatial resolution of 350 m directly to a ground station. All subsystems are developed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components, thereby leading to low cost and suitable for mass production. Some of the innovative methodologies used in the design are, having a single processor core for the communication transceiver and for onboard logic, super capacitors with capacity of 500 mAh to 1000 mAh for energy storage. The preliminary design results show that the power budget allows adequate operation of the payload and a link margin of +6 db for ground communication. Further, this design is contrasted with traditional satellite design to analyze similarities and dissimilarities in relationships such as subsystem power allocation and mass allocation. This adds more insight into the design process.

We study the impact on performance of energy conversion efficiency and of wind prediction quality. Specifically, we provide theoretical bounds on the trade-off between energy loss and fast ramping generation, which we show to be tight for large capacity of the available storage.

This large volume of water amounts to nearly one-third of the total annual discharge of the Yangtze River. Reservoir construction has dramatically changed the spatial distribution of water resources in the basin. Substantial amounts of water are now impounded in the upper reaches of the basin for energy generation and the pattern of seasonal water discharge has been altered. Future anthropogenic changes could further worsen the situation as additional large hydropower projects are completed in the upper reaches of the basin. This will cause more serious ecosystem disconnectivity through the elimination of free-flowing streams. Free-flowing streams are vanishing on the mainstem and major tributaries, such as the Jinshajiang, Wujiang, Dadu, Yuanjiang and Jialingjiang, because of reservoir construction. At present, 4688 km of streams are regulated by dams and this figure could increase to 7298 km by 2025 when all the dams currently under construction are put into operation. If all the planned dams are completed, the figure could jump to 10 675 km, or about 43% of the total length of the streams. At that time, almost all the mainstem and major tributaries will be fully regulated and this could lead to very serious negative ecosystem effects by disconnecting sediment/nutrient transport and fish migration.

Pumped storage still is the most valid option. The capacity of existing facilities is not sufficient to accommodate future renewable resources. New locations for additional pumped storage capacity are scarce. Mountainous areas mostly are remote and do not allow construction of large facilities for ecological reasons. In the Netherlands underground solutions were studied for many years. The use of (former) coal mines was rejected after scientific research. Further research showed that solid rock formations below the (unstable) coal layers can be harnessed to excavate the lower water reservoir for pumped storage, making an innovative underground solution possible. A complete plan was developed, with a capacity of 1400 MW (8 GWh daily output) and a head of 1400 m. It is technically and economically feasible. Compared to conventional pumped storage it has significantly less impact on the environment. Less vulnerable locations are eligible. The reservoir on the surface (only one instead of two) is relatively small. It offers also a solution for other European countries. The Dutch studies provide a valuable basis for new locations. © Owned by the authors 2012.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883105226

Recent innovations in research and design have reduced to a few alternatives with limited impact on residential construction. Cost effective solutions have been found at larger scale, but storage and delivery of energy to the actual location it is used, remain a critical issue. The Integrated Roof Wind Energy System is designed to overcome the current issues of urban and larger scale renewable energy system. The system is built up by an axial array of skewed shaped funnels that make use of the Venturi Effect to accelerate the wind flow. This inventive use of shape and geometry leads to a converging air capturing inlet to create high wind mass flow and velocity toward a vertical-axis wind turbine in the top of the roof for generation of a relatively high amount of energy. The methods used in this overview of studies include an array of tools from analytical modelling, PIV wind tunnel testing, and CFD simulation studies. The results define the main design parameters for an efficient system, and show the potential for the generation of high amounts of renewable energy with a novel and effective system suited for the built environment. © Owned by the authors 2012.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883071609

They were tested using a DSC with a high pressure gold-plated steel crucible to evaluate the thermal reaction characteristics with effects of various voltages. Moreover, the parameters were obtained for thermal runaway reaction, such as initial exothermic temperature (T0), maximum temperature (Tmax), and heat flux of the Li-ion cell (ΔH). The results show that T0 was reduced with the increasing voltage of the batteries, and the self-heat reaction was not caused right away after the separator was melted that occurred until the repercussive temperature.

The hypothesis is that air-tight storage of high-moisture barley and wheat will increase nutrient digestibility due to chemical conversions prior to feeding. The objective was to evaluate the effect of high moisture compared to dry storage of barley and wheat on digestibility of P and CP. The crops were grown on 1 field keeping other factors constant. Half of the grains was harvested in the morning after a rainy day and stored in air-tight silos (DM, %: barley, 85.2; wheat, 82.8) and the other half was harvested later the same day (windy and sunny) and stored dry (DM, %: barley, 89.8; wheat, 88.3). After 6 mo of storage, 1 low- and 1 high-moisture diet were prepared with a barley:wheat ratio of 1:1 mixed with soybean (Glycine max) meal and rapeseed cake to produce a compound diet without inorganic P and microbial phytase. Sixteen 45-kg pigs housed in metabolism crates were fed either the low- or the highmoisture diet for 5 d for adaptation and 7 d for total collection of feces. Digestibility of P was 12% higher (P < 0.01) and of CP was 4% higher (P = 0.08) in the high-moisture diet. Phytase activity of dry-stored grain was lower (P < 0.01) and phytate P was 4% higher in the high-moisture stored grain vs. the grains stored dry. Overall, high-moisture storage increased digestibility of P and CP when the grain was fed to finishing pigs. Therefore, high-moisture air-tight storage saved energy (without drying) and at the same time enhanced P digestibility and increased the nutritional value of grain probably through enzymatic activity during storage. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

The Level-1 Trigger is the first rate-reducing step in the ATLAS Trigger, with an output rate of 75 kHz and a decision latency of less than 2.5 μs. It is primarily composed of the Calorimeter Trigger, Muon Trigger, and the Central Trigger Processor which are implemented in custom built VME electronics. The Central Trigger Processor collects trigger information from all Level-1 systems and produces a Level-1 trigger decision that initiates the readout of all ATLAS subdetectors. In 2014 the LHC will run at center of mass energy of 14 TeV, compared to the current 8 TeV, and the luminosity will exceed 1034 cm-2 s-1. With higher luminosities, the required number and complexity of Level-1 triggers will increase in order to satisfy the physics goals of ATLAS while keeping the total Level-1 rates at or below 100 kHz. It is also foreseen to install a Level-1 Topological trigger in the 2013 shutdown period to further improve the selection at this trigger stage. In order to process more trigger inputs and the additional hardware, the Central Trigger Processor will be upgraded during the 2013 shutdown. In this presentation the current Central Trigger Processor, the justification for the upgrade, and the proposed upgrade to satisfy the requirements of the 2014 physics run at the LHC will be discussed. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Center-of-mass energies; Central trigger processors; Collision rate; Event storages; Level-1 triggers; Muon trigger; Output rate; Subdetectors; Medical imaging; Nuclear physics; Tellurium compounds; Luminance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881608737

For grid integration of ac type distributed generators, the ac/ac converters need voltage boost function, which can't be achieved by traditional IMC due to its limited input-to-output voltage transfer gain 0.866. Alternatively, reverse power flow operation of IMC can be implemented to meet voltage boost requirement for distributed generation interface. Intuitively, only the generator side power needs to be controlled, since the power will be spontaneously transferred to the grid side due to the lack of energy storage in IMC. However, open-loop operation of grid side (current source side) converter will lead to uncontrollable grid side reactive power. This paper proposes control schemes of IMC with controllable grid side reactive power by means of controlling both the generator and grid side currents coordinately with properly designed control loop.

The heart of this converter is a transformer which, in some designs, may include the required inductance to shape the current and control the energy transfer. This paper shows that for these designs, tape wound cores, usually made of amorphous or nanocrystalline materials, are not the best core option due to leakage flux which is orthogonal to the lamination layers. This flux increases losses in these types of cores. Solutions are proposed to overcome this significant drawback.

The resulting tails contain complex toxic compounds. With reference to this, the protection of the environment should be the major issue. A complete detoxification of cyanides before disposal, a partial detoxification to the allowable concentrations and a disposal of tails at a polygon followed by the detoxification of excess water into the environment are offered as an environmentally friendly way of disposal. However, a complete detoxification of the cyanidation tails does not give the required results due to the presence of toxic compounds, cyanides and thiocyanates in tailings ponds. This is due to adsorption-desorption process occurring between solid and liquid phases. A partial detoxification is used to down cyanide to the allowable concentrations, which are safe to the environment. The storage of tails without detoxification is mainly used at low concentrations of toxic compounds in the disposed tails. With reference to this, water recycling is practiced by Russian plants in order to reduce as much as possible or almost eliminate toxic effluents into the environment. Fresh water is applied if necessary and to make up for water losses, with 8-12% of total water supply. This allows for the stability of water balance and the decrease of consumption of the reagents applied. The conditioning technologies of water recycling followed by regeneration of free cyanide and metals recovery as saleable concentrates are specially developed due to adverse impact of water recycling on gold recovery processes due to high concentration of base metals (copper). These technologies are also profitable. In order to detoxify cyanide in the tails for tailings dam, effective and inexpensive technologies involving a seasonal use of detoxified reagents were developed. For example, a technology with aldehydes use which is applied by a series of operations. Effluents disposed to the environment are detoxified using chlorination followed by almost a complete destruction of toxic cyanides and thiocyanates. Before disposal, chlorinated water is settled to precipitate the resulting hydroxides of metals and complete chemical reactions such as a full decomposition of hypochlorite ions. In order to protect ground water, watertight screens from local water-resistant materials are used. The samples of these materials were previously tested and chosen according to their maximum ability to adsorb toxic compounds in the tailings pond. If local water-resistant materials are not available, whole welded impermeable polymer screens are used. The options mentioned allow the storage of cyanidation tails in accordance with national ecological standards.","Cyaninides; Detoxification; Environmental safety; Recycled water-supply; Storage; Thiocyanates; Wastes","Adsorption-desorption process; Cyaninides; Environmental safety; Hydrometallurgical process; Protection of the environments; Recycled water-supply; Thiocyanates; Water-resistant materials; Chlorination; Cyanides; Decomposition; Detoxification; Energy storage; Gold; Groundwater; Hydrometallurgy; Metal recovery; Ore tailings; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Technology; Wastes; Water recycling; Water supply; Effluents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879971072

Conventional flux-based solder ball attachment process is fast reaching its bottleneck in satisfying the more restrictive pitch tolerances, and assembling challenges in optoelectronics and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) packages. To meet the new packaging requirements, a new flux-less laser solder ball jetting technology has been developed. Despite the various advantages which laser solder ball jetting can offer, it has not been extensively reported. In this paper, fine pitch laser solder ball jetting at 200μm pitch was demonstrated using 120μm SAC305 solder spheres. The reliability of the laser jetted bumps was evaluated and compared against the flux-based reflowed bumps, by subjecting the bumps under high temperature storage (1250C for 24hrs, 500hrs and 1000 hrs) and multiple reflow (5 and 10 times). The quality and reliability of the solder joints were quantified through the solder ball shear test, cross-sectioning, energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. From our results, laser jetted bumps showed high initial average shear strength of 10.70g/mil2, which eventually decreased to 6.96g/mil2 after 24 hours. Comparing the laser jetted bumps against the flux-based reflowed bumps after 1000 hours of thermal aging and 10 times of reflow, the average shear strength values were persistently higher and the measurements of the IMC thickness were constantly lower. Hence, laser solder ball jetting has proven to be an attractive and alternative solder ball attachment method for strong and reliable solder interconnections. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Attachment process; Better performance; Electronic package; Energy dispersive x-ray; High temperature storage; Jetting technology; Microelectronic industry; Solder interconnections; Electronics packaging; MEMS; Microelectronics; Quality control; Reliability analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Soldering alloys; Thermal aging; Soldering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879753985

While main efforts of this research focus on server and storage power reduction, network devices as part of the key components of data centers, also contribute to the overall power consumption as data centers expand. In this paper, we address this problem with two perspectives. First, in a macro level, we attempt to reduce redundant energy usage incurred by network redundancies for load balancing. Second, in the micro level, we design algorithm to limit port rate in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption. Given the guidelines we obtained from problem formulation, we propose a solution based on greedy approach with integration of network traffic and minimization of switch link rate. We also present results from a simulation-based performance evaluation which shows that expected power saving is achieved with tolerable delay. © 2012 IEEE.","Data center; Optimization; Power management","Data center networks; Data centers; Energy optimization; Greedy approaches; Network redundancy; Number of datum; Power managements; Problem formulation; Communication; Energy management; Optimization; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877647995

In terms of control systems, the presence of storage provides additional freedom to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption. In a previous paper [1] an analytical solution to the energy management problem for fuel cell hybrid propulsion systems was derived and compared with existing strategies like the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) [1-4]. An experimental study has been carried out on a Fiat Doblo, which was converted from a regular gasoline powered vehicle into a fuel cell hybrid vehicle. The fuel cell drive train comprises a 10kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack connected by means of a DC/DC converter to a Li-ion battery. The aforementioned analytical energy management strategy was used during the experiments. The experiments were carried out on a roller test bench and on the road. The experiments were conducted not only to validate the energy management strategy and the underlying models but also to establish its practical value. The paper shordy reviews the energy management problem and solution. Next the vehicle and its fuel cell hybrid drive train are presented as well as the experimental setup.

In recent years, it has also been reported that 2SrO.3Al2O3/Eu 2+ and 4SrO.7Al2O3/Eu 2+ phosphors as green and blue emitters have even higher quantum efficiencies. To determine the initial particle size effect on the phosphorescence behaviour, Eu2+ /Dy 3+ doped Sr4Al 14O25 phosphors were synthesised by mixing 4SrO and 7Al2O3 with a flux (H3BO3) through high temperature solid state reaction method under weak reducing atmosphere. Such an influence on the crystalline structure and emission colour of phosphorescent pigments was studied by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM), particle size analysis, excitation and emission spectroscopy. The results showed that the emission wavelength of the phosphorescence pigments shifted from green to blue region due to the decrease in average particle sizes of the phosphor batches, forming different types of strontium aluminate crystals. © 2012 Institute of Materials.","Long afterglow; Particle size; Phosphorescence; Rare earths; Solid state reaction; Wet milling","Crystalline structure; Energy storage materials; High temperature solid-state reaction; Long afterglow; Phosphorescent pigments; Photoluminescent materials; Weak reducing atmosphere; Wet milling; Aluminum; Boric acid; Emission spectroscopy; High temperature applications; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Phosphorescence; Phosphors; Rare earths; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid state reactions; X ray diffraction; Light emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876782341

The IEEE 802.3az protocol reduces the network energy consumption by turning active copper Ethernet links to a low power model when no traffic exists. However, the effect of 802.3az heavily depends on the network traffic patterns which makes system level energy optimization challenging. In clusters, distributed data intensive applications that generate heavy network traffic are common, and in turn the required network devices can consume large amounts of energy. In this research, we examined the 802.3az technology with the goal of applying it in clusters. We defined an energy budget calculator that takes energy-efficient Ethernet into account by including the energy models derived from tests of 802.3az enabled devices.

Tethered lipid bilayers represent one of the most promising classes of model membranes and are based on the immobilization of a planar lipid bilayer on a solid support that enables characterization by a wide range of surface-sensitive analytical techniques. Moreover, as the result of molecular engineering inspired by biology, tethered bilayers are increasingly able to mimic fundamental properties of natural cell membranes, including fluidity, electrical sealing and hosting transmembrane proteins. At the same time, new methods have been employed to improve the durability of tethered bilayers, with shelf-lives now reaching the order of weeks and months. Taken together, the capabilities of tethered lipid bilayers have opened the door to biotechnology applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring and energy storage. In this review, several examples of such applications are presented. Beyond the particulars of each example, the focus of this review is on the emerging design and characterization strategies that made these applications possible.

For ultralow-power consideration, the crucial factors in SRAMs are stability and reliability. A number of researchers considered various configurations of bit-cells for SRAMs for subthreshold operations, with differential pair structure and single-ended 8T, 9T, and 10T to improve stability and reliability. This paper proposes a 10T differential bit-cell that can effectively separate the read and write operation paths. We used a high Vth NMOS in the write operation path to reduce the bit-line leakage current. We also used virtual ground (V-Vss) to reduce the bit-line leakage to ensure that the data can be read correctly.

While dedicated to cover local power needs, their structure and operation is usually quite complex. Complexity arises due to a number of factors: in the first instance, a variety of operational modes - among them, MGs can be considered to be operated autonomously whenever the main distribution grid is not available; furthermore, the heterogeneity of energy types in a MG - not exclusively electrical energy, but also thermal for instance; also, the different functions that a MG energy management system has to fulfill - like coordination and dispatching of multiple generation, transfer, transformation and storage devices; finally, the external and internal random factors that affect operations. All these aspects make control and scheduling of a MG quite a challenging task. On the other hand, this widespread complexity leaves much room for improvement on the current state of the art. An advancement on the state of the art requires the development of a realistic model of the system at hand. This work puts forward a model of a MG that is based on the framework of Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). SHS models can capture the interaction between probabilistic elements and discrete and continuous dynamics, and thus promise to be able to tame the complexity of the systems discussed above. This work displays the outcomes of model simulations and discusses potential development of general analysis and synthesis approaches over SHS models (e.g., based on model checking and on approximate dynamic programming) for typical challenges in MGs. © 2012 IEEE.","Microgrids; Modeling; Simulation; Stochastic Hybrid Systems","Analysis and synthesis; Approximate dynamic programming; Continuous dynamics; Distribution grid; Electrical energy; Local energy; Micro grid; Model simulation; Modeling and simulation; Number of factors; Operational modes; Power needs; Random factors; Realistic model; Simulation; State of the art; Stochastic hybrid systems; Computer simulation; Energy management systems; Hybrid sensors; Model checking; Models; Random number generation; Smart power grids; Virtual storage; Solar buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874739215

In view of the large size of the problem, its solution relies on the so-called benders decomposition technic.

The method uses a real installation with relatively small storage capacity which is combined with a simulation model of the grid. The storage is cycled based on measurements from the potential grid location and desired application. A scaling factor is used to relate the physical installation capacity and power ratings with the grid-size storage in the simulation model. Such a hybrid method allows evaluating grid-size storage installations without disturbing the grid. The physical behavior of the battery and control algorithm can be evaluated under realistic conditions without the need to construct a full grid-size storage installation.

The potential to use battery storages of electric vehicles as a sink for excess electricity that may result from large integration of wind power, especially in countries like Denmark, is widely discussed and promoted. However, the wide-spread adoption of EVs requires the provision of intelligent grid and EV charging infrastructure. To analyse and understand the amount of EVs that could be integrated in the local distribution grids, within its existing capabilities, is absolutely essential for the system operators to plan and implement the levels of grid reinforcement and intelligence required. This paper investigates the local grid limitations to accommodate large amount of EVs of sizable power ratings in residential areas. The case study applied in this paper uses a detailed secondary distribution grid model in Denmark. Various EV integration scenarios are analysed in this work to understand the network operational flexibility and ruggedness. The simulation results show that level of EV integration varies with the strength of different feeders in the studied network.

One of the critical elements in LEDs lamp in ensuring optimal performance and long operating life is the LEDs driver. The driver performs a number of functions such as power conversion, power factor correction (PFC), voltage isolation and current regulation. The main focus of this project is to improve the LED driver characteristics using Cuk topology for greater durability and efficiency. The Cuk converter is considered the optimum topology with non pulsating input current, non pulsating output current, minimum storage elements, minimum switch number, and high energy storage density using a capacitor instead of an inductor, which can operate as step up or down converter. The PIC microcontroller is used as a main controller for providing constant current to the LED. This project is designed and simulated and a prototype is developed.

This evaluation is conducted on typical wind dominated distribution and transmission networks in Denmark. The analyses show that EV integration of around 10% is capable of providing sufficient grid regulation services in Danish power systems to support wind power penetration of around 50% in Denmark. The aggregated EV penetration levels quantified on system levels are validated with impact assessment studies on low voltage residential networks. Significant amount of EVs could be integrated in local distribution grids with the support of intelligent grid and smart charging strategies. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Ancillary service; Balancing power; Battery storage; Denmark; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity production; Impact assessments; Intelligent grids; Large penetrations; Local distributions; Low voltages; Paper analysis; Penetration level; Power balancing; Power fluctuations; Regulation services; Renewable energies; Residential networks; Smart charging; Support services; System levels; Variable generations; Vehicle integration; Wind power penetration; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Propulsion; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874443859

Hence, we present an adaptive write cache mechanism - CacheRAID. Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk (RAID) is widely used in modern distributed storage systems. Our CacheRAID aims to improve the random access problems that implicitly exist in RAID techniques to create more idle time of hard drives, and conserve RAID disk array energy.

With fast charging stations that enable to recharge a vehicle battery in a few minutes, the range limitation can be overcome in principle. For such fast charging stations, compact and efficient DC-DC converters with a high output power are required. Therefore, a multi-phase half-bridge DC-DC converter, which is part of an ultra fast charging station capable of charging a vehicle battery in less than 5 min, is presented in this paper. The ultra fast charging station utilises an intermediate storage battery, in order to avoid power pulsations at the grid and to provide additional functionality as e.g. energy storage for renewables. By splitting the intermediate storage battery, the voltage ratings of the semiconductor devices used in the high power DC-DC converter can be reduced, which increases the system efficiency. For further increasing the efficiency, a triangular current modulation (TCM) scheme is applied, which allows zero voltage switching (ZVS) for all semiconductor devices. To achieve a high power density as well as to implement ripple cancellation on the output current, several power electronic modules are parallel interleaved. A detailed analysis of the proposed system and simulation results are provided in this paper. Based on the above mentioned means the DC-DC converter achieves a system efficiency above 99.5% over a wide operating range. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Fast charging stations; Half-bridge dc-dc converters; High output power; High power; High power density; Intermediate storage; Operating ranges; Output current; Power electronic modules; Renewables; Ripple cancellation; System efficiency; Triangular current; Ultra-fast; Vehicle battery; Voltage ratings; DC-DC converters; Efficiency; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric vehicles; HVDC power transmission; Motion control; Power electronics; Zero voltage switching; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874251555

Hence, many techniques to generate cost effective, reliable and environmentally friendly alternative energy source are being explored.

This sort of power systems are known as distributed generation (DG) power system. However, the application of DG power systems raise certain issues such as cost effectiveness, environmental impact and reliability. The modelling as well as the optimization of this DG power system was successfully performed in the previous work using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The central idea of that work was to minimize cost, minimize emissions and maximize reliability (multi-objective (MO) setting) with respect to the power balance and design requirements. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy model that takes into account the uncertain nature of certain variables in the DG system which are dependent on the weather conditions (such as; the insolation and wind speed profiles).

Cyclic voltammetry is an important characteristic to determine the performances of energy storage devices such as battery and supercapacitor. In this paper we focus on the interdigital electrode with the various physical parameters such as gap, width and length of electrodes to increase the current response based on cyclic voltammetry performances. 2-D cyclic voltammetry time dependent model was developed. The interdigital electrode array consists of working electrode and counter electrode and the reaction at the working electrode is described by concentration dependent Butler-Volmer kinetics. The counter electrode is modeled so that it acts like an ideal reference electrode. In the design, the counter electrode with respect to ground is set to zero. The applied cell potential range from -0.5V to 0.5V. To explore the performances on cyclic voltammetry with different physical parameters of interdigital electrode, Comsol Multiphysics ver.4.2a is used to design the interdigital electrode, and the cyclic voltammetry was plotted.

However, its intrinsic properties of poor conductivity and low lithium-ion diffusion limit its practical applications. In order to improve these disadvantages, we prepared the LiFe 0.99La0.01PO4/C composite materials by a solid state reaction method using La-ion as a metal dopant and organic diacids as carbon coating sources. In this work, the composite materials were characterized by XRD, DSC, SEM/mapping, TEM/EDS/SAED, and total organic carbon (TOC). Further, their electrochemical performance was examined. The conductivity results of the doped composites showed a distinct enhancement from 3.97×10-8 to 2.60×10-5 S cm-1. The LiFe0.99La0.01PO4/C composites using malonic and sebasic acids as carbon sources displayed an initial discharge capacity of 151 and 145 mAh g-1, respectively, between 2.8 and 4.0 V at a 0.2 C rate. This is a significant improvement compared to the initial discharge capacity of 100 mAh g-1 of the un-doped bare LiFePO4 sample, and it may be related to electronic conductivity enhancement by carbon coating and charge transfer kinetics improvement by La-ion doping.","Battery charge; Energy storage; Lithium battery","Battery charge; Carbon coating; Carbon source; Cathode materials; Charge transfer kinetics; Diffusion limits; Electrochemical performance; Electronic conductivity; Initial discharge capacities; Intrinsic property; Li-ion batteries; LiFePO; Lithium ions; Organic diacids; Solid state reaction method; Total Organic Carbon; XRD; Carbon; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Coatings; Composite materials; Doping (additives); Electric batteries; Electric conductivity; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Lithium batteries; Olivine; Organic acids; Solid state reactions; Organic carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873298245

The dominant resonance shows good agreement at THz band with small inaccuracy of ∼15 %. A single perturbation slot is introduced at the half-patch length. By having a perturbed slot, the dominant resonance moves to a higher mode. The design approach has successfully proved that the electrical field strength is highly concentrated at the perturbed slot. The studies have shown that the proposed antenna can effectively concentrate the THz field when the perturbation slot is small.

We have previously introduced economic optimizing MPC schemes that both reduce operating costs and offer flexible power consumption in a future Smart Grid. The goal is to utilize the thermal capacity of refrigerated goods in a supermarket to shift the load of the system in time without deteriorating the quality of the foodstuffs. The analyses in this paper go before closing any control loops. In the first part, we introduce and validate a new model with which we can estimate the actual temperatures of refrigerated goods from available air temperature measurements. This is based on data obtained from a dedicated experiment. Since limits are specified for food temperatures, the estimate is essential for full exploitation of the thermal potential. Secondly, the thermal properties, shapes and sizes of different foodstuffs make them behave differently when exposed to changes in air temperature. We present a novel analysis based on Biot and Fourier numbers for the different foodstuffs. This provides a valuable tool for determining how different items can be utilized in load-shifting schemes on different timescales and for estimating maximum energy storage time. The results are shown for a large range of parameters, and with specific calculations for selected foodstuff items. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Actual temperature; Air temperature; Air temperature measurement; Control challenges; Control loop; Energy storage time; Food temperatures; Fourier numbers; Smart grid; Thermal potential; Time-scales; Atmospheric temperature; Heat storage; Temperature measurement; Estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873123084

This paper compares the environmental impact including carbon footprint for these two approaches using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, and provides a holistic view of how CSO is to be treated considering technical, economic and environmental issues. The analysis is based on the results of the EUfinanced LotWater project and 9 years of operational data from wastewater treatment in Copenhagen. All technologies are analysed for handling of 1 m3 of CSO. However, costs are compared based on cost per reduced area. The study showed that decentralised treatment of CSO is the cheapest method and the power consumption for the decentralised treatment is five times less than that for central treatment of CSO. However, central treatment of CSO appeared to be most efficient in reducing discharge of nutrients and environmental toxics. The LCA showed that the largest environmental impacts from handling CSOs are eutrophication and aquatic ecotoxicity. This study concludes that focusing on global warming alone in the form of reduced energy consumption could result in negative impacts on recipient waters. © IWA Publishing 2012.","Carbon footprint; Combined sewer overflow (CSO); Life cycle assessment; Wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872513885

Different absorption kinetics (e.g., free vs. protein-bound AA) may, however, create asynchrony in postabsorptive availability of individual AA, thereby reducing the efficiency of protein deposition. We studied the effects of AA asynchrony on protein metabolism in growing, milk-fed calves. In 2 experiments, each with a change-over design including 8 calves, a milk replacer deficient in Lys and Thr was used. In Expt. 1, L-Lys and L-Thr were parenterally supplemented, either in synchrony (SYN), asynchrony (ASYN), or partial asynchrony (PART) with dietary AA. In Expt. 2, L-Lys and L-Thr were orally supplemented, either in SYN or ASYN with dietary AA. In Expt. 1, digested protein was used less efficiently for growth for ASYN (31.0%) than for SYN (37.7%), with PART being intermediate (36.0%). Indicator AA oxidation tended (P = 0.06) to be higher for ASYN. In Expt. 2, the efficiency of protein utilization was lower for ASYN (34.9%) than for SYN (46.6%). Calves spared AA from oxidation when the limiting AA were provided in excess after a short period (<24 h) of deprivation. Restoring AA balance byparenteral supplementation resulted in a 19% lower efficiency of digestible protein utilization than by oral supplementation, likely caused by splanchnic oxidation of imbalanced AA in excess to Thr. In conclusion, asynchronous availability ofindividual indispensable AA reduces the efficiency by which digested protein is retained in milk-fed calves. Furthermore, an AA imbalance in the splanchnic tissues may result in disproportionate AA oxidation. © 2012 American Society for Nutrition.",,"amino acid; lysine; threonine; urea; article; calf (mammal); circadian rhythm; diet supplementation; energy metabolism; lipid storage; male; milk; nonhuman; oxidation; protein deposition; protein metabolism; Amino Acids; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Cattle; Circadian Rhythm; Diet; Digestion; Energy Metabolism; Male; Milk; Oxidation-Reduction; Postprandial Period; Proteins; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872137952

An ultrafast charging station (UFCS) must provide high power output with minimal influence on the electricity transmission system, which can only be achieved by the application of energy storage acting as an additional buffer between the vehicle and the grid. Besides storage, interfaces between a fast charging station and the outside environment (vehicle, utility grid) must be designed to fulfil a set of requirements. The main challenge is to be found within the specification of parameters for the design of future energy supply systems, providing for fast charging of the vehicle batteries while avoiding solicitations of the local distribution system which exceed its instantaneous power capabilities. The possible impact of an UFCS on the power distribution system is analysed with the stochastic approach, based on the utilisation of such a station. The general aspects of highly variable load profile clearly include the use of energy storage means that must be specified regarding both the energy storage and the instant power capabilities. Different technologies are analysed in terms of performances and costs. In conclusion, one of the important problems facing electric vehicles is the possibility of short-time charging, both as seen from the EV battery itself as well as from the local supply system. In this context, large load variations as seen from the local power system, at multiple levels, must be carefully assessed with special attention to feasible load changes at the coupling points. By addressing these technical issues as well as the financial constraints, the research aims at providing viable solution for broad ultrafast charging systems integration into the power distribution infrastructure.","Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Load management; Power converters","Charging solutions; Charging station; Charging systems; Electricity transmission systems; EV battery; Fast charging; Financial constraints; Future energies; General aspects; High power output; Instantaneous power; Load change; Load variations; Local distribution system; Multiple levels; Power capability; Power distribution system; Power distributions; Stochastic approach; Supply system; Ultra-fast; Utility grids; Variable loads; Vehicle battery; Viable solutions; Electric load distribution; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Energy storage; Power converters; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872105121

Especially the intermittent sources wind and sun will be of importance. Energy storage and load shifting are two possibilities to balance the mismatch between generation and consumption. The motivation of consumers to apply energy storage or change their consumption behaviour and the respective application of both may be different and even conflictive with utilities' aims. To create a win-win situation for both consumers and utilities/grid operators, the frame conditions have to be defined carefully. Therefore it is essential to understand how consumers would behave under different circumstances, including energy prices, locally available renewable energy sources, storage devices and demand response application. In the presented study, the energy supply strategy of a single-family house is examined. The house is described by a heat flow and an energy hub model. An energy hub is a device that represents the conversion and storage of different energy carriers using various technologies, including demand response. The models admit an optimization of the technologies' utilisation to reach minimum energy costs. Simulations are carried out with variations of energy prices, storage and demand response parameters, and available renewable electricity. The analysis of the simulations helps to understand the behaviour of consumers, to determine how storage devices can be used expediently and how demand response and energy storage impact each other. First results show that electric energy storage and the application of demand response mostly compete for available renewable energy, but can both be kept small when combined carefully. Also, small storage capacities are mostly sufficient to gain cost savings. However, results may vary significantly for different frame conditions, consequently following examinations will focus on trends and similarities for different scenarios.","Demand response; Energy storage; Optimal power supply; Renewable energy use; Residential application","Cost saving; Demand response; Energy carriers; Energy hubs; Energy prices; Energy supplies; Load shifting; Minimum energy costs; Optimal power; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Residential application; Residential sectors; Single-family house; Storage capacity; Win-win; Costs; Electric power systems; Electricity; Heating; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Virtual storage; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872100405

Studies show that DRAMs contribute to a significant part of overall system power consumption. Therefore, one of the main challenges in low-power DRAM design is the inevitable refresh process. Due to process variation, memory cells exhibit retention time variations. Current DRAMs use a single worst-case refresh period. Prolonging refresh intervals introduces retention errors. Previous works adopt conventional ECC (Error Correcting Code) to correct retention errors. These approaches introduce significant area and energy overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel error correction framework for retention errors in DRAMs, called SECRET (Selective Error Correction for Refresh Energy reducTion). The key observation we make is that retention errors can be treated as hard errors rather than soft errors, and only few DRAM cells have large leakage. Therefore, instead of equipping error correction capability in all memory cells as existing ECC schemes, we only allocate error correction information to leaky cells under a refresh interval. Our SECRET framework contains two parts, an off-line phase to identify memory cells with retention errors given a target error rate, and a low-overhead error correction mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed SECRET framework can reduce refresh power by 87.2%, and overall DRAM power by 18.57% with negligible area and performance overheads. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Computing system; Correction mechanism; DRAM cells; DRAM design; ECC scheme; Energy reduction; Error correcting code; Error correction capability; Low Power; Main memory; Memory cell; Process Variation; Retention time; Soft error; Target error rate; Design; Dynamic random access storage; Semiconductor storage; Error correction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872055430

Among other issues, emphasis is made on the state of white and brown adipose tissue, in particular the association of specific brown fat features and the so-called white fat browning with the functions of normal and mutated tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN and BRCA1. These connections are considered from the viewpoint implying the existence of two types of hormonal carcinogenesis and of hormonal mediation of the genetic predisposition to tumor development, and should be accounted for in prevention and treatment of both obesity and cancer. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.","browning of white fat; cancer; heterogeneity; mutations; obesity; tumor suppressors; types of hormonal carcinogenesis; white and brown fat","adipocytokine; BRCA1 protein; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; adipocyte; body composition; body fat; body mass; brown adipose tissue; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; cytokine production; disease association; gene function; genetic predisposition; hormonal carcinogenesis; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; paracrine signaling; priority journal; prognosis; review; risk factor; tumor suppressor gene; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Body Composition; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Neoplasms; Obesity; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871252665

The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a type of high-temperature fuel cell. It has the characteristic of a very high operating temperature of 1,027°C (1,300 K). The SOFC has the main advantage of very high performance efficiency (more than 50%) but also has very high exhaust temperatures. Current studies point out that the combination of the SOFC and gas turbine (GT) can produce efficiency of more than 60%. The exhaust temperature of this hybrid power system can be as high as 227-327°C (500-600 K). With this waste heat utilized, it is possible to further improve the overall efficiency of the system. A simulation program of the SOFC/GT system and the introduction of the concept of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system have been used in this study. The waste heat of the SOFC/GT hybrid power generation system was used as the heat source to drive an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) for cooling. This waste heat enables the SOFC/GT to generate electricity in the system while providing additional cooling and heating capacity. Therefore, the authors have a combined CCHP system developed using three major modules - the SOFC, GT, and ARS modules. The SOFC module was verified by the authors' test data. The GT and SOFC/GT modules were compared with a commercial code and literature data. Both the single- and double-effect ARS modules were verified with available literature results. Finally, the CCHP analysis simulation system, which combines SOFC, GT, and ARS, has been completed. With this CCHP configuration system, the fuel usability of the system by the authors' definition could be more than 100%, especially for the double-effect ARS. This analysis system was demonstrated to be a useful tool for future CCHP designs with SOFC/GT systems. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Absorption refrigeration system; Combined cooling, heating, and power system; Microturbine; Solid oxide fuel cell","Absorption refrigeration system; Analysis system; CCHP system; Commercial codes; Configuration system; Cooling , heating , and power systems; Current energy; Double effects; Exhaust temperature; Generate electricity; Heat sources; Heating capacity; High operating temperature; High temperature fuel cells; Hybrid power systems; Literature data; Low emission; Micro turbine; Overall efficiency; Performance efficiency; Performance study; Simulation program; Simulation systems; SOFC/GT hybrid; Test data; Absorption refrigeration; Cooling; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric power generation; Gas turbines; Heating; Hybrid systems; Refrigerators; Waste heat; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870953943

We investigated the predictors and impact of MT on relevant metabolic parameters including peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in elderly twins. Design and Participants: Seventy-four elderly same-sex twins underwent hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps preceded by an iv glucose tolerance test. Aerobic capacity (VO2max) and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan) were determined in all twins. A biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle was excised in the fasting state. The muscle triacylglycerol content was analyzed by biochemical extraction from these biopsies. Results: The percentage of total body fat was the only independent predictor of MT content. After adjustment for trunk fat percentages and sex, MT level was significantly associated to fasting plasma levels of glucose and insulin as well as hepatic insulin resistance. However, the association wasweakenedafter adjustment for total fat percentages.A1 SD (34.5mmol/kgdry weight) increase in MT content was associated with a 24% increase of hepatic insulin resistance. No association between MT content and peripheral insulin sensitivity was observed. Conclusion: MT content is associated with hepatic but not peripheral insulin resistance in elderly twins. Wespeculate that MT content may reflect the general ectopic accumulation of triglycerides, including fat in the liver.

This paper discusses the implications of greenhouse gas emission reductions for major Asian regions (China, India, Indonesia, South-East Asia, Japan and Korea) based on results from the IMAGE modelling framework. Energy use in regions and economic sectors is affected differently by ambitious climate policies. We find that the potential for emission reduction varies widely between regions. With respect to technology choices in the power sector, we find major application of CO2 storage in Indonesia and India, whereas Korea and India apply more solar and wind. Projections for Japan include a (debatable) large share of nuclear power. China and, India, and South-East Asia, show a diverse technology choice in the power sector. For the industry sector, we find that the recent rapid growth in China limits the potential for emission reduction in the next decades, assuming that recently built coal-based industry facilities are in use for the next decades. For the residential sector, the model results show that fewer households switch from traditional fuels to modern fuels in GHG mitigation scenarios. With respect to co-benefits, we find lower imports of fossil energy in mitigation scenarios and a clear reduction of air pollutant emissions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Asia; Co-benefits; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Household fuel switching; Industry; Power sector","Asia; Co-benefits; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Household fuels; Power sector; Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Emission control; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Industry; International trade; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal industry; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; modeling; temperature; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; reduction; Asia; China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870545498

This hexose is essentially metabolized in splanchnic tissues, where it is converted into glucose, glycogen, lactate, and, to a minor extent, fatty acids. In animal models, high fructose diets cause the development of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Ectopic lipid deposition in the liver is an early occurrence upon fructose exposure, and is tightly linked to hepatic insulin resistance. In humans, there is strong evidence, based on several intervention trials, that fructose overfeeding increases fasting and postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations, which are related to stimulation of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and VLDL-TG secretion, together with decreased VLDL-TG clearance. However, in contrast to animal models, fructose intakes as high as 200. g/day in humans only modestly decreases hepatic insulin sensitivity, and has no effect on no whole body (muscle) insulin sensitivity. A possible explanation may be that insulin resistance and dysglycemia develop mostly in presence of sustained fructose exposures associated with changes in body composition. Such effects are observed with high daily fructose intakes, and there is no solid evidence that fructose, when consumed in moderate amounts, has deleterious effects. There is only limited information regarding the effects of fructose on intrahepatic lipid concentrations. In animal models, high fructose diets clearly stimulate hepatic de novo lipogenesis and cause hepatic steatosis. In addition, some observations suggest that fructose may trigger hepatic inflammation and stimulate the development of hepatic fibrosis. This raises the possibility that fructose may promote the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to its more severe forms, i.e. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. In humans, a short-term fructose overfeeding stimulates de novo lipogenesis and significantly increases intrahepatic fat concentration, without however reaching the proportion encountered in non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Whether consumption of lower amounts of fructose over prolonged periods may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD has not been convincingly documented in epidemiological studies and remains to be further assessed. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,"fatty acid; fructose; glucose; glycogen; hexose; lactic acid; sucrose; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; body composition; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; fructose metabolism; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; short survey; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Liver; Fructose; Humans; Inflammation",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870389895

It is important to understand whether this reflects an advantageous or unfavourable shift in nutrition status. This to some extent can be judged from the changes in the patients' adipokine patterns. We, therefore, examined the circulating levels of the most important adipokines before and after the TIPS procedure. Methods: Twenty-five liver cirrhosis patients were examined before TIPS insertion and followed for six months after the procedure. Their body composition was determined by the bioimpedance technique. The serum concentrations of adiponectin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), and leptin were measured. Results: The TIPS procedure induced a 12% increase in body cell mass (P = 0.03) but did not change the body fat mass. At six months, serum adiponectin was increased by 60% (mean ± SD, 10.7 ± 6.1 vs. 16.9 ± 8.9 mg/L; P = 0.001), serum RBP4 was decreased by 45% (28.6 ± 20.0 vs. 16.3 ± 9.6 mg/L; P = 0.01), and the leptin levels remained unchanged. Conclusions: The TIPS-related tissue build up was accompanied by increased adiponectin and decreased RBP4. Such changes are associated with an anabolic condition where the adipose tissue possesses residual capacity for energy storage. TIPS, therefore, can be considered to be nutritionally beneficial to cirrhosis patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.","Adiponectin; Leptin; Liver cirrhosis; Retinol binding protein 4; TIPS","adipocytokine; adiponectin; leptin; retinol binding protein 4; adipose tissue; adult; aged; anabolic metabolism; article; bioimpedance; body cell mass; body composition; body fat mass; clinical article; diet therapy; energy metabolism; female; follow up; human; impedance; liver cirrhosis; male; malnutrition; metabolic parameters; metabolism; nutrition education; nutritional status; outcome assessment; portal hypertension; preoperative evaluation; protein blood level; transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; weight gain; Adipokines; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Body Composition; Electric Impedance; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Portal; Leptin; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870255926

The global warming potential related to these treatment alternatives varies largely amongst the studies. Large differences in relation to setting of system boundaries, methodological choices and variations in used input data were seen between the studies. Also, a number of internal contradictions were identified, many times resulting in biased comparisons between alternatives. Thus, noticed differences in global warming potential are not found to be a result of actual differences in the environmental impacts from studied systems, but rather to differences in the performance of the study. A number of key issues with high impact on the overall global warming potential from different treatment alternatives for food waste were identified through the use of one-way sensitivity analyses in relation to a previously performed LCA of food waste management. Assumptions related to characteristics in treated waste, losses and emissions of carbon, nutrients and other compounds during the collection, storage and pretreatment, potential energy recovery through combustion, emissions from composting, emissions from storage and land use of bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers and eco-profiles of substituted goods were all identified as highly relevant for the outcomes of this type of comparisons. As the use of LCA in this area is likely to increase in coming years, it is highly relevant to establish more detailed guidelines within this field in order to increase both the general quality in assessments as well as the potentials for cross-study comparisons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Food waste; Key issues; Life-cycle assessment; System-boundaries","Chemical fertilizers; Current status; Eco-profiles; Food waste; Global warming potential; High impact; Input datas; Internal contradictions; Key issues; Life-cycle assessments; Pre-Treatment; System boundary; System-boundaries; Anaerobic digestion; Composting; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Global warming; Life cycle; Waste management; Waste incineration; anoxic conditions; assessment method; biofertilizer; carbon emission; combustion; compost; composting; environmental impact; global warming; landfill; life cycle analysis; nutrient; waste management; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; biomass production; combustion; composting; energy recovery; environmental impact assessment; food waste; greenhouse effect; incineration; intermethod comparison; landfill; life cycle assessment; pollution monitoring; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; waste; Food; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870237207

A fundamental biochemical problem in these conditions is the impaired generation of ATP to fuel muscle contractions, which relates directly to the metabolic defect, but also to substrate-limited energy deficiency, as exemplified by the "" second wind"" phenomenon in McArdle disease. A number of secondary events may also play a role in inducing premature fatigue in glycogenoses, including (1) absent or blunted muscle acidosis, which may be important for maintaining muscle membrane excitability by decreasing chloride permeability, (2) loss of the osmotic effect related to lactate accumulation, which may account for absence of the normal increase in water content of exercised muscle, and thus promote higher than normal concentrations of extracellular potassium in exercising muscle and (3) exaggerated accumulation of ADP during exercise that may inhibit sodium-potassium and calcium-ATPases. Disorders of muscle glycogenolysis and glycolysis reveal the crucial role of these metabolic processes for supplying both anaerobic and aerobic energy for muscle contraction; and the pathological fatigue that occurs when glycogenolysis and/or glycolysis is blocked imply an important role for theses metabolic pathways in normal muscle fatigue. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); adenosine triphosphatase (potassium); adenosine triphosphate; article; exertional fatigue; fatigue; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; human tissue; muscle contraction; muscle contracture; muscle exercise; muscle fatigue; muscle function; muscle necrosis; myalgia; myoglobinuria; osmosis; priority journal; water content; Adenosine Triphosphate; Exercise; Glycogen Storage Disease; Humans; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle, Skeletal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870015841

Cold storage may be a better alternative, but this treatment leads to rapid platelet clearance after transfusion, initiated by changes in glycoprotein Ibα, the receptor for von Willebrand factor. Design and Methods We examined the change in glycoprotein Ibα distribution using Förster resonance energy transfer by time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Results Cold storage induced deglycosylation of glycoprotein Ibα ectodomain, exposing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues, which sequestered with GM1 gangliosides in lipid rafts. Raft-associated glycoprotein Ibα formed clusters upon binding of 14-3-3ζ adaptor proteins to its cytoplasmic tail, a process accompanied by mitochondrial injury and phosphatidyl serine exposure. Cold storage left glycoprotein Ibα surface expression unchanged and although glycoprotein V decreased, the fall did not affect glycoprotein Ibα clustering. Prevention of glycoprotein Ibα clustering by blockade of deglycosylation and 14-3-3ζ translocation increased the survival of cold-stored platelets to above the levels of platelets stored at room temperature without compromising hemostatic functions. Conclusions We conclude that glycoprotein Ibα translocates to lipid rafts upon cold-induced deglycosylation and forms clusters by associating with 14-3-3ζ. Interference with these steps provides a means to enable cold storage of platelet concentrates in the near future. © 2012 Ferrata Storti Foundation.","14-3-3ζ; Clustering; Cold storage; Glycoprotein Ibα; Lipid raft; Platelets","fibrinogen receptor; ganglioside GM1; glycoprotein Ib alpha; n acetylglucosamine; PADGEM protein; protein 14 3 3; animal cell; apoptosis; article; cell survival; cryopreservation; deglycosylation; fluorescence activated cell sorting; fluorescence microscopy; hemostasis; immunohistochemistry; lipid raft; mouse; nonhuman; protein binding; protein localization; room temperature; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte lifespan; thrombocyte preservation; 14-3-3 Proteins; Apoptosis; Blood Platelets; Cold Temperature; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; G(M1) Ganglioside; Glycosylation; Hemostatics; Humans; Membrane Microdomains; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex; Protein Transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869885949

The possible applications of such metal amines depend explicitly on the conditions for ammonia release and it is thus essential to understand the exact ab- and desorption mechanisms. Here, we apply equilibrium pressure measurements from ammonia desorption, X-ray powder diffraction and density functional theory calculations to identify thermodynamically stable Sr(NH3)Cl2, Sr(NH 3)2Cl2 and Sr(NH3) 8Cl2 phases. The crystal structures were solved in the space groups Cmcm, Aem2 and Pnma respectively. Controversy regarding the possible existence of a diamine phase is resolved on the basis of a combined structural and thermodynamic analysis of the ammonia release mechanisms, yielding a diamine structure with nearly the same stability as the monoamine. Depending on temperature and pressure, the diamine phase is found to have marginally higher or lower stability than the monoamine phase which explains why the diamine phase is found in some experiments and is not found in others.

Seventeen male athletes (mean±standard deviation age, 27.3±2.0 years) who had unilateral, chronic middle-portion tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon were assessed by the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment questionnaire, measurements of tendon viscoelastic properties, voluntary electromechanical delay (EMD), normalized rate of force development (RFD), and one-leg hopping distance. Compared with the non-injured leg, the tendinopathic leg showed reduced tendon stiffness (-19.2%. P<0.001), greater mechanical hysteresis (+21.2%, P=0.004), lower elastic energy storage and release (-14.2%, P=0.002 and -19.1%, P<0.001), lower normalized RFD at one-fourth (-16.3%, P=0.02), 2/4 (-17.3%, P=0.006), and three-fourths maximal voluntary contraction (-13.7%, P=0.02), longer soleus and medial gastrocnemius voluntary EMD (+26.9%, P=0.009 and +24.0%, P=0.004), and shorter hopping distances (-34.1%, P<0.001). Tendon stiffness was correlated with normalized RFD, voluntary EMD in the medial gastrocnemius, and hopping distances (r ranged from -0.35 to 0.64, P<0.05).

The resultant ALD-Pt catalyst on GO sheets offers better catalytic activity, CO tolerance, and long-term stability than those on commercial carbon support.

What constitutes 'abnormal' fat accumulation in this definition is not specified, but this most likely represents a consensus term that encapsulates the importance of adipose tissue dysfunctions, rather than solely excess fat per se, in the pathogenesis of disease entities of the metabolic syndrome, particularly type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Over the past decades, such abnormalities in fat accumulation have been linked to a pattern of fat distribution characterized by disproportionate fat deposition in the abdomen; to limits in the capacity of adipose tissue to expand resulting in the burden of fat storage being shifted to 'lean' tissues/organs as ectopic fat; and to the secretion (by both intrinsic and infiltrated cells within the adipose tissue mass) of a plethora of cytokines and other factors which via their autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine actions underscore a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. These links have formed the basis of a multitude of adipocentric concepts that have stimulated basic and clinical research aimed at explaining differential susceptibilities to cardiometabolic diseases according to diet and lifestyle, birth weight and post-natal growth patterns, menopausal transition and the ageing process, race and ethnicity - often within the framework of hypotheses constructed around thrifty genotypes or thrifty phenotypes, and around overlapping molecular pathways implicated in metabolic inflammation, thermogenesis and body composition regulation. It is against this background of rapidly advancing research in metabolic health - fuelled as much by the search for early markers of cardiometabolic risks as by the search for 'druggable' molecular targets for treating obesity and its comorbidities - that fundamental concepts, controversies and novel research avenues relevant to the theme of 'Body composition, Inflammation and Thermogenesis in Pathways to Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome' are addressed in this overview and the 10 review articles in this supplement reporting the proceedings of the 6th Fribourg Obesity Research Conference (FORC-2011). © 2012 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Adipose tissue; Energy expenditure; Type 2 diabetes","ceramide; cytokine; diacylglycerol; insulin; palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase; uncoupling protein 1; abdomen; abdominal obesity; adipose tissue; aging; apoptosis; article; birth weight; body composition; body weight; brown adipose tissue; cardiovascular disease; cell differentiation; cold stress; comorbidity; core temperature; diet; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; energy balance; energy expenditure; ethnicity; genotype; heat stress; human; hypothalamus; immune system; inflammation; innate immunity; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; lifestyle; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; liver metabolism; menopause; metabolic syndrome X; muscle mass; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; paracrine signaling; phenotype; plasticity; protein synthesis; race; risk factor; steatosis; subcutaneous fat; thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Body Composition; Humans; Inflammation; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity; Thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868087718

Microalgae could be of importance for future biodiesel production due to their fast growth rate and high oil content. In collections of temperature sensitive mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris, nine out of fourty-one mutants in C. reinhardtii and eleven out of fifty-three mutants in C. vulgaris contained increased amounts of neutral lipids, predominantly as triacylglycerols. Upon temperature induced cell-cycle arrest, these mutants showed enlarged cellular volume compared with the wild type. The C. reinhardtii mutants were analyzed further and one type of mutants displayed a shift in lipid composition from polar membrane lipids to neutral lipids after a temperature up-shift, while the second type of mutants accumulated more total lipid per cell, predominantly as neutral lipids as compared with the wild type. Three C. reinhardtii mutants were analyzed further and found to be arrested after DNA synthesis but prior to cell division in the cell cycle. These mutants will be useful in order to further understand neutral lipid accumulation in microalgae and suggest possibilities for biodiesel production by specific induction of lipid accumulation in miroalgal cultures by cell-cycle inhibition. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Cell cycle; Chlamydomonas; Chlorella; Neutral lipids; Temperature sensitive mutants; Triacylglycerol","biofuel; DNA; triacylglycerol; adaptation; article; cell cycle checkpoint; cell division; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella vulgaris; genetics; growth, development and aging; heat; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mutation; physiological stress; Adaptation, Physiological; Biofuels; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Division; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella vulgaris; DNA; Hot Temperature; Lipid Metabolism; Mutation; Stress, Physiological; Triglycerides; Chlamydomonas; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867621535

The structural characterization of synthesized mannitol hexastearate (MHS), mannitol hexapalmitate (MHP), mannitol hexamyristate (MHM) and mannitol hexalaurate (MHL) were carried out using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), and 13C NMR spectroscopy methods. Thermal energy storage properties and thermal reliability of the synthesized PCMs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. DSC results showed that the melting temperatures of the PCMs were in the temperature range of 42-65 °C and their latent heat values spanned between 145 and 202 J/g. The latent heats of these PCMs are low compared to mannitol but they fall into the same range as fatty acids. The synthesized PCMs have much lower phase change temperatures and supercooling degree (about 1-8 °C) and compared to the mannitol. They have also better odor, noncorrosivity and thermal durability properties as compared to the fatty acids. Thermal cycling test consisted of repeated 1000 melting/solidification cycles also revealed that the synthesized PCMs have good thermal reliability. In addition, thermal conductivity of the PCMs was increased significantly by addition of expanded graphite (EG) at 10 wt%. Based on all results it can be concluded that the synthesized PCMs, MHS, MHP, MHM and MHL esters can be considered as promising solid-liquid PCMs for solar heating applications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed load flow solution firstly used reduction technique to eliminate the load buses. Then, the power flow problem is solved for the generator buses only using real-coded GA to calculate the phase angles. Thus, the load flow problem becomes a single objective function, where the voltage magnitudes are specified resulted in reduced computation time for the solution. Once the phase angle has been calculated, the system is restored by calculating the voltages of the load buses in terms of the calculated voltages of the generator buses. A sparsity technique is used to reduce the computation time further as well as the storage requirements. The proposed load flow solution also can efficiently solve the load flow problems for ill-conditioned power systems whereas the conventional RCGA alone fails to solve these systems. The proposed method was demonstrated on 14-bus IEEE, 30-bus IEEE and 300-bus IEEE, and a practical system 362-busbar Iraqi National Grid.

Our aim was to study the localization of LPL and its endothelial anchoring protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) in mouse pancreas, and effects of diet and leptin deficiency on their expression patterns. For this, immunofluorescence microscopy was used on pancreatic tissue from C57BL/6 mouse embryos (E18), adult mice on normal or high-fat diet, and adult ob/ob-mice treated or not with leptin. The distribution of LPL and GPIHBP1 was compared to insulin, glucagon and CD31. Heparin injections were used to discriminate between intracellular and extracellular LPL. Results: In the exocrine pancreas LPL was found in capillaries, and was mostly co-localized with GPIHBP1. LPL was releasable by heparin, indicating localization on cell surfaces. Within the islets, most of the LPL was associated with beta cells and could not be released by heparin, indicating that the enzyme remained mostly within cells. Staining for LPL was found also in the glucagon-producing alpha cells, both in embryos (E18) and in adult mice. Only small amounts of LPL were found together with GPIHBP1 within the capillaries of islets. Neither a high fat diet nor fasting/re-feeding markedly altered the distribution pattern of LPL or GPIHBP1 in mouse pancreas. Islets from ob/ob mice appeared completely deficient of LPL in the beta cells, while LPL-staining was normal in alpha cells and in the exocrine pancreas. Leptin treatment of ob/ob mice for 12 days reversed this pattern, so that most of the islets expressed LPL in beta cells. Conclusions: We conclude that both LPL and GPIHBP1 are present in mouse pancreas, and that LPL expression in beta cells is dependent on leptin. © 2012 Nyrén et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Diabetes mellitus; Endothelium; Exocrine pancreas; Heparin; High fat diet; Immunofluorescence; Islet cells; Lipoprotein lipase; Ob/ob mice; qPCR","CD31 antigen; glucagon; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPI HBP1 protein, mouse; GPI-HBP1 protein, mouse; heparin; insulin; leptin; lipoprotein lipase; lipoprotein receptor; animal; article; C57BL mouse; capillary; endothelium cell; lipid diet; male; metabolism; methodology; mouse; pancreas; pancreas islet alpha cell; pancreas islet beta cell; Animals; Antigens, CD31; Capillaries; Diet, High-Fat; Endothelial Cells; Glucagon; Glucagon-Secreting Cells; Glycosylphosphatidylinositols; Heparin; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Leptin; Lipoprotein Lipase; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Pancreas; Receptors, Lipoprotein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869881208

One of the main objectives of Economic/Environmental Dispatch (EED) and Environmental Friendly Dispatch (EFD) is to optimize the amount of pollutants emitted from the hybrid power plants. The optimization problems determine the amount of optimum generation to be allocated to each generating unit including renewable sources without violating system constraints while minimizing the pollutants. EED is an important multi objective problem which minimizes both the fuel cost of generation and the amount of pollutants emission while EFD has the single objective of optimizing the amount of pollutants emission only. EED and EFD are especially more useful tools in areas that have high potential of renewable energy. Optimum EED and EFD can be obtained by extracting maximum renewable energy during their availability periods and then using this renewable energy for both available and unavailable periods with the aid of energy storage.

Data centers are the building blocks of IT business enterprises providing the capabilities of centralized repository for storage, management, networking and dissemination of data.

These data centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy but are riddled with IT inefficiencies. Data center are plagued with thousands of servers as major components. These servers consume huge energy without performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the servers are ""dead"" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized. Their utilization ratio is only 5 to 10%. This study proposes a five step model using an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient data centers.

In some applications with electromechanical phenomena, such as energy storage or for biological samples, a liquid environment is required to provide full functionality and sample stability.

So every attempt to economize energy consumption is very valuable. In this research a nocturnal radiative cooling system with flat plate solar collectors in a humid area, Babol, Iran, is assessed both experimentally and numerically. Different methods available in the literature are reviewed and by using a widely accepted model, the sky temperature is determined. The mathematical model for a flat plate solar collector is used as a guideline to derive the governing equations of a night sky radiator. Then, a cooling loop, including a storage tank, pump, connecting pipes, and a radiator has been studied experimentally. The water is circulated through the unglazed flat-plate radiator having 4 m2 of collector area at night to be cooled by convection and radiation to sky. The experiments were carried out at various mass flow rates and in different weather conditions and the results have been compared to those of the theoretical model. The results indicate that water temperature decreases 7 - 8°C and the average net cooling will be ranged from 23 to 52 W/m2, as the mass flow rate increases from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/s.

Different operating strategies have been defined for the PV power plant and the required energy storage capacity was estimated for each of them via a sizing methodology that will be briefly described. In addition, six areas of favorable solar radiation characteristics have been chosen as case studies to evaluate the presented methodology.

However, the high charge and discharge rates, as well as the high cycling capability make flywheels attractive as compared to other energy storage devices. This research serves as a preliminary study that aims for developing a technique in designing a flywheel rotor based on the solid isotropic method with penalization (SIMP) method. Examples are presented to illustrate the optimum structural layouts obtained given various design objectives. For a static rotor, the objectives are maximizing the first torsional natural frequency, maximizing the moment of inertia and maximizing both of them, respectively. The problem is formulated using bound formulation and the method of moving asymptotes (MMA), a first-order optimization technique, was employed. Therefore the design sensitivity becomes a necessity. The so-called checkerboard problem in the topology optimization is avoided using the nodal design variable. Also, a threshold is used to reduce the numerical imperfection in each iteration. For the topology design of a rotating rotor, the centrifugal force induced in the high-speed rotation is considered. The objective is to maximize the rotor stiffness and is demonstrated in the last example. Results show clear topology layout of flywheel was obtained using proposed method. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Flywheel; SIMP; Topology optimization","Bound formulation; Centrifugal Forces; Charge and discharge; Chemical batteries; Design objectives; Design sensitivity; Design variables; First-order; Flywheel rotors; Method of moving asymptotes; Moment of inertia; Optimization techniques; Rotor stiffness; SIMP; SIMP method; Structural layout; Topology design; Topology layout; Torsional natural frequencies; Design; Flywheels; Kinetics; Manufacture; Rotors; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; Wheels; Iterative methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869447567

To this purpose, we propose an energy consumption model that reflects the characteristics of low-power transceivers including power consumption at the receiver side. Numerical results show that the optimum frame length for energy efficiency results in significant loss in throughput, and vice versa. This suggests that the transmission duration of the opportunistic network should be chosen depending on the prime system objective. © 2012 ICST.","energy efficiency; power consumption; sensing; Temporal spectrum sharing; throughput","Design objectives; Energy consumption model; Frame length; Low Power; Low-power systems; Low-power transceiver; Mathematical frameworks; Numerical results; Opportunistic networks; Radio spectra; sensing; Spectrum sharing; Temporal domain; Wireless systems; Cognitive radio; Commerce; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Radio systems; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Throughput",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869384914

By virtue of transformation optics, we propose a design method of forming a polygonal surface-plasmonic resonator in fully open structures by applying the nonmagnetic affine transformation optics strategy. The radiation loss can be suppressed because SPPs that propagate in the designed open structures will be deceived as if they were propagating on a flat metal/dielectric interface without radiation. Because of the nonmagnetic nature of the transformation strategy, this design can be implemented with dielectric materials available in nature.

To achieve a more sustainable society with adequate renewable energy and less environmental pollution, more versatile, robust and efficient approaches in electric energy storage and conversion are needed. To achieve these goals, the development of new electrode materials with high electrical conductivity, corrosion-resistance, high specific surface area, high porosity and low cost is highly desirable. Graphene aerogels (GAs) have been focused recently due to novel properties of graphene (extremely low electrical and thermal resistivity, large carrier mobility, high surface area and mechanical elasticity) and the low cost and easy preparation of graphene from graphite. The performance of GA-based electrodes strongly depends on the morphology and structure of the GAs. However, there has been little study on the optimization of the GA nanostructures in terms of surface area, pore size, pore volume and density for energy storage devices. In this work, the GA nanostructures synthesized from commercial graphite were controlled successfully. The graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from commercial graphite powder using a modified Hummers method. A hydrothermal method was used to synthesize GAs due to its simplicity, environmental friendliness and low cost. No binders were used to prevent their negative effects to the electrical conductivity of the aerogels. Effects of fabrication conditions and the GO concentration on the GA nanostructures were also quantified. A maximum Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 394m2/g and the lightest density of 0.042g/cm3 were achieved when the GA with 3mgGO/mL was hydrothermally treated at 180°C for 1.5h. The thermal durability analysis showed that the GAs could be stable up to 500°C in air, with 24h of hydrothermal treatment time. Preliminarily the GA hydrothermally treated for 6h had an electrical conductivity of 0.004S/cm. The experimental results of the study are useful for optimizing GA structures for energy storage applications. © 2012.","Binderless; Controlled morphology; Energy storage applications; Graphene aerogel; Hydrothermal method","Aerogels; Elasticity; Electric conductivity; Energy storage; Graphite; Morphology; Nanostructures; Optimization; Binderless; Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas; Controlled morphology; Electric energies; Electrical conductivity; Electrode material; Energy storage applications; Environmental friendliness; Environmental pollutions; Graphene oxides; Graphite powder; High electrical conductivity; High porosity; High specific surface area; High surface area; Human being; Hummers method; Hydrothermal methods; Hydrothermal treatments; Hydrothermally treated; Low costs; Mechanical elasticities; Morphology control; Pore volume; Renewable energies; Surface area; Sustainable society; Thermal durability; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868327354

This paper discusses the implications for the further development of CCS, particularly with respect to climate change policy in an international geopolitics context. The rationale for developing CCS should be the over-abundance of fossil fuel reserves (and resources) in a climate change context. From a geopolitical point, it can be argued that the most important outcome from the successful commercialisation of CCS will be that fossil fuel-dependent economies with large fossil fuel resources will find it easier to comply with stringent greenhouse gas reduction targets (i. e. to attach a price to CO 2 emissions). This should be of great importance since, from a geopolitical view, the curbing on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be isolated from security of supply and economic competition between regions. Thus, successful application of CCS may moderate geopolitical risks related to regional differences in the possibilities and thereby willingness to comply with large emission cuts. In Europe, application of CCS will enhance security of supply by fuel diversification from continued use of coal, especially domestic lignite. Introduction of CCS will also make possible negative emissions when using biomass as a fuel, i. e. in so called Biomass Energy CCS (BECCS). Yet, the development of BECCS relies on the successful development of fossil fuelled CCS since BECCS in itself is unlikely to be sufficient for establishing a cost efficient CCS infrastructure for transport and storage and because BECCS does not solve the problem with the abundant resources of fossil fuels. Results from research and development of capture, transport and storage of CO 2 indicate that the barriers for commercialization of CCS should not be technical. Instead, the main barriers for implementation of CCS seem to be how to reach public acceptance, to reduce cost and to establish a high enough price on CO 2 emissions. Failure to implement CCS will require that the global community, including Europe, agrees to almost immediately to start phasing out the use of fossil fuels, an agreement which seems rather unlikely, especially considering the abundant coal reserves in developing economies such as China and India.","Carbon capture; CCS; CO 2; Geopolitics; Greenhouse gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868381609

A boost converter normally utilies an inductor (energy storage) to boost the voltage level from its input to a higher output value. This study analyses the possibility of using the generator inductance as a boost inductor. It is discussed and verified in the study that for the given switching frequency of the boost converter (fs=1 kHz), the generator sub-transient inductance (not the synchronous inductance) appears as an equivalent inductance seen by the boost converter.

This included enteric (open-circuit respiratory chambers) and manure-derived methane (various techniques).

They protect the crops from unfavorable outdoor climate conditions and pests and offer the opportunity to modify the indoor climate to create an environment that is optimal for crop growth and production, both in terms of quality and quantity. A quick scan of protected cultivation systems presently in use reveals that quite a variety of protected cultivation systems can be found throughout the world. They range from fully passive ""solar greenhouses"" with thick energy storage walls as found in China to the high-tech ""closed greenhouses"" in Western Europe. This variety is due to local conditions, including the local climate, the availability of resources like water, energy, capital, labor and materials, local legislation and social aspects, to mention a few.

The most energy savings can usually be achieved when investing in new construction with the newest technology of energy harvesting, storage and re-usage. In existing greenhouses, however, a high energy reduction is also possible. Some energy savings are possible by simply optimising the climate set points, but in some situations, larger savings can be achieved by installing some of the newest equipment. At the same time, plant growth and quality must not decrease due to lower greenhouse energy consumption. To support the growers in decision-making processes, greenhouses need to be individually analysed for modification. We developed an internet-based software tool to analyse greenhouse energy performance and pinpoint the bottlenecks, identifying the possibilities for reducing the energy consumption of existing greenhouses by either software or hardware measures. Thus, a decision support system (DSS) was created that accesses greenhouse climate computer data that can, after input of greenhouse physical data, be used to analyse the effects of modifications in greenhouse materials, crop schedules, climate set points, and others on energy consumption and crop yield. The system consists of a large number of independently developed simulation models that are integrated to one working system. Models of greenhouse physics, crop-specific growth, plant development and quality, crop microclimate, different environmental stresses, e.g. heat- or waterstress, and more are involved.","Decision support system; DSS; Model; Simulation; Software",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870669915

The generic model LINPAC (LINTUL model for Perennial and Annual Crops) is presented to predict annual biomass yield of energy crops on large spatial scales by adding new modules to LINTUL: (1) Leaf Area Index (LAI) is simulated independent of specific leaf area; (2) a species specific daily Light Use Efficiency (LUE, gMJ -1) is modified by temperature and light intensity; (3) crop base temperature is generated by local weather conditions within crop physiological ranges. LINPAC is driven either by site-specific input data or by globally gridded weather and soil data. LINPAC was calibrated on the basis of a model sensitivity analysis of the input parameters and validated against different agro-ecological experimental data sets for two grass species Miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) and Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and for two woody species Willow (Salix spp.) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.). LINPAC reproduced the biomass yields with a normalized root mean square error (RMSE) of 17%, comparable to the coefficient of variation (CV=12%) of the experimental data. In the model photosynthetic pathways were differentiated by assigning higher LUE values for the C4 crop (Miscanthus) compared with the C3 crops (others), leading to higher simulated biomass yield of Miscanthus (18.8±1.5tha -1) over Reed canary grass (10.5±1.6tha -1) in comparable environments. LINPAC is applicable for local, regional and global estimations of biomass yield of energy crops. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Base temperature; Biomass; Leaf area index; Light use efficiency; Simulation","Base temperature; Biomass productivity; Biomass yield; Coefficient of variation; Data sets; Energy crops; Generic models; Global estimation; Grass species; Input datas; Input parameter; Leaf Area Index; Light intensity; Light use efficiency; Local weather conditions; Miscanthus; Model sensitivity analysis; Perennial crops; Phalaris arundinacea; Photosynthetic pathways; Physiological range; Plantation establishment; Reed canary grass; Root mean square errors; Salix spp; Simulation; Site-specific; Soil data; Spatial scale; Specific leaf area; Total biomass; Woody species; Biomass; Computer simulation; Digital storage; Forestry; Mean square error; Physiological models; Productivity; Crops; agricultural ecosystem; biomass; crop production; crop yield; energy crop; leaf area index; light intensity; light use efficiency; perennial plant; physiological response; plantation; temperature effect; Eucalyptus; Miscanthus; Phalaris; Phalaris arundinacea; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868502274

The studied strategy is a night cool storage with phase change material (PCM). To evaluate this, a Matlab code was used for the analysis of climate files along with the thermodynamical properties of PCM storages and then used with IDA Indoor Climate and Energy for building simulations. The building model is based on an actual Passive House in the district of Lambohov in Linköping, Sweden, where continuous logging of temperatures are available. Without comfort cooling the simulations show excessive temperatures summertime, which is consistent with the field measurements from the actual house.

The EFD problem decides the amount of generation to be allocated to each generating unit including renewable sources so that the total emission of polluting gases is minimized without violating the system constraints. This type of optimization becomes more efficient in countries like Saudi Arabia where high potential of crude oil and renewable resources exists. This paper considers the problem of EFD for hybrid power system including solar, wind and the storage. High potential of solar and wind in Saudi Arabia ensures the availability of renewable sources to some extent. A consistent optimum EFD can be obtained by extracting maximum renewable energy during the available period and using it for both available and unavailable periods with the aid of energy storage. This paper illustrates the optimization of EFD with renewable storage using MATLAB simulation.

Heat capacity in single-family houses with electrical heating using heat pumps represents a storage which can be used to balance the electricity supply. It is assumed that electricity prices will reflect surplus or deficiency in production. A performance function describing cost of electricity combined hour by hour with user comfort is formulated. Minimization of this performance will balance the grid by pushing consumption towards hour with surplus production capacity. The minimization results in a power consumption schedule and a temperature schedule for each house. A number of control structures are described aiming to obtain this optimum by communicating references to either house temperature or heat pump power or by offering the consumer an hour by hour price. By simulation the schemes are compared by there ability to time shift consumption and to avoid consumer discomfort. Additionally the necessary information exchange for the schemes is discussed. Comparisons indicate that it is possible to use heat pump heated private houses to move power consumption within a time interval without loss of consumer comfort. However the full potential of the storage capacity can only be achieved in the schemes which combine feedback with an optimizing solution. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Control structure; Cost of electricity; Electrical heating; Electricity prices; Electricity supply; Heat pumps; Information exchanges; Performance functions; Private residence; Production capacity; Renewable energies; Single-family house; Storage capacity; Time interval; Time shifts; Costs; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Heat pump systems; Houses; Power quality; Wind power; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867963786

Key missions for the sensor test laboratories in the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory and in the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Institute for Energy and Transport are to assure the availability and proper use of hydrogen safety sensors. As an integral element in a safety system, sensor performance should not be compromised by operational parameters. For example, safety sensors may be required to operate at reduced oxygen levels relative to air, such as that which would exist for nitrogen purges. Some sensor platforms are amenable for anaerobic operation, whereas other platforms will be deactivated and possible permanently altered with anaerobic operation. The NREL and JRC sensors laboratories assessed the ability of a number of sensor platforms to detect hydrogen under conditions of varying oxygen concentration. The performance of three common hydrogen sensor platforms, the thermal conductivity sensor, combustible gas sensor, and a palladium thin-film (metallic resistor) sensor, to operate under anaerobic conditions is presented.

We find that across countries energy intensity levels tend to decrease in most Manufacturing sectors. In the Service sector, energy intensity decreases at a relatively slow rate, with diverse trends across sub-sectors. A decomposition analysis reveals that changes in the sectoral composition of the economy explain a considerable and increasing part of aggregate energy intensity dynamics. A convergence analysis reveals that only after 1995 cross-country variation in aggregate energy intensity levels clearly tends to decrease, driven by a strong and robust trend break in Manufacturing and enhanced convergence in Services. Moreover, we find evidence for the hypothesis that across sectors lagging countries are catching-up with leading countries, with rates of convergence that are on average higher in Services than in Manufacturing. Aggregate convergence patterns are almost exclusively caused by convergence of within-sector energy intensity levels, and not by convergence of the sectoral composition of economies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Convergence; Decomposition; Energy intensity; Sectoral analysis","Catching-up; Convergence; Convergence analysis; Decomposition analysis; Energy intensity; Manufacturing sector; National accounts; OECD countries; Rates of convergence; Sectoral analysis; Service sectors; Structural change; Decomposition; Digital storage; Manufacture; Aggregates; convergence; decomposition analysis; energy policy; manufacturing; OECD; structural change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867678142

It is therefore of interest to predict putative RNA-RNA duplexes in silico on a genome-wide scale. Current computational methods for predicting these interactions range from fast complementary-based searches to those that take intramolecular binding into account. Together these methods constitute a trade-off between speed and accuracy, while leaving room for improvement within the context of genome-wide screens. A fast pre-filtering of putative duplexes would therefore be desirable.Results: We present RIsearch, an implementation of a simplified Turner energy model for fast computation of hybridization, which significantly reduces runtime while maintaining accuracy. Its time complexity for sequences of lengths m and n is with a much smaller pre-factor than other tools. We show that this energy model is an accurate approximation of the full energy model for near-complementary RNA-RNA duplexes. RIsearch uses a Smith-Waterman-like algorithm using a dinucleotide scoring matrix which approximates the Turner nearest-neighbor energies. We show in benchmarks that we achieve a speed improvement of at least 2.4× compared with RNAplex, the currently fastest method for searching near-complementary regions. RIsearch shows a prediction accuracy similar to RNAplex on two datasets of known bacterial short RNA (sRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) and eukaryotic microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA interactions. Using RIsearch as a pre-filter in genome-wide screens reduces the number of binding site candidates reported by miRNA target prediction programs, such as TargetScanS and miRanda, by up to 70. Likewise, substantial filtering was performed on bacterial RNA-RNA interaction data. © 2012 The Author.",,"Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; bacterial RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; RNA; untranslated RNA; algorithm; article; base pairing; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; cluster analysis; computer simulation; duplicate gene; genetics; information retrieval; metabolism; methodology; nucleotide sequence; position weight matrix; sequence alignment; validation study; Algorithms; Base Pairing; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Genes, Duplicate; Information Storage and Retrieval; MicroRNAs; Models, Molecular; Position-Specific Scoring Matrices; RNA; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Alignment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867300120

The first case study is a premier building in Ankara that is ready to meet the net-zero exergy target. It is also the first building in Turkey to receive the highest Platinum rating in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. A net-zero exergy building (NZEXB) is a building that has an annual sum of net-zero exergy transfer across the building-district boundary. This new target is made possible by lowered annual exergy consumption, (AEXC), and increased on-site production from a bundle of sustainable energy technologies. The modeled results of the building indicate that the reduced AEXC of 60 kW h/m2 yr is met with on-site production of 62 kW h/m2 yr. On-site production includes PV and building integrated PV, a micro-wind turbine, combined heat and power, GSHP, and solar collectors. Diversified thermal energy storage tanks further facilitate the exergy supply to meet with the exergy demand. The results of this case study provide key lessons to structure an energy value chain that is more aware of exergy, which are up-scalable to the district level when the bundle of sustainable energy technologies is zoomed out across a larger spatial area. These key lessons are then compared with the second case study of two districts in the south heating network of the city of Stockholm, which was the European Green Capital in 2010. The levels of exergy match in these districts of Stockholm, namely the districts of Högdalen and Hammarby, is found to be 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. However, there remain several bottlenecks for these districts to reach net-zero targets at the community level. The paper concludes that the NZEXB case study has much to offer as a ""building block"" to reform the way energy is converted and managed and in this way, to structure an exergy-aware energy value chain for greater sustainability in green cities of the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The investment cost of a solar water heating system is very low, and the maintenance costs are nearly zero. Using the solar energy for solar water heating (SWH) technology has been greatly improved during the past century. A storage tank is used in many solar water heating systems for the conservation of heat energy or hot water for use when some need it. In addition, domestic hot water consumption is strongly variable in many buildings. It depends on the geographical situation, also on the country customs, and of course on the type of building usage. Above all, it depends on the inhabitants' specific lifestyle. For that reason, to provide the hot water for consumption at the desirable temperature whenever inhabitants require it, there must be a good relevance between the collectors and storage tank. In this paper, the optimum sizes of the collectors and the storage tank are determined to design more economic and efficient solar water heating systems.

However, waste could be used to produce new products or as additives for existing materials or products. Using waste materials decreases the need to use natural resources and hence prevents some irreparable environmental destruction while simultaneously decreasing the impact of waste storage problems on the environmental landscape. In this research the sludge resulting from the purification of water that has been used to clean granite during cutting and polishing, consisting primarily of quartz, was tested as a filler in bituminous hot mixtures. The granite sludge was dried, milled and sieved using a No. 200 sieve, then used in production of bituminous hot mixture specimens. The waste material was used as filler in ratios of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% to find the optimum filler ratio in the mix. A design for the bituminous hot mixture was performed using the Marshall method for each of the filler ratios, and optimum bitumen ratios were determined. Mechanical Marshall immersion tests and indirect tensile tests were performed for each of the specimens with optimum bitumen ratios. The tests results show that using granite sludge with an optimum ratio of 7.3% as filler in bituminous hot mixtures could improve the engineering properties of the mixes in wearing courses, thereby requiring a smaller quantity of natural materials, such as aggregate and bitumen, and causing less damage to our environmental heritage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The case study is the French power system, whose characteristics rely on high rates of nuclear power and a strong emerging wind energy market. A dynamic optimization dispatching model is used to simulate the operation of the power system, under two development scenarios of the technology mix by 2030, one scenario documented by European Commission, EC [1], and a second one by French Transmission System Operator, RTE [2]. Both scenarios result in power storage requirements of around 7 TWh for more than 4 GW installed storage capacity of pumped hydro power plants in France as a whole. In this context, it is assessed the profitability of an additional regional project of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) located in the region of Bretagne. It shows how benefits could accrue by avoiding the regional wind curtailment of 59 GWh, by providing ancillary services such as secondary reserve, and by increasing the use of grid assets and the nuclear power output with more than 230 GWh. The profitability of the CAES project remains however negative, around -70 /MWh despite the social value and the system benefits that results in. The study assesses qualitatively possible ways to incentivize the investment in new storage projects, through for instance contracts for difference, which would link the storage operation, its investment cost and stage of development to the power market design via power prices and a pre-defined rate of return. The periodical revision of these regulatory arrangements would enable the storage investor to recover the investment cost and would eliminate the risk of over rewarding generators in the case of windfall profits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is based on the premise that to understand the public's concerns and to predict their future opinion, it is necessary to know how people arrive at their evaluations about CCS. The study described in this paper aimed to enhance insight into currently held beliefs and awareness among the general public about CCS and CO2 as well as to investigate the role of the media as a vehicle for knowledge transfer. To meet the first aim, we interviewed 15 lay people to identify commonly held beliefs. Next, we investigated the prevalence of these beliefs by administering a questionnaire among 401 respondents. To meet the second aim, we analyzed the 430 articles mentioning CCS in all major Dutch newspapers from mid-2009 to mid-2010 and investigated respondents' media use and exposure to recent media events about CCS. The survey revealed several beliefs that were shared by a large group of respondents, some of which were factually incorrect.

Our interest is in the capillary-pressure range between 0 and 100bars for temperatures between 293 and 372K and wetting-phase pressures between 25 and 255bars. For this purpose, we have implemented capillary pressure in the PRSV equation of state. The results show that capillary pressure promotes interfacial evaporation. Capillary pressure reduces the CO2 solubility in water and the aqueous-phase density up to 64% and 1.3%, respectively, whereas it increases the water solubility in the CO2-rich phase and the CO2-rich-phase density up to 1172% (1.0+11.7=12.7 times) and 13%, respectively. If the CO2-rich-phase properties were calculated as a function of the wetting-phase pressure, capillary pressure would shift the CO2 liquid-vapor transition and consequently the upper critical point of the CO2-water system to a lower pressure. Therefore, the CO2-rich-phase properties must be calculated using the non-wetting-phase pressure to avoid this shift. For mixed CO2-water injection into a geothermal reservoir, the influence of capillary pressure on the phase equilibrium reduces both the heat recovery up to 37% and the CO2-storage capacity up to 37%. We construct a plot of the recuperated heat energy versus the maximally stored CO2 for a variety of conditions; we compare the results including and excluding the effect of capillary pressure in the phase-equilibrium calculations.

A theoretical consideration which allows quantification of the quantum corrections to the rate constants of endothermic reactions associated with an increase in the high-energy tail of the equilibrium momentum distribution function at high pressures is presented. This quantum effect is caused by a manifestation of the principle of uncertainty for the energy of the colliding particles at a high frequency of collisions. It is shown that significant deviations of experimentally observed ignition and detonation delay time from the predictions of kinetic calculations are quite well described by the proposed quantum corrections. This general mechanism should be considered in the safety problem with emergency emissions of hydrogen at nuclear power stations, as well as problems of the safe production and storage of hydrogen and acetylene, which have a fundamental importance for industry and power engineering. © 2012 American Physical Society.",,"Colliding particles; Delay Time; Elevated pressure; Endothermic reactions; High energy tails; High frequency; High pressure; Kinetic calculations; Low temperatures; Momentum distribution function; Power engineering; Quantum correction; Quantum effects; Quantum phenomena; Safe production; Safety problems; Storage of hydrogen; Acetylene; Hydrogen storage; Lighting; Quantum electronics; Rate constants; Detonation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868332145

In the well-studied minimum-energy broadcast (MEB) problem, the optimal tree varies by source. In contrast, SBT is source-independent, thus substantially reducing the overhead for information storage and processing. The SBT problem also differs from the range assignment problem (RAP), because the power for message forwarding in SBT, although being source-independent, depends on from which tree neighbor the message is received. We approach SBT from a computational optimization standpoint, and present a dual decomposition method applied to an optimization model that embeds multiple directed trees into a shared tree. For the dual decomposition method, some of the constraints in the model are preferably formulated implicitly. The dual decomposition scheme is coupled with a fast local search algorithm. We report computational results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This is mainly due to the fact that these networks are severely resource constrained in terms of the deployed camera sensors. The resources refer to battery, processor, memory and storage of the camera sensor. Limited resources mandates the need for efficient classification techniques in terms of energy consumption, space usage and processing power. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet accurate classification algorithm for WMSNs using a genetic algorithm-based classifier. The efficiency of the algorithm is achieved by extracting two simple but effective features of the objects from the video frames, namely shape of the minimum bounding box of the object and the speed of the object in the monitored region. The accuracy of the classification, on the other hand, is provided through using a genetic algorithm whose space/memory requirements are minimal. The training of this genetic algorithm based classifier is done offline and it is stored at each camera in advance to perform online classification during surveillance missions. The experiments indicate that a promising classification accuracy can be achieved without introducing a major energy and storage overhead on camera sensors. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Bounding box; Camera sensor; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Classification technique; Object classification; Offline; On-line classification; Processing power; Resource-constrained; Space usage; Storage overhead; Surveillance missions; Video frame; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Cameras; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Sensors; Security systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867837898

The outage minimizing ST protocol computes the fraction of each frame to reserve for energy harvesting by the main energy storage device (ESD); the rest of the frame is used concurrently for message transmission and for charging of the secondary ESD. In this paper, we study the performance loss due to the randomness of energy availability at the transmitter, compared to a conventional system with a deterministic supply of power, through a derivation of the outage probability expression under certain special conditions. It will be shown that this performance loss is dependent on the distribution assumed for the energy harvesting rate, X. Different parameter settings for a Gamma-distributed X lead to performance gaps ranging from 1 to 10 dB. These results confirm that the performance loss incurred by using an unreliable energy source is heavily dependent on the variability of the source. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Conventional systems; Diversity analysis; Energy availability; Energy source; Gamma-distributed; Message transmissions; Minimizing energy; Outage probability; Parameter setting; Performance gaps; Performance loss; Wireless link; Wireless protocol; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Outages; Rayleigh fading; Signal processing; Transmitters; Virtual storage; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867722847

In previous steady state 13C wash-in experiments a delay of labeling enrichments in glycolytic intermediates was observed, which suggests turnover of storage carbohydrates. The turnover of storage pools consumes ATP which is expected to reduce the product yield for energy demanding production pathways like penicillin-G.Results: In this study, a 13C labeling wash-in experiment of 1 hour was performed to systematically quantify the intracellular flux distribution including eight substrate cycles. The experiments were performed using a mixed carbon source of 85% CmolGlc/CmolGlc+EtOH labeled glucose (mixture of 90% [1-13C1] and 10% [U-13C6]) and 15% ethanol [U-13C2]. It was found, that (1) also several extracellular pools are enriched with 13C labeling rapidly (trehalose, mannitol, and others), (2) the intra- to extracellular metabolite concentration ratios were comparable for a large set of metabolites while for some carbohydrates (mannitol, trehalose, and glucose) the measured ratios were much higher.Conclusions: The fast enrichment of several extracellular carbohydrates and a concentration ratio higher than the ratio expected from cell lysis (2%) indicate active (e.g. ATP consuming) transport cycles over the cellular membrane. The flux estimation indicates, that substrate cycles account for about 52% of the gap in the ATP balance based on metabolic flux analysis. © 2012 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"alcohol; carbon; carbon 13; glucose; mannitol; succinic acid; trehalose; article; cell cycle; concentration (parameters); controlled study; fungal cell; nonhuman; Penicillium chrysogenum; staining; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Isotopes; Cluster Analysis; Ethanol; Glucose; Isotope Labeling; Penicillium chrysogenum; Substrate Specificity; Penicillium chrysogenum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867745157

In this study, we tested dietary glycerol as a way of replenishing muscle glycogen reserves of farmed gilthead seabream. Two diets were tested in duplicate (n = 42/tank). Results show 5% inclusion of crude glycerol in gilthead seabream diets induces increased muscle glycogen, ATP levels and firmness, with no deleterious effects in terms of growth, proximate composition, fatty acid profile, oxidative state, and organoleptic properties (aroma and color). Proteomic analysis showed a low impact of glycerol-supplementation on muscle metabolism, with most changes probably reflecting increased stress coping capacity in glycerol-fed fish. This suggests inclusion of crude glycerol in gilthead seabream diets (particularly in the finishing phase) seems like a viable strategy to increase glycogen deposition in muscle without negatively impacting fish welfare and quality. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","aquaculture; crude glycerol; fish proteomics; flesh quality; gilthead seabream; muscle glycogen","ATP level; Crude glycerol; Decomposition process; Deleterious effects; Energy depletion; Fatty acid profiles; Fish meat; Flesh quality; Gilthead seabream; Glycogen deposition; Organoleptic properties; Proteomic analysis; Proteomics; Proximate compositions; Shelf life; Skeletal muscle; Aquaculture; Fish; Glycerol; Molecular biology; Nutrition; Muscle; glycerol; glycogen; animal; article; colorimetry; diet; diet supplementation; metabolism; muscle; sea bream; Animals; Colorimetry; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Glycerol; Glycogen; Muscles; Sea Bream",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867812909

In this work, Li 2O-K 2O-B 2O 3 (LKB) glasses co-doped with different concentration of titanium oxide (TiO 2) have been prepared by chemical quenching technique. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results showed the amorphous nature of the sample. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, energy band gap, density, ion concentration, molar volume, Polaron radius and inter-nuclear distance and other significant parameters have been analyzed in the light of the different oxidation states of the dopant ions in the glass matrix. Based on the up-conversion phenomenon, the addition of different concentration of TiO 2 ions illustrates its effect on the Photoluminescence (PL) emission of LKB. Due to the change in the activator concentration, a broad blue emission with intensity of around 300 (au) has been observed with 0.3 mol% concentration. Enhancement of about three times has been shown with the increment of 0.7 mol% in concentration. The current results are attributed to electron-phonon vibration obtained after the charge transferred from the valence state (O 2/2p 6) to the conductive state (Ti/3d).

Due to particle size reduction, surface effects increasingly dominate, which can drastically change the storage properties. Using density functional theory calculations we investigate the impact of the surface environment on the Li-ion insertion properties in defective spinel Li 4+xTi 5O 12, a highly promising negative electrode material. The calculations reveal that the storage properties strongly depend on the surface orientation. The lowest energy (1 1 0) surface is predicted to be energetically favorable for Li-ion insertion into the vacant 16c sites. The (1 1 1) surface allows capacities that significantly exceed the bulk capacity Li 7Ti 5O 12 at voltages greater than 0 V by occupation of 8a sites in addition to the fully occupied 16c sites. One of the key findings is that the surface environment extends nanometers into the storage material, leading to a distribution of voltages responsible for the curved voltage profile commonly observed in nanosized insertion electrode materials. Both the calculated surface-specific voltage profiles and the calculated particle size dependent voltage profiles are in good agreement with the experimental voltage profiles reported in literature. These results give a unique insight into the impact of nanostructuring and further possibilities of tailoring the Li-ion voltage profiles and capacities in lithium insertion materials. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","density functional theory; Li surface storage; Li-ion battery; nanosize effects; spinel Li 4+xTi 5O 12","Anisotropic surfaces; Density functional theory calculations; Electrode material; Li-ion batteries; Li-ion insertion; Lithium insertion; Lithium insertion materials; Nano-size; Nano-sized; Nano-structuring; Nanosize effects; Nanosizing; Negative electrode material; Particle size reduction; Size dependent; Storage mechanism; Storage properties; Surface effect; Surface environments; Surface orientation; Surface storage; Voltage profile; Density functional theory; lithium; nanomaterial; titanium; titanium dioxide; anisotropy; article; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; electrode; electromagnetic field; equipment design; equipment failure analysis; isolation and purification; nanomedicine; particle size; power supply; surface property; ultrastructure; Anisotropy; Computer Simulation; Electric Power Supplies; Electrodes; Electromagnetic Fields; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Lithium; Models, Chemical; Nanomedicine; Nanostructures; Particle Size; Surface Properties; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867760196

Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A save-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time ρ (dubbed the save ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting, with the remaining fraction 1 - ρ used for data transmission. The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the ESD efficiency, η. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD being a battery with η < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with η = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is derived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn.

By applying a -10 V pulse for 1 s, a large amount of holes injected from Si substrate are stored in the nanocrystals and consequently, the current at +1.5 V increases by a factor of 10 4 as compared to that of the initial state. Even with a smaller -5 V pulse for 1 μs, a sufficiently large current ratio of 36 can still be obtained, verifying the low power operation. Since holes are stored in nanocrystals which are isolated from Si substrate by Al 2O 3 with good integrity and correspond to a large valence band offset with respect to Al 2O 3, desirable read endurance up to 10 5 cycles and excellent retention over 100 yr are achieved.

Furthermore, the bottom of the conduction band of Zr 6FeAl 2 is dominated by contributions of the Zr 4d*- and Fe 3d*-like states. Regarding the occupation of the valence band of Zr 6FeAl 2, the APW + LO results have been confirmed experimentally by a comparison on a common energy scale of the XPS valence-band spectrum and the XES bands representing the energy distributions of the valence Zr d-, Fe d-, Al p- and Al s,d-like states in the compound under consideration.

Deletion of the ppk gene had a stimulatory effect on actinorhodin production; the mutant strain produced about 5 times more antibiotic compared to the wild type strain at 120 h of growth. There was no difference in undecylprodigiosin production between the mutant and wild-type strains. In the presence of a selective antibiotic, the mutant strain could grow only on rich medium and could not sporulate effectively. Moreover, while the wild type strain was resistant, the mutant strain was sensitive to H2O2 in the conditions tested.

The behavior of such systems can be tracked from the scattering matrix which is actually a network of directed vectors (or pathways) connecting subsequent values, which characterize an event, such as the index values in stock markets. A system behaves in a rigid (elastic) way to an external effect and resists permanent deformation, or it behaves in a viscous (or soft) way and deforms in an irreversible way. It was shown in the past that a formula derived using the slope of paths gives a measure about the extent of viscoelastic behavior of relation-based systems Gündüz (2009) [5] Gündüz and Gündüz (2010) [6]. In this research the 'work' associated with 'elastic' component, and 'heat' associated with 'viscous' component were discussed and elaborated. In a simple two subsequent pathway system in a scattering diagram the first vector represents 'the cause' and the second 'the effect'. By using work and heat energy relations that involve force and also storage and loss modulus terms, respectively, one can calculate the energy involved in relation-based systems. The modulus values can be found from the parallel and vertical components of the second vector with respect to the first vector. Once work-like and heat-like terms were determined the internal energy is also easily found from their summation. The parallel and vertical components can also be used to calculate the magnitude of torque and torque energy in the system. Three cases, (i) the behavior of the NASDAQ-100 index, (ii) a social revolt, and (iii) the structure of a melody were analyzed for their 'work-like', 'heat-like', and 'torque-like' energies in the course of their evolution. NASDAQ-100 exhibits highly dissipative behavior, and its work terms are very small but heat terms are of large magnitude. Its internal energy highly fluctuates in time. In the social revolt studied work and heat terms are of comparable magnitude. The melody depicts highly organized structure, and usually has larger work terms than heat terms, but at some intervals heat terms burst out and attain very large magnitudes. Torque terms reach high values when the system is recovering from a minimum value. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the rate of one of the major destruction mechanisms of CH+3, dissociative recombination (DR), has long been uncertain, hindering the use of CH+ 3 as an astrochemical probe. Here, we present the first absolute measurement of the DR of vibrationally cold CH+ 3, which has been made using the heavy storage ring CRYRING in Stockholm, Sweden. From our collision-energy- dependent cross sections, we infer a thermal rate constant of k(T) = 6.97(± 0.03) × 10-7(T/300) -0.61(± 0.01)cm3 s-1 over the region 10 K ≤ T ≤ 1000K. At low collision energies, we have measured the branching fractions of the DR products to be CH3 (0.00+0.01 -0.00), CH2 + H (0.35+0.01 - 0.01), CH + 2H (0.20+0.02 - 0.02), CH + H2 (0.10 +0.01 -0.01), and C + H2 + H (0.35 +0.01 - 0.02), indicating that two or more C-H bonds are broken in 65% of all collisions. We also present vibrational calculations which indicate that the CH+ 3 ions in the storage ring were relaxed to the vibrational ground state by spontaneous emission during the storage time. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new measurements for the observation of CH+ 3 in regions of the diffuse interstellar medium where CH+ is abundant. © 2012.

In this review, published as well as previously unpublished preclinical studies that detail the effects of NOMAC on estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic systems, as well as mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, bone, and metabolic indices are described.Methods: In vitro assays to determine NOMAC structure-activity relationships used tissue derived from rat uteri. Transactivation profiles were performed using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with cDNAs encoding human steroid receptors. Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities were monitored in vivo in rats as well as in vitro in human breast cancer cells. Standard in vivo techniques were used in rats to determine progestational activity; antigonadotropic, androgenic, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activities; as well as effects on bone and other metabolic indices. Ovulation inhibition was monitored in rats and primates. NOMAC's effects on cardiovascular systems were determined in dogs and primates.Results: NOMAC was without significant agonistic or antagonistic activity for estrogen receptor alpha or beta in vitro, and inhibited ovulation in rats and monkeys (2.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively). NOMAC lacked androgenic, antimineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and metabolic activity and exhibited moderate anti-androgenic activity in rats. NOMAC did not affect bone mineral density (BMD) in rats or hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters in dogs and primates.Conclusions: NOMAC is a selective progestogen structurally similar to progesterone that has modest anti-androgenic activity and does not affect lipid or carbohydrate metabolism, BMD, or many cardiovascular parameters in selected animal models. © 2012 van Diepen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC); Oral contraceptives; Pharmacology; Preclinical studies; Progesterone","3alpha hydroxy 5alpha pregnan 20 one; beta endorphin; corticosterone; cyproterone acetate; dexamethasone; dienogest; drospirenone; estradiol; estradiol benzoate; estradiol valerate; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; gestagen; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; levonorgestrel; medroxyprogesterone acetate; mineralocorticoid; mineralocorticoid receptor; nomegestrol; nomegestrol acetate; norethisterone acetate; progesterone; spironolactone; steroid receptor; testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase; testosterone propionate; unindexed drug; adrenal cortex; adrenal gland; antiinflammatory activity; binding affinity; bone density; bone metabolism; breast cancer; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular system; cell proliferation; central nervous system; corticosterone blood level; drug metabolism; drug potency; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; heart electrophysiology; heart hemodynamics; histopathology; hormone action; hypophysis adrenal system; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; low drug dose; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; ovulation; pharmacokinetics; protein expression; review; structure activity relation; triacylglycerol blood level; uterus; uterus weight; vagina smear; weight reduction; Androgens; Animals; Bone Density; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cell Proliferation; CHO Cells; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined; Cricetinae; Dogs; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Estrogens; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Macaca fascicularis; Male; Megestrol; Norpregnadienes; Ovulation; Progesterone Congeners; Rats; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Uterus; Animalia; Canis familiaris; Cricetulus griseus; Primates; Rattus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867049453

To investigate if reducing the light-curing time (while maintaining similar energy density) of resin-based surface sealants influences their erosion-preventive potential and mechanical stability after thermomechanical loading. Methods. Dentine samples were treated as follows: group 1untreated, groups 24Seal&Protect, groups 57experimental sealer, and groups 810Syntac Classic system. Groups 2, 5 and 8 were light-cured for 10 s (1000 mW/ cm 2), groups 3, 6 and 9 for 7 s (1400 mW/ cm 2), and groups 4, 7, and 10 for 3 s (3200 mW/ cm 2). After water storage (7 d), first measurement was performed to evaluate baseline permeability of the sealants. After a thermomechanical loading (5000 cycles, 50/5°C, 12000 brushing strokes) a second evaluation of permeability was conducted (measurement 2). Permeability was tested by storing the samples in HCl (pH 2.3; 24 h) and measuring the dentine calcium release by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results. For the first and second measurements, no influence of light-exposure time on permeability was observed (ANOVA: P > 0.05). No significant difference in the stability of the respective sealants was observed when light-cured for different durations. Conclusion. Shortening the light-curing time, while maintaining energy density constant, has no influence on permeability and stability of the investigated sealants. © 2012 Florian J.

Thus, in freshwater ecosystems the thermal regime directly affects the geographical distribution of aquatic species through their growth and metabolism and indirectly through their tolerance to parasites and diseases. Models used to predict surface water temperature range between physically based deterministic models and statistical approaches. Here we present the initial results of a physically based deterministic model of global freshwater surface temperature. The model adds a surface water energy balance to river discharge modeled by the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. In addition to advection of energy from direct precipitation, runoff, and lateral exchange along the drainage network, energy is exchanged between the water body and the atmosphere by shortwave and longwave radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Also included are ice formation and its effect on heat storage and river hydraulics. We use the coupled surface water and energy balance model to simulate global freshwater surface temperature at daily time steps with a spatial resolution of 0.5° on a regular grid for the period 1976-2000. We opt to parameterize the model with globally available data and apply it without calibration in order to preserve its physical basis with the outlook of evaluating the effects of atmospheric warming on freshwater surface temperature. We validate our simulation results with daily temperature data from rivers and lakes (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), limited to the USA) and compare mean monthly temperatures with those recorded in the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) data set. Results show that the model is able to capture the mean monthly surface temperature for the majority of the GEMS stations, while the interannual variability as derived from the USGS and NOAA data was captured reasonably well. Results are poorest for the Arctic rivers because the timing of ice breakup is predicted too late in the year due to the lack of including a mechanical breakup mechanism. Moreover, surface water temperatures for tropical rivers were overestimated, most likely due to an overestimation of rainfall temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. The spatiotemporal variation of water temperature reveals large temperature differences between water and atmosphere for the higher latitudes, while considerable lateral transport of heat can be observed for rivers crossing hydroclimatic zones, such as the Nile, the Mississippi, and the large rivers flowing to the Arctic. Overall, our model results show promise for future projection of global surface freshwater temperature under global change. © 2012.

Based on a land-atmosphere analytic continuum model, a numerical land surface model, and field observations we show that high-frequency fluctuations in incoming radiation (with period less than 6 h, for example, due to intermittent clouds) are preferentially partitioned toward ground heat flux. These higher frequencies are concentrated in the 0-1 cm surface soil layer. Subsequently, measurements even at a few centimeters deep in the soil profile miss part of the surface soil heat flux signal. The attenuation of the high-frequency soil heat flux spectrum throughout the soil profile leads to systematic errors in both measurements and modeling, which require a very fine sampling near the soil surface (0-1 cm). Calorimetric measurement techniques introduce a systematic error in the form of an artificial band-pass filter if the temperature probes are not placed at appropriate depths. In addition, the temporal calculation of the change in the heat storage term of the calorimetric method can further distort the reconstruction of the surface soil heat flux signal. A correction methodology is introduced which provides practical application as well as insights into the estimation of surface soil heat flux and the closure of surface energy balance based on field measurements. © 2012.

Often computers host multiple programs running simultaneously. However, among those programs, some maybe more time-critical than others to users. Consequently, users would hope those time-critical programs to finish their execution as soon as possible. Generally speaking, the course of program execution includes CPU operation and hard disk operation (disk I/O). For the CPU operation, modern computer systems have the ability to adjust the CPU scheduling sequence according to program priority. Nevertheless, for the disk I/O, it is not quite the same. Most computer systems do not have effective ways to conduct disk I/O based on program priority. Compared with CPU, disk I/O speed is still about six orders of magnitude behind, making time-critical and high-priority programs involving disk I/O hard to achieve high performance as users would expect. Currently, Complete Fair Queuing (CFQ) is the default disk scheduler in the Linux operating system. Unfortunately, it only offers prioritized disk I/O to some extent. We propose and implement a new disk scheduler, namely Prioritized Complete Fair Queuing (PCFQ), by adding schemes of supporting truly prioritized disk I/O into CFQ in the Linux kernel. We compare the performance between PCFQ and CFQ under different situations. Our experimental results demonstrate that, for programs with high priority, PCFQ outperforms CFQ in all cases by reducing up to extra 59.7% of the program execution time on top of what CFQ can accomplish. © 2012 IEEE.","disk scheduling; high performance; operating system; storage","CPU scheduling; Disk I/O; Disk scheduling; Fair queuing; high performance; Human society; Linux kernel; LINUX- operating system; Modern computer systems; Multiple program; Orders of magnitude; Program execution; Program performance; Computer operating systems; Energy storage; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866984372

The focus is on autonomous MGs that dynamically should perform similarly to the conventional power systems. During MG autonomous operation, the generators should accomplish the frequency control process, by means of their automatic generation control. However, RES-based generators have poor controllability in terms of active power, and therefore the need of improving the MG power reserve by adding energy storage systems is often demanded.

For electrochemistry, bulk quantities of materials are needed. The most common preparation of bulk quantities of graphene materials is based on oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide and subsequent thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide to thermally reduced graphene oxide (TR-GO). It is important to investigate to which extent a reaction condition, that is, composition of the oxidation mixture and size of graphite materials, influences the properties of the resulting materials. We characterised six graphite materials with a range of particle sizes (0.05, 11, 20, 32, 35 and 41 μm) and the TR-GO products prepared from them by use of scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetric performance of the TR-GO samples was compared using ferro/ferricyanide and ascorbic acid. We observed no correlation between size of initial graphite and properties of the resultant TR-GO such as density of surface defects, amount of oxygen-containing groups, or rate of heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). A positive correspondence between HET rate and high defect density as well as low amounts of oxygen functionalities was noted. Our findings will have profound influence upon practical fabrication of graphene for applications in sensing and energy storage devices. © 2012 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865728774

Gold wire bonding has the advantages of a fast bonding process, excellent electrical property and stable chemical property. It has been widely used in various electronic packages. Gold prices have been raised significantly over the last few years. Many manufactures have been investigating ways to replace the conventional gold wire with various new materials. Copper wire bonding is an alternative interconnection technology. Cu wire has superior electrical and thermal conductivities as well as higher tensile strength, elongation and better ""ball neck"" strength. On the other hand, the higher hardness of Cu wire requires higher ultrasonic power and bonding force, which lead to high risk of cratering for ball bonding and tearing for wedge bonding. These will cause some package limitation and wire bonder machine downtime or low units per hour (UPH). Ag alloy wire has low Young's modulus and hardness property. It is a low cost wire bonding solution other than gold wire. In this study, Ag alloy wire is proposed as an alternative to Au bonding wire. Emphasis is placed on the wire bonding workability and reliability of using Ag-Au-Pd alloy wire for TSOP package. Also, wire bonding parameter such as electronic flame off (EFO), bond force, ultrasonic power, heat block temperature and time for ball and wedge bonding are optimized. Furthermore, the response for parameter optimization is determined by the Dage bond tester. Package reliability is determined through environmental tests that include pressure cooker test (PCT), temperature cycle test (TCT) and high temperature storage life test (HTSL). The tested samples were studied by focused ion beam (FIB), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer analyses (EDS). Intermetallic compound growth behavior during reliability test is characterized and compared to Al-Au and Al-Cu systems.

The nine-switch converter can provide six input terminals for the connections of one three-phase ac source plus three dc sources to the grid. The three-phase utility grid is connected to the VMC's current source side. This configuration allows the input ac/dc sources' voltages lower than the grid voltage. The control and modulation schemes are proposed to extract the commanded current from the input ac/dc sources to the grid and guarantee high quality ac/dc inputs and ac output current waveforms with unity power factors.

By relying on pairs of detachable energy storage elements featuring properly sized capacity, the conversion concept provides high-voltage galvanic insulation, high fault tolerance and simple frequency conversion among all grids without using any transformer. Each pair of energy storage elements is associated to a couple of AC/DC or DC/DC units constituting voltage source cells. In turn, each phase of a grid is structured modularly as proper parallel and series connections of such cells. The pivotal idea is to transfer energy by periodical exchange of the storage elements among the cells, while always avoiding any simultaneous galvanic contact among them. This simple principle assures galvanic insulation and high fault tolerance since the grids or renewable sources never exchange energy directly. The energy exchange is always indirect and mediated by the energy storage elements. Owing to this property no fault is propagated immediately among the interconnect grids and, until sufficient energy is present in the storage elements, one gains precious time for enterprising much better emergency actions in the grids, actions that would be otherwise impossible with the nowadays much reduced time scales. The exchange of storage elements by reconnection can rely on contacts, like the ones for high-voltage tap changers, and on different moving means, like Robots, if physical displacement is envisaged. This latter realization broadens the concept considerably because the storage elements can be transported, via autonomous vehicles, for the long distances which divide the energetically connected entities. A specific reconnection sequence of the storage elements assures their disconnection and reconnection at zero current, thereby maximizing the lifespan of the switches. Although the present state of the art in storage technologies renders the concept still uneconomical and unfeasible today, the ongoing technological advancements could open future scenarios one should be prepared to embrace. This paper is not about a conventional solution for today. It is about highlighting what could be futuristically possible in exchanging large amounts of energy among grids, and/or renewable sources, when material science will provide storage technologies with sufficiently high capacity and number of cycles. © 2012 IEEE.","Energy storage; Fault tolerance; HVDC transmission; Power grids; Power grids interconnection; Solar parks; Static power converters; Transformerless; Wind farms","HVDC transmission; Power grids; Static power converters; Transformerless; Wind farm; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fault tolerance; Motion control; Power electronics; Wind power; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866791841

Traded volume is driven by agents' anticipation of numerous factors of limited predictability, such as renewable energy in-feed or volatile fuel prices. Such stochasticity leads to volume time-series with noise like characteristics. The goal of our study is to investigate if there are structural artifacts in the time-series attributable to weather conditions. Employing a set of simple assumptions concerning the market behavior and the financial products available, we arrive at qualitatively sensible results from a more robust theoretical perspective. Our model is trained on historical data from the Swiss market, which depends on a highly predictable renewable energy, namely hydroelectric power. A filtering process is applied to remove deterministic elements of the volume time-series such as patterns due to dates or seasons. An analysis of weather impact on this time series proves to be consistent with an intuitive analysis of the data for the months of winter. An estimation of the relative volume shift during warm and cold days in winter is provided. Results prove to be consistent with the features of heating demand, particularly for spring and autumn, when the heating status (on/off) is highly sensitive to weather conditions.

A recent study assessed optimal locations for wind power plants based on the calculation of production costs derived from wind speeds modeled in a spatially explicit way for Austria. However, wind power production, as any other intermittent renewable power source, can be highly variable due the stochastic nature of wind. This may incur additional costs for regulating power or storage devices. Selecting wind power production sites by minimizing the variability of joint power output may be one way to manage intermittency. We have generated synthetic time series of wind power production using data from a wind atlas and meteorological stations. We used the time series in an optimization model to analyze how variability in the output of newly added wind turbines can be decreased by diversifying the sites of wind farms. Results indicate that hourly variability as well as seasonal variability can be reduced by diversification of turbine sites, however, there is a trade-off. Model results indicate that diversification will reduce rents of wind turbine developers by increasing costs although all assessed sites are profitable when considering current feed-in tariffs. This implies that regulators could increase the usability of wind power plants by taking into account diversification of locations without increasing costs for consumers. 1 © 2012 IEEE.","Geographic Information Systems; Mathematical Programming; Monte Carlo methods; Wind power generation","Action plan; Additional costs; Austria; Feed-in tariff; Intermittency; Joint power; Meteorological station; Model results; Optimal locations; Optimization models; Power potential; Power sources; Production cost; Regulating power; Seasonal variability; Spatially explicit; Stochastic nature; Synthetic-time; Wind farm; Wind power production; Wind speed; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Geographic information systems; Mathematical programming; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Time series; Virtual storage; Wind turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866783459

In this review we demonstrate that it is the extraordinary ability of birds to extensively store and use lipids as the main energy source which allows them to fast for long periods during breeding, moulting, and migratory flight despite their high metabolic rates. Long-term fasting birds derive the largest part of the required energy (up to about 95%) from fat and only a minimum amount from protein. In contrast to mammalian running, birds maintain such a high proportion of energy derived from fat also during endurance flight. This is achieved by physiological adaptations during preparation, as well as for the catabolism of fatty acids during flight, such as extensive lipid storage and a specific upgrading of the transport system of fatty acids to the flight muscles and their oxidative capacity. Only little is known about the hormonal regulation of the metabolism during endurance flight, most of it related to the possible actions of the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone.

In this study, the short-term variations in growth and storage kinetics of activated sludge under disturbed feeding conditions were analyzed using a multi-component biodegradation model. The variations in growth and storage kinetics were investigated with the aid of multi-response modeling and identifiability analysis. It was found that the heterotrophic biomass is able to increase its direct growth activity together with reducing the substrate storage capability under the availability of external substrate. Reducing the sludge age (SRT) from 10 to 2 days increased the maximum specific growth rate, lOHO,Max from 3.9 to 7.0 day-1, but did not considerably affected the maximum storage rate, kStor,OHO. The alteration of sludge age also elevated the half-saturation constant for growth (KS,OHO) from 5 to 25 mg COD/L. The increase in primary growth metabolism together with reduced storage rate was validated by model for two different sludge ages in the availability of external substrate. Aside from having a lower storage capability, the biomass had fast adaptation ability to direct growth process at low SRTs. The alteration of feed conditions was found to have different impacts on storage and growth kinetics. These results are significant and advance the field of activated sludge modeling under dynamic conditions by incorporation of short-term effects. Appropriate modifications including short-term effects in model structure may also reduce dynamic model recalibration efforts in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Aerobic growth; Feast and famine; Respirometry; Storage; Variable kinetics","Activated sludge; Aerobic growth; Biodegradation model; Direct growth; Dynamic condition; Fast adaptations; Feast and famine; Feeding conditions; Heterotrophic biomass; Identifiability analysis; Maximum specific growth rates; Multicomponents; Multiresponse; Recalibrations; Respirometry; Short-term effects; Short-term variations; Simultaneous growth; Sludge age; Steady-state condition; Storage capability; Bioactivity; Biodegradation; Biomass; Energy storage; Food supply; Growth kinetics; Kinetics; Substrates; Ecology; activated sludge; analytic method; article; biodegradation; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; fed batch reactor; growth rate; heterotrophy; priority journal; sludge; steady state; Aerobiosis; Biomass; Models, Biological; Sewage; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870370347

The desorbed CO2 concentration could reach above 90%, which is practical for further utilization or permanent storage. The heat input required to regenerate spent 13X was low, reflecting an energy-efficient CO2 adsorbent. A statistical analysis on the adsorbent cost of CO2 capture revealed that the 13X could be cost-effective after extensive TVSA cycling. 13X showed less moisture sensitivity below 30 °C and showed a stable adsorption performance for CO2 under humid conditions.

A thin sacrificial layer of Al2O3 is deposited by ALD and removed eventually, forming a nanogap between the CoO core (or the NiO nanowall) and the TiO2 shell. When they are tested as supercapacitor electrodes, an evident difference between the solid core-shell nanostructure and hollow ones can be found; for example, the hollow structure shows ∼2 to 4 times the capacitance compared to the solid wires. The electrochemical properties are also superior compared to the bare nanorods without the nanotube shell. The enhancement is ascribed to the conformal hollow design which provides enlarged specific surface areas and a shorter ion transport path.

The overall purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of C. moschata fruit extract (CME) on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenges. Male ICR mice from four groups designated vehicle, CME-50, CME-100 and CME-250, respectively (n = 8 per group in each test) were orally administered CME for 14 days at 0, 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were evaluated using exhaustive swimming time, forelimb grip strength, as well as levels of plasma lactate, ammonia, glucose, and creatine kinase after an acute swimming exercise. The resting muscular and hepatic glycogen was also analyzed after 14-day supplementation with CME. Trend analysis revealed that CME treatments increased grip strength. CME dose-dependently increased 5% body weight loaded swimming time, blood glucose, and muscular and hepatic glycogen levels. CME dose-dependently decreased plasma lactate and ammonia levels and creatine kinase activity after a 15-min swimming test. The mechanism was relevant to the increase in energy storage (as glycogen) and release (as blood glucose), and the decrease of plasma levels of lactate, ammonia, and creatine kinase. Therefore, CME may be potential for the pharmacological effect of anti-fatigue. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Anti-fatigue; Cucurbita moschata; Exercise performance; Glycogen; Pumpkin","glycogen; plant extract; animal; animal experiment; article; blood; body weight; chemistry; drug effect; fatigue; fruit; hand strength; liver; male; metabolism; mouse; organ size; skeletal muscle; squash; Animals; Body Weight; Cucurbita; Fatigue; Fruit; Glycogen; Hand Strength; Liver; Male; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal; Organ Size; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Plant Extracts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868087340

We developed a concept infant formula (IMF) with large, phospholipid-coated lipid droplets (Nuturis; Danone Research, Paris, France) and investigated its programming effect on metabolic phenotype later in life.Methods:Male C57Bl/6j mice were fed a control formula (Control IMF) or Nuturis (Concept IMF) diet between postnatal day (PN)16 and PN42. All mice were subsequently fed a Western-style diet (WSD) until PN126. Body composition was monitored repeatedly by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry between PN42 and PN126.Results:Concept IMF slightly increased lean body mass as compared with Control IMF at PN42 but did not affect fat mass. Upon 84 d of WSD feeding, the Concept IMF group showed reduced fat accumulation as compared with Control IMF. In addition, fasting plasma leptin, resistin, glucose, and lipids were significantly lower in the Concept IMF group.Conclusion:Large phospholipid-coated lipid droplets in young mice reduced fat accumulation and improved metabolic profile in adulthood. These data emphasize that physical properties of early dietary lipids contribute to metabolic programming. © 2012 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"fat droplet; glucose; leptin; resistin; animal experiment; article; artificial milk; body composition; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat intake; lean body weight; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; perinatal period; priority journal; weight gain; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adiposity; Aging; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Biological Markers; Blood Glucose; Dietary Fats; Eating; Fasting; Humans; Infant; Infant Formula; Leptin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nutritional Status; Particle Size; Phospholipids; Resistin; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867095208

Three oocyte developmental phases were observed: primary growth phase, secondary growth phase and maturation phase. We observed four different developmental stages: (1) perinucleolus stage with cortical alveolus formation, (2) lipid droplets formation, (3) vitellogenesis stage and (4) maturation. Late maturation stage of oocytes in the ovaries was from the autumn season. Females accumulated lipids in liver (up to 35.2 % dw) and deposited large amounts of lipids into gonads (up to 52.2 % dw) during maturation. Lipid classes in female gonads changed seasonally, with relative increase in cholesterol during summer and depletion of storage lipids (triacylglycerols and wax esters/cholesterol esters) during the winter. Lipid composition in liver changed during oocyte development and spawning, as neutral lipids were transferred to developing oocytes during summer to autumn. During winter, storage lipids were depleted during starvation. Based on the increase in gonadosomatic index (GSI) with length and observed maturation stages, females seem to mature at a length of about 125-130 mm. The GSI and hepatosomatic index of large females sampled in autumn (September-October) were significantly higher than for females in late winter (April) and spring (May). These results indicate that spawning takes place during winter in Isfjorden and that energy reserves stored in the liver are utilized by females during gonadal development and reproduction. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Gonadosomatic index; Hepatosomatic index; Histology; Leptoclinus maculatus; Lipids; Oogenesis","lipid; animal; Arctic; article; chemistry; female; liver; oocyte development; ovary; Perciformes; physiology; sea; season; water pollution; Animals; Arctic Regions; Female; Lipids; Liver; Oceans and Seas; Oogenesis; Ovary; Perciformes; Seasons; Water Pollution; Leptoclinus maculatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866485955

When functioning as an energy storage device, the URSOFC acts like a solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) in water electrolysis mode; whereby the electric energy is stored as (electrolyzied) hydrogen and oxygen gases. While hydrogen is useful as a transportation fuel and in other industrial applications, the URSOFC also acts as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in power generation mode to produce electricity when needed. The URSOFC would be a competitive technology in the upcoming hydrogen economy on the basis of its low cost, simple structure, and high efficiency. This paper reports on the design and manufacturing of its anode support cell using commercially available materials. Also reported are the resulting performance, both in electrolysis and fuel cell modes, as a function of its operating parameters such as temperature and current density. We found that the URSOFC performance improved with increasing temperature and its fuel cell mode had a better performance than its electrolysis mode due to a limited humidity inlet causing concentration polarization. In addition, there were great improvements in performance for both the SOFC and SOEC modes after the first test and could be attributed to an increase in porosity within the oxygen electrode, which was beneficial for the oxygen reaction. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The conversion efficiency of ammonia borane to hydrogen is estimated from the accumulated volume of produced hydrogen gas and the quantitative analysis of hydrolysate by solid-state 11B NMR. Characteristics of hydrogen evolution are significantly influenced by both water dosage and injection rate of water. In the case that water is a limiting agent, namely, H 2O/AB = 1.28, less hydrogen is produced than that predicted stoichiometrically. In contrast, conversion efficiency of ammonia borane reaches nearly 100% for the case with H 2O/AB = 4.50. Injection rate of water to ammonia borane also affect profoundly the produced volume and production rate of hydrogen, if water is used as a limiting agent in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane. Nonetheless, boric acid and metaboric acid are found to be the dominant products in the hydrolysate from XRD, FT-IR and solid-state 11B NMR analysis.

The simulation results show that in a pillared graphene structure, the HSC of the graphene sheets is better than that of the carbon nanotube (CNT) pillars. An insufficient gap between graphene sheets decreases the HSC because hydrogen adsorbed at the edges of a pillared graphene structure prevents hydrogen from entering the structure.

In 1995, Taiwan's government began, via afforestation, to establish air quality enhancement zones (AQEZs) in order to promote multiple environmental benefits, including improved air quality, increased carbon sequestration, and enhanced environmental quality of life. In 2010, there were over 504 such zones. In addition to providing urban forests and green spaces, tree growth in AQEZs can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and, by shading and evapotranspiration, reduce energy demand and increase soil storage of organic carbon. In addition, afforestation can offset the carbon footprint of the world's population and is one of the best approaches to implementing carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the carbon reduction benefits of afforested AQEZs. Investigations of 48 AQEZs showed (1) a high diversity of trees planted (168 species), (2) an average density of trees of 1142/ha, (3) a forest timber volume of 23.92m 3/ha, lower than in standard plantations, (4) a carbon storage capacity of 9.25tons/ha, and (5) average annual carbon sequestration of 1.34ton-C/ha/yr. Carbon sequestration by AQEZs in Taiwan, although not remarkably high, is nevertheless, along with other ecosystem services provided by AQEZs, a significant and direct benefit to the urban public. This study provides a reliable basis of measureable results with which decision makers can evaluate benefits of urban forest carbon sequestration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality enhancement zone; Carbon neutrality; Carbon sequestration; Green space; Urban forest","A-carbon; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Benefit assessments; Carbon reduction; Carbon sequestration; Decision makers; Ecosystem services; Energy demands; Environmental benefits; Environmental quality; Green spaces; Quality enhancement; Soil storage; Timber volume; Tree growth; Urban forests; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Energy management; Quality control; Reforestation; Urban growth; Water supply; Air quality; Antidesma platyphyllum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865552875

The 129I contained in the waste is of major concern due to its long half-life and its anionic speciation in groundwater (I -), which hinders the retention by most minerals due to their negatively charged structural surfaces at near-neutral pH. AFm-SO 4 is one of the phases present in cementitious materials. Experimental data suggest that the formation of solid solution between AFm-SO 4 and AFm-I 2 has the potential to retard 129I mobility. In order to improve the present geochemical models, thermodynamic properties of AFm-I 2 and of its solid solution with AFm-SO 4 were evaluated based on precipitation and dissolution experiments in aqueous solutions between 4°C and 60°C. The solubility product of AFm-I 2 was determined at 23°C±2°C to be logKs0=-13.57±0.28 (2σ) for the dissolution reaction Ca2Al(OH)6I·2H2O↔2Ca2++Al(OH)4-+2OH-+I-+2H2O. The Gibbs energy of formation of AFm-I 2 at standard state (1bar, 25°C) was assessed to be -3325.0±2.4 (2σ) kJmol -1. The experimental data for AFm-(I 2, SO 4) phases were consistent with the formation of a continuous solid solution without miscibility gaps. A good fit to these data was obtained using a sub-regular solid solution model with negative Margules interaction parameters W SO4=-1.0kJmol -1 and W I=-8.0kJmol -1, and end-members (Ca 2Al(OH) 6I and Ca 4Al 2(OH) 12SO 4) defined according to the Vanselow convention for ion exchange. The results show the potential of AFm-SO 4 to act as a sink for 129I, notably in carbonate-free systems. Small amounts of calcite can hamper the formation of AFm-(I 2, SO 4) solid solution.

The present paper has reviewed the studies conducted on the energy and exergy analysis of CTES systems with a special focus on ice thermal and chilled water storage systems as the most common types of CTES. However, choosing a proper CTES technique is mainly dependent on localized parameters such as the ambient temperature profile, electricity rate structure, and user's habit, which makes it quite difficult and complicated as it depends on many individual parameters. Therefore, it was found that energy and exergy analysis can help significantly for a better judgment. The review paper has shown that the exergetic efficiency analysis can show a more realistic picture than energy efficiency analysis. In addition, the environmental impact and the economic feasibility of these systems are also investigated.

Hydrogen quality affects fuel cell stack performance and lifetime, as well as other factors such as valve operation. In this paper, previous researcher's development on hydrogen as a possible major fuel of the future has been studied thoroughly. Hydrogen is one of the energy carriers which can replace fossil fuel and can be used as fuel in an internal combustion engines and as a fuel cell in vehicles. To use hydrogen as a fuel of internal combustion engine, engine design should be considered for avoiding abnormal combustion. As a result it can improve engine efficiency, power output and reduce NO x emissions. The emission of fuel cell is low as compared to conventional vehicles but as penalty, fuel cell vehicles need additional space and weight to install the battery and storage tank, thus increases it production cost. The production of hydrogen can be 'carbon-free' only if it is generated by employing genuinely carbon-free renewable energy sources. The acceptability of hydrogen technology depends on the knowledge and awareness of the hydrogen benefits towards environment and human life.

Therefore, utilizing the cold thermal energy storage (CTES) technique can significantly reduce the energy demand. In this study, a macroscopic thermodynamic analysis of the application of five different CTES systems for an office building in Malaysia is presented.

The new concrete deck with microencapsulated PCM is the standard deck on which an additional layer of the PCM concrete was added and, at the same time, the latent heat storage was introduced to the construction. The challenge of numerically simulating the performance of the new deck with PCM concrete is the thermal properties of such a new material, as the PCM concrete is yet to be well defined.

Data collected from Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and d-spacing reveal the changes in the CoS structures and crystalline lattices after annealing. Cyclic voltammetry results reveal that the annealed CNT/CoS composite electrodes yield values of 2140 ± 90 and 1370 ± 50 F g -1 for specific capacitance at scan rates of 10 and 100 mV s -1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the annealed CNT/CoS composite electrodes provide higher specific capacitance relative to other reported ones at a scan rate of 100 mV s -1. CNT/CoS composite electrodes yield a power density of 62.4 kW kg -1 at a constant discharge current density of 217.4 A g -1.

In this report a novel protocol for SDS gelatin zymography was established, and an increase of cathepsin B and L activity after HP treatment was shown followed by a decrease during storage. No calpain activity was detected following HP treatment. HP treatment was shown to induce a decrease in protein solubility in both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic fractions. LC-MS analysis of these fractions showed changes in the peptide pattern during storage. Western blot analysis showed that troponin-T was indeed degraded during storage after HP treatment.

The basic principle of this loop has been implemented and verified with simulations. The loop is able to optimize the antenna-electronics interface for a ±33% change in antenna reactance.

Their core is comprised of hydrophobic lipids covered by a surface region consisting of amphiphilic lipids and proteins. For example, high and low density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) are essentially lipid droplets surrounded by specific proteins, their main function being to transport cholesterol. Interfacial tension and surface pressure of these particles are of great interest because they are related to the shape and the stability of the droplets and to protein adsorption at the interface. Here we use coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations to consider a number of related issues by calculating the interfacial tension in protein-free lipid droplets, and in HDL and LDL particles mimicking physiological conditions. First, our results suggest that the curvature dependence of interfacial tension becomes significant for particles with a radius of ∼5 nm, when the area per molecule in the surface region is &lt;1.4 nm2. Further, interfacial tensions in the used HDL and LDL models are essentially unaffected by single apo-proteins at the surface. Finally, interfacial tensions of lipoproteins are higher than in thermodynamically stable droplets, suggesting that HDL and LDL are kinetically trapped into a metastable state. © 2012 Biophysical Society.",,"high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; article; chemistry; kinetics; molecular dynamics; pressure; protein conformation; surface property; Kinetics; Lipoproteins, HDL; Lipoproteins, LDL; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Pressure; Protein Conformation; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866514776

However, in practical applications, these materials suffer from low efficiency due to their sluggish kinetics and significant structural changes during hydration and dehydration. A DFT PW91-TZ2P level optimization is performed on the various hydrates of magnesium sulfate molecules to study their structural properties. The study identifies a wide network of hydrogen bonds that is significantly influencing the chemical structure of the molecules. These hydrogen bonds appear to cause distortions in the hydrated structures and even hinder the coordination of water with magnesium, resulting in lower-energy isomers. In the case of hexahydrated isomers, the hydrogen bond stabilizes a conformation that has only four coordinated water molecules and is energetically more stable than the conformation with six coordinated water molecules. The sluggish hydration kinetics in magnesium sulfate is attributed to the strong hydrogen bond network present in the crystals.

We show from first-principles calculations that transition metals such as V and Nb can act as effective catalysts for H 2 interaction with Al(100). When located at subsurface sites, V and Nb can reduce the activation barrier for H 2 dissociation by significantly larger values than the well-studied catalyst Ti. In addition, the binding energy of a H atom on the surface can be enhanced by as much as 0.4 eV when V or Nb is introduced in the sublayers of Al(100). The diffusion barrier for the adsorbed hydrogen is reduced by ∼0.1 eV, showing an increased hydrogen mobility. The mechanism of promoting the metal surface reactivity by subsurface alloying with transition metals proposed in this work may serve as a new possible scheme for catalytic reactions on the metal surface. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation barriers; Adsorbed hydrogen; Alanates; Catalytic reactions; Dissociative chemisorption; First-principles calculation; Hydrogen interaction; Hydrogen mobility; Hydrogen-storage materials; Metal surfaces; Sub-layers; Subsurface alloying; Subsurface sites; Alloying; Aluminum; Binding energy; Calculations; Catalysis; Catalysts; Chemisorption; Dissociation; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Niobium; Transition metals; Surfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865961220

These inorganic compounds can be easily obtained by fusion of potassium or sodium phosphates at 700-800 °C for several hours followed by rapid cooling. These polymers are present in the cells of all living organisms from bacteria to mammals. Numerous functions of this compound in the cells, including phosphate and energy reservation, sequestration and storage of cations, formation of membrane channels, participation in phosphate transport, involvement in cell envelope formation and function, gene activity control, regulation of enzyme activities, stress response and stationary phase adaptation, are provided by the following properties: polyphosphate is an osmotically neutral form of phosphorus, the vital cell element necessary for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and phospholipids, phosphorylation of proteins and sugars; the energy of phosphoanhydride bonds between phosphate residues is close to the energy of terminal phosphoester bond in ATP; these polyanions can form complexes both with inorganic cations and with positively charged organic compounds, modifying the properties of these compounds. Polyphosphates are extensively used for sequestration of iron, manganese, calcium and magnesium in water treatment. Polyphosphates are also applied as fertilizers and food additives. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) based on polyphosphate accumulation by sludge bacteria is now an accepted and low-cost strategy for controlling eutrophication. Polyphosphates are promising as phosphodonors in enzymatic synthesis of biologically active compounds instead of ATP. Great expectations are associated with their application in different fields of medicine. They display antiseptic, cytoprotective and antiviral activity. In view of the fact that polyphosphates are involved in the regulation of bone tissue metabolism, they are appropriate agents in treatment for bone diseases and in stomatology. Calcium polyphosphate bioceramics is being developed as a bone substitute. Polyphosphate plays a key role in both inflammation and formation of blood clots as an activator of Factor XII. Thus, these polymers are of great interest as a new type of treatment for inflammation, thrombosis, and other blood coagulation diseases. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Such a treatment gives rise simultaneously to a prominent enbrittlement of the material and its activation towards reaction with water with the hydrogen evolution. The latter fact makes the activated alu- minium a promising energy carrier for the small-scale hydrogen energetics. It is demonstrated that both phe- nomena are caused by the fast diffusion of the eutectics along intergrain boundaries and microcracks throughout the bulk of polycrystalline Al. The diffusion is promoted by the formation of (Al-Ga-In) solid solution in near-surface regions of Al crystalline grains. The progressive loss of activity of aluminium treated with GaIn eutectics upon a prolonged storage in humid air is due to the decomposition of the eutectics accompanied by the segregation of indium metal and partial gallium oxidation. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2012.",,"Crystalline grains; Energy carriers; EXAFS; Fast diffusion; Humid air; Hydrogen evolution; Indium metal; Inter-grain; Micro-tomography; Microstructural changes; Near surface regions; Polycrystalline; X-ray synchrotron; Eutectics; Gallium; Gallium alloys; Hydrogen; Solidification; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870571210

In a nutshell, energy routers exchange energy sharing control information using their data network while sharing energy freely among connected embedded sensor devices using their energy network. To improve sharing efficiency subject to energy leakage, we develop an effective energy charging and discharging mechanism using an array of ultra-capacitors as the main component of an energy router.

In the present work, characteristic features of the radicals were investigated in detail for pre-irradiated, irradiated (gamma and UV), and mechanically induced fingernails by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Heights of the resonance lines measured with respect to the spectrum base line were used to monitor microwave power saturation, washing treatment, absorbed dose, storage time and temperature dependent kinetic features of the radical species contributing to the formation of recorded experimental ESR spectra. From the recorded ESR spectra of fingernail samples collected from 20 donors showed that spectroscopic splitting factors g determined from recorded background spectra were 2.0042 and peak to peak width was found to be ΔHpp≅0.45 mT. In the interested low dose range (≤ 200Gy) irradiated fingernails showed a broad, unresolved ESR spectrum which was similar to the background signal except its high peak intensity. A linear dose-response curve was recorded for UV-irradiated fingernails. Washed fingernails with different solutions effected the decay rate of the samples. The radicals produced upon irradiation were fairly stable at room storage conditions. The act of cutting the fingernail samples generates sulphur centered radicals of α-keratin content of fingernail. Three radical species of were found for the mechanically damaged fingernail samples. The variations of the peak heights of the samples with temperature were related with the water content found in the keratin of fingernails. Decay activation energy for mechanically induced radicals in fingernail was calculated to be 23.5 kcal/mol. Basing on these results, it was concluded that human fingernail samples could be used as biological dosimeters and that ESR spectroscopy could be successfully used as a potential technique for monitoring its dosimetric behaviours.","Biological dosimeter; Dosimeter; ESR; Fingernail; Irradiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867035966

Thermal energy storage properties of the synthesized SSPCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and found that they had typical solid-solid phase transition temperatures in the range of 27-30°C and high latent heat enthalpy between 34 and 74J/g. Especially, the copolymer with the mole ratio of 1/1 (poly(styrene-co-allyalcohol)/stearoyl chloride) is the most attractive one due to the highest latent heat storage capacity among them. The results of DSC and FT-IR analysis indicated that the synthesized SSPCMs had good thermal reliability and chemical stability after 5000 thermal cycles. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results suggested that the synthesized SSPCMs had high thermal resistance. In addition, thermal conductivity measurements signified that the synthesized PCMs had higher thermal conductivity compared to that of poly(styrene-co-allyalcohol). The synthesized copolymers as novel SSPCMs have considerable potential for thermal energy storage applications such as solar space heating and cooling in buildings and greenhouses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Poly(styrene-co-allyalcohol); Solid-solid phase change material; Stearic acid; Thermal energy storage","Amorphous phase; Crystal morphologies; Crystalline phase; Fourier transform infrared; FTIR analysis; Graft copolymerization; In-buildings; Mole ratio; Polarized optical microscopy; Poly(styrene-co-allyalcohol); Proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Solid-solid; Solid-solid phase transitions; Thermal conductivity measurements; Thermal cycle; Thermal reliability; Thermogravimetric; Chlorine compounds; Copolymers; Differential scanning calorimetry; Grafting (chemical); Heat storage; Latent heat; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Optical microscopy; Phase change materials; Reliability analysis; Stearic acid; Styrene; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Thermal conductivity; alcohol; calorimetry; cooling; crystal structure; enthalpy; fatty acid; FTIR spectroscopy; heating; nuclear magnetic resonance; polymer; renewable resource; solar power; storage; thermal conductivity; thermal power; thermogravimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865608371

More importantly, the materials used to produce hydrogen on demand should be in themselves safe to handle. In present work, Al-Li intermetallic compounds (IMC) were fabricated in air by electrolysis from LiCl-KCl molten salt at 480 ± 25 °C. Bulk AlLi IMC and the bulk compound with mixture of Al 2Li 3 and Al 4Li 9 (Al 2Li 3/Al 4Li 9 IMC) were not pyrophoric and can be safely handled in air. When both compounds in contact with water, vigorous reaction occurred and H 2 was directly produced. The by-products after H 2 generation from AlLi IMC were a mixture of Li-containing α-Al and Li-Al hydrotalcite (hereafter referred to as Li-Al LDH). The by-product after H 2 generation from Al 2Li 3/Al 4Li 9 compound was a mixture of LiOH·H 2O and Li-Al LDH. Those by-products can be easily separated from water and may be reused as a resource. Approximately 500-860 ml of H 2 per weight (g) of the IMC compounds was generated in deionized water at room temperature. Experimentally, AlLi IMC powder and Al 2Li 3/Al 4Li 9 compound exhibit gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 7.0 wt.% and 5.4 wt.%, respectively. Although the energy consumed for fabricating Al-Li IMC compounds is a little larger than the energy provided by the generated H 2, the Al-Li IMC compounds are promising materials for producing hydrogen on demand without the necessity of hydrogen storage. Highlights: AlLi and Al 2Li 3/Al 4Li 9 compounds vigorously reacted with water to generate hydrogen. Al-Li IMC could exhibit gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 5.4-7.0 wt.%. No catalyst was used in the hydrogen generation reaction.

The ball milling conditions were systematically varied to prepare three samples with different reactivity. Up to eight full cycles of hydrogen release and uptake were investigated for each sample, which reveal that Nb2O5 reacts with Mg forming a ternary oxide, MgxNb1-xO. The PXD data for the ternary oxide is similar to that observed for the isostructural compounds MgO and NbO although shifted to lower Bragg diffraction angles revealing an expansion of the unit cell. Rietveld refinements suggest that MgxNb1-xO has a limiting composition of x ∼ 0.6 after eight cycles of hydrogen release and uptake. At elevated temperatures Nb(II) is reduced to metallic Nb(0) and extracted from the ternary oxide and forms in a reaction with Mg.

The process can be divided into three phases: ""adiabatic heating"" phase, ""heat transfer"" phase and ""end of reaction"" phase. Critical phenomenon is observed between ""adiabatic heating"" and ""heat transfer"" phases. The crisis occurs when temperature of metal hydride bed reaches maximum, which is close to equilibrium temperature for inlet pressure, and is followed by significant slowdown of the reaction rate. Presence and accumulation of impurities in the voids of metal hydride bed precipitates crisis due to decreasing of hydrogen partial pressure. Two strategies of hydrogen purification with the aid of metal hydrides are discussed. Mixture filtration through the metal hydride bed is recommended for high concentration of impurities and PSA (or TSA) suits for nearly pure hydrogen. Highlights: Critical phenomenon slows hydrogen sorption rate in metal hydride bed. Crisis is connected with insufficient heat transfer and presence of impurities.

Energy generation from conventional fossil fuels has been identified as the main culprit of environmental quality degradation and environmental pollution. In order to address these issues, nanotechnology plays an essential role in revolutionizing the device applications for energy conversion and storage, environmental monitoring, as well as green engineering of environmental friendly materials. Carbon nanotubes and their hybrid nanocomposites have received immense research attention for their potential applications in various fields due to their unique structural, electronic and mechanical properties. Here, we review the applications of carbon nanotubes (1) in energy conversion and storage such as in solar cells, fuel cells, hydrogen storage, lithium ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors, (2) in environmental monitoring and wastewater treatment for the detection and removal of gas pollutants, pathogens, dyes, heavy metals and pesticides and (3) in green nanocomposite design. Integration of carbon nanotubes in solar and fuel cells has increased the energy conversion efficiency of these energy conversion applications, which serve as the future sustainable energy sources. Carbon nanotubes doped with metal hydrides show high hydrogen storage capacity of around 6 wt% as a potential hydrogen storage medium. Carbon nanotubes nanocomposites have exhibited high energy capacity in lithium ion batteries and high specific capacitance in electrochemical supercapacitors, in addition to excellent cycle stability. High sensitivity and selectivity towards the detection of environmental pollutants are demonstrated by carbon nanotubes based sensors, as well as the anticipated potentials of carbon nanotubes as adsorbent to remove environmental pollutants, which show high adsorption capacity and good regeneration capability.

They have been studied extensively because of being associated with various chronic and acute diseases especially immunosuppression and cancer. Aflatoxin occurrence is influenced by certain environmental conditions such as drought seasons and agronomic practices. Chili pepper may also be contaminated by aflatoxins during harvesting, production and storage. Aflatoxin detection based on chemical methods is fairly accurate. However, they are time consuming, expensive and destructive. We use hyperspectral imaging as an alternative for detection of such contaminants in a rapid and nondestructive manner. In order to classify aflatoxin contaminated chili peppers from uncontaminated ones, a compact machine vision system based on hyperspectral imaging and machine learning is proposed. In this study, both UV and Halogen excitations are used. Energy values of individual spectral bands and also difference images of consecutive spectral bands were utilized as feature vectors. Another set of features were extracted from those features by applying quantization on the histogram of the images. Significant features were selected based on proposed method of hierarchical bottleneck backward elimination (HBBE), Guyon's SVM-RFE, classical Fisher discrimination power and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used as the classifiers. It was observed that with the proposed features and selection methods, robust and higher classification performance was achieved with fewer numbers of spectral bands enabling the design of simpler machine vision systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aflatoxin detection; Feature extraction; Feature subset selection; Food safety; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine vision","Agronomic practices; Aspergillus flavus; Aspergillus parasiticus; Backward elimination; Chemical method; Chili pepper; Classification performance; Compact machines; Difference images; Energy value; Environmental conditions; Feature subset selection; Feature vectors; Fisher discrimination; Hyperspectral Imaging; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine vision systems; Multi-layer perceptrons; Non destructive; Selection methods; Spectral band; SVM-RFE; Toxic metabolites; UV- and; Aflatoxins; Aspergillus; Chemical detection; Feature extraction; Food safety; Pattern recognition systems; Principal component analysis; Computer vision; agricultural practice; cancer; detection method; disease prevalence; environmental conditions; food safety; fungus; herb; histogram; metabolite; pollution effect; selection; spectral analysis; toxin; Aspergillus; Aspergillus flavus; Aspergillus parasiticus; Capsicum frutescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863431206

Here, energy management is important from a broad sustainability perspective. This paper presents the state-of-the-art regarding one energy management concept; the closed greenhouse integrated with thermal energy storage (TES) technology. This concept is an innovation for sustainable energy management since it is designed to maximize the utilization of solar energy through seasonal storage. In a fully closed greenhouse, there is no ventilation which means that excess sensible and latent heat must be removed. Then, this heat can be stored using seasonal and/or daily TES technology, and used later in order to satisfy the heating demand of the greenhouse. This assessment shows that closed greenhouse can, in addition to satisfying its own heating demand, also supply the demand for neighboring buildings. Several energy potential studies show that summer excess heat of almost three times the annual heating demand of the greenhouse. However, many studies propose the use of some auxiliary system for peak load. Also, the assessment clearly point out that a combination of seasonal and short-term TES must be further explored to make use of the full potential. Although higher amount of solar energy can be harvested in a fully closed greenhouse, in reality a semi-closed greenhouse concept may be more applicable. There, a large part of the available excess heat will be stored, but the benefits of an integrated forced-ventilation system are introduced in order to use fresh air as a rapid response for primarily humidity control. The main conclusion from this review is that aspects like energy efficiency, environmental benefits and economics must be further examined since this is seldom presented in the literature. Also, a variety of energy management scenarios may be employed depending on the most prioritized aspect. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The comparison is carried out in terms of specific energy consumption, CO 2 footprint, CO 2 capture energy penalty, raw material consumption and energy recovery potential. This has been achieved through the modelling of the integration of these process concepts with a reference cement plant. The results show that for the same capture efficiency (85%), calcium looping has an advantage as the specific energy consumption increases by 18%. In the case of MEA the increase is 45%. CL also has considerably higher energy recovery potential, which can also further reduce its CO 2 footprint. However, chemical looping demonstrates a higher complexity of integration with an existing cement plant. Oxy-combustion, though showing lower capture efficiency (60%), results in lower specific energy consumption than the base case cement plant, which results to a negative CO 2 capture penalty. These results contribute to the identification of the most suitable CO 2 reducing strategy for the cement industry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the structures, total energies, and decomposition reactions of LiBH 4 nanoparticles using density functional theory calculations. We find that the reaction energies of nanoclusters with a diameter ≲2 nm are very close to that of bulk LiBH 4. Only very small clusters with a diameter &lt;1 nm are significantly destabilized relative to the bulk. The thermodynamics of such small clusters is unfavorable, however, and leads to dehydrogenation temperatures that are higher than that of the bulk. Although small (LiBH 4) n nanoclusters exhibit a number of different geometries, they show only little variation in the total energy per formula unit. Of all possible decomposition reactions of (LiBH 4) n, the reaction where diborane is released, is unfavorable for most cluster sizes, whereas the hydrogen desorption reaction to Li 2H 12B 12 is most favorable.

We investigate the impacts of a planned 1000 MW PS scheme connecting Lago Bianco with Lago di Poschiavo (Switzerland) on temperature and particle mass concentration in both basins. The upper (turbid) basin is a reservoir receiving large amounts of fine particles from the partially glaciated watershed, while the lower basin is a much clearer natural lake. Stratification, temperature and particle concentrations in the two basins were simulated with and without PS for four different hydrological conditions and 27 years of meteorological forcing using the software CE-QUAL-W2. The simulations showed that the PS operations lead to an increase in temperature in both basins during most of the year. The increase is most pronounced (up to 4C) in the upper hypolimnion of the natural lake toward the end of summer stratification and is partially due to frictional losses in the penstocks, pumps and turbines. The remainder of the warming is from intense coupling to the atmosphere while water resides in the shallower upper reservoir. These impacts are most pronounced during warm and dry years, when the upper reservoir is strongly heated and the effects are least concealed by floods. The exchange of water between the two basins relocates particles from the upper reservoir to the lower lake, where they accumulate during summer in the upper hypolimnion (10 to 20 mg L-1) but also to some extent decrease light availability in the trophic surface layer. © 2012.

In this case the paper substrate acts much in the same way as circuit boards, containing conductive tracks and acting as a carrier for the electrical components. It is important to consider the contacting of the components to be able to produce low resistance electrical contacts to the conductive tracks. Supercapacitors are able to deliver a large amount of current in a short time and are a good option for short term energy storage and if the printed product is to be used only one, or a few times, it can be the only power source needed. When manufacturing printed electronics, the overall resistance of the printed tracks as well as the contact resistance of the mounted components will add up to the total resistance of the system. A high resistance will cause a voltage drop from the power source to the component. This will waste power that goes to Joule heating and also the voltage and current available to components may be too low to drive them. If the intention is to use a power supply such as batteries or solar cells this becomes a limitation. In this article have been tested several conductive adhesives used to contact paper based supercapacitors to ink jet printed silver tracks on paper. The best adhesive gives about 0.3 Ω per contact, a factor 17 better compared to the worst which gave 5 Ω. The peak power that is possible to take out from a printed system with a flexible battery and super capacitors is about 10 times higher than compared with the same system with only the battery.","Paper Electronics; Printed Electronics; Supercapacitors","Circuit boards; Conductive adhesive; Electrical components; Electrical contacts; High resistance; Ink jet; Low resistance; Paper electronics; Paper substrate; Peak power; Power sources; Power supply; Printed electronics; Printed products; Printed structures; Short term; Silicon-based; Super capacitor; Total resistance; Voltage drop; Conductive adhesive; Electrical components; Electrical contacts; Paper electronics; Printed electronics; Printed structures; Short term energies; Total resistance; Capacitors; Electric power systems; Identification (control systems); Adhesives; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Ink jet printers; Supercapacitor; Substrates; Substrates; Adhesives; Batteries; Components; Contacting; Paper; Power Supply; Resistance; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865269763

In addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account channel conditions and energy sources that are time varying, so as to maximize the throughput. Two types of side information (SI) on the channel conditions and harvested energy are assumed to be available: causal SI (of the past and present slots) or full SI (of the past, present and future slots). We obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. In particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy and the full SI is available, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Convex optimization; dynamic programming; energy harvesting; optimal policy; wireless communications","Channel conditions; Conventional batteries; Convex optimization techniques; Energy allocations; Energy Harvester; Energy source; Finite horizons; Optimal energy; Optimal policies; Optimality; Past and present; Side information; Time selective fading; Time varying; Waterfilling; Wireless communications; Convex optimization; Dynamic programming; Energy harvesting; Water levels; Wireless telecommunication systems; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865230790

Since the vast majority of sensing and energy storage chemical and electrochemical systems require bulk quantities of graphene, thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) is commonly employed instead of pristine graphene. The sp 2 planar structure of TRGO is heavily damaged, consisting of a very short sp 2 crystallite size of nanometre length and with areas of sp 3 hybridized carbon. Such a structure of TRGO is reminiscent of the key characteristic of the structure of amorphous carbon, which is defined as a material without long-range crystalline order consisting of both sp 2 and sp 3 hybridized carbons. Herein, we describe the characterization of TRGO, its parent graphite material and carbon black (a form of amorphous carbon) via transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry experiments. We used the data obtained as well as consideration of practical factors to perform a comparative assessment of the relative electrochemical performances of TRGO against amorphous carbon. We found out that TRGO and amorphous carbon exhibit almost identical characteristics in terms of density of defects in the sp 2 lattice and a similar crystallite size as determined by Raman spectroscopy. These two materials also exhibit similar amounts of oxygen containing groups as determined by XPS and nearly indistinguishable cyclic voltammetric response providing almost identical heterogeneous electron transfer constants. This leads us to conclude that for some sensing and energy storage electrochemical applications, the use of amorphous carbon might be a much more economical solution than the one requiring digestion of highly crystalline graphite with strong oxidants to graphite oxide and then thermally exfoliating it to thermally reduced graphene oxide. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Comparative assessment; Crystalline graphite; Crystalline order; Density of defects; Electrochemical applications; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical systems; Energy storage applications; Graphite materials; Graphite oxide; Heterogeneous electron transfer; Key characteristics; Nanometres; Oxygen containing groups; Planar structure; Reduced graphene oxides; Strong oxidants; Two-materials; Voltammetric response; Carbon black; Crystalline materials; Cyclic voltammetry; Energy storage; Graphene; Graphite; Photoelectrons; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Amorphous carbon; carbon; fullerene derivative; graphite; nanomaterial; oxide; pristine (C60); article; chemistry; electrochemical analysis; electrode; temperature; Carbon; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Fullerenes; Graphite; Nanostructures; Oxides; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864449329

The traditional approach in integrating them to the main system is the use of interfacing dc-dc converters which introduce additional costs and power losses. This paper therefore, presents a novel direct integration scheme for supercapacitors and thereby eliminates associated costs and power losses of interfacing converters. The idea is simply to replace ordinary capacitors of three-level flying-capacitor rectifiers with supercapacitors and operate them under variable voltage conditions. An analysis on the reduction of power losses by the proposed system is presented. Furthermore, supercapacitor sizing and implementation issues such as effects of the variable voltage operation and resistive behavior of supercapacitors at high frequencies are also discussed. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system in suppressing short term power fluctuations in wind generation system. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Additional costs; Associated costs; Direct integration; Distributed generation system; High frequency; Power fluctuations; Power-losses; Short term; Storage elements; Super capacitor; Three-level; Variable voltage; Wind generation system; DC-DC converters; Electric power system interconnection; Industrial electronics; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864862847

To obtain well-constructed clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), the synthetic parameters (the solvent systems and reaction temperature) were investigated. The rate of solvent evaporation is critical to optimise the formation of clusters which were spherical in shape, had a diameter of approximately 97 nm, and were highly stable for storage at room temperature. This greener synthetic approach displays the benefits of high yield and waste reduction compared to previous reports. In addition, IONP clusters of 50 μg mL-1 retained over 84% of the viability of KB cells and the structure of the clusters can be observed by transmission electron microscopy after cellular internalisation. The mechanism of cellular uptake of the IONP clusters was speculated to be via an energy-dependent endocytic pathway because the internalisation was significantly inhibited at 4 °C. These IONP clusters also had higher saturation magnetisation and r2 relaxation (253.85 s-1 mM-1) values and better T2-weighted contrast performance (r2/r1 = 20.5) than commercial Resovist®. The contrast signal for magnetic resonance imaging was efficiently increased by the IONP clusters in vivo, especially in the liver and tumour regions. Iron staining of both tissues confirmed the accumulation of the nanoparticles in both areas. Thus, these clusters, which were prepared with the use of a nonionic polymer surfactant, can potentially serve as efficient contrast agents for magnetic resonance applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",,"Emulsification; Ethylene glycol; Evaporation; Iron oxides; Magnetic resonance imaging; Metal nanoparticles; Nonionic surfactants; Phase transitions; Polyethylene glycols; Saturation magnetization; Solvents; Superparamagnetism; Tissue; Transmission electron microscopy; Cellular uptake; Contrast agent; Endocytic pathways; Energy dependent; High yield; In-vivo; Iron oxide nanoparticle; Nonionic polymers; Reaction temperature; Room temperature; Solvent evaporation; Solvent system; Superparamagnetic iron oxides; Synthetic approach; Synthetic parameters; Waste reduction; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863943911

At the same time, the efficient consumption of energy is vital for avoiding the impacts from increasing fuel prices. A significant part of this challenge may be dealt with in the way space heating, space cooling, and domestic hot water production which is provided to residential and commercial buildings. Air source heat pumps (ASHP) are widely used conversion technologies for providing building thermal energy services; cooling, heating, and water heating. ASHP does not have a constant temperature for the primary source like: soil, ground water, or surface water heat pumps. In result, laboratory experiments and tests are faced by the problem of having to handle a wide range of conditions under which the evaporator is operated. In order to cover various climate conditions, performance and behavior must be tested for temperatures ranging from -30°C to 40°C and for various humidity levels. This paper presents a state-of-art experimental stand, named controlled lab environment (CLE or climatic box), for testing ASHP under controlled evaporator ambient conditions. A main purpose of the CLE is to test and verify the performance and behavior of a theoretical model of the ASHP as a basis for optimization and efficiency improvements. Together with thermal storage technologies and intelligent control system this technology may come to play a key role in the development of Smart Buildings in future energy systems. While experimental results are not yet available the paper presents the design considerations and schematics of the CLE. Furthermore, a thermodynamic model of an ASHP is presented. © 2012 IEEE.","Air source heat pump; climatic box; CO 2; controlled lab environment; flexible experimental stand","Ambient conditions; Climate condition; climatic box; Commercial building; Constant temperature; Consumption of energy; controlled lab environment; Conversion technology; Design considerations; Domestic hot water; Efficiency improvement; Energy services; Energy systems; Fuel prices; Future energies; Heat pumps; Humidity levels; Laboratory experiments; Low costs; Penetration level; Primary sources; Renewables; Space cooling; Theoretical models; Thermal storage technology; Thermodynamic model; Water heating; Wind and solar power; Carbon dioxide; Evaporators; Fossil fuels; Groundwater; Heat storage; Office buildings; Optimization; Solar energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Air source heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864688361

In this study, nanocrystal-graphene hybrids were successfully synthesized in high-boiling-point organic solvents. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were modified by oleylamine (OLA) to form a OLA-GO complex in order to be readily incorporated into hydrophobic synthesis. A rich library of highly crystalline nanocrystals, with types including noble metal, metal oxide, magnetic material and semiconductor were successfully grown on chemically converted graphene (CCG), which is simultaneously reduced from GO during the synthesis. High boiling-point solvents afford sufficient thermal energy to assure the high-quality crystalline nature of NCs, therefore the post-annealing process is obviated. Controlled experiments revealed that OLA-GO triggers heterogeneous nucleation and serves as excellent nuclei anchorage media.

It used the second law of thermodynamics to analyze the exergy loss of the major components of this experimental system. This study set up a dual-temperature refrigeration system in the experiment, and designed an intercooler to increase the system subcooling and to reduce the superheat. It simulated the storage under different loads and different operating frequencies of compressor to discuss the variance trend of the consumed power, exergy loss analysis, compression work, coefficient of performance (COP) and energy factor (E.F) of the system. The experimental result showed that the refrigeration efficiency of the compressor working at 50 Hz is similar to that at 60 Hz, but the energy factor is approximately 17.3% lower than that at 60 Hz. When the system is in steady operation, the COP of the electronic dual-temperature refrigeration system is approximately 17.6% better than the mechanical dual-refrigeration system. As for the exergy analysis, the two components having the most severe exergy loss in the system are the compressor and the refrigeration expansion valve. The total exergy loss of the two major components is approximately 60%∼70% of that of the overall system. The exergy loss of the electronic machine is approximately 30% lower than the system. As for the performance of energy factor, when the operating frequency of the compressor is 60 Hz, 50 Hz and 40 Hz, the Energy factor of the electronic dual-temperature refrigeration system is higher than that of the mechanical two-temperature refrigeration system by 7.6%, 5.23% and 4.7% respectively. According to the above results, when the mechanical throttle refrigerant control device is changed to electronic type, the system has better performance in power consumption, exergy loss and energy factor in the long term. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

We here look at how energy storage may benefit renewable power generation by making it available in periods with little or no intermittent generation and thereby prevent additional conventional generation form being used. In addition to this, one of the strongest concerns in relation to renewable power is the instability in the electric power system that it may introduce as a result of large and relatively fast power fluctuations. An additional benefit of energy storage is therefore its ability to counteract fluctuations in renewable power generation and thereby allow for longer reaction times for any controllable generation units. Capture and storage of excess renewable power in order to fully exploit the natural recourses is likely to become relevant for high penetration levels of renewable energy. Meanwhile, the insurance of power system stability through reduction of power gradients is of major importance even at lower penetration levels and some form of energy storage therefore seems unavoidable. A variety of technologies are available for storage of energy in the power system. When identifying the most relevant storage solutions it is necessary to include considerations on many relevant parameters which should be evaluated against the potential drawbacks and benefits of adding storage. Here, the most relevant technologies in relation to power systems with high penetration of renewable sources are identified and considerations with regard to cost, sizing and operation scheme are made. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Fat storage-Inducing Transmembrane (FIT) proteins are conserved ER-resident proteins that facilitate fat storage by partitioning energy-rich triglycerides into LDs. FIT2, the ancient ortholog of the FIT gene family first identified in mammals has two homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SCS3 and YFT2) and other fungi of the Saccharomycotina lineage. Despite the coevolution of these genes for more than 170 million years and their divergence from higher eukaryotes, SCS3, YFT2, and the human FIT2 gene retain some common functions: expression of the yeast genes in a human embryonic kidney cell line promotes LD formation, and expression of human FIT2 in yeast rescues the inositol auxotrophy and chemical and genetic phenotypes of strains lacking SCS3. To better understand the function of SCS3 and YFT2, we investigated the chemical sensitivities of strains deleted for either or both genes and identified synthetic genetic interactions against the viable yeast gene-deletion collection. We show that SCS3 and YFT2 have shared and unique functions that connect major biosynthetic processes critical for cell growth. These include lipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic genes, and protein synthesis. The genetic data indicate that optimal strain fitness requires a balance between phospholipid synthesis and protein synthesis and that deletion of SCS3 and YFT2 impacts a regulatory mechanism that coordinates these processes. Part of this mechanism involves a role for SCS3 in communicating changes in the ER (e.g. due to low inositol) to Opi1-regulated transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. We conclude that SCS3 and YFT2 are required for normal ER membrane biosynthesis in response to perturbations in lipid metabolism and ER stress. © 2012 Moir et al.",,"cadmium chloride; cerulenin; fat droplet; fat storage inducing transmembrane protein 1; fat storage inducing transmembrane protein 2; fenpropimorph; inositol phosphate; membrane protein; messenger RNA; paromomycin; phosphatidylinositol; phospholipase C; phospholipase Isc1; protein IRE1; unclassified drug; FIT2 protein, human; inositol; membrane protein; phospholipid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; Scs3 protein, S cerevisiae; article; auxotrophy; biosynthesis; cell migration; cell strain HEK293; chemosensitivity; controlled study; disease association; embryo; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fat storage inducing transmembrane protein 1 gene; fat storage inducing transmembrane protein 2 gene; gene; gene deletion; gene expression; gene function; gene interaction; genetic analysis; genetic complementation; genetic transcription; HAC1 gene; human; human cell; INO1 gene; intracellular signaling; IRE1 gene; lipid metabolism; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; phospholipid synthesis; phylogeny; protein localization; protein synthesis; regulatory mechanism; SCS3 gene; unfolded protein response; YFT2 gene; animal; cytology; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene regulatory network; genetics; metabolism; physiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; unfolded protein response; Eukaryota; Fungi; Mammalia; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomycotina; Animals; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Gene Deletion; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Inositol; Lipid Metabolism; Membrane Proteins; Phospholipids; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Unfolded Protein Response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866182918

Dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) serve as the photoelectric conversion system and a copper (Cu) heat-transfer nanofilm coating on both sides of the thermoelectric generator (TEG) acts as a thermoelectric conversion system. Thus module assembly absorbs light and generates electricity by DSSCs, and also recycles waste heat and generates power by the TEG. In addition, a set of pulsating heat pipes (PHP) filled with Cu nanofluid is placed on the cooling side to increase cooling effects and enhance the power generation efficiency. Results show that when the heat source of thermoelectric modules reaches 90 °C, TEG power output is increased by 85.7%. Besides, after thermoelectric modules are heated by additional heat source at 80 °C, the electrical energy generated by them can let a NiMH cell (1.25 V) be sufficiently charged in about 30 minutes. When photothermoelectric modules is illumined by simulated light, the temperature difference of two sides of TEG can reach 7 °C and the thermoelectric conversion efficiency is 2.17%. Furthermore, the power output of the thermoelectric modules is 11.48 mW/cm2, enhancing 1.4 % compared to merely using DSSCs module.

Influence of pre-treatment on the colour property was studied as well by blanching the sample at three levels of temperature (50-70 °C). Total colour change ({increment}E*) was used to assess the colour degradation kinetics and quantify the degree of browning during processing and storage. It was found that the dried pre-treated sample under heat pump isothermal drying recorded the highest {increment}E* value during storage followed by non-pre-treated samples under heat pump intermittent drying, freeze-drying, hot air-drying and heat pump isothermal drying. Weibull model is found to better fit the experimental data as compared with zero-order and first-order kinetics models.

This compound is influenced by temperature, ethylene and 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatment. It was believed that ethylene application at chilling temperature could help increase the amount of lycopene content of tomato fruits. In addition, application of 1-MCP was assumed to reduce the action of ethylene on production of lycopene content and decrease loss of firmness of tomato fruit under chilling temperature. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to see the effect of ethylene and 1-MCP treatment on color and firmness of tomato fruit under different storage temperatures. A tomato variety (cv. Rotarno) grown under greenhouse condition harvested at red and breaker stage was stored at 4, 8 and 20°C to assess color and firmness. Tomato fruits were treated by ethylene (85.7 ppm) and 1-MCP (2.9 ppm) gases starting from the first day of storage throughout the experimentation period. The color and firmness of the fruits were measured by pigment analyzer and Zwick respectively. Results showed that there was significant difference in color value of ethylene treated breaker stage tomato. 1-MCP treatment reduced the color value of tomato fruits stored at 20°C more than the fruits stored at 4 and 8°C. However, 1-MCP treatment helped to reduce loss of firmness of the fruits. We conclude that external ethylene application on red tomato fruits stored at chilling temperature generally has no effect on the subsequent accumulation of lycopene or to maintain the loss of accumulated lycopene during chilling storage. However, external ethylene treatment on breaker stage tomatoes helps for red color development. In addition, 1-MCP treatment helps to reduce loss of firmness of the fruits. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.","1-MCP; Antioxidant; Lycopene; Ripening; Storage; Tomato","1-MCP; Antioxidant; Lycopenes; Ripening; Tomato; Color; Energy storage; Ethylene; Experiments; Plants (botany); Fruits; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864372250

Here, we consider the effects of nano-size on the kinetics and thermodynamics and study its bearing on the lithium storage performance in insertion and conversion based Li storage mechanism. Firstly, we investigate the storage performance of nanocrystalline LiMnPO 4 by insertion reaction. Ball milling of LiMnPO 4 synthesized by soft-template method with carbonaceous materials helps to reduce the grain size as well as formation of a thin layer of carbon coating. Nanostructuring by ball milling process promotes high surface area of the active electrode material for improved electrolyte wetting, short transport length for Li diffusion while the carbon coatings facilitates electronic wiring all of which contribute to the enhanced storage performance. Additionally, we show that combining nanostructuring with divalent cation doping further improves the storage performance of the system which make them potential high voltage cathodes for real applications. Secondly, we discuss the size effect on thermodynamics during the conversion reaction, considering Fe 2O 3 as an example. The process of Li storage by conversion induces drastic size reduction, leading to stabilization of metastable phase of γ-Fe 2O 3. We show here that apart from kinetics, thermodynamics at nanosize also limit the rate of conversion reaction. Finally, we show that Fe 2O 3 can be a potential anode material for practical applications as they demonstrate a high degree of reversibility ∼90% and excellent high rate performance. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","α-Fe 2O 3; γ-Fe 2O 3; conversion reaction; high coulombic efficiency; high rate performance; insertion reaction; kinetics; LiMn 0.9Fe 0.05Mg 0.05PO 4; LiMn 0.9Fe 0.1PO 4; LiMnPO 4; Size effect; thermodynamics","Conversion reactions; Coulombic efficiency; High-rate performance; Insertion reactions; LiMn 0.9Fe 0.05Mg 0.05PO 4; LiMn 0.9Fe 0.1PO 4; LiMnPO 4; Size effects; Anodes; Ball milling; Carbon; Cathodes; Diffusion coatings; Energy harvesting; Enzyme kinetics; Kinetics; Lithium; Metastable phases; Reaction kinetics; Size determination; Thermodynamics; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864331712

This study assesses whether different HF diets differentially affect striatal dopamine D2/3 receptor (DRD2/3) availability, as decreased striatal DRD2/3 availability has been implicated in obesity in relation to reward deficiency for food. Thirty rats were randomized to either a free-choice HF diet (HF-choice), a premixed HF diet (HF-no-choice), or a standard chow diet for 28 days. Striatal DRD2/3 was measured using 123 I-IBZM storage phosphor imaging at day 29. DRD2/3 availability was significantly decreased in the dorsal striatum in the HF-choice rats compared to chow rats, but not in HF-no-choice rats. Additionally, caloric intake of the HF-choice rats was significantly higher than that of HF-no-choice rats and serum leptin and percentage abdominal fat store weight of total body weight were significantly higher in the HF-choice rats compared to chow rats. These preliminary results suggest that the choice element in HF diets, which is possibly related to the motivational aspects of eating, leads to overconsumption and to a distinct state of obesity.

However, the state-of-charge (SoC) estimation of the energy storage component (e.g. rechargeable battery) influences the decisions of the power-aware software. A measurement error may cause wrong decisions which would reduce the lifetime of the network. This work presents the simulation results of the impact of an SoC measurement error on the network lifetime running a simple and an enhanced power-aware WSN application. A simulation environment written in SystemC-AMS is used, which enables the combined simulation of the sensor node's application software and its hardware.

Twenty-four elite male athletes (28.0 ± 1.2 years) were randomized to receive CHO (maltodextrin solution) or zero energy placebo solution (control group). The high-intensity running protocol consisted of 10 × 800 m at 100% of the best 3000-m speed (Vm3 km) and 2 × 1000 m maximal bouts in the morning and a submaximal 10-km continuous easy running in the afternoon of day 9. IMCL concentrations were assessed by 1H-MRS before (-day 9) and after training (day 9) in soleus (SO) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Blood hormones were also measured before, during, and post-exercise. The percent change (Δ%) in TA-IMCL was higher in the CHO group (47.9 ± 24.5 IMCL/Cr) than in the control group (-1.7 ± 13.1, respectively) (P =.04). Insulin concentrations were higher in the CHO group post-intermittent running compared to control (P =.02). Circulating levels of free fatty acids and GH were lower in the CHO group (P &gt;.01). The decline in performance in the 2nd 1000-m bout was also attenuated in this group compared to control (P &lt;.001 and P =.0035, respectively). The hormonal milieu (higher insulin and lower GH levels) in the CHO group, together with unchanged free fatty acid levels, probably contributed to the increased IMCL stores. This greater energy storage capacity may have improved post-exercise recovery and thus prevented performance deterioration. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The trapping energy can be obtained from the data retention characteristic for different absolute temperature (T). The discharging time (τ) was extracted from a linear fitting curve of the data retention characteristic. From the relationship between ln(1/τT 2) and 1/kT, the trapping energy was evaluated. Based on the retention properties, the discharge mechanisms of electrons in shallow and deep traps are correlated to the charge loss time. The observed values of the trapping energy demonstrated that deep traps are passivated by hydrogen species after FGA treatment; the difference of programming and erasing (P/E) speed of the memories between the samples with- and without-FGA treatment can be explained by this passivation process. A band diagram is proposed to explain the behavior of the charge loss mechanism.

This is possible due to their reverse biased gated p-i-n diode configuration (Figs. 1a, 1b), which allows at the same time a negligible reverse saturation current when OFF and a conduction mechanism based on band-to-band tunneling of carriers when ON. In order to overcome the intrinsic limitations of TFETs, several architectures have been explored, aiming to enhance conduction by aligning the tunneling direction to the gate electric field. Among them, a promising concept has been recently proposed, called the Electron-Hole Bilayer TFET (EHBTFET), exploiting carrier tunneling through a bias-induced electron-hole bilayer. In this work, we show that through appropriate optimization of the Ge EHBTFET it is possible to achieve superior static characteristics for low supply voltage applications, when compared to a double-gate Ge MOSFET with similar geometry. The EHBTFET outperforms the MOSFET if we compare their transfer characteristics, providing an average sub-threshold slope (from 0 to |Vdd| = 0.25 V) of 30 mV/dec against 60 mV/dec and Ion/Ioff ratio of 10 8 against 10 4, at same |Ion| 0.18 A/m. Considering Id-Vd plots, the EHBTFET has been optimized to linearize the quasi-exponential current increase generally observed in TFETs at low |Vd|, with remarkable results. At the same time, it shows very high output resistances at high |Vd|, whereas the MOSFET is highly affected by channel length modulation, due to short channel effects. Taking advantage of the high symmetry of p- and n- type transistor characteristics, complementary EHBTFET and MOSFET inverters have been simulated using the same width for pull-up and pull-down transistors Wn = Wp = 1 m. Voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of the two inverters show that the EHBTFET exhibits higher robustness with Vdd scaling down to 0.25 V, where the MOSFET has the opposite trend. Moreover, larger noise margins (NML = 131 mV, NMH = 110 mV)and doubled inverter gain (|g| = 90.13) suggest a great potential for low-voltage EHBTFET SRAM cells. The dynamic behavior of the devices is investigated by simulating the transient response of a three-stage inverter chain and ring oscillator. This study is of major importance, considering the well-known increase of the total device capacitance that TFETs have, compared to MOSFETs. As expected, time plots confirm that this increase in capacitance doubles the input-to-output voltage delay of EHBTFET inverters with respect to MOSFET , resulting in cumulative propagation delays for larger number of stages. In addition, the EHBTFET switching current has larger decay time, but is more than 4 decades lower than in MOSFET after complete switching: this allows targeting the EHBTFET as a more suitable power-saving device than MOSFET at low supply voltage and low operating frequency. In deeper analysis, ring oscillator simulations allowed the extraction of the inverter maximum frequency of operation (f): at Vdd = 0.25 V the EHBTFET is still slower than MOSFET, with 14 MHz vs. 41 MHz. The larger delay (T = 1/f) at low Vdd increases the energy delay product (EDP) of the devices, and is higher for the EHBTFET due to the increased capacitance. However, the EHBTFET is more robust for Vdd scaling. Finally, with a logic activity factor = 0.01, we compared the energy efficiency of the two devices for several supply voltages: at low Vdd, the EHBTFET is more promising in terms of energy-saving than the MOSFET, as it keeps the leakage component far from approaching the dynamic part of the total switching energy. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Activity factor; Band to band tunneling; Carrier tunneling; Channel length modulation; Conduction Mechanism; Current increase; Decay time; Device capacitance; Double-gate; Dynamic behaviors; Electron-hole bilayers; Energy delay product; Gated p-i-n diode; Ge MOSFET; High output; High symmetry; Leakage components; Low supply voltages; Low-leakage current; Low-voltage; Maximum frequency; MOS-FET; MOSFETs; Noise margins; Operating frequency; Power-saving; Propagation delays; Reverse-saturation currents; Ring oscillator; Scaling down; Short-channel effect; SRAM Cell; Static and dynamic behaviors; Static characteristic; Subthreshold; Supply voltages; Switching currents; Switching energy; Transfer characteristics; Transistor characteristics; Tunnel FET; Voltage delay; Voltage transfer; Capacitance; Electric fields; Electric resistance; Energy efficiency; Germanium; Leakage currents; Optimization; Static random access storage; Switching; Threshold voltage; MOSFET devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864235746

However, the long group delay and the high computational complexity limit the usage in hearing aids. A Quasi-ANSI S1.11 18-band 1/3-octave filter bank is proposed to reduce the group delay. With the matching error reduction method, the results show that the filter bank achieve comparable good matching between prescriptions and hearing aid response. The overall group delay is significantly reduced to 10ms compared to 78ms in the ANSI 1/3-octave filter bank design. Finally, the IFIR technique is adopted to minimize the computational complexity. For an 18-band digital hearing aid with 24 KHz sampling rate, the proposed architecture saves about 93% of multiplications and up to 74% of storage elements, comparing that with a parallel FIRs architecture. The test chip has been implemented in UMC 90 nm high-Vt CMOS technology, which consumes only 73 W. By voltage scaling, the circuit-level simulation result exhibits that the power consumption of the test chip reduces to 27 W, which is about 30% of that of the most energy-efficient design for digital hearing aids available in the literature. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Acoustic application; Circuit-level simulation; CMOS technology; Digital hearing aids; Energy-efficient design; Filter bank design; Hearing aid; Human hearing; Long group delays; Matching error; Proposed architectures; Sampling rates; Storage elements; Test chips; Voltage-scaling; Audition; CMOS integrated circuits; Computational complexity; Group delay; Hearing aids; Filter banks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864065369

The mixture was characterized in terms of its rheological behavior, and a difference was observed between ultrasonicated and nonultrasonicated mixtures. All the dispersions exhibited shear thinning behavior. Ultrasonication helped to minimize the aggregation of nanotubes in the dispersion.

Alternatively, a low fat oxidation rate may stimulate glucose oxidation, thereby enhancing glucose disposal. Here, we investigated whether an ethyl-2-[6-(4- chlorophenoxy)hexyl]-oxirane-2- carboxylate (etomoxir)-induced inhibition of fat oxidation leads to muscle fat storage and insulin resistance. An intervention in healthy male subjects was combined with studies in human primary myotubes. Furthermore, muscle DAG and triacylglycerol (TAG), mitochondrial function, and insulin signaling were examined in etomoxir-treated C57bl6 mice. In humans, etomoxir administration increased glucose oxidation at the expense of fat oxidation. This effect was accompanied by an increased abundance of GLUT4 at the sarcolemma and a lowering of plasma glucose levels, indicative of improved glucose homeostasis. In mice, etomoxir injections resulted in accumulation of muscle TAG and DAG, yet improved insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Also in human myotubes, insulin signaling was improved by etomoxir, in the presence of increased intramyocellular lipid accumulation. These insulin-sensitizing effects in mice and human myotubes were accompanied by increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our results show that a reduction in fat oxidation leading to accumulation of muscle DAG does not necessarily lead to insulin resistance, as the reduction in fat oxidation may activate AMPK.",,"carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; carnitine; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; diacylglycerol; etomoxir; glucose; glucose transporter 4; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; placebo; protein kinase B; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; article; cell function; controlled study; energy expenditure; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose oxidation; human; human tissue; in vivo study; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; male; mitochondrial respiration; muscle biopsy; myotube; nonhuman; normal human; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein content; protein localization; sarcolemma; sarcoplasm; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Blotting, Western; Diglycerides; Epoxy Compounds; Fatty Acids; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mitochondria; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Sarcolemma; Triglycerides; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863944529

To address these environmental issues and their related costs manure processing technologies were developed. The objective here was to assess the environmental consequences of a new manure processing technology that separates manure into a solid and liquid fraction and de-waters the liquid fraction by means of reverse osmosis. This results in a liquid mineral concentrate used as mineral nitrogen and potassium fertilizer and a solid fraction used for bio-energy production or as phosphorus fertilizer. Five environmental impact categories were quantified using life cycle assessment: climate change (CC), terrestrial acidification (TA), marine eutrophication (ME), particulate matter formation (PMF), and fossil fuel depletion (FFD). For pig as well as dairy cattle manure, we compared a scenario with the processing method and a scenario with additional anaerobic digestion of the solid fraction to a reference situation applying only liquid manure. Comparisons were based on a functional unit of 1 ton liquid manure. System boundaries were set from the manure storage under the animal house to the field application of all end products. Scenarios with only manure processing increased the environmental impact for most impact categories compared to the reference: ME did not change, whereas, TA and PMF increased up to 44% as a result of NH 3 and NO x emissions from processing and storage of solid fraction. Including digestion reduced CC by 117% for pig manure and 104% for dairy cattle manure, mainly because of substituted electricity and avoided N 2O emission from storage of solid fraction. FFD decreased by 59% for pig manure and increased 19% for dairy cattle manure. TA and PMF remained higher compared to the reference. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH 4 emission from manure storage, NH 3 emission from processing, and the replaced nitrogen fertilizer by the mineral concentrate were important parameters affecting final results. It was concluded that processing fattening pig and dairy cattle manure to produce mineral fertilizer increased overall environmental consequences in terms of CC (except for dairy cattle manure), TA, PMF, and FFD compared to current agricultural practice. Adding the production of bio-energy reduced CC and FFD. Only when NH 3 emission from processing was low and bio-energy was produced, overall equal or better environmental performance was obtained for TA and PMF. It was emphasized that real time measurements should be done to enhance the environmental assessment of manure processing technologies. Results of this study present the full environmental consequences of manure processing and key parameters affecting the environmental impact of manure management.

They are composed of an A1 region that synthesizes ATP and an integral part AO that conducts ions. Subunit E is a component of the peripheral stalk that links the A1 with the AO part of the A-ATP synthase. We have determined the crystal structure of the entire subunit E (PhE) of the Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 A-ATP synthase at 3.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals an extended S-shaped N-terminal α-helix with 112.29 Å in length, followed by a globular head group. The S-shaped feature, common in elastic connectors and spacers, would facilitate the storage of transient elastic energy during rotary motion in the enzyme. The structure has been superimposed into the asymmetric peripheral stalks of the three-dimensional reconstruction of the Pyrococcus furiosus enzyme, revealing that the S-shaped subunit PhE fits well into the bent peripheral stalk, whereas the previously solved E subunit structure (3.1 Å resolution) of Thermus thermophilus A-ATP synthase is well accommodated in the density of the straight stator domain.

If employed speculatively with real-time memory controllers, power-down mechanisms could impact both the guaranteed bandwidth and the memory latency bounds. This calls for power-down strategies that can hide or bound the performance loss, making run-time memory power-down feasible for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose two such strategies that reduce memory energy consumption and yet guarantee realtime memory performance. One provides significant energy savings without impacting the guaranteed bandwidth and latency bounds.

The resonances due to 2s-2p (△n = 0) core excitations are detected in the center-of-mass energy range of 0-15eV. The experimental results are compared with intermediate coupling AUTOSTRUCTURE calculations. Plasma rate coefficients are obtained from the DR spectrum by convoluting it with a Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution for temperatures in the range of 103-106K. The derived temperature-dependent plasma recombination rate coefficients are presented graphically and parameterized by using a fit formula for convenient use in plasma modeling codes. The experimental rate coefficients are also compared with the theoretical data available in literature. In the temperature range of 103-2 × 104 K, our experimental results show that previous calculations severely underestimate the plasma rate coefficients and also our AUTOSTRUCTURE calculation does not reproduce the experimental plasma rate coefficients well. Above 2 × 104K, the agreement between the experimental and theoretical rate coefficients is much better, and the deviations are smaller than the estimated uncertainties. © 2012.

Embedded systems with predetermined applications can achieve further improvement with the addition of fast and energy efficient scratchpad memory (SPM) on chip and moving frequent accesses code and/or data from main memory to SPM. While many researchers have attempted to either streamline cache accesses or improve the effectiveness of SPM, few studies focus on exploring their joint synergy. This study proposes integer linear programming (ILP) models that include both code repositioning and SPM code selection to identify the optimal code layout and reduce energy consumption in embedded systems with a cache and SPM. This study also proposes a two-stage metaheuristic algorithm. Experimental results reveal that 1) allocating a dedicated portion of the on-chip SRAM to the SPM is not always better than using a cache-only configuration and 2) it is not trivial to select code objects for the SPM. As much as 55 percent additional energy can be saved by applying both code repositioning and SPM code selection techniques. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Code layout; embedded systems; energy consumption; scratchpad memory","Cache access; Cache behavior; Code layout; Code selection; Energy efficient; Integer linear programming models; Main memory; Meta heuristic algorithm; Off-chip memories; On chips; Optimal codes; Scratch pad memory; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Static random access storage; Optimal systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863484218

However, the motorcycles' emissions are the main moving air pollution sources. Therefore, it's important to develop more efficient combustion technology in order to save energy and reduce air pollution. In this paper, a novel technology of hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel is developed. Hydrogen gas is released from solid state hydrogen storage tank and then mixed with the incoming gasoline. The intake valve in manifold sucks the hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel into the cylinder for combustion. A series of performance test is conducted by motorcycle chassis dynamometers. The results reveal that this technology can increase the power and torque, and decrease fuel consumption per kilo-power due to promote combustion efficiency. In addition, the hydrogen has greater heat value, so the oil temperature and sparkplug temperature increase. This technique can reduce CO and HC, but increase CO2 and NOx. The engine performance is improved at rarefied hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel. Therefore, the engine performance with M.J. #98 is better than that with M.J. #110. This technique can achieve energy saving and environment-friendly purpose.

Three driving cycles, the NEDC for Low Power vehicles, CSC and JE05 cycle, define the driving requirements for the vehicle. The Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is used for determining the control setpoint for the fuel cell and battery system. It closely approximates the global minimum in fuel consumption, set by Dynamic Programming (DP). Using DP the sizing problem can be solved but ECMS can also be implemented real-time. For the considered vehicle and hardware, all three driving cycles result in optimal sizes for the fuel cell stack of approximately three times the average drive power demand. This demonstrates that sizing the fuel cell stack the average or maximum power demand is not necessarily optimal with respect to a minimum fuel consumption. The battery is sized to deliver the difference between specified stack power and the peak power in the total power demand. The sizing of the battery is dominated by its power handling capabilities. Therefore, a higher maximum C-rate leads to a lower battery weight which in turn leads to a lower hydrogen consumption. The energy storage capacity of the battery only becomes an issue for C-rates over 30. Compared to a Range Extender (RE) configuration, where the stack size is comparable to the average power demand and the stack is operated on a constant power level, optimal stack and battery sizes with ECMS as Energy Management Strategy significantly reduce the fuel consumption. Compared to a RE strategy, ECMS makes much better use of the combined power available from the fuel cell stack and the battery, resulting in a lower fuel consumption but also enabling a lower battery weight which consequently leads to improved payload capabilities.© 2012 IFP Energies nouvelles.",,"Average power; Battery size; Battery systems; Constant power; Drive power; Driving cycle; Energy management strategies; Energy storage capacity; Fuel cell stack; Global minima; Hydrogen consumption; Low Power; Maximum power; Optimal size; Payload capabilities; Peak power; Power-handling capability; Total power; Energy management; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Optimization; Trucks; Vehicles; Piles; alternative energy; hydrogen; road transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868246213

This facility comprises an ion source of the electron-string type, a 3-MeV/u linear accelerator, a 600-MeV/u superconducting booster synchrotron (Booster), a Nuclotron (upgraded superconducting synchrotron with a maximum energy of 4. 5 GeV/u for ions with the charge-to-mass ratio Z/A = 1/3), and a collider consisting of two vertically separated superconducting rings with an average luminosity of 10 27 cm -2 s -1 in an energy range over 3. 0 GeV/u. Beam cooling is supposed to be used in two NICA elements, the Booster, and the collider rings. The Booster is intended for the storage of 197Au 31+ ions to an intensity of about 4 × 10 9 particles; their acceleration to the energy 600 MeV/u, which is sufficient for the complete stripping of nuclei (an increase in the injection energy and the charge state of ions makes the requirements for vacuum conditions in the Nuclotron less stringent); and the formation of the necessary beam emittance using the electron cooling system.

However, as the operation capacity of modern wind farms become comparable with the existed power plants, the fluctuation output of a large wind farm brings many integration challenges as the penetration level increase. For a smoother output of a large wind farm into the utility grids, a variety of energy storage or conversion strategies are proposed. Although these proposals seem to be helpful to smooth out the fluctuating output of the wind farms, all these strategies always need to rely on not only the complicated computations but also those unsure estimation methods to achieve the power compensation works. In this paper, the Adaptive Continuously Variable Transmission (ACVT) adopting to the individual wind turbine for fixed-speed control is proposed. For the ACVT, regarded as a fluctuation filter, can adapt the driving speed transmitted from wind mill to a fixed-speed. Consequently, the output voltage of the individual wind turbine can maintain in stability. The main features of the proposal are confirmed by means of numerical simulations. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

This study uses radio frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) combined with temperature and humidity sensors (T/H sensors) for the design of a smart temperature and humidity information material (STHIM) that automatically, regularly, and continuously converts temperature and humidity signals within concrete and transmits them by radio frequency (RF) to the Building Physiology Information System (BPIS).

It is found that for an excitation of 50 mW, the PL quenching for (100) and (311)A QWs occurs at 220 K and 300 K, respectively. This suggests that the high index plane (311)A has superior structural properties and less non-radiative defect centers than the conventional (100) plane. The better optical quality of the QWs grown on (311)A is also confirmed by the narrowing of the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the PL emission: 10 nm for (311)A and 20 nm for (100). From these findings it is expected that optical devices grown on (311)A GaAs planes should have better performances than those grown on conventional (100) orientation. We have also carried out a systematic study to investigate the effect of post-growth thermal annealing on the optical quality of the QWs. We observed a substantial improvement of the PL efficiency with annealing temperatures in the range 500-700 °C for all samples. However, this PL enhancement is accompanied by a blueshift. These energy shifts can be explained by interdiffusion or intermixing of In and Ga atoms at the interfaces between the QWs and the barriers. A noticeable narrowing of the PL linewidth with higher annealing temperatures could be explained by a homogenisation of the quantum well interfaces. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present research, we used structural equation modeling to examine an extensive causal model of the role of convictions and trust for the public's protest potential against carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) among a large sample of the general population (N = 769). Trust, convictions, perceived benefits, and risks were included in the model. Our model fitted the data well. Convictions regarding emission reduction, decentralization of energy production, and tampering with natural structures in the deep subsurface influenced the perception of benefits and risks. Trust, in contrast, was barely influential. Perceived benefits were more prominent for public protest potential than perceived risks. However, perceived benefits did not dominate perceived risks as much as earlier studies found for acceptance. We argue that trust can become fully effective as a determinant of perceived risks and benefits only when the public perceives the distinct positioning of the stakeholders involved. Until then, laypeople are likely to draw on their own convictions and intuitive mental concepts for making decisions about accepting a new technology or protesting it. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","benefit perception; CCS; convictions; protest potential; risk perception; trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863851416

BPR697, a peripheral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonist, elevated fat oxidation without added energy expenditure. Its impact on food intake, body weight changes and metabolic alterations were examined in rats fed standard chow and in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice.Materials and methods:CB1 agonist-induced hypothermia and analgesia responses were measured to examine the brain activity of BPR697. The acute effects of BPR697 on food intake, body weight change and post-absorptive metabolic profiles were investigated in rats. Energy utilization with BPR697 was examined by indirect calorimetry. Chronic treatment of DIO mice was used to evaluate the long-term effects of BPR697. Results: Distribution of BPR697 was significantly biased in favor of the periphery instead of the brain, as shown by its low brain/plasma concentration ratio and confirmed by the negative response of BPR697 in CB1 agonist-induced hypothermia and analgesia. When administered to rats at 20 mg kg-1, BPR697 showed a unique spectrum of effects with significant weight loss without altered food intake. Furthermore, BPR697 increased serum levels of free fatty acids and ketone bodies and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation with preservation of liver glycogen in postprandial rats. Indirect calorimetric profiling of BPR697 revealed a similar trend, shifting whole-body energy catabolism toward fat oxidation, but without elevated energy expenditure. In DIO mice with chronic treatment, animals treated with BPR697 at 20 mg kg-1 resisted weight gain and showed a reduction of high-fat-induced cardiometabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, abdominal fat and liver steatosis. Conclusion: The induction of fatty acid oxidation without concomitant elevation of energy expenditure by the peripheral CB1 antagonist BPR697 is sufficient to cause substantial weight loss in chow-fed rats. In the presence of high-dietary fat intake, BPR697 resists weight gain and alleviates obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","body weight; cardiometabolic risk factors; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; peripheral CB1 antagonist","4 (1,1 dimethylheptyl) 1',2',3',4',5',6' hexahydro 2,3' dihydroxy 6' (3 hydroxypropyl)biphenyl; bpr697; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; fatty acid; glycerol; insulin; ketone body; rimonabant; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; abdominal fat; analgesia; animal experiment; animal model; article; brain function; calorimetry; cardiometabolic risk; catabolism; controlled study; drug blood level; drug brain level; drug distribution; drug effect; energy consumption; energy expenditure; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; food intake; glycerol blood level; glycogen liver level; hyperglycemia; hypothermia; insulin blood level; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; postprandial state; priority journal; rat; risk reduction; triacylglycerol blood level; weight change; weight gain; weight reduction; Animals; Blood Glucose; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Fatty Liver; Hypothermia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Pyrazoles; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Thiophenes; Weight Gain; Animalia; Mus; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863720667

In vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the tibialis anterior of ATGL -/- mice revealed that its intramyocellular lipid pool is approximately sixfold higher than in WT controls (P = 0.0007). In skeletal muscle of ATGL -/- mice, glycogen content was decreased by 30% (P &lt; 0.05). In vivo 31P magnetic resonance spectra of resting muscles showed that WT and ATGL -/- mice have a similar energy status: [PCr], [Pi], PCr/ATP ratio, PCr/Pi ratio, and intracellular pH. Electrostimulated muscles from WT and ATGL -/- mice showed the same PCr depletion and pH reduction. Moreover, the monoexponential fitting of the PCr recovery curve yielded similar PCr recovery times (τPCr; 54.1 ± 6.1 s for the ATGL -/- and 58.1 ± 5.8 s for the WT), which means that overall muscular mitochondrial oxidative capacity was comparable between the genotypes. Despite similar in vivo mitochondrial oxidative capacities, the electrostimulated muscles from ATGL -/- mice displayed significantly lower force production and increased muscle relaxation time than the WT. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than mitochondrial dysfunction cause the impaired muscle performance of ATGL -/- mice.","31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Exercise","glucose; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; controlled study; electron microscopy; electrostimulation; enzyme deficiency; gastrocnemius muscle; genotype; glucose blood level; in vivo study; lipid blood level; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; mouse; muscle cell; muscle excitation; muscle function; muscle mitochondrion; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein depletion; skeletal muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; Animals; Cytoplasmic Granules; Electric Stimulation; Electrodes, Implanted; Hindlimb; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Relaxation; Muscle Tonus; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidative Phosphorylation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863636368

Although gut microbiota are known to contribute to hepatic lipogenesis and fat storage, little is known about how the condition influences the deposition of glycogen in the liver. To better understand and characterize the host energy metabolism in guts lacking microbiota, we compared the liver metabolome of specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with partial least-squares discriminant analysis. We identified 30 of 52 highly reproducible peaks in chromatograms of liver tissue extracts from the two groups of mice. The two groups showed significant differences in metabolic profile. Changes in liver metabolism involved metabolites such as amino acids, fatty acids, organic acids and carbohydrates. The metabolic profile of germ-free mice suggests that they synthesize glycogen and accumulate it in the liver through gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis. Our findings shed light on a new perspective of the role of gut microbiota in energy metabolism and will be useful to help study probiotics, obesity and metabolic diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Glycogen; Metabolomics; Microbiota","2 amino 2 methylpropionic acid; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetic acid; alanine; aspartic acid; citric acid; creatinine; fructose; fumaric acid; gluconic acid; glucose; glutamic acid; glycerol; glycerophosphate; glycogen; hydroxybutyric acid; inositol; lactic acid; lauric acid; malic acid; nicotinamide; octanoic acid; phosphoric acid; serine; sorbitol; succinic acid; threonine; urea; valine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; discriminant analysis; energy metabolism; gluconeogenesis; glycogen synthesis; histology; intestine flora; liver metabolism; male; mass fragmentography; metabolome; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; partial least squares regression; Amino Acids; Animals; Carbohydrates; Discriminant Analysis; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gastrointestinal Tract; Germ-Free Life; Gluconeogenesis; Glycogen; Liver; Male; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Metagenome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862322604

As an alternative to expensive electro-chemical and mechanical storage options, the thermal energy demand in buildings offers a cost-effective option for intermittency-friendly electricity consumption patterns. Combining hot and cold thermal storages with new high-pressure compressor technology that allows for flexible and simultaneous production of useful heat and cooling, the paper introduces and investigates the high-efficiency thermal battery (TB) concept. In a proof-of-concept case study, the TB replaces an existing electric resistance heater used for hot water production and an electric compressor used for air refrigeration in a central air conditioning system. A mathematical model for least-cost unit dispatch is developed. Heat pump cycle components and thermal storages are designed and optimized. A general methodology is applied that allows for comparing the obtained results with other Smart Grid enabling options. It is found that the TB concept leads to improvements in the intermittency-friendliness of operation Rc (improves from -0.11 to 0.46), lower CO 2 emissions (reduced to zero), and lower operational costs (reduced by 72%). The results indicate that TB may be the most cost-effective Smart Grid enabling option for supporting higher penetration levels of intermittent renewables in the energy system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the contribution of these systems in Malaysia is still minor in comparison with their potential. Therefore, the feasibility and potentiality of employing ice thermal storage (ITS) systems for office building cooling applications is studied to investigate their economical and environmental benefits. The air conditioning systems in Malaysia are considered as the major energy consumers in office buildings with around 57% share. The economical analysis of the cost benefits is carried out for a system including chiller and storage system. The installation costs are mainly dominated by the total system capacity; hence the study was conducted for a range of 100-2000 tons of refrigeration (TR) (352-7034 kW) for two storage strategy of full storage and load levelling storage strategy. The results indicate that considering the special off-peak tariff rate of $0.06/kWh for the total system capacities of 500 and 1500 TR (1758 kW and 5275 kW), the annual cost saving varies from $230,000 to $700,000 and from $65,000 to $190,000 for full storage and load levelling storage strategy, respectively. The overall results show that the full storage strategy can reduce the annual costs of the air conditioning system by up to 35% while this reduction is limited to around 8% for a load levelling strategy. The comparison study reveals that for the full storage strategy the payback period varies between 3 and 6 years while the payback period for the load levelling strategy varies between 1 and 3 years. It was concluded that the ITS system can play a vital role in consuming the natural resources in a more efficient, economical and environmentally benign way by changing the electricity consumption pattern to overcome the disparity between energy generation and energy demand. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

DSC was applied to assess the kinetic parameters, such as kinetic model, frequency factor (ln k 0), activation energy (E a), reaction order, and heat of reaction (ΔH d). Comparisons of non-isothermal and isothermal-kinetic model simulation led to a beneficial kinetic model of thermal decomposition to predict the thermal hazard of DTBPH. Simulations of a 0.5 L Dewar vessel and 25 kg barrel commercial package in liquid thermal explosion models were performed and compared to the results in the literature. From the results, the optimal conditions for use of DTBPH to avoid violent runaway reactions during the storage and transportation were determined.

In the future, more flexible nuclear systems could enable wind to achieve a 50% share of the renewable contribution to the energy mix. Small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) could provide firming power generation to back-up the supply from renewable resources and follow-load. This study involves the hypothetical combination of an off-shore wind farm and a SMR, operated together as a virtual power plant (VPP). Results using wind data from the North Sea indicate that the combination results in 80% less wind power variation to the grid, effectively creating a virtual baseload power plant. This gain comes at the loss of 30% SMR capacity utilization. The research identified that the reduction of 1000MW off-shore wind farm variability was best achieved with 700MW SMRs using 100MW modules. In demand-following mode the VPP could maneuver output to improve synchronization with demand by 60-70% over a wind-only system. Power variability was indifferent to the SMR module size. The VPP could not reduce 100% of the wind variation, as additional balancing measures (e.g., smart grid, storage, and hybrid-nuclear systems) are still needed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Off-shore wind farm; Small medium reactor; Virtual power plant","Baseload power plant; Benefits and costs; Capacity utilization; Energy mix; European union; Low-carbon; Module size; North Sea; Nuclear systems; Off-shore; Power variability; Renewable resource; Small medium reactor; Smart grid; Source of energy; Virtual power plants; Wind data; Wind farm; Wind power variations; Wind variation; Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Power plants; Wind power; Small nuclear reactors; cost-benefit analysis; nuclear power; power generation; power plant; renewable resource; wind farm; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861221134

Composites were synthesized by chemical polymerization of pyrrole on dispersed fibers of cellulose from Cladophora algae and dispersed wood cellulosebased commercial filter papers, respectively, as well as on Cladophora cellulose and filter paper sheets. The resulting composites, which were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and elemental analysis, were found to exhibit specific charge capacities proportional to the PPy content of the composites. The highest specific capacity (i.e., 171 C/g composite or 274 C/g PPy) was obtained for composites made from dispersed Cladophora cellulose fibers. The higher specific capacities for the Cladophora cellulose composites can be explained by the fact that the Cladophora cellulose fibers were significantly thinner than the wood cellulose fibers. While the PPy was mainly situated on the surface of the Cladophora cellulose fibers, a significant part of the PPy was found to be present within the wood fibers of the filter paper-based composites. The latter can be ascribed to a higher accessibility of the aqueous pyrrole solution to the wood-based fibers as compared to the highly crystalline algae based cellulose fibers. The present results clearly show that the choice of the cellulose substrate is important when designing electrode materials for inexpensive, flexible and environmentally friendly paper-based energy storage devices. © 2012.

The performance of a power plant integrated with solar assisted post combustion CO 2 capture (SCC) is largely affected by the local climatic conditions, such as solar irradiation, sunshine hours and ambient temperature, the type of solar thermal collector and CO 2 recovery ratio. The feasibility evaluation results about such a power plant show that the cost of electricity (COE) and cost of CO 2 avoidance (COA) are mainly determined by the local climatic conditions. For the locations having higher solar irradiation, longer sunshine hours and higher ambient temperature, the power plant with SCC has lower COE and COA. COE and COA are sensitive to the prices of solar thermal collectors. In order to achieve lower COE and COA compared to the power plant integrated with non-solar assisted post combustion capture, the price of solar thermal collector has to be lower than 150USD/m 2 and 90USD/m 2 for the solar trough and vacuum tube, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Amine-based CO 2 capture; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Cost of CO 2 avoidance; Cost of electricity; Electrical efficiency penalty; Solar thermal energy","Amine-based CO 2 capture; Carbon capture and storage; Cost of electricity; Electrical efficiency; Solar thermal energy; Carbon capture; Combustion; Costs; Organic compounds; Power plants; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Temperature; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; electricity; power plant; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860688928

In total three key aspects were investigated in relation to PHES: its operation, size, and cost. From the results it was evident that PHES can increase the wind penetration feasible on the Irish energy system and also reduce its operating costs. However, under predicted 2020 fuel prices and a conventional 6% interest rate, these savings may not be sufficient since the savings are sensitive to changes in the PHES capacities used, fuel prices, interest rates, and the total annual wind energy produced. Finally, the optimum capacities of PHES identified for Ireland in 2020 were compared to two other alternatives which required the same investment: domestic heat pumps and district heating with CHP. These alternatives offer similar savings to PHES, but are not as sensitive to changes in fuel prices, interest rates, and wind power production. This outlines the importance of considering all sectors of an energy system when assessing future alternatives, as significant savings are feasible using existing technologies, especially by integrating the electricity and heat sectors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic optimisation; Energy storage; Pumped hydroelectric; Renewable energy; Technical optimisation; Wind power","Economic implications; Energy systems; Fuel prices; Heat pumps; Hydroelectric energy; Interest rates; Ireland; Optimisations; Optimum capacity; Pumped hydroelectric; Renewable energies; Wind penetration; Wind power production; Energy storage; Fuels; Operating costs; Optimization; Wind power; Investments; hydroelectric power; investment location; optimization; power generation; pump; renewable resource; spatiotemporal analysis; wind power; Ireland; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856552625

In addition to involvement in performance and degradation mechanisms, electromechanical effects underpin a broad spectrum of nanoscale imaging and spectroscopies including piezoresponse force and electrochemical strain microscopies. Traditionally, these studies are conducted under ambient conditions. However, applications related to imaging energy storage and electrophysiological phenomena require operation in a liquid phase and therefore the development of electromechanical probing techniques suitable to liquid environments. Due to the relative high conductivity of most liquids and liquid decomposition at low voltages, the transfer of characterization techniques from ambient to liquid is not straightforward. Here we present a detailed study of ferroelectric domain imaging and manipulation in thin film BiFeO 3 using piezoresponse force microscopy in liquid environments as model systems for electromechanical phenomena in general. We explore the use of contact resonance enhancement and the application of multifrequency excitation and detection principles to overcome the experimental problems introduced by a liquid environment.

H 2, being a clean, reliable, and affordable source, is finding ever increasing use in distributed electric power generation and H2 fuelled cars. Although still under 0.1%, the distributed use of H2 is the fastest growing area. In distributed H2 storage, distribution, and consumption, safety continues to be a critical aspect. Affordable safety systems for distributed H2 applications are critical for the H 2 economy to take hold. Advances in H2 sensors are driven by specificity, reliability, repeatability, stability, cost, size, response time, recovery time, operating temperature, humidity range, and power consumption. Ambient temperature sensors for H2 detection are increasingly being explored as they offer specificity, stability and robustness of high temperature sensors with lower operational costs and significantly longer operational lifetimes.

In view of the great variability among alcohol drinkers in patterns of drinking, amounts ingested, ingestion of other nutrients, metabolic characteristics, genetic factors, and lifestyle characteristics (such as exercise or smoking behavior), the effects of alcohol on nutritional status and disease risk are very heterogeneous. Alcohol -associated malnutrition includes both primary and secondary malnutrition. Because of the comparatively high energy content of alcohol, it displaces other energy sources and thus many essential nutrients in the diet, thereby lowering the intake of most nutrients (primary malnutrition). Gastrointestinal and metabolic complications of heavy alcohol intake (especially liver dysfunction) lead to so -called secondary malnutrition. Anorexia and vomiting from alcoholic gastritis further promote inadequate intakes of food. Malabsorption of nearly all nutrients can develop as a result of mucosal dysfunction, liver insufficiency, and pancreatic insufficiency. Alcoholic liver dysfunction causes a reduced capacity to transport nutrients in the blood, a reduced storage capacity, and an insufficient activation of nutrients such as vitamins. In addition, alcohol increases the excretion of nutrients in the urine and bile. In alcoholic patients, several mechanisms for the development of malnutrition usually occur simultaneously. The effect of alcohol on morbidity and mortality is biphasic, and the relationship is J -shaped: low levels of ingestion are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality risks, whereas abstinence and higher levels of ingestion are associated with a higher mortality risk due to different cancers, alcoholic liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke. The reduced mortality risk at lower intakes is explained by the risk of coronary artery disease and a reduced risk of ischemic stroke. The amount of alcohol ingestion at the nadir of mortality risk is not known and varies from study to study and from one individual to another. The hallmark of excessive alcohol intake is metabolic and structural alterations at the level of the liver, and liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of death in heavy drinkers. Often, both positive and negative effects occur. In view of the heterogeneity of responses for any given alcohol dose, the formulation of public health recommendations for safe consumption levels is becoming increasingly difficult. In any case, alcohol should not be recommended for health reasons or for health maintenance, especially as long as there are no specific, sensitive predictors for harmful alcohol use and abuse. In the setting of an overall healthy lifestyle with respect to nutrition and physical activity, light to moderate alcohol consumption may add to the quality of life; however, the benefits and risks are not equal for all. © 2012 International Life Sciences Institute.","Alcohol effects, on mineral and trace element metabolism; Alcohol metabolism, change in redox potential in liver; Alcohol on morbidity and mortality, biphasic, relationship J-shaped; Alcohol, its role in nutrition and health; Alcohol-associated endocrine pathologies; Alcohol-associated malnutrition, primary and secondary malnutrition; Alcohol-induced metabolic perturbations, alcohol dose and consumption duration; Alcoholic beverages in daily life, absolute priority in metabolism; Excessive alcohol intake, metabolic and structural alterations, and liver cirrhosis; Metabolic and functional abnormalities, due to alcohol consumption",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886963270

We evaluated the effect of body fat distribution on direct FFA storage in women with different obesity pheno-types. Twenty-eight women [10 upper body overweight/obese (UBO; WHR &gt;0.85, BMI &gt;28 kg/m 2), 11 lower body overweight/obese (LBO; WHR &lt;0.80, BMI &gt;28 kg/m 2), and 7 lean (BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2)] received an intravenous bolus dose of [9,10- 3H]palmitate- and [1- 14C]triolein-labeled VLDL tracer followed by upper body subcutaneous (UBSQ) and lower body subcutaneous (LBSQ) fat biopsies. Regional fat mass was assessed by combining DEXA and CT scanning. We report greater fractional storage of FFA in UBSQ fat in UBO women compared with lean women (P &lt; 0.01). The LBO women had greater storage per 10 6 fat cells in LBSQ adipocytes compared with UBSQ adipocytes (P = 0.04), whereas the other groups had comparable storage in UBSQ and LBSQ adipocytes. Fractional FFA storage was significantly associated with fractional VLDL-TG storage in both UBSQ (P &lt; 0.01) and LBSQ (P = 0.03) adipose tissue. In conclusion, UBO women store a greater proportion of FFA in the UBSQ depot compared with lean women. In addition, LBO women store FFA more efficiently in LBSQ fat cells compared with UBSQ fat cells, which may play a role in development of their LBO phenotype. Finally, direct FFA storage and VLDL-TG fatty acid storage are correlated, indicating they may share a common rate-limiting pathway for fatty acid storage in adipose tissue. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.","Free fatty acid; Free fatty acid storage; Obesity; Very-low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride","1 triolein c 14; tracer; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein; adipocyte; adult; article; body fat; body fat distribution; body mass; body weight; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; human cell; human tissue; isotope labeling; lean body weight; lipid storage; lower body obesity; lower body subcutaneous fat; obesity; priority journal; upper body besity; upper body subcutaneous fat; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adipocytes; Adult; Body Composition; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Humans; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Obesity; Overweight; Palmitates; Subcutaneous Fat; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Triglycerides; Waist-Hip Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862552326

In this study, both differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) were used to characterize the thermally incompatible hazards and adiabatic runaway features of aqueous TBHP with various acids and alkalis. From the thermal analysis experiments, we integrated the enthalpy of energy-rich aqueous TBHP reacting with acids and alkalis to normalize various temperatures of the exothermic decomposition and heat production. Self-reactive ratings on incompatibly thermal hazards were characterized using various thermokinetic parameters of the adiabatic calorimetry method, such as the initial exothermic temperature (T 0), self-heating rate (dT/dt), pressure rise rate (dP/dt), and pressure-temperature profiles.

Our thermal electric system's total efficiency can reach 43% and power generation of thermoelectric modules is only 0.6%. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Combined solar thermal and electric system; Solar energy; Thermoelectric module","Electric power; Electric systems; Flow channels; Hot water; Hot water system; Miniature systems; Power generation systems; Solar electric systems; Solar thermal; Solar thermal systems; Solar tracking systems; Solar-radiation fluxes; Storage tank; Thermoelectric modules; Total efficiency; Water pump; Water tubes; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Equivalent circuits; Solar energy; Sun; Thermoelectricity; Solar heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861599497

Some specialized cells, such as guard cells and pulvini motor cells, exhibit rapid volume changes. These changes require the rapid release and uptake of ions and water by the vacuole and are a prerequisite for plant survival. Furthermore, seed vacuoles are important storage units for the nutrients required for early plant development. All of these fundamental processes rely on numerous vacuolar transporters. During the past 15 years, the transporters implicated in most aspects of vacuolar function have been identified and characterized. Vacuolar transporters appear to be integrated into a regulatory network that controls plant metabolism. However, little is known about the mode of action of these fundamental processes, and deciphering the underlying mechanisms remains a challenge for the future. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

It has been proposed to be a therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether á-lipoic acid (ALA) exerts a lipidlowering effect through regulation of SIRT1 activation and production in C2C12 myotubes. Methods ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) production, as well as intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation and fatty acid β-oxidation were analysed in the absence or presence of a SIRT1 inhibitor (nicotinamide), SIRT1 small interfering (si) RNA and an AMPK inhibitor (compound C) in C2C12 myotubes. Mice with streptozotocin/nicotinamideinduced diabetes and db/db mice fed on a high-fat diet were used to study the ALA-mediated lipid-lowering effects in vivo. Results ALA increased the NAD+/NADH ratio to enhance SIRT1 activity and production in C2C12 myotubes. ALA subsequently increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, leading to increased palmitate β-oxidation and decreased intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation in C2C12 myotubes. In cells treated with nicotinamide or transfected with SIRT1 siRNA, ALA-mediated AMPK/ACC phosphorylation, intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation and palmitate β-oxidation were reduced, suggesting that SIRT1 is an upstream regulator of AMPK. ALA increased ATGL and suppressed FAS protein production in C2C12 myotubes. Oral administration of ALA in diabetic mice fed on a high-fat diet and db/db mice dramatically reduced the body weight and visceral fat content. Conclusions/interpretation ALA activates both SIRT1 and AMPK, which leads to lipid-lowering effects in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that ALA may have beneficial effects in the treatment of dyslipidaemia and obesity. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","́-lipoic acid; AMPK; ATGL; SIRT1","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; antilipemic agent; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; nicotinamide; resveratrol; sirtuin 1; small interfering RNA; thioctic acid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; palmitic acid derivative; sirtuin 1; thioctic acid; triacylglycerol; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cell level; controlled study; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; enzyme synthesis; fat content; fatty acid oxidation; in vivo study; intraabdominal fat; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein induction; protein synthesis; treatment response; weight reduction; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; genetics; liver; metabolism; muscle; oxidation reduction reaction; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cell Line; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscles; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitates; Sirtuin 1; Thioctic Acid; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865406937

Despite markedly suppressed GH secretion, total IGF-I levels are often within normal range in obese adults. Aim: To study associations between IGF-I and estimated muscle mass in the Odense Androgen Study population and secondly to investigate associations between serum IGF-I and regional fat depots. Method: The Odense Androgen Study is a population-based, cross-sectional study of 776 randomly selected men aged 20-29. years. Regional lean and fat mass were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, whereas regional muscle and fat areas were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Age-adjusted IGF-I levels correlated significantly with different estimates of muscle mass (r-values between 0.15 and 0.19; p< 0.001). Using multiple linear regression, serum IGF-I correlated positively with subcutaneous adipose tissue on the abdomen (SAT) after controlling for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the whole group and in the subgroup of men with normal waist circumference (r-values between 0.13 and 0.15; p< 0.03). In addition, IGF-I correlated positively with subcutaneous thigh fat area (TFA) after controlling for intramyocellular lipid (imcl) r= 0.18; p< 0.004) and IGF-I correlated negatively with TFAimcl in the whole group and in the subgroup of men with normal waist circumference. Conclusion: SAT and subcutaneous TFAs were positively associated with IGF-I in regression analyses. Conversely, imcl of the thigh was inversely associated with IGF-I levels. These findings emphasize the differential associations between IGF-I and regional fat deposits. Future studies may provide further insight regarding the interplay between circulating IGF-I levels and regional muscle and fat mass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","IGF-I; Population-based; Subcutaneous adipose tissue; Visceral adipose tissue","somatomedin C; abdominal subcutaneous fat; adult; article; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; human; human experiment; intraabdominal fat; lean body weight; lipid storage; male; muscle mass; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Odense Androgen Study; population research; priority journal; protein blood level; randomization; subcutaneous fat; thigh; types of study; waist circumference; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adult; Androgens; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Subcutaneous Fat; Waist Circumference; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863785894

We evaluated the impact of various containers on the nutrient concentrations in human milk. Methods: A total of 42 breast milk samples from 18 healthy lactating mothers were collected. A baseline macronutrient concentration was determined for each sample. Then, the breast milk samples were divided and stored in nine different commercial milk containers. After freezing at -20°C for 2 days, the milk samples were thawed and analyzed again. A midinfrared human milk analyzer (HMA) was used to measure the protein, fat, and carbohydrate contents. Results: There was a significant decrease in the fat content following the storage, freezing, and thawing processes, ranging from 0.27-0.30 g/dL (p = 0.02), but no significant decrease in energy content (p = 0.069) was noted in the nine different containers. There were statistically significant increases in protein and carbohydrate concentrations in all containers (p = 0.021 and 0.001, respectively), however there were no significant differences between the containers in terms of fat, protein, carbohydrate, or energy contents. Conclusion: Human milk, when subjected to storage, freezing, and thawing processes, demonstrated a significant decrease in fat content (up to 9% reduction) in various containers. It is better for infants to receive milk directly from the mother via breastfeeding. More studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of milk storage on infant growth and development.","human milk; infrared analysis; storage container","carbohydrate; fat; protein; analyzer; article; artificial milk; breast feeding; breast milk; carbohydrate analysis; child development; child growth; child nutrition; concentration (parameters); container; controlled study; fat content; female; food storage; freezing; human; lactation; macronutrient; nutritional status; protein content; thawing; Carbohydrates; Fats; Food Storage; Humans; Milk Proteins; Milk, Human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863609413

Helium interstitials in bulk oxides are shown to be energetically more favorable than substitutional helium, yet helium binds to existing vacancies. The solubility of He in oxides is systematically higher than in iron and scales with the free volume at the interstitial site nearly independently of the chemical composition of the oxide. In most oxides, He migration is significantly slower and He-He binding is much weaker than in iron. To quantify the solubility of helium at oxide-iron interfaces two prototypical systems are considered (Fe-MgO, Fe-FeO-MgO).

Such materials would be suitable for use in buildings because they can store a large amount of cold and phase change occurs at a constant temperature, thereby increasing thermal comfort. The aim of the study was to investigate how and where PCMs are used in the cooling systems, how are these systems related to buildings, if they provide lower energy consumption, how the indoor temperatures change due to PCMs and if the indoor air conditions improve. In this article are firstly presented materials that are suitable for such applications and desirable properties for use in such applications. A review of cooling systems follows, which are divided into four groups, namely: free cooling applications, encapsulated PCM systems, air-conditioning (AC) systems and sorption cooling systems, both with integrated PCMs. All studies have shown that the use of PCMs helps to improve energy performance of buildings, the problems were encountered in heat transfer and the amount of PCM needed for storage.

The recently introduced quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) tandem mass spectrometer allows fast acquisition of high-resolution higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectra due to the parallel mode of operation, where the generation, filling, and storage of fragment ions can be performed while simultaneously measuring another ion packet in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. In this study, data-dependent acquisition methods for ""fast"" or ""sensitive"" scanning were optimized and assessed by comparing stable isotope labeled yeast proteome coverage. We discovered that speed was the most important parameter for sample loads above 125 ng, where a 95 ms HCD scanning method allowed for identification and quantification of more than 2000 yeast proteins from 1 h of analysis time. At sample loads below 125 ng, a 156 ms HCD acquisition method improved the sensitivity, mass accuracy, and quality of data and enabled us to identify 30% more proteins and peptides than the faster scanning method. A similar effect was observed when the LC gradient was extended to 2 or 3 h for the analysis of complex mammalian whole cell lysates. Using a 3 h LC gradient, the sensitive method enabled identification of more than 4000 proteins from 1 μg of tryptic HeLa digest, which was almost 200 more identifications compared to the faster scanning method. Our results demonstrate that peptide identification on a quadrupole Orbitrap is dependent on sample amounts, acquisition speed, and data quality, which emphasizes the need for acquisition methods tailored for different sample loads and analytical preferences. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","data-dependent; HCD; LCMS; Orbitrap; parallel operation; Q Exactive","proteome; fungal protein; peptide fragment; proteome; accuracy; article; cell lysate; collisionally activated dissociation; controlled study; fragmentation reaction; human; human cell; intermethod comparison; isotope labeling; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometer; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein isolation; proteomics; quadrupole mass spectrometry; reaction optimization; sensitivity and specificity; tandem mass spectrometry; velocity; yeast; chemistry; HeLa cell line; isolation and purification; metabolism; procedures; proteomics; tandem mass spectrometry; Mammalia; Chromatography, Liquid; Fungal Proteins; HeLa Cells; Humans; Peptide Fragments; Proteome; Proteomics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861800006

We investigate the structural, electronic, and thermodynamical properties of these compounds with regard to their hydrogen storage effectiveness. PBE0 and HSE06 predict cell parameters and bond lengths that are in good agreement with the GGA-PBE calculations and previously known experimental results. As expected smaller band gaps (E gs) are predicted by GGA-PBE for the pure magnesium hydride phases. PBE0 overcomes the deficiencies of DFT in treating these materials better than HSE06 and yields E gs that compare even better with previous GW calculations. Both the hybrid functionals increase the E gs of the Al-doped magnesium hydrides by much less magnitudes than of the Si-doped phases. This difference is interpreted in terms of charge density distributions. Best H 2 adsorption energies (ΔH ads) are computed by HSE06 while GGA-PBE significantly overestimates them. Si-doped α- and β-MgH 2 exhibited the least negative ΔH ads in close proximity to the H 2 binding energy range of -0.21 to -0.41 eV ideal for practical H 2 storage transportation applications. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This concept involves; i) waste heat recovery at a temperature of ~. 75-80. °C from a low thermal resistance multi PV chip receiver package, ii) thermal energy storage and iii) desalination with the membrane distillation technique (MD). For optimization of the overall yield, we are using a multi-effect membrane distillation (MEMD) system which reaches a similar efficiency improvement per added effect like a multi-effect distillation (MED) plant. A semi-empirical prediction model was developed to describe the MEMD desalination system under steady state conditions. Experimental investigations were carried out with the MEMD system and the results were compared with the model. The model predicted the experimental data with +/-. 15% accuracy.

Having recognized this, the EPO cooperated with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the International Centre on Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and produced a study on Patents and Clean Energy. To consolidate the efforts invested in this study, the Y02 patent classification was created. This is a tagging scheme developed by experienced examiners working in the relevant fields, in cooperation with external experts, for patent documents related to CCMTs, which provides additional classification next to the regular ECLA and IPC classification of such documents. Patent documents were tagged by means of search strategies by experienced expert examiners, which were formalized into algorithms that can be re-run periodically to update the classes. Currently there are 2 subclasses: Y02C (for Greenhouse gas capture and storage) and Y02E (CCMTs relating to energy generation, transmission or distribution). At the time of writing, over 650,000 documents have been tagged with Y02 codes. A comparison between published patent documents with Y02 tags and published patent documents in general confirms that over the last 15 years the annual amount of patents related to ""clean energy"" has grown more than twice as fast as the average of all patents.

It is shown that hydrogen has several advantages, as well as few drawbacks in using for the above purposes. The research shows that hydrogen will be a key player in storing energy that is wasted at generation stage in large-scale power grids by off-peak diversion to dummy loads. The estimations show that by the year of 2050 there will be a hydrogen demand of over 42 million metric tons or 45 billion gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) in the United States of America alone which can fuel up 342 million light-duty vehicles for 51 × 10 11 miles (82 × 10 11 km) travel per year. The production at distributed level has also been discussed. The paper also presents the levels of risk in production, storage and distribution stages and proposes possible techniques to address safety issues. It is shown that the storage in small to medium scale containers is much economical compared to doing the same at large-scale containers.

The form-stable composite PCMs were prepared by absorbing galactitol hexa myristate (GHM) and galactitol hexa laurate (GHL) esters into porous networks of diatomite, perlite and vermiculite. In composite PCMs, fatty acid esters were used as energy storage materials while diatomite, perlite and vermiculite were used as building materials. The prepared composite PCMs were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) analysis techniques. The SEM results proved that the esters were well confined into the building materials. The maximum mass percentages of GHM adsorbed by perlite, diatomite and vermiculite were determined as 67, 55 and 52 wt%, respectively as they were found for GHL to be 70, 51 and 39 wt%, respectively. Thermal properties and thermal stabilities of the form-stable composite PCMs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The DSC results showed that the melting temperatures and latent heat values of the PCMs are in range of about 39-46 °C and 61-121 J/g. The thermal cycling test revealed that the composite PCMs have good thermal reliability and chemical stability. TG analysis revealed that the composite PCMs had high thermal durability property above their working temperature ranges. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of the PCMs were increased by adding the expanded graphite (EG) in mass fraction of 5%. Based on all results, it was also concluded that the prepared six composite PCMs had important potential for thermal energy storage applications such as solar space heating and cooling applications in buildings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In previous work we have identified major challenges to systematically modeling distributed, non-uniform resources emerging in power grids. Today's modeling of electric energy systems is either entirely based on first principles which suffers significantly from the ever-increasing complexity of non-uniform devices, or is purely based on computer science data-driven approaches which lose the fundamental physical insights of electric power networks. Therefore, it is very difficult with today's modeling practices to integrate distributed non-uniform resources using both first-principle and data driven approaches in large-scale cyber-physical energy systems. In sharp contrast, this paper presents a holistic multi-scale modeling approach by combing advances from (1) physics based modeling of emerging distributed resources (e.g. wind generation and storage devices), and (2) data-driven modeling of load resources. With both physics-based models of distributed resources and data-driven models of flexible demands, key parameters are abstracted and identified from the detailed dynamical models necessary for the multi-scale power system operations. The proposed modeling framework is tested using realistic phasor measurement unit data obtained from Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). © 2012 IEEE.","data-driven modeling; Multi-scale modeling; spatial aggregation; structure-preserving modeling; temporal aggregation","Data-driven modeling; Multi-scale Modeling; Spatial aggregation; Structure-preserving; Temporal aggregation; Embedded systems; Power generation; Units of measurement; Virtual storage; Models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861520770

Potential step charging provides better control of the charging and can result in significantly shorter charging times, enabling charging in 22 s for devices with cell capacitances of 12.2 F when charged to 0.8 V. The paper-based electrode material was compatible with charging currents as large as 5.9 A g -1 due to the rapid counter ion mass transport resulting from the porous composite structure and the thin PPy coatings. The charging times were controlled by the RC time constants of the devices and the cell resistance was found to decrease with increasing electrode area. For small cells, the cell resistance was determined to a large extent by the electrolyte resistance and contact resistances, whereas the resistance of the current collectors dominated for larger cells. The specific cell capacitance was 38.3 F g -1 or 2.1 F cm -2, normalized with respect to the total electrode weight and electrode cross section area respectively, and the devices showed 80-90% capacitance retention after 10 000 potential step charge and discharge cycles.

We theoretically investigate the systematic errors that arise when mass and energy balances are computed directly from these measurements. We show that, even with no measurement or model errors, large residuals might result when finite difference approximations are used to compute fluxes and storage term. To calculate the limits set by the use of spatially discrete measurements on the accuracy of balance closure, we derive an analytical solution to estimate the residual on the basis of the two key parameters: the penetration depth and the distance between the measurements. When the thickness of the control layer for which the balance is computed is comparable to the penetration depth of the forcing (which depends on the thermal diffusivity and on the forcing period) large residuals arise. The residual is also very sensitive to the distance between the measurements, which requires accurately controlling the position of the sensors in field experiments. We also demonstrate that, for the same experimental setup, mass residuals are sensitively larger than the energy residuals due to the nonlinearity of the moisture transport equation. Our analysis suggests that a careful assessment of the systematic mass error introduced by the use of spatially discrete data is required before using fluxes and residuals computed directly from field measurements. © 2012.

Proper utilization of renewable energy such as wind energy is proposed as an efficient solution to address this problem. However, due to the high inter-temporal variation and limited predictability, it is difficult to make full use of renewable energy as supplement to the conventional thermal power plants in smart grid. In this paper, we provide an energy efficient solution to solve this problem: the integration of Pug-In-Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). Through proper charging and discharging processes, the PHEV fleet can act as energy storage when there is excess renewable energy, while in case of energy shortage, the energy can be properly returned to the grid. Optimization models based on stochastic programming are developed for both the cases without PHEV fleet and with PHEV fleet, while various uncertainties such as power price, renewable power and user demand are taken into account. By solving the two stochastic programming problems, the optimal power management solutions are obtained, and the numerical results show that the integration of PHEV can effectively reduce the energy to be generated by conventional thermal power plants, and as a result, the overall energy generation cost can be significantly reduced. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Discharging process; Energy efficient; Energy generations; Energy shortages; Numerical results; Optimal power; Optimization models; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Power price; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Thermal power plants; User demands; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Smart power grids; Stochastic programming; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Problem solving",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862083457

By employing SiO 2- and TiO 2-capped Au nanoparticles we have identified the mechanism with which the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) is influenced by the neighboring metal nanoparticles. The efficiency of an N719 dye-sensitized solar cell (9.3%) increased to 10.2% upon incorporation of 0.7% Au@SiO 2 and to 9.8% upon loading of 0.7% Au@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The plasmonic effect as monitored by introducing Au@SiO 2 in DSSC produces higher photocurrent.

As a result, Au@TiO 2 nanoparticle-embedded DSSC exhibit higher photovoltage.

This approach is justified in order to generate the integrated view required for ""green"" optimizations, while taking into account service demand and operations While subsystems with lower native energy footprints are being migrated into public networks, the many adaptation mechanisms at sub-system, protocol and management levels make system complexity too high to design major comprehensive ""green"" trade-offs. However, by focusing on the incremental effects of a new network user, the approximate model allows marginal effects to be estimated with good accuracy. This capability allows for the provisioning of personalized energy / emissions reducing tariffs to end users with inherent advantages both to operators, energy suppliers and users. One key advantage is the possibility to reduce waste capacity, and thus energy consumption in the network, by allowing the user to specify just the service capacity and demands he/she has. From an engineering point of view, the incremental model allows to tune sub-system characteristics jointly, especially transceivers, transmission and storage. From a configuration point of view, the model allows to determine which nodes in the network benefit most from back-up and renewable power sources. From a business perspective, the model allows to determine trade-offs between personalized bundle characteristics and the energy cost share in the marginal operating expense share.

However, the concept of their ultra fast charging still poses demanding requirements, both in terms of the EV battery and the impact on the power grid. Towards this direction, emerging power electronics interfaces as well as energy storage technologies will play a significant role into making EV charging stations competitive with the existing gas station infrastructures. This paper focuses on the proposal of a power converter architecture, which aims for the interface between the three-phase medium voltage AC grid and the Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries. The transformerless AC/DC conversion stage motivates the choice of a suitable multilevel topology, namely the Cascaded H-Bridge Converter (CHB), where the medium voltage is split into several dedicated low voltage DC buses. At each of these levels, integrated stationary Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) play the role of power buffers, reducing thus the influence of the charging station on the distribution grid. The EV battery is then charged through parallel-connected isolated DC/DC converters, in order to achieve high currents and meet the standards for galvanic isolation. © 2012 IEEE.","Cascaded H-Bridge Converter; DC Ultra Fast Charging; Electric Vehicle; Integrated Energy Storage; Isolated DC/DC Converter","AC-grid; Ac/dc conversion; Cascaded H-bridge converter; Charging station; Converter architecture; Distribution grid; EV battery; Galvanic isolation; Gas stations; Global systems; High currents; Low voltages; Medium voltage; Parallel-connected; Power buffers; Power electronics interface; Power grids; Stationary batteries; Storage technology; Transformerless; Ultra-fast; Bridge circuits; Carbon dioxide; DC power transmission; DC-DC converters; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Phase interfaces; Power electronics; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860823999

Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to play a large role in the future Smart Grid. They are expected to provide grid services, both for peak reduction and for ancillary services, by absorbing short term variations in the electricity production. In this paper the Economic MPC minimizes the cost of electricity consumption for a single EV. Simulations show savings of 50-60% of the electricity costs compared to uncontrolled charging from load shifting based on driving pattern predictions. The future energy system in Denmark will most likely be based on renewable energy sources e.g. wind and solar power. These green energy sources introduce stochastic fluctuations in the electricity production. Therefore, energy should be consumed as soon as it is produced to avoid the need for energy storage as this is expensive, limited and introduces efficiency losses.

Therefore, significant efforts have been focused on the development of new materials for the chemical hydrogen storage and production. Of particular importance, ammonia-borane (NH 3BH 3) is emerging as one of the most promising solid hydrogen carrier due to its high gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (19.6 wt.%) and low molecular weight (30.8 g/mol). ammonia-borane can release hydrogen gas upon catalytic hydrolysis under mild conditions. Herein, the discovery of a new catalytic material, ruthenium nanoparticles stabilized by ZK-4 zeolite framework, for this important reaction has been reported. This new catalyst system was prepared by borohydride reduction of ruthenium(III)-exchanged ZK-4 zeolite in water at room temperature. The characterization of the resulting material by advanced analytical tools shows the formation of ZK-4 zeolite dispersed ruthenium nanoparticles (2.9 ± 0.9 nm). The catalytic performance of the resulting supported ruthenium nanoparticles depending on activity, lifetime and reusability was demonstrated in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane. They were found to be highly active (initial TOF = 5410 h -1), long-lived (TTO = 36,700) and reusable catalyst (retaining of &gt;85% of initial activity in the 5th reuse) in this important catalytic reaction at room temperature under air. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, conventional NVMs cannot achieve low-V DD operation due to insufficient write voltage generated by charge-pumped (CP) circuits at a low V DD, and a lack of low-V DD current-mode sense amplifiers (CSA) [1-4] to overcome read issues in reduced sensing margins, degraded speeds, and insufficient voltage headroom (VHR). Resistive RAM (ReRAM) [4-6] is a promising memory with the advantages of short write time, low write-voltage, and reduced write power compared to Flash and other NVMs. Using a low-V DD CP with relaxed output voltage/current requirements for write operations, ReRAM is a good candidate for on-chip low-V DD NVM if a low-V DD CSA is provided, particularly for frequent-read-seldom-write applications.

Both rings will be operated at a constant 500 mA of stored current with top-up shots supplied by the MAX IV linac acting as a full-energy injector. Until recently, injection into both storage rings was designed using a conventional approach: a closed four-kicker injection bump brings the stored beam to the septum blade where the injected bunches are captured in a single turn. This method, although commonly found in third generation light sources, has significant disadvantages. Therefore, an alternative injection into the storage rings using pulsed multipoles has been investigated. This type of injection does not require an injection bump and has the potential to make top-up injection fully transparent to users. Design studies have been successfully completed and as a consequence it has been decided to replace the originally foreseen conventional injection scheme with pulsed multipole injection in both MAX IV storage rings. This paper reports on these studies, presents pulsed sextupole injection schemes, and summarizes requirements for the pulsers, sextupole magnets, and vacuum chambers. © 2012 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861829885

A major problem associated with platelet storage containers is that some platelet units show a dramatic fall in pH, especially above certain platelet contents. The aim of this study was a detailed investigation of the different in vitro effects occurring when the maximum storage capacity of a platelet container is exceeded as compared to normal storage. Materials and methods. Buffy coats were combined in large-volume containers to create primary pools to be split into two equal aliquots for the preparation of platelets (450-520×10 9platelets/unit) in SSP+ for 7-day storage in two containers (test and reference) with different platelet storage capacity (n=8). Results. Exceeding the maximum storage capacity of the test platelet storage container resulted in immediate negative effects on platelet metabolism and energy supply, but also delayed effects on platelet function, activation and disintegration. Conclusion. Our study gives a very clear indication of the effects in different phases associated with exceeding the maximum storage capacity of platelet containers but throw little additional light on the mechanism initiating those negative effects. The problem appears to be complex and further studies in different media using different storage containers will be needed to understand the mechanisms involved. © SIMTI Servizi Srl.","In vitro study; Platelet content; Platelets; Storage","article; blood buffy coat; container; controlled study; energy resource; human; human cell; in vitro study; normal human; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte metabolism; thrombocyte preservation; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Humans; Platelet Activation; Platelet Count; Product Packaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860510586

Lyngby, Denmark","The use of thermal energy storage (TES) in buildings in combination with space heating and/or space cooling has recently received much attention. A variety of TES techniques have developed over the past decades. TES systems can provide short-term storage for peak-load shaving as well as long-term (seasonal) storage for the introduction of natural and renewable energy sources. TES systems for heating or cooling are utilized in applications where there is a time mismatch between the demand and the most economically favorable supply of energy. The selection of a TES system mainly depends on the storage period required, economic viability, and operating conditions. One of the main issues impeding the utilization of the full potential of natural and renewable energy sources, e.g., solar and geothermal, for space heating and space cooling applications is the development of economically competitive and reliable means for seasonal storage of thermal energy. This is particularly true at locations where seasonal variations of solar radiation are significant and/or in climates where seasonally varying space heating and cooling loads dominate energy consumption. This article conducts a literature review of different seasonal thermal energy storage concepts in the ground. The aim is to provide the basis for development of new intelligent TES possibilities in buildings. © 2012 2012 ASHRAE.",,"Cooling applications; Cooling load; Economic viability; In-buildings; Literature reviews; Operating condition; Renewable energy source; Seasonal storage; Seasonal variation; Space cooling; Storage periods; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Space heating; Sun; Thermography (temperature measurement); Cooling systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862566506

Kinetic energy harvesters are frequency selective, meaning that they have high power transmission efficiency only when they are excited at their natural frequency. The well-weighted swing disk with nonlinear effects can render the energy harvester more broadband, that is, it has a more steady power generation at various wheel speeds than the ill-weighted swing disk has. We integrate magnets in a novel circular Halbach array and coils into the design to augment the magnetic strength on one side of the array where the coils are placed. Therefore, the gradient of the average magnetic flux density for the circular Halbach array disk is larger than that of the multipolar magnetic disk. The dynamic models with electromechanical couplings have been established and are analyzed.

The data input for solar radiation model is obtained from the Singapore Meteorological Service (SMS), and these data have been compared with long-term average data of NASA (surface meteorology and solar energy or SSE). The comparison shows a good agreement between the predicted and measured hourly-averaged, horizontal global radiation. The SHWP at CIAS, which comprises 1200m 2 of evacuated-tube collectors, 50m 3 water storage tanks and a gas-fired auxiliary boiler, is first analyzed using a baseline configuration, i.e., (i) the local solar insolation input, (ii) a coolant flow rate through the headers of collector based on ASHRAE standards, (iii) a thermal load demand pattern amounting to 100m 3/day, and (iv) the augmentation of water temperature by auxiliary when the supply temperature from solar tank drops below the set point. A comparison between the baseline configuration and the measured performance of CIAS plant gives reasonably good validation of the simulation code. Optimization is further carried out for the following parameters, namely; (i) total collector area of the plant, (ii) storage volume, and (iii) three daily thermal demands. These studies are performed for both the CIAS plant and a slightly modified plant where the hot water supply to the load is adjusted constant at times when the water temperature from tank may exceed the set temperature. It is found that the latter configuration has better thermal and economic performances over the conventional design. © 2012.","Economic evaluation; Optimization; Solar hot water plant; Solar radiation analysis","Auxiliary boilers; Average data; Baseline configurations; Changi International Airport; Conventional design; Coolant flow rates; Data input; Detailed models; Economic evaluations; Economic performance; Gas-fired; Global radiation; Hot water; Hot-water supply; Load demand; Long term performance; Measured data; Micro genetic algorithm; Payback periods; Performance optimizations; Setpoints; Simulation code; Singapore; Solar hot water; Solar insolation; Solar radiation analysis; Solar radiation model; Solar tanks; Storage volumes; Thermal demands; Water storage tanks; Water temperatures; Atmospheric radiation; Genetic algorithms; Investments; NASA; Optimization; Solar radiation; Sun; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Water supply; Economic analysis; ecological modeling; economic analysis; genetic algorithm; insolation; meteorology; performance assessment; solar power; solar radiation; temperature effect; water temperature; Changi; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859438553

In the experimental work, a cylindrical solar pond system (CSPS) with a radius of 0.80. m and a depth of 2.0. m and four flat plate collectors dimensions of 1.90 m × 0.90. m was built in Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey. The CSPS was filled with salty water of various densities to form three salty water zones (Upper Convective Zone, Non-Convective Zone and Heat Storage Zone). Heat energy collected by collectors was transferred to the solar pond storage zone by using a heat exchanger system which is connected to the solar collectors. Several temperature sensors connected to a data acquisition system were placed vertically inside the CSPS and at the inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger. Experimental studies were performed using 1, 2, 3 and 4 collectors integrated with the CSPS under approximately the same condition. The integrated solar pond efficiencies were calculated experimentally and theoretically according to the number of collectors. As a result, the experimental efficiencies are found to be 21.30%, 23.60%, 24.28% and 26.52%; the theoretical efficiencies to be 23.42%, 25.48%, 26.55% and 27.70% for 1, 2, 3 and 4 collectors, respectively.

Industrial hemp has high biomass and energy yields. The study evaluated and compared net energy yields (NEY) and energy output-to-input ratios (R O/I) for production of heat, power and vehicle fuel from industrial hemp. Four scenarios for hemp biomass were compared; (I) combined heat and power (CHP) from spring-harvested baled hemp, (II) heat from spring-harvested briquetted hemp, and (III) CHP and (IV) vehicle fuel from autumn-harvested chopped and ensiled hemp processed to biogas in an anaerobic digestion process. The results were compared with those of other energy crops. Calculations were based on conditions in the agricultural area along the Swedish west and south coast. There was little difference in total energy input up to storage, but large differences in the individual steps involved. Further processing to final energy product differed greatly. Total energy ratio was best for combustion scenarios (I) and (II) (R O/I of 6.8 and 5.1, respectively). The biogas scenarios (III) and (IV) both had low R O/I (2.7 and 2.6, repectively). They suffer from higher energy inputs and lower conversion efficiencies but give high quality products, i.e. electricity and vehicle fuel. The main competitors for hemp are maize and sugar beets for biogas production and the perennial crops willow, reed canary grass and miscanthus for solid biofuel production.

Three NC raw materials were used: Cladophora cellulose (NCUU) produced at Uppsala University, Cladophora cellulose (NCFMC) produced at FMC Biopolymer, and microfibrillated cellulose (NC INN) produced at Innventia AB. Composite paper sheets of PPy coated on the substrate NC material were produced. The NC raw materials and the composites were characterized with a battery of techniques to derive their degree of crystallinity, degree of polymerization, specific surface area, pore size distribution, porosity, electron conductivity, charge capacity and tensile properties. It was found that the pore size distribution and overall porosity increase upon coating of NC fibres for all the samples. The charge capacity of the composites was found to decrease with the porosity of the samples. It was further found that the mechanical strength of the pristine NC sheets was largely dependent on the overall porosity, with NC INN having the highest mechanical strength and lowest porosity in the series. The mechanical properties of the composite NC-PPy sheets were significantly diminished as compared with pristine NC sheets because of the impaired H-bonding between fibres and PPy-coated nanofibres. It was concluded that to improve the mechanical properties of PPy-NC sheets, a fraction of additive bare NC fibres is beneficial. Future study may include the effect of both soluble and insoluble additives to improve the mechanical strength of PPy-NC sheets. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",,"Charge capacities; Cladophora; Composite sheets; Conductive electrodes; Degree of crystallinity; Degree of polymerization; Electron conductivity; H-bonding; Microfibrillated cellulose; Nano-cellulose; Paper sheets; Polypyrrole (PPy); Raw material characteristics; Uppsala University; Additives; Cellulose; Polypyrroles; Pore size; Virtual storage; Mechanical properties",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859111066

This broad bandwidth harvesting system comprises of four units of individual ZnO (zinc oxide) piezoelectric harvester in the form of a cantilever structure connected in parallel, and rectifying circuit with storage module. This system has ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy from the varying ambient vibration. The design and simulation of a piezoelectric cantilever plate was described by using commercial software ANSYS FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to determine the optimum thickness of PET substrate, internal stress distribution, operation frequency and electric potential. With the optimum thickness predicted by developed accurate analytical formula analysis, the one-way mechanical strain that is efficient to enhance the induced electric potential can be controlled within the piezoelectric ZnO layer. In addition, the relationship among the model solution of piezoelectric cantilever plate equation, vibration-induced electric potential and electric power was realized. An individual piezoelectric harvester consists of flexible PET substrate, piezoelectric ZnO thin film with (002) c-axis preferred orientation, and selectively deposited UV-curable resin lump structure which is used to change the resonant frequency of the harvester. In combination with multi-harvesters and rectifying with storage module together, an energy harvesting system with broad bandwidth can be fabricated. One individual harvester achieves a maximum OCV (open-circuit voltage) up to 4 V with power density of 1.247 μW/cm 3. So far, we succeeded in accomplishing a broad bandwidth system with operating frequency range within 100 Hz-450 Hz to enhance powering efficiency. When the DC voltage (direct current voltage) across a storage module is charged up to 1.55 V after rectification, a flash LED (light emitting diode) is driven. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The maximum incorporation percentage for ETP and ETS into diatomite and EP was found to be 57 wt% and 62 wt%, respectively without melted PCM seepage from the composites. The morphologies and compatibilities of the composite PCMs were structurally characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) analysis techniques. Thermal energy storage properties of the composite PCMs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The DSC analyses results indicated that the composite PCMs were good candidates for building applications in terms of their large latent heat values and suitable phase change temperatures. The thermal cycling test including 1000 melting and freezing cycling showed that composite PCMs had good thermal reliability and chemical stability. TG analysis revealed that the composite PCMs had good thermal durability above their working temperature ranges. Moreover, in order to improve the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs, the expanded graphite (EG) was added to them at different mass fractions (2%, 5%, and 10%). The best results were obtained for the composite PCMs including 5wt% EG content in terms of the increase in thermal conductivity values and the decrease amount in latent heat capacity. The improvement in thermal conductivity values of ETP/Diatomite, ETS/Diatomite, ETP/EP and ETS/EP were found to be about 68%, 57%, 73% and 75%, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal energy storage via a heat transfer fluid (HTF) is a crucial requirement to enable such plants to deliver electricity. With advantages of high boiling temperature, large specific heat, and low price, molten salts are very suitable for use as HTFs. Therefore, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is proposed in this paper for investigating the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of FLiNaK salt. The proposed model is validated through comparison with existing correlations and experimental data of friction factor (f w), Nusselt (Nu) number, and hydraulic and thermal entrance length (L h,L th) in a simple round tube under various inlet Reynolds numbers (Re). Specifically, the predicted fully-developed f w corresponds well with that calculated by the Blasius correlation and the Moody diagram. The predicted Nu number is also in close agreement with that determined using Gnielinski's correlation, revealing that this correlation is more suitable for predicting the heat transfer characteristics of FLiNaK salt. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By using consistent energy systems scenarios meeting stringent targets for atmospheric CO 2 concentrations we investigate the impact of higher energy and carbon dioxide prices as well as of the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. We find that wooden frames cause lower carbon dioxide emissions given the prevailing energy system, but concrete frames obtain about the same emissions as the wood frame in a system where CCS is not used for wood incineration in the demolishing phase. The net present costs for the different buildings are also affected by the future energy supply system, even though the impact is small, especially compared to the total construction cost. We conclude that it is unclear whether wood framed buildings will be a cost-effective carbon mitigation option and that further analyses of costs should be performed before prescriptive materials policies are enforced in the buildings sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Building materials; Carbon capture and storage; Climate policy; CO 2 emissions; Materials substitution","Atmospheric CO; Buildings sector; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon mitigation; Climate policy; Concrete frame; Construction costs; Energy supply system; Energy systems; In-buildings; Life-times; Mitigation strategy; Net present cost; Wood frame; Wooden frames; Building materials; Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Global warming; Incineration; Wood; Cost benefit analysis; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); concrete; construction material; environmental policy; structural component; wood; Buildings; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Combustion; Costs; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855246789

Nanostructured metal oxides exhibit good electrochemical properties, and they are regarded as promising anode materials for high-performance LIBs. In this feature article, we will focus on three different categories of metal oxides with distinct lithium storage mechanisms: tin dioxide (SnO 2), which utilizes alloying/dealloying processes to reversibly store/release lithium ions during charge/discharge; titanium dioxide (TiO 2), where lithium ions are inserted/deinserted into/out of the TiO 2 crystal framework; and transition metal oxides including iron oxide and cobalt oxide, which react with lithium ions via an unusual conversion reaction. For all three systems, we will emphasize that creating nanomaterials with unique structures could effectively improve the lithium storage properties of these metal oxides. We will also highlight that the lithium storage capability can be further enhanced through designing advanced nanocomposite materials containing metal oxides and other carbonaceous supports. By providing such a rather systematic survey, we aim to stress the importance of proper nanostructuring and advanced compositing that would result in improved physicochemical properties of metal oxides, thus making them promising negative electrodes for next-generation LIBs. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anode material; Carbonaceous supports; Charge/discharge; Cobalt oxides; Compositing; Conversion reactions; Cycle lives; Electrode material; Lithium ions; Lithium storages; Lithium-ion battery; Metal oxides; Nano-structuring; Nanostructured metals; Negative electrode; Physicochemical property; Three systems; TiO; Transition-metal oxides; Cobalt; Electrochemical cells; Iron oxides; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Nanocomposites; Tin; Titanium dioxide; Transition metal compounds; Anodes; lithium; nanomaterial; tin derivative; tin dioxide; titanium; titanium dioxide; article; chemistry; electrode; power supply; surface property; Electric Power Supplies; Electrodes; Lithium; Nanostructures; Surface Properties; Tin Compounds; Titanium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859304135

Fifteen PHA-producing bacterial strains were identified from bacteria isolated from Antarctic soils collected around Casey Station (66°17'S, 110°32'E) and Signy Island (60°45'S, 45°36'W). Screening for PHA production was carried out by incubating the isolates in PHA production medium supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sodium octanoate or glucose. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolated PHA-producing strains were mainly Pseudomonas spp. and a few were Janthinobacterium spp. All the isolated Pseudomonas strains were able to produce medium-chain-length (mcl) PHA using fatty acids as carbon source, while some could also produce mcl-PHA by using glucose. The Janthinobacterium strains could only utilize glucose to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). A Pseudomonas isolate, UMAB-40, accumulated PHA up to 48% cell dry mass when utilizing fatty acids as carbon source. This high accumulation occurred at between 5 °C and 20 °C, then decreased with increasing temperatures. Highly unsaturated mcl-PHA was produced by UMAB-40 from glucose. Such characteristics may be associated with the ability of UMAB-40 to survive in the cold. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.","Antarctic bacteria; Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA); Pseudomonas spp., Janthinobacterium spp","16S rRNA gene sequence; Antarctic bacteria; Bacterial strains; Carbon source; Dry mass; Energy storage materials; Octanoate; PHA production; Poly-hydroxyalkanoate; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Pseudomonas spp; Pseudomonas strain; Soil bacterium; Biopolymers; Carbon; Diagnosis; Glucose; RNA; Sodium; Bacteria; bacterial DNA; carbon; fatty acid; glucose; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; adaptation; bacterium; cold tolerance; fatty acid; glucose; polymer; survival; temperature effect; Antarctica; article; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; Oxalobacteraceae; Pseudomonas; Antarctic Regions; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Oxalobacteraceae; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomonas; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; Antarctica; Casey Station; East Antarctica; Signy Island; South Orkney Islands; Bacteria (microorganisms); Janthinobacterium; Pseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858286514

Recently it has been found that systemic SP-D is associated with metabolic disturbances and that SP-D deficient mice are mildly obese. However, the mechanism behind SP-D's role in energy metabolism is not known. Here we report that SP-D deficient mice had significantly higher ad libitum energy intake compared to wild-type mice and unchanged energy expenditure. This resulted in accumulation but also redistribution of fat tissue. Blood pressure was unchanged. The change in energy intake was unrelated to the basal levels of hypothalamic Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) gene expression. Neither short time systemic, nor intracereberoventricular SP-D treatment altered the hypothalamic signalling or body weight accumulation. In ad libitum fed animals, serum leptin, insulin, and glucose were significantly increased in mice deficient in SP-D, and indicative of insulin resistance. However, restricted diets eliminated all metabolic differences except the distribution of body fat. SP-D deficiency was further associated with elevated levels of systemic bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In conclusion, our findings suggest that lack of SP-D mediates modulation of food intake not directly involving hypothalamic regulatory pathways. The resulting accumulation of adipose tissue was associated with insulin resistance.

However, most OR-PAM systems are realized by using a bulky laser for photoacoustic excitation. The large volume and high price of the laser may restrain the popularity of OR-PAM. In this study, we develop a low-cost and compact OR-PAM system based on a commercially available DVD pickup head. We showed that the DVD pickup head have the required laser energy and focusing optics for OR-PAM. The firmware of a DVD burner was modified to enable its laser diode to provide a 13-ns laser pulse with 1.3-nJ energy at 650 nm. Two excitation wavelengths at 650 and 780 nm were available. The laser beam was focused onto the target after passing through a 0.6-mm thick DVD transparent polycarbonate coating, and then aligned to be confocal with a 50-MHz focused ultrasonic transducer in forward mode. To keep the target on focus, a scan involving auto-tracking procedure was performed. The lateral resolution was verified via cross-sectional imaging of a 6-?m carbon fiber. The measured -6 dB width of the carbon fiber was 6.66 μm which was in agreement with optical diffraction limit. The proposed OR-PAM has potential as an economically viable and compact blood screening tool available outside of large laboratories due to its low cost and portability. Furthermore, a better spatial resolution could be provided by using a blue ray DVD pickup head. © 2012 SPIE.","DVD pickup head; Micro-vascular imaging; Photoacoustic microscopy","Auto tracking; Cross-sectional imaging; DVD pick-up head; Excitation wavelength; Focusing optics; Forward mode; High price; Label free; Laser energies; Lateral resolution; Low costs; Microvascular; Optical diffraction limit; Optical resolution; Photoacoustic excitation; Screening tool; Spatial resolution; Carbon fibers; Data storage equipment; Diagnosis; Firmware; Light; Photoacoustic microscopy; Photons; Pickups; Ultrasonic transducers; Ultrasonics; Videodisks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859338102

Herein, for the first time, we investigated an environmentally friendly green aqueous modification of fluoropolymers, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) for energy storage applications. The PVDF polymer was modified in aqueous medium by using bioinspired protein dopamine without any harmful toxic chemicals. Dopamine functionalization onto pre-irradiated PVDF polymer powder was carried out using a simple reflux method to strongly bind dopamine onto the PVDF surface. The resulting dopamine modified PVDF films exhibited excellent dielectric properties, when compared with the pristine PVDF polymer. The dielectric constant can be enhanced up to 32 with fairly low dielectric loss as compared to pristine PVDF. Furthermore, the modified films were found to have good flexibility; they could be curled as easily as pristine PVDF films. Since this method avoids the use of toxic chemicals, it may allow the application of modified PVDF not only for energy storage applications but also for other applications such as in biocompatible materials. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",,"Biological materials; Capacitors; Dielectric losses; Energy storage; Neurophysiology; Polymer films; Polymers; Toxic materials; Aqueous medium; Bio-inspired; Electronic application; Embedded capacitor; Energy storage applications; Environmentally-friendly; Functionalizations; High energy densities; Low dielectric loss; Modified film; Multilayer capacitors; Other applications; Polymer powders; Polyvinylidene fluorides; PVDF films; Solution processable; Toxic chemicals; Fluorine containing polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858025824

It was found that the boundaries' morphology of the detached gold fragments depends essentially on the microrelief of surface for each kind of the glass substrate. It was confirmed by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy that carbon nanotubes are formed near the detachment boundaries of the gold nanolayer's fragment from glass substrate and consequent storage of these samples in the air at room temperature. In the authors' opinion, the observed mechanochemical effect associated with the detachment of thin gold layer fragment from glass substrate leads to the increase of the gold catalytic activity and to carbon nanotubes formation in the air that contains carbon impurities. This assumption is confirmed, in particular, by the formation of carbon nanotubes after the detachment of thin gold layer fragment from the glass substrate surface and storage in an ethylene atmosphere. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is the high cost of raw materials. Biodiesel from waste cooking oil is an economical source and an effective strategy for reducing the raw material cost. Although biodiesels made from waste cooking oil have been previously investigated, PAH emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) with catalyzer fueled with biodiesel from waste cooking oil and its blend with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for the US-HDD transient cycle have seldom been addressed. Experimental results indicate that ULSD/WCOB (biodiesel made from waste cooking oil) blends had lower PM, HC, and CO emissions but higher CO 2 and NO x emissions when compared with that of ULSD. Using ULSD/WCOB blends instead of ULSD decreased PAHs by 14.1%-53.3%, PM by 6.80%-15.1%, HC by 6.76%-23.5%, and CO by 0.962%-8.65% but increase CO 2 by 0.318-1.43% and NOx by 0.384-1.15%.

Applications range from micro fuel cells to battery replacements in small electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. The primary advantages of DMFC over existing battery technologies are increased power density and energy storage capacity, as well as the potential for uninterrupted operations. However, current DMFC technology suffers from limited power production capabilities. It is necessary to force a system to operate in conditions that correspond to the DMFC maximum power point. Since the DMFC maximum power point is a unique and fixed point of operation, load power requirements must be taken into account and the output voltage will vary with load resistance variations. In this paper, a new configuration for a DMFC/battery hybrid power system with the required controller was proposed and analyzed. The measured results proved the ANFIS controller can maintain a constant DMFC output voltage. The proposed system showed acceptable system operations under different conditions.

This paper presents the structure, operation, and modeling of a nanoelectromechanical NVM based on the switching of a free electrode between two stable states. This electrode, called the shuttle, has no mechanical anchors and commutes between two positions. It is guided inside an insulator pod. Adhesion forces between the shuttle and fixed electrodes serve to hold the shuttle in stable positions. Smooth metal layers give strong Van der Waals stiction between two surfaces in contact. Memory detection is obtained by probing the conductance between two fixed contacts; the shuttle serves as a switchable open/short electrode. Electromechanical contacts have an ideally large resistance ratio between on and off levels. At microscale, gravity is found to be negligible compared with adhesion forces, which motivates the anchorless design for high-temperature data storage. The model proposed is based on charge induction over the surface of metal electrodes and is validated by finite-element method. Kinematic equations and energy transfers of the shuttle device are explored. Due to its unique anchorless design, the scalability of the anchorless shuttle memory is found to be excellent. © 2006 IEEE.","Electrostatic actuation; high-temperature (HT) electronics; microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS); nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices","Adhesion forces; Data storage; Electrostatic actuation; Finite element methods (FEM); High temperature; High voltage; Kinematic equations; Metal electrodes; Metal layer; Micro-scales; Nano electromechanical systems; Nano-electromechanical; Non-volatile memories; Nonvolatile memory devices; P-n junction; Resistance ratio; Stable state; Storage layers; Switchable; Van der waals; Adhesion; Electrodes; Electromechanical devices; Electrostatic actuators; Energy transfer; Finite element method; MEMS; Nonvolatile storage; Semiconductor junctions; Van der Waals forces; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862829684

This work combines the algorithm level, node level, and bit level optimizations to achieve over 2 Gb/s throughput with acceptable hardware cost and power. The algorithm level optimization is the on-demand variable node activation scheduling with concealing channel values, which can not only achieve twice faster decoding convergence speed than log-belief propagation (log-BP) algorithm, but also reduce the 17% message storage capacity. The node level optimization duplicates the check node units and variable node units and unfolds the message storage first-in-first-outs (FIFOs) so that the throughput becomes twelve multiplying with clock frequency. In the meantime, the bit level optimization is employed to retime the critical path such that the higher clock frequency can be achieved and message storage size is slightly reduced. Furthermore, a novel hybrid-partitioned FIFO is proposed to provide sufficient memory bandwidth to processing units and alleviate power consumption. With these schemes, a test chip of proposed LDPC-CC decoder has been fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology with core area of 2.37 × 1.14 mm 2.

It is necessary to study the thermal effects on the HAMR system which includes the head, the media, the head and disk interface (HDI) and data recording and reproducing performance. In this paper, the key thermal issues in the HAMR system and their effects on the recording performances are analyzed and discussed. In the HAMR head, the heat sources are analyzed, and their effects on the temperature increase of the HAMR head are studied. The thermal profile of the media generated by the near field transducer is a determinant for achieving high density. Based on the measured thermal parameters of the medium materials, the thermal profiles of the medium at different medium parameters are studied. The results indicate that the boundary thermal resistance and the insulation of the grains are very important factors for obtaining small thermal spot sizes. The recording performances at a variety of temperatures are analyzed by the simulation of a micro-magnetic modeling. In the HDI, one of the key challenges is if the lubricant film can suffer the dynamic high temperature working environment. The lubricant thermal response for the dynamic high temperature working environment is characterized. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Disk interface; Heat sources; Heat-assisted magnetic recording; High density; High temperature; Lubricant films; Medium material; Micromagnetic modeling; Near-field transducers; Recording performance; Temperature increase; Thermal parameters; Thermal profiles; Thermal response; Thermal spots; Working environment; Magnetic recording; Nonvolatile storage; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861748361

The criterion is based on the area difference of the contour during evolution. In this criterion, the evolution of the contour terminates when the area difference fluctuates around a constant. The termination criterion is tested using parametric gradient vector flow active contour with contour resampling and normal force selection. The usefulness of the criterion is shown through its trend, speed, accuracy, shape insensitivity, and insensitivity to contour resampling. The metric used in the proposed criterion demonstrated a steadily decreasing trend. For automatic implementation in which different shapes need to be segmented, the proposed criterion demonstrated almost 50% and 60% total time reduction while achieving similar accuracy as compared with the pixel movement-based method in the segmentation of synthetic and real medical images, respectively. Our results also show that the proposed termination criterion is insensitive to shape variation and contour resampling. The criterion also possesses potential to be used for other kinds of snakes. © Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine 2011.","Active contour; Area difference; Gradient vector flow; Group average; Termination criterion","Active contours; Area difference; Gradient vector flow; Group average; Termination criteria; Digital image storage; Radiology; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; femur; histology; humerus; image enhancement; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; tibia; Algorithms; Femur; Humerus; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Tibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861639320

Through DMP analysis, it is confirmed that the NH 3 PT not only significantly increases the quality of the surrounding dielectric of metal NCs but also effectively passivates shallow trap sites in the Si 3N 4 trapping layer. As compared with the sample without NH 3 PT, the NH 3-plasmatreated device exhibits better reliability characteristics such as excellent charge retention (only 5% charge loss for 104 s retention time) and very high endurance (no memory window narrowing after 105 program/erase cycles).

This is well accepted for the case of main-chain (MC) LCPs. It is confirmed here for the case of two side-group (SG) LCPs as well. The DSC temperature calibration is usually based on melting of metals like indium and zinc and hence only possible on heating. Being instantaneous, LC transitions are as such very appropriate for DSC temperature calibration. This is demonstrated for the case of two SG-LCPs: one with a side group including an ester group, and one with a nitrostilbene side group. Transition kinetics were studied upon heating and cooling with DSC rates in the range of 2.5-50 K min -1. After room temperature storage, the SG-LCPs studied showed considerable thermal effects due to physical ageing. These endothermic effects could easily be discerned from the instantaneous LC transitions and appeared to be thermally activated, with apparent activation energies depending on the amount of preceding physical ageing: on reheating after melting and cooling about 475 kJ mol -1, while after long-time storage at room temperature 280 kJ mol -1 is obtained. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","differential calorimetry; kinetics; liquid crystalline polymer; temperature calibration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859612099

Many different graphene-based materials are employed by electrochemists as electrodes in sensing and in energy-storage devices. Because the methods for their preparation are inherently different, graphene materials are expected to exhibit different electrochemical behaviors depending on the functionalities and density of defects present. Electrochemical treatment of these ""chemically modified graphenes"" (CMGs) represents an easy approach to alter surface functionalities and consequently tune the electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a preliminary electrochemical characterization of four common chemically modified graphenes, namely: graphene oxide, graphite oxide, chemically reduced graphene oxide, and thermally reduced graphene oxide. These CMGs were compared with graphite as a reference material. Cyclic voltammetry was used to ascertain the chemical functionalities present and to understand the potential ranges in which the materials were electroactive. Electrochemical treatment with either an oxidative or a reductive fixed potential were then carried out to activate these chemically modified graphenes. The effects of such electrochemical treatments on their electrocatalytic properties were then investigated by cyclic voltammetry in the presence of well-known redox probes, such as [Fe(CN) 6] 4-/3-, Fe 3+/2+, [Ru(NH 3) 6] 2+/3+, and ascorbic acid. Thermally reduced graphene oxide exhibited the best electrochemical behavior amongst all of the CMGs, with the fastest rate of heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) and the lowest overpotentials. These findings will have far-reaching consequences for the evaluation of different CMGs as electrode materials in electrochemical devices. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&amp;Co.

Two different acidic solutions, namely H2SO4/HNO3 and FeSO 4/H2SO4/H2O2, were used for etching treatment. A novel electroless deposition process, incorporating supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) fluid, was used to decorate finely-dispersed nano-sized Pt particles on CNTs. The hydrogen storage capacities of various modified CNTs were measured by using a high pressure thermal gravimetric microbalance (HPTGA). The experimental results showed that acidic etching could increase the surface defect density and lead to open-up of the caps of CNTs, resulting in an increase in the active adsorption site for physical sorption of H2. The electroless deposition of nano-Pt particles on CNTs, using conventional electrolyte, could promote chemical sorption of hydrogen via spillover mechanism. By employing sc-CO2 bath, the Pt particle size became much finer and more uniformly distributed on the surfaces of CNTs, giving rise to a high hydrogen storage capacity. When a hybrid process including sc-CO2 Pt decoration following acidic etching was applied to modify CNTs, a substantial enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity (about 2.7 wt%) was observed.

It allows energy storage from photovoltaic panels to a compressed air accumulator. This accumulator is controlled to enable compression and expansion modes under Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT). A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) power converter is as usual connected to the solar cells. An intermediary storage tank consisting of supercapacitors and its associated power converter are inserted as a buffer. They adapt the power extracted from the solar cells under the MPPT condition to the power injected into the hydro-pneumatic system under the MEPT condition. Energy transfer from the solar cells to the hydro-pneumatic system is sequentially operated. The number of cascaded power converters decreases the global efficiency of this hybrid accumulator. This paper introduces a solution that consists of the reduction of the number of power converters. It is obtained by a direct connection of the supercapacitors on the solar panels to lower losses. Taking advantage of the sequential energy transfer, the MPPT mode is kept for the solar panels, as well as the MEPT mode for the hydro-pneumatic accumulator.

One of the most promising configurations for such a device is a thin film based fiber optic detector. We demonstrate that with such a device not only the detection of a specific threshold concentration is possible, but also a quantitative determination of the hydrogen concentration. A varying hydrogen concentration can be measured optically using Pd-Ta alloy sensing materials. The optical properties of a Pd-Ta sensing layer change in a one-to-one relation with the applied partial hydrogen pressure. Thus, in a thin film optic fiber configuration, the hydrogen concentration can be quantitatively determined up to 300 mbar at room temperature in reflection mode. This Pd-Ta sensor remains optically and mechanically stable up to at least 60 hydrogenation cycles without any indication of degradation. The response time during absorption and desorption is fast (typical &lt; 50 s) as compared to Pd based detectors. Furthermore, pressure composition isotherm measurements indicate that the hysteresis between hydrogen absorption and desorption becomes very small for Pd-Ta alloys containing more than 5 at.% Ta, which results in an almost one-to-one relation between the applied hydrogen pressure and the optical response. However, due to the loss of optical response in reflection at higher Ta concentrations, the most optimal composition range between 5.0 and 6 at.% Ta. Furthermore, we find that optical transmission measurements are more sensitive and allow to use higher Ta concentrations of up to 7 at.% and enables the measurement of pressures up to 1000 mbar H 2. The presented research is a first step toward the development of a quantitative fiber optic hydrogen sensor for the measurements of hydrogen concentrations in processes involving the production, transportation, storage and use of hydrogen. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present work was to study the mechanism and kinetics of the hydrogen interaction with rapidly solidified LaMg11Ni by employing in situ synchrotron X-Ray diffraction studies of hydrogen absorption-desorption processes in hydrogen gas or in vacuum. These studies uncovered a number of temperature-dependent phase structural transformations contributing to reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption, including (a) formation of metastable (in hydrogen) solid solutions of Ni in La 2Mg17 with Ni substitution on both La and Mg sites; (b) amorphisation and nanostructuring of the alloys depending on the solidification rate; nanocrystallisation of the amorphous alloys proceeding at rather low glass transition temperatures and yielding nanocrystallites of Mg2Ni/ Mg1.9La0.1Ni and La1.8Mg17Ni 1.0; (c) the mechanism of the Hydrogenation-Disproportionation- Desorption-Recombination processes resulting in a two-step cooperative Mg-assisted phase transformation where a low temperature decomposition of LaH2 led to the recombination of the intermetallics LaMg12 and La2-xMg17Nix. The metastable solid solutions of Ni in the La2Mg17-based intermetallic show high hydrogenation rates and, despite they decompose during the cycling of hydrogen absorption and desorption, the formed on cycling nanocrystallites of Mg2Ni further maintain high catalytic activity of the materials towards the hydrogen absorption. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The metal/oxide/high-k/oxide/silicon (MOHOS)-type memories were fabricated by using two different charge storage layers. The Gd 2O 3 nanocrystal (Gd 2O 3-NC) was used as a charge storage layer due to the discrete nodes, while the HfGdO high-k material was used as a charge storage layer due to the existence of discrete traps. In the case of Gd 2O 3-NC memory, a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometer analysis was used in this study to extract the valence band location and the band-gap of the Gd 2O 3-NC layer. The retention characteristic was also analyzed to extract the trapping level in Gd 2O 3-NC, based on the relationship between trapping energy and discharging time. A band diagram was created to characterize the memory effect of the Gd 2O 3-NC memory. In the case of HfGdO SONOS-type memory, the electrical and physical studies were conducted for HfGdO charge-trapping layers deposited by a dual-sputtered method for silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS)-type nonvolatile memory. The Hf/Gd dual-sputtered power ratio and the Ar/O 2 gas flow ratio were optimized.

The optimal immobilization conditions of enzyme in Ca-alginate beads were investigated and obtained with 2% alginate using 0.5mg/ml enzyme and 0.7M CaCl 2 solution. In order to prevent enzyme from leaking out of the gel beads, Ca-alginate beads were then coated with silicate. Enzyme loading efficiency and immobilization yield for silicate coated beads was determined as 98.1% and 71.27%, respectively and compared with non-coated ones which were 68.5% and 45.80%, respectively. Surface morphologies, structure and elemental analysis of both silicate coated and non-coated alginate beads were also compared using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, silicate coated alginate beads enhanced reusability of esterase in continuous processes compared to non-coated beads. The hydrolytic properties of free and immobilized enzyme in terms of storage and thermal stability as well as the effects of the temperature and pH were determined. It was observed that operational, thermal and storage stabilities of the esterase were increased with immobilization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium alginate; Esterase; Immobilization; Silicate coating","calcium alginate; calcium chloride; recombinant enzyme; recombinant esterase; silicate; unclassified drug; article; chemical analysis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme immobilization; enzyme stability; Geobacillus; geothermal energy; infrared spectroscopy; material coating; nonhuman; pH; process optimization; protein hydrolysis; scanning electron microscopy; spectroscopy; storage; structure analysis; surface property; temperature sensitivity; Turkey (republic); Alginates; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes, Immobilized; Esterases; Geobacillus; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Microspheres; Recombinant Proteins; Silicates; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857748549

Therefore, process control equipment and solenoid valves were used in the TCSWH system for the development. TCSWH was experimentally analyzed at 40°C, 45°C, 50°C and 55°C and it was also compared with the thermosiphon system. A detailed comparison was performed by calculating stored energy, storage tank water temperatures, storage tank water amounts and system efficiencies for both of the systems. As a result, the TCSWH system could provide water temperature at the set value with ±2°C accuracy. In the TCSWH system, the highest average efficiency was obtained as a result of the experiments carried out at 40 and 45°C. In solar water heaters, efficiency is not the only indicator of usable energy amount in the system storage tank. Although efficiencies of the systems of which water amounts at low temperature are high, the energy they store is useless energy. For that reason, the importance of useable energy in the storage tank was emphasized with graphics by comparing TCSWH system to the thermosiphon system. The amount of water was obtained as 84 kg when the control device was set to 45°C in the TCSWH and the amount of water in the thermosiphon system was obtained 52 kg at the same temperature. In addition to average energy efficiency was obtained as 65% for the TCSWH and 60% for the thermosiphon system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Solar energy; Temperature control; Water heater","Control device; Energy and exergy analysis; Low temperatures; Storage tank; Stored energy; System efficiency; Usable energy; Water amount; Water temperatures; Energy efficiency; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Temperature; Temperature control; Water heaters; Tanks (containers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857040078

Hochst. is one of the tree species in dry woodlands of Ethiopia that provides several goods and services. Despite its wide economic and ecological importance, its area coverage is dwindling from time to time, and its natural regeneration is hampered. Hence, long-term prospect for a sustained supply of the goods and services from the species is becoming questionable. The objectives of this study were to investigate: (i) the effect of resin tapping and tree size (DBH) on seed susceptibility to insect attack and the production of viable seeds; and (ii) seed longevity and germination ecology of the seeds of B. papyrifera. We collected seeds from tapped and untapped B. papyrifera stands at Lemlem Terara in Metema District, northwestern Ethiopia. The result showed that both tapped and untapped stands produced comparable insect attacked seeds (tapped stands = 16.6%; untapped stands = 15.8%). Untapped trees yielded significantly (P< 0.0001) higher viable seeds (59%) than continuously tapped trees (49.3%), and trees with medium size (20. cm DBH) provided more viable seeds than bigger (30. cm DBH) and younger trees (10. cm DBH). Longevity of B. papyrifera seeds indicated significant difference in viability under three different temperature regimes (5, 15 and 21 °C), three storage periods (6, 9 and 12. months) and two tapping regimes (tapped and untapped populations). Fire that produced temperatures above 100 °C was lethal to the seeds as it caused complete loss of germinability regardless of exposure time. However, heat with temperatures less than 100 °C did not cause loss of germinability even after an hour of exposure. We also found that light conditions had no significant impact on the germination percentage. In general, viability of the seeds was affected by tapping and tree size but not by storage conditions and period, modest temperature and light conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fire; Frankincense; Insect attack; Resin tapping; Storage; Tree size","Ethiopia; Exposure-time; Frankincense; Germinability; Insect attacks; Light conditions; Medium size; Natural regeneration; Significant impacts; Storage condition; Storage periods; Temperature regimes; Tree size; Tree species; Cultivation; Ecology; Energy storage; Fires; Reforestation; Resins; Seed; commercial species; deciduous tree; germination; heating; insect; light availability; light effect; longevity; regeneration; resin; seed collection; size structure; storage; temperature effect; viability; woodland; Ethiopia; Metema; Boswellia; Boswellia papyrifera; Boswellia sacra; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856435768

Due to the high antibiotic dosage requirement in anti-biofilm therapy, the most suitable formulation for this purpose is the antibiotic nanoparticles themselves, instead of the more extensively studied antibiotic-loaded nano-carriers, which often exhibit low drug loading. The present work details the preparation and characterization of antibiotic nanoparticle complex (or nanoplex) by self-assembly amphiphile-polyelectrolyte complexation process. Ofloxacin (OFX) and levofloxacin (LEV) are used as the antibiotics with dextran sulfate (DXT) as the polyelectrolyte. The nanoplex possesses high drug loading (up to 80%) and size < 400. nm ideal for sputum penetration. Unlike existing methods to prepare drug nanoparticles, the present method is fast, energy-minimal, solvent-free, and highly efficient as manifested in nearly 100% of drug is transformed into nanoplex. The effects of drug-to-polyelectrolyte charge ratio, pH, drug, and salt concentrations on the nanoplex characteristics (i.e. size, stability, drug loading) are investigated from which the optimal preparation conditions have been identified. Higher complexation efficiency and stronger agglomeration tendency are observed for LEV nanoplex owed to its higher hydrophobicity. The antibiotics are completely released from the nanoplex in aqueous salt solution within 3. h and their antimicrobial activity is preserved upon complexation. The nanoplex is readily transformed into amorphous dry powders that remain stable after one-month storage owed to the high glass transition temperature. The antibiotic nanoplexes are highly charged enabling their subsequent functionalization for targeted delivery and controlled drug release purposes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Amphiphiles; Antibiotic; Dextran; Nanoparticles; Polyelectrolyte complexation; Self-assembly","Anti-biofilm; Anti-microbial activity; Aqueous salt solution; Biofilm infections; Charge ratio; Complexation process; Controlled drug release; Dextran sulfates; Drug loading; Drug nanoparticles; Dry powders; Functionalizations; Levofloxacin; Nano scale; Ofloxacin; Polyelectrolyte complexation; Preparation conditions; Salt concentration; Solvent free; Targeted delivery; Amphiphiles; Biofilms; Controlled drug delivery; Dextran; Drug dosage; Glass transition; Loading; Nanoparticles; pH effects; Polyelectrolytes; Self assembly; Antibiotics; dextran sulfate; levofloxacin; nanoparticle; ofloxacin; polyelectrolyte; amphophilicity; antibacterial activity; article; biofilm; chemical phenomena; complex formation; controlled drug release; controlled study; drug loading; drug solubility; drug stability; drug to polyelectrolyte charge ratio; green chemistry; hydrophobicity; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; particle size; pH; pharmacological parameters; powder; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; self assembly amphiphile polyelectrolyte complexation; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Biofilms; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Dextran Sulfate; Electrolytes; Green Chemistry Technology; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Nanoparticles; Ofloxacin; Particle Size; Powders; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Sodium Chloride; Surface-Active Agents; Thermogravimetry; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856102432

The aim of this paper is to study which of these two solar combisystem designs is suitable for different houses. The thermal performance of solar combisystems based on the two different heat storage types is compared. Design/methodology/approach - The thermal performance of Low flow bikini solar combisystems and high flow tank-in-tank solar combisystems is calculated with the simulation program TRNSYS. Two different TRNSYS models based on measurements were developed and used. Findings - Based on the calculations it is concluded that low flow solar combisystems based on bikini tanks are promising for low energy buildings, while solar combisystems based on tank-in-tank stores are attractive for the houses with medium heating demand and old houses with high heating demand. Originality/value - Many different Solar Combisystem designs have been commercialized over the years. In the IEA-SHC Task 26, twenty one solar combisystems have been described and analyzed. Maybe the mantle tank approach also for solar combisystems can be used with advantage? This might be possible if the solar heating system is based on a so-called bikini tank.

Upon applying a voltage difference between the two electrodes, cations move to and are accumulated in electrostatic double layers inside the negatively charged cathode and the anions are removed by the positively charged anode. One of the key parameters for commercial realization of CDI is the salt adsorption capacity of the electrodes. State-of-the-art electrode materials are based on porous activated carbon particles or carbon aerogels. Here we report the use for CDI of carbide-derived carbon (CDC), a porous material with well-defined and tunable pore sizes in the sub-nanometer range. When comparing electrodes made with CDC with electrodes based on activated carbon, we find a significantly higher salt adsorption capacity in the relevant cell voltage window of 1.2-1.4 V. The measured adsorption capacity for four materials tested negatively correlates with known metrics for pore structure of the carbon powders such as total pore volume and BET-area, but is positively correlated with the volume of pores of sizes <1 nm, suggesting the relevance of these sub-nanometer pores for ion adsorption. The charge efficiency, being the ratio of equilibrium salt adsorption over charge, does not depend much on the type of material, indicating that materials that have been identified for high charge storage capacity can also be highly suitable for CDI. This work shows the potential of materials with well-defined sub-nanometer pore sizes for energy-efficient water desalination. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","capacitive deionization; carbide-derived carbons; electrostatic double layer theory; millifluidics; porous electrodes; water desalination","Capacitive deionization; Carbide derived carbon; electrostatic double layer theory; millifluidics; Porous electrodes; water desalination; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Anodes; Carbides; Cathodes; Electrostatics; Ions; Pore size; Porous materials; Water filtration; Desalination; carbon; ion; sodium chloride; water; adsorption; article; chemical model; chemistry; electricity; electrode; isolation and purification; methodology; porosity; salinity; water management; Adsorption; Carbon; Electricity; Electrodes; Ions; Models, Chemical; Porosity; Salinity; Sodium Chloride; Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859147284

Current-voltage measurements demonstrated a highly reproducible state at about 0.65 eV, and the photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed that it complies well with the Ti3d band gap state.

A major limitation of state-of-art supercapacitors lies in their relatively low energy density compared with lithium batteries although they have superior power density and cycle life. Here, we report an additive-free, nano-architectured nickel hydroxide/carbon nanotube (Ni(OH) 2/CNT) electrode for high energy density supercapacitors prepared by a facile two-step fabrication method. This Ni(OH) 2/CNT electrode consists of a thick layer of conformable Ni(OH) 2 nano-flakes on CNT bundles directly grown on Ni foams (NFs) with a very high areal mass loading of 4.85 mg cm -2 for Ni(OH) 2. Our Ni(OH) 2/CNT/NF electrode demonstrates the highest specific capacitance of 3300 F g -1 and highest areal capacitance of 16 F cm -2, to the best of our knowledge. An asymmetric supercapacitor using the Ni(OH) 2/CNT/NF electrode as the anode assembled with an activated carbon (AC) cathode can achieve a high cell voltage of 1.8 V and an energy density up to 50.6 Wh/kg, over 10 times higher than that of traditional electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).

This capacitive bioanode was compared with a noncapacitive bioanode on the basis of performance and storage capacity. The performance and storage capacity were investigated during polarization curves and charge-discharge experiments. During polarization curves the capacitive electrode reached a maximum current density of 1.02 ± 0.04 A/m2, whereas the noncapacitive electrode reached a current density output of only 0.79 ± 0.03 A/m2.

While recent published works identify the lithium superoxide as the main degrading agent for propylene carbonate (PC), there is no clear experimental evidence that the oxygen at the cathode interface layer does not reduce further to peroxide before reacting with PC. Here, we investigate the reactivity of lithium peroxide versus propylene carbonate and find that Li 2O 2 irreversibly decomposes the carbonate solvent, leading to alkyl carbonates. We also show that, compared with a single Li 2O 2 unit in PC, a crystalline surface of Li 2O 2 exhibits an enhanced reactivity. Our findings support the possibility that in lithium/air cells, oxygen may still be reduced to peroxide, with the formation of solid Li 2O 2, which degrades by decomposing PC.

All materials and the memory structure have been investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy, and x ray photo-electron spectroscopy analyses. A conically shaped crystalline Cu (111) nanofilament with a diameter of around 17 nm in the TaO x nanolayer after a current compliance (CC) of 500 μA has been observed, and this has been also characterized by fast Fourier transform. The low resistance state (LRS) decreases as the current compliances (CCs) increased from 1 nA to 1 mA, since the nanofilament diameter increased from 0.04 to 23.4 nm. This is also estimated by bipolar resistive switching characteristics. The resistivity of this crystalline Cu nanofilament is approximately 2300 μω.cm. The nanofilament has a cylindrical shape, with CCs ranging from 1 nA to 10 μA and a conical shape with CCs ranging from 50 μA-1 mA. The resistive switching mechanism has been explained successfully under SET and RESET operations. Improved resistive switching parameters, such as SET voltage, LRS, and high resistance state with consecutive switching cycles are obtained and compared to those of pure GeSe x and TaO x materials. Extrapolated, long program/erase endurance of &gt; 10 6 cycles, attributed to the Al/Cu/GeSe x/TaO x/W structure design, is observed. This resistive switching memory structure shows extrapolated 10 years data retention with a resistance ratio of &gt; 10 at a low CC of 0.1 μA at 50 °C. A large memory size of ∼ 6 Pbit/sq. in. is obtained, considering the nanofilament diameter at a low CC of 0.1 μA.

The primary motivations for DOSNs are privacy and autonomy from big brotherly service providers. However decentralization introduces many challenges. One of the principal problems is to guarantee availability of data even when the data owner is not online, so that others can access the said data even when a node is offline or down. Intuitively this can be solved by replicating the data on other users' machines. Existing DOSN proposals try to solve this problem using heuristics which are agnostic to the various kinds of heterogeneity both in terms of end user resources as well as end user behaviors in such a system. In this paper, we argue that a pragmatic design needs to explicitly allow for and leverage on system heterogeneity, and provide incentives for the resource rich participants in the system to contribute such resources. To that end we introduce SuperNova - a super-peer based DOSN architecture. Super-peers can help (i) bootstrap new peers who are yet to have/find any friends by either providing them storage space, (ii) maintaining a directory of users, so that users can find friends in the network by name or interests, (iii) help peers find other peers to store their content in case they don't have adequate friends to do so, or if their friends are already overloaded. Users may want to become super-peers out of altruism (they want DOSNs to succeed), for the sake of the reputation (e.g., being an influential member for an interest based community) as well as potentially to monetize their special roles (e.g., run advertisements). While proposing the SuperNova architecture, we envision a dynamic system driven by incentives and reputation, however, investigation of such incentives and reputation, and its effect on determining peer behaviors is a subject of our future study. In this paper we instead investigate the efficacy of a super-peer based system at any time point (a snap-shot of the envisioned dynamic system), that is to say, we try to quantify the performance of SuperNova system given any (fixed) mix of peer population and strategies. © 2012 IEEE.","Self-organization; Storage; Super-peers; System architecture","End users; Offline; Online social networks; Open source communities; Resource-Rich; Self-organization; Service provider; Storage spaces; Super-peer; Super-peers; System architectures; Time points; Communication systems; Energy storage; Network architecture; Stars; Websites; Peer to peer networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858025733

The increased use of biomaterials has resulted in higher raw material prices, and there are no signs that indicate a decrease in raw material competition. Additives can be used for different purposes. Partly, they are used to facilitate the use of new raw materials to increase the raw material base, and partly, they are used to decrease the energy use in the pelletizing process. They are also used to increase durability or shelf life. Consequently, it is necessary to do research that systematically investigates the consequences of using additives. In this work, it is investigated how various percentages of different kinds of starch influence pellet properties, including shelf life and energy use in the pelletizing process. Four different starch grades were used: native wheat starch, oxidized corn starch, native potato starch, and oxidized potato starch. The pellets were produced in a small industrial pellet press located at Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden. The result shows that starch increases the durability of the pellets. Oxidized starches increase the durability more than native starches, and the best results were obtained by adding oxidized corn starch. The durability did not decrease with storage time when the pellets were stored indoors during 7 months. The oxidation process was not consistently altered by the addition of starch. The energy consumption of the pellet press decreases when starch is added. Again, the oxidized corn starch showed the best result; when 2.8% of corn starch was added, the average energy consumption was reduced by 14%. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Average energy; Corn starch; Energy use; Karlstad University; Native starch; Oxidation process; Oxidized starch; Pellet properties; Potato starches; Raw material prices; Shelf life; Storage time; Wheat starch; Biological materials; Durability; Energy utilization; Pelletizing; Presses (machine tools); Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858378601

Energy generation from conventional fossil fuels has been identified as the main culprit of environmental degradation from global warming effects, in addition to environmental pollution which arises from rapid industrialization and agricultural development. In order to address these issues, nanotechnology plays an essential role in revolutionizing the applications for energy conversion and storage, environmental monitoring, as well as green engineering of environmental friendly materials. Carbon nanotubes and their hybrid nanocomposites have received immense research attention for their potential applications in various fields due to their unique structural, electronic, and mechanical properties. Here, we review the applications of carbon nanotubes (i) in energy conversion and storage as in solar cells, fuel cells, hydrogen storage, lithium ion batteries, and electrochemical supercapacitors, (ii) in environmental monitoring and wastewater treatment as in the detection and removal of gas pollutants, pathogens, dyes, heavy metals, and pesticides, and (iii) in green nanocomposite design. Integration of carbon nanotubes in solar cells and fuel cells has increased the energy conversion efficiency of these energy conversion applications, which serve as the future sustainable energy sources. Carbon nanotubes doped with metal hydrides show high hydrogen storage capacity of around 6 wt% as a potential hydrogen storage medium. Carbon nanotubes nanocomposites have exhibited high energy capacity in lithium ion batteries and high specific capacitance in electrochemical supercapacitors, in addition to excellent cycle stability. High sensitivity and selectivity towards the detection of environmental pollutants is demonstrated by carbon nanotubes based sensors, as well as the anticipated potentials of carbon nanotubes as adsorbent to remove environmental pollutants, which show high adsorption capacity and good regeneration capability. Carbon nanotubes are employed as reinforcement material in green nanocomposites, which is advantageous in supplying the desired properties, in addition to the biodegradability. This paper presents an overview of the advantages imparted by carbon nanotubes in electrochemical devices of energy applications and green nanocomposites, as well as nanosensor and adsorbent for environmental protection. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The term 'trapped-field magnet'describes a bulk superconductor supporting a trapped magnetic field after amagnetization process. The trapped magnetic field of the superconducting bulk magnethas been reported to be superior to that of a conventional permanent magnet. For furtherenhancements of the trapped magnetic field of the bulk superconductors, it is important toincrease the critical current density (Jc) and the size of the single domain. On the otherhand, the trapped magnetic field depends also on several other parameters, such as theshape and the aspect ratio of the sample and the distance between the sample surface andthe observation point, which is also important for the future design of electrical machinesthat utilize high trapped fields, like motors and generators.For this reason this chapter summarizes the numerical calculation of trappedmagnetic field. It is known that the calculation method using the sand-pile model andBiot-Savart law is useful for the determination of the magnetic characteristics of thesample. At the first stage, it was examined and extended earlier calculations of fielddistribution within the bulk superconductor for constant critical current density.

Indeed, elevated TGF-b has been previously reported in human adipose tissue during morbid obesity and diabetic neuropathy. In this review, we discuss the pleiotropic effects of TGF-b/Smad3 signaling on metabolism and energy homeostasis, all of which has an important part in the etiology and progression of obesity-linked diabetes; these include adipocyte differentiation, white to brown fat phenotypic transition, glucose and lipid metabolism, pancreatic function, insulin signaling, adipocytokine secretion, inflammation and reactive oxygen species production. We summarize the recent in vivo findings on the role of TGF-b/Smad3 signaling in metabolism based on the studies using Smad3-/- mice. Based on the presence of a dual regulatory effect of Smad3 on peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR)b/d and PPARg2 promoters, we propose a unifying mechanism by which this signaling pathway contributes to obesity and its associated diabetes. We also discuss how the inhibition of this signaling pathway has been implicated in the amelioration of many facets of metabolic syndromes, thereby offering novel therapeutic avenues for these metabolic conditions. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Insulin resistance; Metabolism; Obesity; Smad3; TGF-b","acarbose; adipocytokine; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta; cyclic AMP; glucocorticoid; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; interleukin 6; leptin; messenger RNA; metformin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; myogenic factor 5; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); pioglitazone; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinoic acid; retinol binding protein 4; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; sulfonylurea; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta1; adrenergic stimulation; allosterism; amino acid sequence; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; antidiabetic activity; bladder cancer; body fat; body mass; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; cancer risk; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular risk; cell differentiation; cell energy; cell function; cell proliferation; chromatin immunoprecipitation; cohort analysis; cold exposure; cystic fibrosis; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic patient; disease course; dyslipidemia; embryo development; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental stress; enzyme activity; fatty acid blood level; gene expression profiling; gene identification; genetic association; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; growth retardation; heart muscle cell; heart ventricle hypertrophy; hepatitis; homeostasis; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; hypoxia; immune deficiency; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; inflammatory cell; insulin allergy; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin synthesis; intraabdominal fat; knockout mouse; lethality; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; long term exposure; longitudinal study; metabolic syndrome X; morbid obesity; muscle atrophy; muscle hypertrophy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pancreas function; pancreas islet beta cell; phenotype; physical activity; pleiotropy; postnatal growth; priority journal; promoter region; prospective study; review; satellite cell; scleroderma; teratogenicity; thermal exposure; thermogenesis; transgenic mouse; ultraviolet radiation; weight gain; weight reduction; white adipose tissue; wound healing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880748325

The plasma focus device, a non-cylindrical z-pinch device, being a multiple radiation source of ions, electron, soft and hard X-rays, and neutrons, has routinely been used for several applications such as lithography, radiography, imaging, activation analysis, radioisotopes production and more recently for material processing and thin films depositions. This review paper highlights and critically discusses the key features and traits (such as the plasma dynamics, plasma characteristics and energetic ions and electron emission characteristics) of plasma focus device to understand the novelties, opportunities and mechanisms of processing and synthesis of nanophase hard magnetic materials using this device. The results of recent key experimental investigations performed on the modification of various physical properties of PLD grown thin films of FePt by energetic ion exposure in plasma focus device and the deposition of nanostructured CoPt thin films in plasma focus device are reviewed. The FePt and CoPt thin films are believed to be the most prominent candidates for ultra-high density magnetic data storage. The prime requirements for ultra-high density magnetic data storage are: (i) small size of nanoparticles in the range of ̃3-4 nm with narrow size distribution (ii) nanoparticles should be in fct phase, which is achieved by post synthesis annealing at about 600 °C, with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (K u) to overcome the superparamagnetism, and (iii) reduced exchange coupling effects with well-separated distribution of nanoparticles. The reduction of phase transition temperature for transformation from low Ku fccstructured magnetically soft A1 phase to high K u fct-structured magnetically hard L1 phase, control of the fct-(001) orientation of thin films and minimizing grain growth are three key challenges for practical application of FePt and CoPt nanoparticle thin films in data storage These technologically challenging issues were successfully resolved, to some extent, using novel high energy density plasmas of plasma focus device.

The methodology uses a set of day types, evaluating their frequency in real wind data, to generate hourly synthetic wind speed data, which is critical to designing a high wind penetration energy system. The methodology is applied to three different locations and the results compared to a commonly used method for synthetic wind speed data. It is concluded that the new method constitutes an important advance in simulating the occurrence of different types of wind days, which is particularly relevant in energy systems planning, especially in evaluating the frequency and scale of surpluses and shortages of wind power, and the necessity for and dimensioning of a storage system. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Energy systems; High winds; Renewable electricity; Storage systems; Wind data; Wind speed data; Electric generators; Wind power; Wind effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860466739

Physisorption of hydrogen molecules could be observed from the distribution pattern of the hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the nanomaterials. Because of the cone geometry effect, the open-tip CNCs could have larger storage weight percentage and less desorption of hydrogen molecules (caused by the temperature growth) on their outer surfaces, as compared with those of the reference CNT. The hydrogen molecules inside the CNCs and the reference CNT, however, were noted to have similar desorption behaviors owing to the confinement effects from the structures of the nanomaterials. In addition, the sharper CNC could have higher storage weight percentage but the cone sharpness does not have evident enhancement in the average adsorption energy of the CNC.

This paper describes the InfraCCS model, which can determine the likely extent and cost of the optimal least-cost CO 2 transport network at European scale for the period 2015-2050, with 2015 the earliest foreseeable starting date of the CCS projects co-funded by the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR), and 2050 the EU's target date for 80-95% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The computation is made possible by a number of methodological innovations compared to previous research, in particular: the use of k-means clustering to reduce the number of nodes in the network; the application of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm for pipeline pre-selection; and the introduction of a mathematically convenient yet realistic new pipeline costing model. The InfraCCS tool is applied to determine the optimal network corresponding to a CCS scenario that ensures near-complete decarbonisation of the European power sector. It is shown that the size of the CO 2 network could range from 11,000 to 17,000km by 2050, requiring 16-36 billion euros investment, with the higher numbers corresponding to the case when onshore aquifers are excluded as potential CO 2 storage sites. Since the model shows that by 2030 more than half of the EU Member States could be involved in cross-border CO 2 transport, international coordination seems crucial for the development of an optimised trans-European CO 2 transport network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CCS; CO 2; Infrastructure; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimisation; Pipelines","CCS; Costing model; Cross-border; Delaunay triangulation; Infrastructure; International coordination; K-means clustering; Low-carbon; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimal networks; Optimisations; Power sector; Pre-selection; Storage sites; Transport infrastructure; Transport networks; Aquifers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Investments; Optimization; Pipelines; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; linear programing; numerical model; optimization; pipeline; underground storage; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858386966

There are three reaction pathways for OSR using these metals. Ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde on Cu, Ag and Au, and it can be dehydrated to form ethylene on Co, Ni, Pd and Pt. Ethylene can form coke and degrade catalysts after the long-term OSR. In the third pathway, ethanol preferentially breaks its C-C bond and is further oxidized to CO or CO 2 on Ru, Rh and Ir, providing optimal hydrogen production. In addition, increasing H 2O/ethanol and O 2/ethanol ratios can improve catalytic activity, attributable to atomic oxygen from H 2O and O 2 efficiently rupturing the C-C bond of ethanol. This concept explains the improved performance of OSR on the CeO 2-modified catalyst, which shows better oxygen storage capability. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, the equilibrium pressure is hardly affected, as also the entropy of reaction changes. To understand this thermodynamic behavior it is essential to understand the structure of the phases present in the Ti-doped Mg2Ni system in metallic and hydrogenated state. We used Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) to investigate the local coordination of Ni and Ti atoms in Mg-Ni-Ti thin films both in the as-prepared as well as in the hydrogenated state. In the as-prepared state two phases, Mg2Ni and TiNi or TiNi3, are formed, which transform in a single Ti-doped Mg2NiH4 phase in the hydrogenated state. These results are consistent with previous DFT calculations for this system. Copyright © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes could be attractive hydrogen sorbent for two reasons: firstly, its porous structure allows easy access of hydrogen into the interior of the nanotubes; and secondly, the doubly bonded nitrogen at its pore edges provides active sites for either the adsorption of hydrogen (chemically and physically), or functionalization with metal catalysts. Our calculations show that an isolated nanotube can uptake up to 4.66 wt. % hydrogen, with an average overall hydrogen adsorption energy of about -0.22 eV per H atom. In the form of a bulk bundle, the hydrogen storage capacity is enhanced due to the increased availability of space among the tubes. We predict that the hydrogen storage capacity in the bundle is at least 5.45 wt. %. Importantly, hydrogen molecules can easily access the tube's interior due to the low energy barrier (∼0.54 eV) for their passage through the pores, indicating a fast uptake rate at relatively low pressure and temperature. Our findings show that graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes should be applicable to practical hydrogen storage because of the high gravimetric capacity and fast uptake rate.

However, they are limited in power, memory, and computational capacities. A large number of tiny sensors are usually deployed randomly to monitor one or more phenomena to collect and process the sensed data, and to send the data back to the sink. Many literatures focus on developing power-saving protocols. In addition, many papers present data storage schemes but they do not take power saving into consideration. Hence, these data storage schemes cannot perform well based on power-saving protocols. Therefore, it is very critical to propose a data storage scheme to support power-saving mechanism. In this paper, we propose a power-saving data storage scheme for WSN. Our scheme adopts grid-based architecture, in which each grid guarantees that two sensors will stay in active mode while the others stay in sleep mode to save energy. Simulation results show that our power-saving data storage scheme can reduce energy consumption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the temperature at which the phosphors are excited and the spectral distribution of the excitation light on the ability to store energy in the phosphors lattices are investigated. We show that for these phosphors this storage process is thermally activated upon excitation in the lower 5d excited states of Eu 2, with the lowest thermal barrier for europium doped Ca 2Si 5N 8. Also, the influence of co-doping with thulium on the trap filling and afterglow behavior is studied.

Box 17, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","In temperate regions, such as the Mediterranean basin, there is a diurnal excess of energy nearly every day of the year, which is usually dissipated through natural ventilation. However, since suboptimal nighttime temperatures limit productivity of unheated greenhouses for several months a year, extracting the daytime excess energy and reusing it to heat the greenhouse during the night would increase productivity, or at least reduce energy consumption of greenhouses that are heated. This heat extraction would have the additional advantage of reducing ventilation requirement thereby increasing the scope for carbon dioxide fertilization. To achieve this, the performance of the greenhouse as a solar collector has to be maximized by an efficient heat exchanging and heat buffering system. The aim of this research was to define the optimum combination of heat exchange rate, maximum water flow rate of a heat storage buffer and buffer capacity in a commercial greenhouse in the Mediterranean region (Sicily, Italy, 37 °N), the cost function being represented by the dose (duration × intensity) of low temperature events. The greenhouse temperature was calculated through a previously validated greenhouse climate simulation model, applied to one-year of real local data. The effect of the buffer on the cost function was first calculated for a range of heat exchange values followed by a cost function evaluation for nodes of a pre-selected grid, each node representing a value-pair for the other two buffer defining parameters. In this paper we analyze the trend of the cost function with respect to each parameter of the buffer and how this is affected by the preset tolerance of low temperatures. Furthermore, we discuss a simple method to find an ""optimal"" configuration of the buffer. Finally, a combination of 3000 m3 ha-1 buffer capacity, 45 m3 h -1 ha-1 maximum water flow rate and an overall heat transfer coefficient of 5 W m-2 K-1 is selected (heat transfer coefficient is defined per m2 greenhouse floor area).","Extreme temperatures; Heat buffer; Mild winter regions",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863650309

The unique architecture is realized through a modified sol-gel process to formulate highly porous cryogel using freeze-drying in the presence of a soft template. Small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the organization of the Co 3O 4 porous structure. The unique channels in this hierarchical pores network provide intimate electrolyte contact with cobalt oxide and facilitate electrolyte diffusion.

Methacrylate- functionalized GO sheets can be cross-linked instantaneously at the water-air interface to form a highly wrinkled membrane spreading over an extended area. The multiple covalent linkages amongst the GO sheets enhances the in-plane stiffness of the film compared to noncovalently bonded GO films. The highly convoluted GO membrane can be used in two applications: the promoting of spontaneous stem-cell differentiation towards bone cell lineage without any chemical inducers, and for supercapacitor electrodes. Due to reduced van der Waals restacking, capacitance values up to 211 F g -1 can be obtained. The scalable and inexpensive nature of this assembly route enables the engineering of membranes for applications in regenerative medicine and energy-storage devices where secondary structures like nanotopography and porosity are important performance enhancers.

To adapt well to bursty request arrival patterns with self-similarity and a service provider (SP, i.e., hard disk or WLAN NIC, in this paper) with multiple inactive states, the proposed AH-DPM first derives the average idle time of the SP in the bursty (ON) period and non-bursty (OFF) period separately. Then, to achieve better power saving, we use the average idle time in the ON period to adjust the timeout value more precisely and use the average idle time in the OFF period to decide which inactive state the SP should be switched to. Experimental results based on real traces show that, for the hard disk, the average power consumption of the proposed AH-DPM is better than that of the Adaptive Timeout (ATO), Machine Learning (ML), Predictive, Static Timeout (STO), and Stochastic algorithms. In addition, the average response time of the proposed AH-DPM algorithm is still lower than that specified in a typical hard disk specification. As to the WLAN NIC, experimental results show that the average power consumption of the proposed AH-DPM is comparable to that of the Oracle (theoretically optimal), ATO, and Predictive algorithms, and is better than that of the ML, STO, and Stochastic algorithms. However, the average packet transmission delay of the proposed AH-DPM is better than that of the ATO and Predictive algorithms. Therefore, by providing a better tradeoff between average power consumption and average response time (or average packet transmission delay), the proposed AH-DPM algorithm is very feasible for extending the battery lifetime of ever increasing mobile devices that are equipped with hard disks and WLAN NICs. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Hard disk; Mobile device; Power management; Self-similarity; WLAN NIC","Arrival patterns; Average power; Battery lifetime; Hybrid dynamics; Idle time; Packet transmission delays; Power efficient; Power management; Power savings; Predictive algorithms; Real trace; Self-similarities; Self-similarity; Service provider; Stochastic algorithms; WLAN NIC; Energy management; Hard disk storage; Mobile devices; Packet networks; Stochastic systems; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856043121

It reduces hyperglycemia in diabetic rats and humans. However, the mechanism(s) of its hypoglycemic effect remain(s) unknown. Honey comprises many constituents, making it difficult to ascertain which component(s) contribute(s) to its hypoglycemic effect. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that honey consists of predominantly fructose and glucose. The objective of this review is to summarize findings which indicate that fructose exerts a hypoglycemic effect. The data show that glucose and fructose exert a synergistic effect in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. This synergistic effect might enhance intestinal fructose absorption and/or stimulate insulin secretion. The results indicate that fructose enhances hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and storage via activation of hepatic glucokinase and glycogen synthase, respectively. The data also demonstrate the beneficial effects of fructose on glycemic control, glucose- and appetite-regulating hormones, body weight, food intake, oxidation of carbohydrate and energy expenditure. In view of the similarities of these effects of fructose with those of honey, the evidence may support the role of fructose in honey in mediating the hypoglycemic effect of honey.","Diabetes mellitus; Fructose; Honey; Hypoglycemic effect; Liver; Pancreas","antidiabetic agent; fructose; animal; honey; human; review; Animals; Fructose; Honey; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857575307

It uses mechanical components only-a flywheel, clutches, gears, and a continuously variable transmission-for its hybrid functionalities of brake energy recuperation, reduction of inefficient part-load operation of the engine, and engine shutoff during vehicle standstill. This powertrain has mechanical characteristics, such as a relatively small energy storage capacity in the form of the compact flywheel and multiple driving modes to operate the powertrain because of the use of clutches. The optimization problem is complex because it is twofold: 1) to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and 2) to find the optimal power distribution between the engine, the flywheel, and the vehicle. Dynamic programming is used to compute the globally optimal EMS for six representative driving cycles. The main design criterion is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, subject to the system's kinematics, dynamics, and constraints. The results provide a benchmark of the fuel-saving potential of this powertrain design and give insight into the optimal utilization of the flywheel system. In addition, the complexity (and computation time) of the problem is reduced by a priori (static) optimization of the power distribution for each driving mode. Static optimization of a dynamic optimization problem yields a suboptimal solution; however, the results show that the consequences on the fuel saving are small with respect to the optimal one (the difference is < 0.8%). © 2012 IEEE.","Continuously variable transmission (CVT); Energy management; Flywheel; Mechanical energy storage; Optimal control","Computation time; Continuously variable transmission; Design criterion; Driving cycle; Driving mode; Dynamic optimization problems; Energy recuperation; Flywheel systems; Fuel savings; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical components; Mechanical energies; Optimal controls; Optimal energy; Optimal power; Optimal sequence; Optimal utilization; Optimization problems; Part load; Power distributions; Powertrain design; Small energy; Static optimization; Suboptimal solution; Control; Design; Energy management; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuel economy; Hybrid powertrains; Vehicle transmissions; Wheels; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857311744

RS was performed at three solidification rates, 300-2000 rpm. Ni was found to form a solid solution replacing both La and Mg to yield La 1.7Mg16.7Ni0.6 intermetallic. With increasing RS cooling rates, the very fine, almost amorphous microstructures were formed. The LaMg11Ni alloy solidified at the highest cooling rate exhibited the fastest hydrogenation kinetics, reaching maximum hydrogenation capacity of 5.02 wt. % H.

A mixed H2SO4/H2O2 solution containing ferrous ions (Fe2+) is useful to open the caps, to shorten the length, and to generate defects on CNTs. The Pd catalysts are deposited on the CNTs with the aid of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2); as a result, a highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles and an intimate connection between Pd and carbon surface can be obtained. Combination of the two approaches can optimize a hydrogen spillover reaction on CNTs, resulting in a superior hydrogen storage capacity of 1.54 wt% (at 25 °C and 6.89 MPa), which corresponds to an enhancement factor of ∼4.5 as compared to that of pristine CNTs. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Too few long-term intervention studies in humans have examined the effects of soft drinks. Objective: We compared the effects of SSSDs with those of isocaloric milk and a noncaloric soft drink on changes in total fat mass and ectopic fat deposition (in liver and muscle tissue). Design: Overweight subjects (n = 47) were randomly assigned to 4 different test drinks (1 L/d for 6 mo): SSSD (regular cola), isocaloric semiskim milk, aspartame-sweetened diet cola, and water. The amount of intrahepatic fat and intramyocellular fat was measured with 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other endpoints were fat mass, fat distribution (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging), and metabolic risk factors. Results: The relative changes between baseline and the end of 6-mo intervention were significantly higher in the regular cola group than in the 3 other groups for liver fat (132-143%, sex-adjusted mean; P &lt; 0.01), skeletal muscle fat (117-221%; P &lt; 0.05), visceral fat (24-31%; P &lt; 0.05), blood triglycerides (32%; P &lt; 0.01), and total cholesterol (11%; P &lt; 0.01). Total fat mass was not significantly different between the 4 beverage groups. Milk and diet cola reduced systolic blood pressure by 10-15% compared with regular cola (P &lt; 0.05). Otherwise, diet cola had effects similar to those of water. Conclusion: Daily intake of SSSDs for 6 mo increases ectopic fat accumulation and lipids compared with milk, diet cola, and water. Thus, daily intake of SSSDs is likely to enhance the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

While a large injection rate can reduce the cost associated with injection, an indefinitely large injection rate can result in excessive formation damage. To obtain an optimal injection rate without exceeding the safe pressure limits, one will like to have some knowledge of the transient pressure buildup characteristics resulting from a particular injection rate. While elaborate numerical simulations can provide reliable pressure buildup predictions, they require extensive knowledge about the formation, which is normally not available at the start of an injection process. To alleviate this problem, using some simplifying assumptions, we have developed a solution to predict the transient buildup of pressure resulting from injection of supercritical carbon dioxide from a partially penetrating well into a gas reservoir. The solution in space and time is first obtained in the Fourier-Laplace transform space, and then inverted back into real space (in cylindrical coordinates) and time. We use the solution to study pressure transient characteristics for different formation permeabilities and anisotropy ratios. Results obtained using the solution compared well with those from numerical simulations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

FCs operate with relatively higher efficiencies as compared to internal combustion engines due to the direct conversion of chemical energy to electricity by electrochemical reactions. However, there exist a number of obstacles for their widespread acceptance and integration in our daily lives. These obstacles can be summarized as the high cost of FCs due to the high costs of materials, the need to process fuels to very high-purity levels, the unacceptable declines in performance with time as well as the absence of a H 2 infrastructure. Applications of supercritical fluids (SCFs) in synthesis of novel materials and development of new processing techniques offer a wide range of opportunities that can help commercialization of FCs. These include the preparation of micro or nanoarchitectured materials in a highly controllable manner for electrolyte-electrode assemblies of a wide variety of FCs including proton exchange membrane FCs (PEMFCs) and solid oxide FCs (SOFCs). In this extent, materials synthesized using SCFs are (at least) comparable or superior in performance as compared to their conventional counterparts. The synthesis and processing of novel materials necessary for efficient hydrogen storage/processing and design of novel processes for H 2 production may also benefit from the use of SCFs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The kinetics analysis of the AB hydrolysis shows that hydrogen production is of the first-order reaction in regard to both concentrations of ammonia borane and catalysts initially present, respectively. The hydrolyzate of ammonia borane after hydrogen evolution is also characterized with XRD, FT-IR and 11B NMR. Boric acid (H 3BO 3) is found to be the dominant product in the hydrolyzate. Besides, the produced gas is discovered to contain both hydrogen and ammonia according to the GC-MS analysis and the indophenol colorimetric analysis. A possible reaction pathway on hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane is, accordingly, proposed based on the existence of boric acid, hydrogen and ammonia in the products.

FA biomarkers in the suspended particulate matter roughly mirrored phytoplankton dynamics in the water column, consisting of a small diatom dominance early spring, succeeded by a mass Phaeocystis peak followed by a mixed diatom-dinoflagellate bloom. Deposition and subsequent bacterial degradation of the phytoplankton bloom were also reflected in sediment FA biomarkers. The main distinction in FA biomarker concentration within macrobenthic tissue was observed at the species level (48% of variation), the diet of L. conchilega consisting of bacteria and diatoms and that of N. hombergii also of diatoms, but including more dinoflagellates and invertebrates. Temporal variation explained 17%: the two species retained more bacterial and Phaeocystis markers before the bloom, while they accumulated more poly-unsaturated FA after the bloom.

Policy-makers are urged to regulate the matter without conclusive scientific evidence concerning the scale and severity of indirect land-use change (iLUC). By looking at this situation as an instance of policy making in the context of scientific uncertainty, this study analyses ways to deal with iLUC of biofuels policies learning from policy fields where similar dilemmas were confronted in the past. The experience with technologies such as genetically modified organisms, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and radioactive waste, and transport biofuels is instructive for this purpose. Policy approaches identified in the case studies are applied to the case of iLUC. The results show that a preventive approach, which appears as the most practical choice in terms of effectiveness and stakeholders' acceptability, however, also involves a risk of treating scientific uncertainty as certainty (the uncertainty paradox). Policy-makers, scientists and stakeholders all have responsibility to avoid this paradox, in order to limit future controversy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel; ILUC; Land use; Policy; Uncertainty","biofuel; carbon; article; carbon storage; DNA modification; environmental planning; land use; management; nuclear energy; priority journal; radioactive waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455224631

We have reviewed (analogous) environmental impact assessment procedures and scientific literature on carbon capture and storage (CCS) options. Analogues include the construction of new power plants, transport of natural gas by pipelines, underground natural gas storage (UGS), natural gas production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. It is investigated whether crucial knowledge on environmental impacts is lacking that may postpone the implementation of CCS projects. This review shows that the capture of CO2 from power plants results in a change in the environmental profile of the power plant. This change encompasses both increase and reduction of key atmospheric emissions, being: NOx, SO 2, NH3, particulate matter, Hg, HF and HCl. The largest trade-offs are found for the emission of NOx and NH3 when equipping power plants with post-combustion capture. Synergy is expected for SO2 emissions, which are low for all power plants with CO2 capture. An increase in water consumption ranging between 32% and 93% and an increase in waste and by-product creation with tens of kilotonnes annually is expected for a large-scale power plant (1 GWe), but exact flows and composition are uncertain. The cross-media effects of CO2 capture are found to be uncertain and to a large extent not quantified. For the assessment of the safety of CO2 transport by pipeline at high pressure an important knowledge gap is the absence of validated release and dispersion models for CO2 releases. We also highlight factors that result in some (not major) uncertainties when estimating the failure rates for CO 2 pipelines. Furthermore, uniform CO2 exposure thresholds, detailed dose-response models and specific CO2 pipeline regulation are absent. Most gaps in environmental information regarding the CCS chain are identified and characterized for the risk assessment of the underground, non-engineered, part of the storage activity. This uncertainty is considered to be larger for aquifers than for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Failure rates are found to be heavily based on expert opinions and the dose-response models for ecosystems or target species are not yet developed. Integration and validation of various sub-models describing fate and transport of CO2 in various compartments of the geosphere is at an infant stage. In conclusion, it is not possible to execute a quantitative risk assessment for the non-engineered part of the storage activity with high confidence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A bovine bone powder was sintered at different temperatures ranging from 500 to 1400°C. The influences of post-irradiation storage on the radiation ESR response of the bovine bone powder before and after sintering were also studied. The results indicate that the sintered bovine bone powder contained hydroxyapatite. Diffraction patterns were sharp and clear based on the (211), (300), and (202) reflections corresponding to bovine hydroxyapatite (BHA), which confirmed the phase purity and high crystalline grade of the BHA produced. The PXRD profile of BHA was dependent on sintering temperatures and times. The molecular formula of BHA was determined by Rietveld analysis showed a similar structure and composition to calcium hydroxyapatite in hexagonal P63/m space group a=b=9.435Å and c=6.895Å. ESR data showed that the sintering process can decrease the number of free radicals in BHA; it also revealed that the number of free radicals is constant during long storage periods (75 days).

The proposed generator system employs a three-phase cage induction machine and generates single-phase and constant-frequency electricity at varying rotor speeds without an intermediate inverter stage. The technique uses any one of the three stator phases of the machine as the excitation winding and the remaining two phases, which are connected in series, as the power winding. The two-series-connected-and-one-isolated (TSCAOI) phase winding configuration magnetically decouples the two sets of windings, enabling independent control. Electricity is generated through the power winding at both sub- and super-synchronous speeds with appropriate excitation to the isolated single winding at any frequency of generation. A dynamic mathematical model, which accurately predicts the behavior of the proposed generator, is also presented and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. Experimental results of a 2-kW prototype generator under various operating conditions are presented, together with theoretical results, to demonstrate the viability of the TSCAOI power generation.

It will be necessary to efficiently draw the energy from these two sources as well as recharge the energy storage elements by the dc bus. In this paper, a bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter controlled by phase-shift angle and duty cycle for the fuel-cell hybrid energy system is analyzed and designed. The proposed topology minimizes the number of switches and their associated gate driver components by using two high-frequency transformers that combine a half-bridge circuit and a full-bridge circuit together on the primary side. The voltage doubler circuit is employed on the secondary side. The current-fed input can limit the input current ripple that is favorable for fuel cells. The parasitic capacitance of the switches is used for zero voltage switching (ZVS). Moreover, a phase-shift and duty-cycle modulation method is utilized to control the bidirectional power flow flexibly and it also makes the converter operate under a quasi-optimal condition over a wide input voltage range. This paper describes the operation principle of the proposed converter, the ZVS conditions, and the quasi-optimal design in depth. The design guidelines and considerations regarding the transformers and other key components are given.

This results in the hot spot problem since the nodes close to the sink have a tendency to consume more energy in relaying data from other nodes. Many approaches using mobile sinks have been proposed to prevent this problem, but these approaches still suffer from the buffer overflow problem due to the limited memory capacity of the sensor nodes. This paper proposes an approach in which the mobile sink traverses a subset of nodes. Given the characteristics of wireless communication, such an approach can effectively alleviate the buffer overflow problem without incurring additional energy consumption. To further alleviate the buffer overflow problem, we propose the Allotment Mechanism which allows nodes with different data sampling rates to share their memory and, thus, extend the overflow deadline. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified via the GloMoSim network simulator. The results show that our approach incurs fewer buffer overflows than other data-gathering schemes. © 2012 Po-Liang Lin and Ren-Song Ko.",,"Buffer overflows; Data sampling; GloMoSim; Heterogeneous sensor networks; Hot spot problem; Limited memory; Mobile sinks; Multi-hop forwarding; Network simulators; Wireless communications; Buffer storage; Energy utilization; Sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855585778

Measured values were then compared to evaporation under saturated canopy conditions (E) determined with the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, using (i) measured (eddy covariance) and (ii) calculated (as a function of forest height and wind speed) values for the aerodynamic conductance to momentum flux (g a,M). E was also derived using the energy balance equation and the sensible heat flux measured by a sonic anemometer (H s). I per sampling occasion was strongly correlated with rainfall (P): I=0.21P+0.60 (mm), r 2=0.82, n=121. Values for canopy storage capacity (S=0.37mm) and the average relative evaporation rate (E/R=0.20) were derived from data for single events (n=51). Application of the Gash analytical interception model to 70 multiple-storm sampling events using the above values for S and E/R gave excellent agreement with measured I. For E/R=0.20 and an average rainfall intensity (R) of 3.16mmh -1, the TF-based E was 0.63mmh -1, about four times the value derived with the P-M equation using a conventionally calculated g a,M (0.16mmh -1). Estimating g a,M using wind data from a nearby but more exposed site yielded a value of E (0.40mmh -1) that was much closer to the observed rate, whereas E derived using the energy balance equation and H s was very low (0.13mmh -1), presumably because H s was underestimated due to the use of too short a flux-averaging period (5-min). The best agreement with the observed E was obtained when using the measured g a,M in the P-M equation (0.58mmh -1). The present results show that in areas with complex topography, g a,M, and consequently E, can be strongly underestimated when calculated using equations that were derived originally for use in flat terrain; hence, direct measurement of g a,M using eddy covariance is recommended. The currently measured g a,M (0.31ms -1) was at least several times, and up to one order of magnitude higher than values reported for forests in areas with flat or gentle topography (0.03-0.08ms -1, at wind speeds of about 1ms -1). The importance of g a,M at the study site suggests a negative, downward, sensible heat flux sustains the observed high evaporation rates during rainfall. More work is needed to better quantify H s during rainfall in tropical forests with complex topography. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Aerodynamic conductance; Evaporation; Interception; Sensible heat flux; Throughfall; Topography","Canopy conditions; Canopy storage; Complex topographies; Direct measurement; Eddy covariance; Energy balance equations; Evaporation rate; Flat terrains; Forest height; High evaporation rate; Momentum flux; Penman-Monteith; Rain forests; Rainfall intensity; Rainfall interception; Sensible heat flux; Single event; Sonic anemometer; Stemflow; Study sites; Throughfall; Tropical forest; Wet canopy evaporation; Wind data; Wind speed; Aerodynamics; Energy balance; Evaporation; Heat flux; Phase transitions; Rain; Satellite interception; Topography; Forestry; aerodynamics; anemometer; canopy; complex terrain; eddy covariance; evaporation; interception; montane forest; Penman-Monteith equation; rainfall; rainforest; sensible heat flux; stemflow; stomatal conductance; throughfall; wind velocity; Aerodynamics; Evaporation; Forestry; Rain; Satellites; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855190045

With grid controls, energy transmission management could be enhanced and resilience to control-system failures would be increased. Processing chips and storage units have been embedded into traditional electricity meters, so that they are capable of performing smart functions, called smart meters. Then, smart meters communicate with electrical appliances at home as well as the generation and management facilities at the power companies. Although deploying the smart grid has numerous social and technical benefits, several security and privacy concerns arise. Attackers might compromise smart meters, eavesdrop the communication, or hack into the power company's database, to access power consumption data of the victim, from which they learn about the victim's daily activities. Recently, various security and privacy vulnerabilities and threats have been studied in the research literature, however, most of the problems remain yet to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to design secure smart grid communication protocols that could prevent all possible security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose an anonymous authentication protocol for securing communication among various smart meters of the smart grid. The proposed protocol can achieve key agreement between smart meters and fully protect user privacy with low computation overhead. In addition, the analysis shows that the proposed protocol can satisfy the desirable security requirements and resist several notorious attacks.","Anonymous; Authentication; Smart grid; Smart meters","Anonymous; Anonymous authentication; Computation overheads; Daily activity; Electric systems; Electrical appliances; Electricity meters; Energy transmission; Energy usage; Grid control; Key agreement; Power company; Power infrastructures; Security and privacy; Security requirements; Security vulnerabilities; Smart grid; Smart meters; Storage units; Transmission and distribution; User privacy; Authentication; Electric power measurement; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Industry; Innovation; Power quality; Security of data; Systems engineering; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555191182

Within these firms, there is a continuous battle over where to locate R&D and production. For reasons such as national import restrictions and logistics, production tends to be located in several different countries. By contrast, automotive R&D tends to be more concentrated. This is because it is based on a systemic knowledge base, comprising both tacit and codified pieces of knowledge (Breschi and Malerba, 1997). Effective coordination under such circumstances relies on territorial proximity. Still, the global automotive manufacturers must ensure that their R&D maintains a connection with regional market requirements. Being a small country with a limited domestic market, Swedish car production is marginal from a global perspective: in 2007, the production of the Swedish car manufacturers Volvo Cars and Saab Automobile amounted to only 0.6 per cent of the total production worldwide (Faguert et al., 2009). By contrast, the Swedish heavy vehicle industry (trucks, buses, etc.) has a remarkably strong position. In 2007 the Swedish heavy vehicle manufacturers Volvo and Scania had as much as 28 per cent European market share and controlled about 10 per cent of the world’s production of heavy commercial vehicles. The automotive industry is very important for the Swedish economy. In 2008 its exports amounted to 13 per cent of total Swedish exports (BIL Sweden, 2009) and besides ICT (information and communication technology), the automotive industry is the largest sector in Sweden in terms of R&D spending (Norgren et al., 2007). Combining combustion engines with electric drives, hybridization has been proposed as one of the most promising routes to reduce vehicular CO2 emissions in a short-to mid-term perspective (Hekkert et al., 2005; Schäfer et al., 2006). Hybrid-electric vehicle technology includes a range of technological options, e.g. in terms of different configurations (series, parallel, power-split), degrees of hybridization (micro, mild, full, plug-in) and in different key subsystems technologies (e.g. energy storage, electric machines, power electronics). In particular, hybrid-electric vehicle technology enables significantly reduced fuel consumption in drive cycles characterized by frequent acceleration/deceleration, such as urban traffic. Hybridization may also pave the way for further electrification of the transport system, which may result in additional CO2 emission reduction. During the last decade, hybrid-electric vehicle technology has established itself as a viable alternative for passenger cars, a development that has mainly been promoted by Japanese car manufacturers. In contrast, the application of this technology in heavy vehicles is still in an infant stage. However, since many heavy vehicles operate in urban traffic (e.g. inner-city buses, distribution trucks, refuse trucks), there is a significant potential for fuel efficiency gains in these applications. Based on a case study of the development of hybrid-electric vehicle technology in Sweden over the period 1990-2010, this chapter analyses how governance arrangements on different levels can interplay to facilitate innovation systems conducive to sustainable vehicle technologies. The discourse begins in the theoretical foundations on governance and technological innovation systems (TIS). The research design is then explained, followed by our three analytical steps: a historical exposé of the TIS development; scrutiny of how various governance arrangements have influenced the TIS; and the analysis of how different levels of governance have interacted. The final section draws conclusions related to the governance of innovation systems for sustainable automotive technologies. © 2012 Selection and editorial material, Måns Nilsson, Karl Hillman, Annika Rickne and Thomas Magnusson; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122388941

In the absence of a priori information about the trip, a straightforward strategy is to first deplete the battery down to a minimum level and then keep the state of charge (SoC) around this level. However, largely due to the battery losses, the overall fuel economy can be improved if the battery is discharged gradually. This requires some a priori knowledge about the trip. This paper investigates the tradeoff between improved fuel economy and the need for a priori information. This investigation is done using a variant of telemetry equivalent consumption minimization strategy (T-ECMS) which is modified to be used for a PHEV. To implement this strategy, several parameters need to be tuned based on an assumption of the future trip. By studying two different levels of details, the tradeoff between fuel economy and a priori information is evaluated. It is shown that the proposed strategy improves the fuel economy considerably even when general information is available. However, increase in the details of the a priori information improves the fuel economy even further.

These risks emanate particularly from nuclear waste that needs to be isolated from the biosphere for very long periods of time. Principles of intergenerational equity currently underlie waste management policies, arguing that we should not impose undue burdens on future generations. This chapter scrutinizes the way in which such intergenerational equity principles deal with the issue of long-term risks. The present consensus within the nuclear community is that nuclear waste should be buried in geological repositories rather than kept in surface storage places. This is particularly based on the notion that repositories are believed to be safer in the long run. Such long-term safety seems to be disputable as it relies on great long-term uncertainties which, in turn, necessitate sanctioning a distinction between different future people. Putting distant future generations at a disadvantage does, however, lack solid moral justification, which should urge us to reconsider our temporal moral obligations in the light of recent technological developments. The technological possibility of substantially reducing the waste lifetime through Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) is believed to challenge geological disposal, thus placing long-term surface storage in a new perspective. P&T is, however, a laboratory-scale technology which means that substantial investment will be required before industrial deployment can take place. Moreover, the deployment of this technology creates additional safety risks and economic burdens for the present generation. Nevertheless, the potential possibility to diminish '‘undue burdens’’ for future generations is too relevant to be neglected in discussions on nuclear waste management policies. The question that will furthermore be explored is to what extent should we rely on future technological possibilities in today’s policy-making?. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027695204

Three concepts are based on the idea of an energy hub - bio hub, geo hub and a solar hub. Other concepts are the all electric, conventional and hydrogen concepts. Calculations show that implementation of each of the concepts can lead to energy neutral districts in 2050. When personal transport is included, energy neutrality in 2050 is not feasible. Based on the six general concepts, the most optimal energy concepts tailored for four Dutch cities have been elaborated as pilots, in close cooperation with municipality representatives. The EPG (Energy Pattern Generator) is applied for simulation of a virtual district with 1000 dwellings of various categories. The modelling of a solar hub shows that, assuming equal heat losses for the individual storages and the collective storage, an energy hub with collective heat storage can reduce the required storage capacity by 26% and the total required solar collector surface by 30% at maximum. This shows the added value of energy hubs with exchange, central storage and conversion of energy on a district level and suggests that costs of an energy hub can be optimised, becoming financially more attractive than houses with individual seasonal heat storage. Energy hub concepts can contribute considerably to the energy neutral built environment in 2050. The effect can be intensified by an exchange of surplus sustainable energy with neighbouring districts and import of energy in case of a shortage. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","All-electric; District; District modelling; Energy concept; Energy hub; Energy neutral",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007849454

For investment purposes, commodities are usually divided into the following categories: energy commodities (oil, natural gas, etc.); agricultural commodities (wheat, corn/maize, soybeans, etc.); industrial/base metals (aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, etc.); and precious metals (gold, palladium, platinum, etc.). However, most commodities cannot be stored easily because of the high storage costs incurred. For this reason, investors will normally seek exposure to commodities through derivatives, typically in the form of futures contracts. Notably, investments are often implemented through index tracking funds, hedge funds, and other active investment strategies. Moreover, most investments in commodities are made via index funds. Commodity index investment is typically characterized by a passive strategy designed to gain exposure to commodity price movements as part of a portfolio diversification strategy. In addition to investing in derivatives, institutional investors can invest in the debt or equity of companies that are active in the commodities space (e.g., forestry or mining companies, agricultural producers, etc.).

In such scenario, the aggregate load profile of the selforganized community is likely to be volatile due to the flexibility of the uncoordinated selfish households and the intermittence of the distributed generations. Previously, either centralized solutions or cooperation based decentralized solutions were proposed to manage the aggregate load, or the load of an individual selfish household was considered. We study the interplay between selfish households and community behavior by proposing a novel dynamic pricing model that provides an optimal price vector to the households to flatten the overall community load profile. Our dynamic pricing model intelligently adapts to the intermittence of the DGs and the closed-loop feedback that might result from price-responsiveness of the selfish households using its learning mechanism. Our dynamic pricing scheme has distinct import and export tariff components. Based on our dynamic pricing model, we propose a polynomial-time distributed DS scheduling algorithm that runs at each household to solve a cost minimization problem that complies with the selfish nature of the households. Our simulation results reveal that our distributed algorithm achieves up to 72.5% reduction in standard deviation of the overall net demand of the community compared to a distributed scheduling with two-level pricing scheme, and also gives comparable performance with a reference centralized scheduling algorithm. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2012.",,"Aggregates; Large scale systems; Polynomial approximation; Scheduling algorithms; Storage management; Centralized scheduling; Closed-loop feedback; Distributed scheduling; Distributed storage; Dynamic pricing models; Import and exports; Learning mechanism; Standard deviation; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969974063

The Amperian surface current assumption is assumed for the magnetization of the permanent magnet in the force calculation. The modeling is incorporated with the magnetic configurations of the magnet-superconductor system, such as vertical force for different cooling procedures. In the optimization study, the Amperian bulk current assumption is introduced to the force calculation. Comparing the theoretical results obtained from both assumptions with the experimental results showed that the force estimation is better with the bulk current assumption than that of the surface current. The results indicate that this improvement in the calculation of the force between the superconductor and permanent magnet is useful for larger geometries such as superconducting energy storage systems. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recently, fundamental physics research in superconductor-ferromagnet thin-film tunnel structures created a new opportunity to solve this long-standing problem. Superconductivity and ferromagnetism, two deeply antagonistic electronic properties, can coexist in form of Magnetic Josephson Junctions (MJJs). The superconducting-ferromagnetic MJJs are electrically compatible with traditional superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions (JJs) used for digital energy-efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ/ERSFQ) circuits. Both MJJ and JJ circuits have similar fabrication process and can be integrated on a single chip. As a result, a combination of MJJs and JJs can be used to form addressable memory cells, energy-efficient memory periphery circuits and programmable logic elements. In this paper, we present the test results of superconductor-insulator-ferromagnetsuperconductor (SIFS) MJJs showing their applicability for superconducting spintronic memory and digital circuits. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An experimental study has been carried out on a Fiat Doblo, which was converted from a regular gasoline powered vehicle into a fuel cell hybrid vehicle. The fuel cell drive train comprises a 10kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack connected by means of a DC/DC converter to a Li-ion battery. The aforementioned analytical energy management strategy was used during the experiments. The experiments were carried out on a roller test bench and on the road. The experiments were conducted not only to validate the energy management strategy and the underlying models but also to establish its practical value.

The purpose was to show the potential of heat pump technology in order to raise the acceptance of the technology, and to show that heat pumps are energy-efficient in cold climates. Another goal was to learn more about how SPF is influenced by different system designs. Parts of this study are the Swedish contribution to IEA HPP Annex 37 ""Demonstration of field measurements of heat pump systems in buildings"". The study covered two buildings with geothermal heating, one with geothermal heating combined with solar panels, one brine/water heat pump connected to ground storage combined with solar panels, and one building with an air/water heat pump combined with solar panels. The parameters monitored in the project were temperature and volume flow of heat carriers and tap water, and electrical energy used by compressors and circulation pumps. SPF, energy coverage ratio, energy savings and CO2 reduction were calculated. The results show that there is a potential for energy savings and CO2 reduction by using heat pump technology. Energy savings up to 75 % of the supplied heat have been demonstrated. CO2 reductions are influenced by which type of heating system the heat pump system is compared to, and how the electrical energy is produced. When reporting results from field measurements, it is important to state which electrical components that are included in the analyses. This study used the system boundaries defined in the European SEPEMO-build project. SPF for the five installations ranged from 2.8 to 4.0 when all electrical equipment was included in the calculations, which implies that heat pumps are energy-efficient in cold climates. The SPF value is not the only performance indicator to consider when evaluating heat pump systems. Also energy demand, energy coverage ratio, CO2 emissions, availability are most important parameters for heating systems in which a heat pump is combined with other heat sources, and for systems with large proportion of domestic hot water production. © 2012 ASHRAE.",,"Air conditioning; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heating; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Pumps; Solar concentrators; Domestic hot water; Electrical components; Electrical energy; Electrical equipment; Field measurement; Heat-pump technology; Performance indicators; Single-family house; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938833146

It was constructed on the Euphrates River located in semi-arid Southeastern Turkey in the 1980s as the central component of a large-scale regional development project for the Southeastern Anatolia region (referred to as GAP). The construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1990. The dam and the hydroelectric power plant, which went into service after filling up the reservoir was accomplished in 1992. The Atatürk Dam, which has a height of 169 m, a total storage capacity of 48.7 million m3, and a surface area of about 817 km2 plays an important role in the development of Turkey's energy and agriculture sectors. In this study, the spatial and temporal impacts of the Atatürk Dam on agro-meteorological aspects of the Southeastern Anatolia region have been investigated. Change detection and environmental impacts due to water-reserve changes in Atatürk Dam Lake have been determined and evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries and meteorological datasets within a period of 1984 to 2011. These time series have been evaluated for three time periods. Dam construction period constitutes the first part of the study. Land cover/use changes especially on agricultural fields under the Atatürk Dam Lake and its vicinity have been identified between the periods of 1984 to 1992. The second period comprises the 10-year period after the completion of filling up the reservoir in 1992. At this period, Landsat and meteorological time-series analyses are examined to assess the impact of the Atatürk Dam Lake on selected irrigated agricultural areas. For the last 9-year period from 2002 to 2011, the relationships between seasonal water-reserve changes and irrigated plains under changing climatic factors primarily driving vegetation activity (monthly, seasonal, and annual fluctuations of rainfall rate, air temperature, humidity) on the watershed have been investigated using a 30-year meteorological time series. For all images, geometric corrections including digital elevation information and Tasseled Cap transformations were carried out to attain changes in surface reflectance and denoting disturbance of Landsat reflectance data. Consequently, thematic maps of the affected areas were created by using appropriate visualization and classification techniques in conjunction with geographical information system. The resulting dataset was used in a linear trend analysis to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation-cover development. Analysis has been conducted in ecological units that have been determined by climate and land cover/use. Based on the results of the trend analysis and the primary factor analysis, selected parts of South-eastern Anatolia region are analyzed. The results showed that approximately 368 km2 of agricultural fields have been affected because of inundation due to the Atatürk Dam Lake. However, irrigated agricultural fields have been increased by 56.3% of the total area (1552 km2 of 2756km2) on Harran Plain within the period of 1984 - 2011.

One of the major causes is the malfunction of electrolytic capacitors (E-Caps) which are widely used for stabilizing the dc-link voltage in various types of power converters applied in smart grid. A dc-link module is therefore proposed in this paper with a reduced value of dc-link capacitor and a series voltage compensator.

This analysis and data base show the worldwide experience and prospects of CO2 capture and sequestration projects. The existing documents on each project were collected, processed, analyzed and generalized, and the respective information was systematized. The data base is comprehensively studied and included the analysis, not only of general information, but also geological and hydrochemical data.

All projects include thorough analysis of potential locations for CO2 storages, large scope of experiments, studies and calculations of the mechanism of CO2 capture in a geological structure, physical, and chemical processes in the reservoir and risk assessment. The final stage of the project is development of CO2 transmission infrastructure. In general, the analytical material gathered and systematized for all global CO2 projects is an analytical document that can be the basis for rational and efficient selection of potential location for CO2 long-term storages and implementation of promising, advanced and safe for subsurface CO2 capture, transmission, injection, and storage technologies.

In subtype IIIa hepatic tissue, skeletal- and cardiac muscle tissue is affected, while in subtype IIIb only hepatic tissue is affected. Cardiac storage of limit dextrin causes a form of cardiomyopathy, which resembles primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on cardiac ultrasound. We present a 32-year-old GSD IIIa patient with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) first diagnosed at the age of 8 years. LVH remained stable and symptomless until the patient presented at age 25 years with increasing dyspnea, fatigue, obesity, and NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional classification two out of four. Dyspnea, fatigue, and obesity progressed, and at age 28 years she was severely symptomatic with NYHA classification 3+ out of 4. On echocardiogram and electrocardiogram, the LVH had progressed as well. Initially, she was rejected for cardiac transplantation because of severe obesity. Therefore, a 900 cal, high protein diet providing 37% of total energy was prescribed during 4 months on which 10 kg weight loss was achieved. However, her symptoms as well as the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic LVH indices had improved dramatically – ultimately deferring cardiac transplantation. Thereafter, the caloric intake was increased to 1,370 cal per day, and the high protein intake was continued providing 43% of total energy.

The experiments were performed at Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey on the 3rd and 4th of August 2010 that had the approximately same average outdoor temperature, 31°C. A solar hot water was delivered via a 40 m2 array of flat plate solar collectors that drove a lithium chloride (LiCl) absorption heat pump with a cooling power peak of 20 kW. A solar-powered air conditioning system was designed for heating and cooling in a test room that had a total floor space of 30 m2. Chilled water produced in the evaporator was supplied to the fan coil units, and the heat of condensation and absorption was rejected by means of a wet cooling tower. An electric heater and an air source heat pump were used as auxiliary systems for the absorption cooling application for two different cases when the solar energy was insufficient. Temperature variations were recorded for the absorption machine components, the test room, and the outdoors. The cooling energy, thermal energy, and daily average coefficient of performance (COP) of the absorption system were calculated for two days. Solar absorption cooling was considered for two different auxiliary systems and is presented in this manuscript. The results showed that the daily average COP of the absorption system was 0.283 for Case 1 and 0.282 for Case 2. For both cases, the interior energy storage of the absorption system enabled it to satisfy the cooling demand during the night while solar energy was not available.","Absorption system; Heat storage; Solar cooling; Solar energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903950714

Therefore, our evaluations used extraction method and IC (Ion Chromatography) test to examine the amount of ions for current mask pods and storage cabinet. The pods included the different material of ABS (Amber and Violet Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PMMA (Polymethyl meth acrylate), PEEK (Polyether ether ketone), Metal case, LCP (Liquid Crystal Plastic), PC+CF (Polycarbonate with carbon fiber) and PC+CNT (Polycarbonate with Carbon nano-tubes). Moreover, PSM (Phase shift Mask) haze life time and dosage was strongly interrelated with the amount of chemical contaminant aggregation for storage pods. The other factor to impact haze generation of ArF PSM masks is the condition of storage environment; therefore, we're comparing the different structure of cabinet from different vendors to extend mask life time. They included 3 types of storage system: cabinet with XCDA, purge cabinet and purge stocker. According to this point of view, we used the impinger and Cr Blank IC test to verify the best storage system and remove some of the polluted parts for cabinet to ensure haze free. Resulting from our investigations, we setup storage BKM (Best Known Method) and monitor haze performance to record their results.

Spider dragline silk exhibits excellent mechanical properties in terms of breaking energy, coupled with both high strength and strain at failure. The mechanical properties could be further tuned by varying external factors such as strain rate, temperature, reeling speed and force, the medium of the forcibly draw silk, and treatment with solvents and vapors. In addition, spider silk utilizes its inherent property, supercontraction, to maintain tension in the web and restore web shape after deformation by prey capture, precipitation or wind as they become wetted with morning dew or rain. The powerful cyclic contraction exhibited by spider silk also results in a green and energy efficient mimicry of biological muscles. The multiple occurrences of supercontraction and fatigueless cyclic contraction offer possibilities for performing work in industries and clinical sciences. The outstanding mechanical properties of spider silk are determined by its unique structural characteristics formed through its incomparable dope storage and spinning process. Scientists have applied many techniques in order to study the structure of the dragline silk. SEM and AFM are employed to study the morphology and topography of the fibre, and WAXD and FTIR are used to assess the b-crystallite and total b-sheet content in dragline silk, respectively. Besides, NMR, Raman spectroscopy and SAXS are also important tools inanalyzing the secondary and tertiary structures in dragline silk. Generally speaking, dragline silk can be modeled as a semicrystalline material, in which the polyalanine nano-b-crystallites are embedded in the non-crystalline amorphous region to form a network. In particular, the model by Du et al.25 suggested that intramolecular b-sheets acting as ''molecular spindles'' addressed the molecular origin of strain hardening of spider silk filaments. Last but not least, reconstituted and recombinant silk proteins can be used to fabricate novel biomaterials for application in the biomedical and clinical fields. The proteins are processed into different structures ranging from fibres, films, gels, hydrogels and porous sponges to microcapsules. Surface functionalization through targeting carboxylic acid groups on the amino acids in the protein could be used for biosensors and influence cell and tissue functions by increasing high levels of surface decoration with enzymes. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898738046

The use of solar thermal in connection with district heating is far behind (relatively only one tenth of) the use of solar thermal in individual houses - even though it is in most cases much cheaper to supply solar energy centrally to a district heating network, than to supply solar energy to individual houses.

The ÅA route implies the production of brucite (besides Ca- and Fe- based by-products) from a magnesium/calcium silicate rock, using recoverable ammonium sulphate (AS), followed by carbonation of the Mg(OH)2 in a pressurised fluidised bed at ~ 500°C, 20-30 bar CO2 partial pressure. An assessment is reported for operating the CSM process on waste heat from a limekiln (lime production: 210 t/day) in Pargas, Southwest Finland, i.e. without external energy input apart from what is needed for crushing the rock to the required particle size (a few % of the overall CSM process energy requirement) and compressing the flue gas to be treated. Part of the off-gas from the limekiln (CO2 content ~21%-vol) will be processed without a CO2 separation step. The feature of operating without CO2 separation makes CSM an attractive and cost-competitive option when compared to conventional CCS involving underground storage of CO2. An exergy analysis is used to optimise process layout and energy efficiency, and at the same time maximise the amount of CO2 that can be bound to MgCO3 given the amount of waste heat available from the kiln. Also, experimental results are reported for producing Mg(OH)2 (and Fe,Ca(OH)2) from local rock material.","Lime kiln; Scale-up","Calcium; Costs; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Fluidized beds; Kilns; Mineralogy; Silicate minerals; Storage (materials); Waste heat; Ammonium sulphate; Carbon dioxide storage; External energy; Lime kiln; Lime production; Mineral sequestration; Scale-up; Underground storage; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896526376

CCS causes costs for the industry, creating an extra barrier for implementation of these techniques. A recently developed mineral carbonation process producing a valuable product covering process implementation costs is advanced towards commercial scale. In this two-step process, calcium-rich steel converter slag is treated with an aqueous ammonium salt solution to selectively extract the calcium. Then the dissolved calcium is removed from the process liquid as pure precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) by introducing gaseous CO2 to the system. This concept would utilise waste material from steel industry, and spare the natural resources used for conventional PCC production. Experimental results have shown that papermaking grade PCC can be produced with ammonium nitrate, chloride or acetate solvents. The used solvent has also been regenerated and recycled between the process stages, which reduces the need for fresh solvent and lowers the process costs. To maximise the PCC production in a continuous process, a thermodynamic process model in Aspen Plus is now constructed. The modelling results are validated with a series of semi-continuous experiments. It is found that by using staged carbonate precipitation the yield of pure product is increased. Ammonium nitrate is observed to enable the highest conversion of calcium from steel slag to calcium carbonate also in continuous operation. At ambient conditions the process steps generate heat but this low temperature heat cannot be utilised. The mixing and pumping energies for process operation are small in comparison to the heat duties in chemical reactors. Preliminary results on solid-liquid separation studies, on washing of the solid outlet streams, as well as on recovery and make-up needs of process chemicals are discussed.

For black liquor gasification (BLG) two options for using the product gas are considered: production of electricity or DME motor fuel. Furthermore, both BLG and upgrading of the recovery boiler are assumed to be possible to combine with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The extracted lignin is assumed to either be valued as wood fuel or as oil. The different options are evaluated and compared with respect to annual net profit and global CO2 emissions for four different future energy market scenarios. The results show that, generally, BLG with motor fuels production and lignin extraction with lignin valued as oil achieve the best economic performance.

Considering only direct heat exchange, the minimum forward temperature level is determined by the demand side, as energy services are required at a certain temperature. As domestic hot water is required at a temperature range where legionella is no longer a threat, forward temperatures in a traditional low temperature district heating network cannot be lowered beyond approximately 55 °C. One solution is to boost the temperature of the forward tap water stream with a heat pump, as the remaining heat demands are often not required at temperature levels as high as the tap water. The scope of this work is to evaluate the power consumption and second law efficiency of booster heat pumps for tap water production in a low temperature district heating network. The heat pump and storage arrangement is evaluated based on a tapping sequence from the Danish standards (DS439). Based an initial investigation of possible designs, three configurations have been chosen for the evaluation. Of the three heat pumps, two are implemented on the primary side to boost the network stream, and one is intended to increase the temperature of the tap water directly. Results show that one of the three configurations are superior to the two remaining, when considering temperature levels of forward stream between 35 °C and 47 °C. The overall results remain the same regardless of heat exchanger sizes and the isentropic efficiency of the compressor used in the heat pump. The superior configuration shows exergetic efficiencies higher than 0.5 when forward temperatures is around 45 °C.","Domestic hot water; Exergy analysis; Heat pumps; Low temperature district heating","District heating; Energy conversion; Hot water distribution systems; Temperature; District heating networks; Domestic hot water; Exergy Analysis; Heat pumps; Isentropic efficiency; Low temperatures; Second law efficiencies; Temperature differences; Heat pump systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896382517

In this study, nano magnetite (Fe2O3) particles were prepared with the sol-gel method to be used for enhancing thermal properties of paraffin. 10% nano particle was added to paraffin (melting range: 56-58 °C and latent heat: 119 J/kg) to prepare a nano composite. SEM analysis shows that nano magnetites are homogeneously distributed in paraffin structure with particle size in the range of 15-25 μm. Latent heat of the paraffin nano composite measured by DSC was 144 J/g.

The resulting grey-box model was used for Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the energy in the tank. The control objective was to balance the energy from a solar collector and the heat consumption in a residential house. The storage tank provides heat in periods where there is low solar radiation and stores heat when there is surplus solar heat. The forecasts of consumption patterns were based on data obtained from meters in a group of single-family houses in Denmark. The tank can also be heated by electric heating elements if necessary, but the electricity costs of operating these heating elements should be minimized. Consequently, the heating elements should be used in periods with cheap electricity. It is proposed to integrate a price-sensitive control to enable the storage tank to serve a smart energy system in which flexible consumers are expected to help balance fluctuating renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Through simulations, the impact of applying Economic MPC shows annual electricity cost savings up to 25-30%. © 2012 The Authors.","Model predictive control; Smart energy systems; Smart solar tank; Solar heating",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892653844

Due to their special shapes, compositions, chemical and physical properties, metal oxide nanomaterials are the focus of current research efforts in nanotechnology. One-dimentional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanofibers, nanorods, and nanotubes, have attracted significant attention, due to the interesting confinement effects and the structure-related properties. In particular, metal oxides with 1D nanostructures are considered to be promising candidates in the applications of energy conversion and storage devices, because of their high surface areas, porosities, and fast charge transport. Such 1D metal oxides can be fabricated by many techniques, including top-down synthesis and bottom-up synthesis. Among them, electrospinning is a particular simple, inexpensive technique, which allows fabrication of metal oxides and advanced functional materials on a large scale. The solar cells and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries based on the electrospun metal oxide nanofibers demonstrate higher photoelectric conversion efficiency, and show higher reversible capacity and electrochemical stability, respectively. This paper consists of two main sections categorized by the electrospun fabrication of metal oxides and their energy applications. After a brief description of the electrospinning process of metal oxides, we choose to focus on their major energy applications, including solar cells, Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.

The acoustic image approach showed good agreement with modal analysis and also allowed to identify the chatter frequency. Once identified the problem, the paper also presents a novel approach for improving resistance to cutting instability by implementing HDI in the structure.

In most studies, these nano-biocomposites exhibit intercalated or mixed exfoliated/intercalated morphologies. The use of plate-like clays as additives can lead to some enhancement in the mechanical and gas barrier properties of PHAs as well as increased thermal stability, although the effects depend significantly on clay type, clay organomodifer and process conditions. The influence of clay addition on PHA biodegradability has been either positive or negative according to the particular study. There has been very little research to date on the migration properties of PHA in the context of use in packaging and none yet in which PHA/clay nano-biocomposites have been the focus.

In a simulation study, the potential of this strategy is demonstrated over a World Harmonized Transient Cycle. These results are compared with a baseline engine control strategy.

Both a traditional and a Smart Grid system are discussed. In a traditional energy system, where flexibility is provided by power plants, the quality of a given flexible resource can be determined fairly unambiguously by activation time, length of reservation period and capacity. In a Smart Grid system, flexibility should be provided by flexible consumer appliances, which are not created for power management. Determining the quality and value of a flexible resource therefore becomes far more multifaceted, since additional performance constraints such as storage capacity, minimum runtime, temporal constraints (deadlines), ramp rates etc. must be considered. To explore the value of flexibility, this paper defines two distinct operation strategies for a Virtual Power Plant: The predictive and the agile. A predictive Virtual Power Plant will generate predictions of future market prices, and based on these it will operate the portfolio in a least cost manner. An Agile Virtual Power Plant, on the other hand, operates its portfolio based on an analysis of the quality of the individual flexible resources. The Agile Virtual Power Plant is therefore reluctant to expend its flexible resource and does so in a worst-quality-resource manner.","Deregulated Power Markets; Smart Grid; Virtual Power Plant","Agile manufacturing systems; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Power control; Power plants; Quality control; Deregulated power markets; Future market prices; Operation strategy; Performance constraints; Smart grid; Smart grid systems; Temporal constraints; Virtual power plants; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880900228

This has caused an inefficient energy production and a huge variation in the energy prices. In the near future (10 to 15 years) the amount of non-controllable energy sources will double or more. This again will result in a number of problems: Inefficient energy production, problems with controlling the power grid, the wind turbines have to stop when the wind is optima and so on. A way to reduce these problems is to use the possibility to store energy in ordinary houses. Ordinary houses are the main electricity consumer. More than 60% of the total electricity production is consumed in family homes. A way to overcome these problems with non-controllable electricity production is to use residential homes as energy storage. For instance floor heating systems, hot water tanks, refrigerators and freezers are all examples of systems and appliance that can be used for storing energy in an efficient way. Beside of that it is possible to use the washing machine, the dryer and the ventilation in a more flexible manner which will have the same effect than storing energy. This paper analyzes the possibility for using floor heating systems and hot water tanks as energy storage in ordinary family houses. Beside of that the size and the efficiency of this energy storage are analyzed. The main idea are to make the power consumer more flexible, or in other word the consumer have to use the energy when it is available, and by that mean secure a more efficient and green energy production. If houses and private households have to play that role, then it is very important to find a solution that minimizes the impact on the living comfort. The way to do that is to make an automatic and intelligent house control system that maximizes the consumption flexibility based on the energy user's behavior without affection the living comfort. This behavior is of course different from household to household, because of that it is necessary to include an adaptive behavior prediction system. This paper describes a method for making houses more energy flexible based on pre knowledge of the user behavior. The energy flexibility is calculated based on simulation for 200000 typical houses in Denmark. The simulations shows that it is possible based on these 200000 houses, to store enough energy to absorb the variation in the production in Denmark over a time horizon on several hours.",,"Behavioral research; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Floors; Heating; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Houses; Power control; Power plants; Refrigerators; Smart power grids; Water; Water tanks; Wind turbines; Electricity consumers; Electricity production; Energy flexibility; Energy productions; Floor heating systems; Green energy production; Private households; Residential homes; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880858516

Downloading these data onto a computer, transferring them into shapefiles, filtering, processing, and displaying them consumes considerable end-user time and energy. In this paper, we demonstrate that freely available ""Cloud""-based services are sufficient to take over this workload and fast enough to deliver spatial data to an end-user without a considerable investment of time. The animal-generated spatial data we present come in two forms: satellite data from the Argos service and GPS data delivered as text messages using a Short Message Service (SMS). We suggest a simple mail-to-map system, which automatically archives data (coordinates, time, telemetry) and displays it dynamically on various Internet applications such as Google Maps/Google Earth or Google Graphs. We use the Gmail service to filter messages, a free blog service (e.g., blogger.com or wordpress.com) for unlimited-time data storage and the Google spreadsheets to dynamically assemble the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) files. To demonstrate the utility of our mailto- map system, we apply the approach to two contrasting wildlife case studies-the highly endangered Steller's Sea Eagle (Haliaetus pelagicus) of northeast Asia and White-tailed Deer (Odolescens virginianus), which is ubiquitous in the eastern United States-and discuss conservation implications of the near-real-time data publication opportunities that our system provides. © 2012 The Geological Society of America.

Storage can take place at sites within the forest or in off-forest storage yards. A model for predicting the moisture content of Sitka spruce roundwood and energy wood under an open, offforest, environment was developed for Ireland. Experimental data for the model were gathered over a 16-month period beginning in April 2007. The major factors affecting biomass moisture content change are cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET0), biomass type, and type of cover. ET0 was computed using the FAO Penman-Monteith method, which requires temperature, solar radiation, wind, and relative humidity data. The model was easily used in a spreadsheet to estimate drying times for different locations in Ireland, different starting seasons for drying, different biomass types, and different types of cover. The model should not be used for estimating drying times for in-forest biomass storage because it will overestimate drying rates considerably. ©Forest Products Society 2012.",,"Biomass; Drying; Forestry; Moisture; Moisture determination; Supply chains; Biomass moistures; Cumulative precipitation; Fao penman monteiths; Forest biomass; Moisture management; Picea sitchensis; Storage yards; Transportation cost; Digital storage; Biomass; Data Storage; Digital Systems; Drying; Forestry; Supply Chain Management; Water Supply",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876148125

Strain SolV fixes carbon dioxide (CO2) via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle with methane as energy source, a trait so far very unusual in methanotrophs. In this study, the ability of ""Ca. M. fumariolicum"" to store carbon was explored by genome analysis, physiological studies, and electron microscopy. When cell cultures were depleted for nitrogen, glycogen storage was clearly observed in cytoplasmic storage vesicles by electron microscopy. After cessation of growth, the dry weight kept increasing and the bacteria were filled up almost entirely by glycogen. This was confirmed by biochemical analysis, which showed that glycogen accumulated to 36% of the total dry weight of the cells. When methane was removed from the culture, this glycogen was consumed within 47 days. During the period of glycogen consumption, the bacteria kept their viability high when compared to bacteria without glycogen (from cultures growing exponentially).The latter bacteria lost viability already after a few days when starved for methane. Analysis of the draft genome of ""Ca. M. fumariolicum"" SolV demonstrated that all known genes for glycogen storage and degradation were present and also transcribed. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes showed that they form a separate cluster with ""Ca. M. infernorum"" V4, and the most closely related other sequences only have an identity of 40%. This study presents the first physiological evidence of glycogen storage in the phylum Verrucomicrobia and indicates that carbon storage is important for survival at times of methane starvation. © 2012 Khadem, van Teeseling, van Niftrik, Jetten, Op den Camp and Pol.","Carbon storage; Glycogen; Methane,Verrucomicrobia; Methylacidiphilum; Survival",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875864745

This goal demands not only energy savings and investments in renewables, but also support of CCS in order to achieve a low carbon footprint in the energy mix. However, public acceptance of onshore CCS in the Netherlands is low; therefore, the government has chosen to support only offshore CCS for the moment. To facilitate the development of offshore CCS, the Dutch government and the European Union are co-funding the ROAD project together with the initiators, E.ON and GDF SUEZ. The ROAD project aims to develop a large-scale, integrated CCS demonstration project. This demonstration project encompasses the capture of 25% of the CO2 in the flue gases of a coal-fired power plant (owned by E.ON), transporting this through a 25 km pipeline (operated by GDF SUEZ) and storing it via an injection platform in a 3.5 km deep depleted gas reservoir (operated by TAQA). ROAD needs a number of permits and consents to set up the demonstration project. The permitting process is the main process in which stakeholders can participate. By using this permitting process as a case study, and comparing it to a previous (unsuccessful) onshore CCS project in the Netherlands, we argue that it is best to start with a successful offshore CCS demonstration project. Mainly because the NIMBY effect does not play a role, public resistance against such an offshore CCS project is low. The government can then use this project to show that CCS can be done safely and without negatively impacting the environment or the public. In short: a successful offshore CCS project will help establish the necessary societal embedding for future CCS projects in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, both onshore and offshore.

This study showed that these two materials release heat after a dehydration/hydration cycle with energy densities of 0.38 GJ/m3 for MgSO4.7H2O and 0.71 GJ/m3 MgCl2.6H2O. The low heat release found for MgSO4.7H2O is mainly attributed to the amorphization of the material during the dehydration performed at 13 mbar which reduces its sorption capacity during the rehydration. MgCl2.6H 2O presents a high energy density which makes this material interesting for seasonal heat storage in domestic applications. This material would be able to fulfil the winter heat demand of a passive house estimated at 6 GJ with a packed bed reactor of 8.5 m3. However, a seasonal heat storage system built with this material should be carefully set with a restricted temperature at 40°C for the hydration reaction to avoid the liquefaction of the material at lower temperature which limits its performances for long term storage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Characterization; Dehydration; Heat storage; Heating; Packed beds; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; X ray diffraction; High energy densities; Hydration reaction; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Long-term storage; Lower temperatures; Packed bed reactor; Seasonal heat storages; Sorption capacities; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875037343

The non-traditional electrical state in TI is extracted and modeled in a SPICE-like simulator. The model is the employed for hybrid CMOS-TI NVM design explorations for both memory cell and memory array.

The motivation for the investigation and the test setup arises from the need to serve common user-space like home directories, experiment software and control areas, and clustered log areas. Since the operational requirements on such user-space are stringent in terms of read-write operations (in frequency and access speed) and unobtrusive data relocation, test results are presented with emphasis on file-level performance, stability and ""high-availability"" of the shared filesystems.

As part of the activities of the Experiment Support group in CERN's IT department, and reinforced by effort from the EGI-InSPIRE project, we present work aimed at common solutions across all LHC experiments. Such solutions allow us not only to optimize development manpower but also offer lower long-term maintenance and support costs. The main areas cover Distributed Data Management, Data Analysis, Monitoring and the LCG Persistency Framework. Specific tools have been developed including the HammerCloud framework, automated services for data placement, data cleaning and data integrity (such as the data popularity service for CMS, the common Victor cleaning agent for ATLAS and CMS and tools for catalogue/storage consistency), the Dashboard Monitoring framework (job monitoring, data management monitoring, File Transfer monitoring) and the Site Status Board. This talk focuses primarily on the strategic aspects of providing such common solutions and how this relates to the overall goals of long-term sustainability and the relationship to the various WLCG Technical Evolution Groups. The success of the service components has given us confidence in the process, and has developed the trust of the stakeholders. We are now attempting to expand the development of common solutions into the more critical workflows. The first is a feasibility study of common analysis workflow execution elements between ATLAS and CMS. We look forward to additional common development in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data handling; Distributed computer systems; High energy physics; Information management; Particle accelerators; Computing technology; Distributed data managements; File transfer monitoring; Long-term maintenances; Long-term sustainability; Management monitoring; Monitoring frameworks; Technical evolution; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873310826

Several tools are available to provide this information, developed both inside and outside of the collaboration and often used in common with other experiments. Despite the fact that the current monitoring allowed CMS to successfully perform its computing operations, an evolution of the system is clearly required, to adapt to the recent changes in the data and workload management tools and models and to address some shortcomings that make its usage less than optimal. Therefore, a recent and ongoing coordinated effort was started in CMS, aiming at improving the entire monitoring system by identifying its weaknesses and the new requirements from the stakeholders, rationalise and streamline existing components and drive future software development.

The current paradigm does not divide the sites as in the commonly used hierarchical model, but rather treats them as a single storage endpoint and a pool of distributed computing nodes. The next generation ARC middleware with its several new technologies provides new possibilities in development of the ATLAS computing model, such as pilot jobs with pre-cached input files, automatic job migration between the sites, integration of remote sites without connected storage elements, and automatic brokering for jobs with non-standard resource requirements. ARC's data transfer model provides an automatic way for the computing sites to participate in ATLAS' global task management system without requiring centralised brokering or data transfer services. The powerful API combined with Python and Java bindings can easily be used to build new services for job control and data transfer.

The ATLAS Computing model embraces the Grid paradigm and originally included three levels of computing centers, in order to handle data volumes of multiple petabytes per year. With the formation of small computing centers, usually based at universities, the model was expanded to include them as Tier-3 sites. Tier-3 centers comprise a range of architectures and many do not possess Grid middleware, thus, monitoring of storage usage and analysis software is not possible for the typical Tier-3 site system administrator, similarly, Tier-3 site activity is not available for the virtual organization of the experiment.

Operated at more than 240 sites it has the widest distribution of all grid storage solutions in the WLCG infrastructure. It provides an easy way to manage and configure disk pools, and exposes multiple interfaces for data access (rfio, xroot, nfs, gridftp and http/dav) and control (srm). During the last year we have been working on providing stable, high performant data access to our storage system using standard protocols, while extending the storage management functionality and adapting both configuration and deployment procedures to reuse commonly used building blocks. In this contribution we cover in detail the extensive evaluation we have performed of our new HTTP/WebDAV and NFS 4.1 frontends, in terms of functionality and performance. We summarize the issues we faced and the solutions we developed to turn them into valid alternatives to the existing grid protocols - namely the additional work required to provide multi-stream transfers for high performance wide area access, support for third party copies, credential delegation or the required changes in the experiment and fabric management frameworks and tools. We describe new functionality that has been added to ease system administration, such as different filesystem weights and a faster disk drain, and new configuration and monitoring solutions based on the industry standards Puppet and Nagios.

Some other scientific communities also use similar technologies for data-intensive computations. The distinct feature of Grid computing is the ability to federate heterogeneous resources of different ownership into a seamless infrastructure, accessible via a single log-on. Like other infrastructures of similar nature, Grid functioning requires not only technologically sound basis, but also reliable operation procedures, monitoring and accounting. The two aspects, technological and operational, are closely related: weaker is the technology, more burden is on operations, and other way around. As of today, Grid technologies are still evolving: at CERN alone, every LHC experiment uses an own Grid-like system. This inevitably creates a heavy load on operations. Infrastructure maintenance, monitoring and incident response are done on several levels, from local system administrators to large international organisations, involving massive human effort worldwide. The necessity to commit substantial resources is one of the obstacles faced by smaller research communities when moving computing to the Grid. Moreover, most current Grid solutions were developed under significant influence of HEP use cases, and thus need additional effort to adapt them to other applications. Reluctance of many non-HEP researchers to use Grid negatively affects the outlook for national Grid organisations, which strive to provide multi-science services. We started from the situation where Grid organisations were fused with HEP laboratories and national HEP research programmes; we hope to move towards the world where Grid will ultimately reach the status of generic public computing and storage service provider and permanent national and international Grid infrastructures will be established. How far will we be able to advance along this path, depends on us. If no standardisation and convergence efforts will take place, Grid will become limited to HEP; if however the current multitude of Grid-like systems will converge to a generic, modular and extensible solution, Grid will become true to its name.",,"Digital storage; High energy physics; Societies and institutions; Data-intensive computation; Heterogeneous resources; Infrastructure maintenance; International Grids; Research communities; Research programmes; Scientific community; Storage service providers; Grid computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873302073

The Tier-3 monitoring suite, having been developed in order to satisfy the needs of Tier-3 site administrators and to aggregate Tier-3 monitoring information on the global VO level, needs to be validated for various combinations of LRMS and MSS solutions along with the corresponding Ganglia plugins. For this purpose the testbed infrastructure, which allows simulation of various computational cluster and storage solutions, had been set up at JINR (Dubna, Russia). This infrastructure provides the ability to run testbeds with various LRMS and MSS implementations, and with the capability to quickly redeploy particular testbeds or their components. Performance of specific components is not a critical issue for development and validation, whereas easy management and deployment are crucial. Therefore virtual machines were chosen for implementation of the validation infrastructure which, though initially developed for Tier-3 monitoring project, can be exploited for other purposes.

It is implemented using the plug-in architecture of the XRootD software framework and allows remote file access via XRootD protocol or POSIX-like file access via FUSE mounting. EOS was designed to fulfill specific requirements of disk storage scalability and IO scheduling performance for LHC analysis use cases. This is achieved by following a strategy of decoupling disk and tape storage as individual storage systems. A key point of the EOS design is to provide high availability and redundancy of files via a software implementation which uses disk-only storage systems without hardware RAID arrays. All this is aimed at reducing the overall cost of the system and also simplifying the operational procedures. This paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of redundancy by hardware (most classical storage installations) in comparison to redundancy by software. The latter is implemented in the EOS system and achieves its goal by spawning data and parity stripes via remote file access over nodes. The gain in redundancy and reliability comes with a trade-off in the following areas: • Increased complexity of the network connectivity • CPU intensive parity computations during file creation and recovery • Performance loss through remote disk coupling An evaluation and performance figures of several redundancy algorithms are presented for dual parity RAID and Reed-Solomon codecs. Moreover, the characteristics and applicability of these algorithms are discussed in the context of reliable data storage systems.",,"Computer hardware; Computer programming; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Hardware; High energy physics; Network architecture; Reed-Solomon codes; Data storage systems; Network connectivity; Operational procedures; Plug-in architectures; Redundancy algorithm; Reed-solomon codecs; Scheduling performance; Software implementation; Redundancy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873296108

With the increasing number of users and the accumulation of stored information since the experiment start-up, the electronic logbook actually in use, ATLOG, started to show its limitations in terms of speed and usability. Its monolithic architecture makes the maintenance and implementation of new functionality a hard-to-almost-impossible process. A new tool ELisA has been developed to replace the existing ATLOG. It is based on modern web technologies: the Spring framework using a Model-View-Controller architecture was chosen, thus helping building flexible and easy to maintain applications. The new tool implements all features of the old electronic logbook with increased performance and better graphics: it uses the same database back-end for portability reasons. In addition, several new requirements have been accommodated which could not be implemented in ATLOG.

One of the existing extensions of SAM is Site Wide Area Testing (SWAT), which gathers monitoring information from the worker nodes via instrumented jobs. This generates quite a lot of monitoring data to process, as there are several data points for every job and several million jobs are executed every day. The recent uptake of non-relational databases opens a new paradigm in the large-scale storage and distributed processing of systems with heavy read-write workloads. For SAM this brings new possibilities to improve its model, from performing aggregation of measurements to storing raw data and subsequent re-processing. Both SAM and SWAT are currently tuned to run at top performance, reaching some of the limits in storage and processing power of their existing Oracle relational database. We investigated the usability and performance of non-relational storage together with its distributed data processing capabilities. For this, several popular systems have been compared. In this contribution we describe our investigation of the existing non-relational databases suited for monitoring systems covering Cassandra, HBase and MongoDB. Further, we present our experiences in data modeling and prototyping map-reduce algorithms focusing on the extension of the already existing availability and reliability computations.

Due to the high volume of data created by the HEP experiments, an efficient file and dataset replica system may play an important role on the computing model. Data replica systems allow the creation of copies, distributed between the different storage elements on the Grid. In the HEP context, the data files are basically immutable. This eases the task of the replica system, because given sufficient local storage resources any dataset just needs to be replicated to a particular site once. Concurrent with the advent of computational Grids, another important theme in the distributed systems area that has also seen some significant interest is that of peer-to-peer networks (p2p). P2p networks are an important and evolving mechanism that eases the use of distributed computing and storage resources by end users. One common technique to achieve faster file download from possibly overloaded storage elements over congested networks is to split the files into smaller pieces. This way, each piece can be transferred from a different replica, in parallel or not, optimizing the moments when the network conditions are better suited to the transfer. The main tasks achieved by the system are: the creation of replicas, the development of a system for replicas transfer (RFT) and for replicas location (RLS) with a different architecture that the one provided by Globus and the development of a system for file transfer in pieces on computational grids with interfaces for several storage elements. The RLS uses a p2p overlay based on the Kademlia algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Digital storage; Grid computing; High energy physics; Peer to peer networks; Computational grids; Congested networks; Distributed systems; HEP experiments; Network condition; Peer to Peer (P2P) network; Storage elements; Storage resources; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873288923

The vast amount of data that needs to processed from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments requires good and efficient use of the available resources. Having a good CPU efficiency for the end users analysis jobs requires that the performance of the storage system is able to scale with I/O requests from hundreds or even thousands of simultaneous jobs. In this presentation we report on the work on improving the SE performance at the Helsinki Institute of Physics (HIP) Tier-2 used for the Compact Muon Experiment (CMS) at the LHC. Statistics from CMS grid jobs are collected and stored in the CMS Dashboard for further analysis, which allows for easy performance monitoring by the sites and by the CMS collaboration. As part of the monitoring framework CMS uses the JobRobot which sends every four hours 100 analysis jobs to each site. CMS also uses the HammerCloud tool for site monitoring and stress testing and it has replaced the JobRobot. The performance of the analysis workflow submitted with JobRobot or HammerCloud can be used to track the performance due to site configuration changes, since the analysis workflow is kept the same for all sites and for months in time. The CPU efficiency of the JobRobot jobs at HIP was increased approximately by 50 % to more than 90 %, by tuning the SE and by improvements in the CMSSW and dCache software. The performance of the CMS analysis jobs improved significantly too. Similar work has been done on other CMS Tier-sites, since on average the CPU efficiency for CMSSW jobs has increased during 2011. Better monitoring of the SE allows faster detection of problems, so that the performance level can be kept high. The next storage upgrade at HIP consists of SAS disk enclosures which can be stress tested on demand with HammerCloud workflows, to make sure that the I/O-performance is good.",,"Digital storage; Elementary particles; Hadrons; High energy physics; Microstrip devices; Particle accelerators; Institute of Physics; Large Hadron Collider; Large Hadron Collider experiments; Monitoring frameworks; Performance level; Performance monitoring; Performance optimizations; Storage resources; Solenoids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873286103

Given the increasing data volume that has to be stored and efficiently analyzed, it is a challenge for several LHC experiments to optimize and automate the data placement strategies in order to fully profit of the available network and storage resources and to facilitate daily computing operations. Building on previous experience acquired by ATLAS, we have developed the CMS Popularity Service that tracks file accesses and user activity on the grid and will serve as the foundation for the evolution of their data placement. A fully automated, popularity-based site-cleaning agent has been deployed in order to scan Tier-2 sites that are reaching their space quota and suggest obsolete, unused data that can be safely deleted without disrupting analysis activity. Future work will be to demonstrate dynamic data placement functionality based on this popularity service and integrate it in the data and workload management systems: as a consequence the pre-placement of data will be minimized and additional replication of hot datasets will be requested automatically.

One of the main objectives of Economic/Environmental Dispatch (EED) and Environmental Friendly Dispatch (EFD) is to optimize the amount of pollutants emitted from the hybrid power plants. EED is an important multi-objective problem which minimizes both the fuel cost of generation and the amount of pollutants emission while EFD has the single objective of optimizing the amount of emission only. Here, EED and EFD are modified and renamed as EEDL and EFDL, respectively by including minimization of transmission loss as an additional objective. Optimization of these problems determines the amount of optimum generation which to be allocated to each generating unit including renewable sources without violating system constraints and minimizing the amount of pollutant emissions as well as transmission losses. Extraction and storing of renewable energy at off-peak times or at times when there would be a surplus of its availability and reuse of such stored energy during its unavailable periods makes such approach more effective. Optimum EEDL and EFDL can be obtained by extracting maximum renewable energy during their availability periods, then using it for both available and unavailable periods with the aid of energy storage. MATLAB simulations are performed using IEEE-30 test bus data with 6 generators to illustrate the benefits of renewable energy storage in reducing the unwanted pollutants emission. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Economic/environmental dispatch; Energy storage; Multi-objective optimization; Power demand; Renewable energy; Transmission loss",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873264705

In an in-situ CO2 injection site, the heat released in these exothermic reactions can be exploited in a geothermal power-plant, effectively contributing toward the economic viability of the storage process. Our calculations suggest the possibility of generating up to about 25 TWh of electrical energy while capturing permanently about 240 Mton CO2 per 1 km3 of peridotite or basalt rock. That broadly corresponds to exploring an electric power plant having up to 60 MW gross output during a period of 50 years. These results show that geothermal energy and CO2 storage, often portrayed as conflicting uses of the subsurface, can actually work together, enhancing the economic feasibility of each other in case mafic and/or ultramafic rock formations are used as reservoirs.

The model (CoupModel) consists of several different modules that couples mass and energy flow models with dynamic biotic models of plant and its environment. The simulation period accounted for non-productive water losses, salt accumulation in root zone, and salt transport to below aquifer via deep percolation. The monitoring of biomass production with respect to water consumption and soil osmotic pressure indicted a decline in crop yield due to the water and salt stresses. The drip scenario had a better functionality in terms of the water wastage as the soil evaporation decreased by 40%. However, the productive water consumption decreased by 20% due to insufficient leaching fraction while salt accumulation increased drastically in the entire root zone. We found that salt could be flushed out from the root zone by more leaching but the water wastage increases as well as increasing the possibility of salinization beneath aquifer. The soil-water and plant ecosystem responds differently to salinity in different water management practices. Salt as a source of pollution can either stabilizes the soil by accumulation in the root zone causing anthropogenic soil desertification or can percolate it to beneath the aquifer resulting to long-term salinization. The findings of our study could sever to improve different management schemes in similar semi-arid regions. © 2012 WIT Press.","Chloride balance; Coupmodel; Drip and surface irrigation; Soil evaporation; Soil-water-plant modelling; Transpiration; Water balance","aquifer; computer simulation; crop yield; drip irrigation; environmental modeling; environmental monitoring; flow modeling; numerical model; rhizosphere; salinization; semiarid region; soil water; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871216036

A small device size of 150 × 150 nm2 and a Cu nanofilament with a small diameter of 30 nm are both observed by highresolution transmission electron microscope in the SET state. The GexSe1 - x solid electrolyte compositions are confirmed by both energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The switching mechanism relies on the smaller barrier heights for holes rather than for electrons; the positively charged Cuz+ ions (i.e., holes) migrate through the defects in the GexSe1 - x solid electrolytes during SET/RESET operations. Hence, the Cu nanofilament starts to grow at the Ge0.5Se0.5/W interface, and starts to dissolve at the Cu/Ge0.5Se0.5 interface, as illustrated in the energy band diagrams. Owing to both the higher barrier for hole injection at the Cu/Ge0.5Se0.5 interface than at the Cu/Ge0.2Se0.8 interface and greater thermal stability, the resistive switching memory characteristics of the Al/Cu/Ge0.5Se0.5/W are improved relative to the Al/Cu/Ge0.2Se0.8/W devices. The Al/Cu/Ge0.5Se0.5/W memory device can also be operated with a low current compliance of 1 nA, and hence, a low SET/RESET power of 0.61 nW/6.4 pW is achieved.

As these dependencies may be influenced by the dose level, the present study investigates the temperature dependence during irradiation and the temporal change of the optical response following irradiation of radiochromic dosimeters at a range of doses. Methods: Cuvette samples of the PRESAGE™ radiochromic dosimeter were irradiated within a dose range of 0-10 Gy at irradiation temperatures within 5-35 °C and postirradiation storage within 6-30 °C. The optical response due to irradiation was measured using a standard spectrophotometer and the data were analyzed in terms of thermal and temporal change. Results: The initial dose response was linear over the applied dose range independent of irradiation temperature. However, the optical response to a specific dose increased exponentially with irradiation temperature corresponding to an activation energy of 0.114 ± 0.007 eV. The temporal change in dose response after irradiation consisted of an offset, an auto-oxidation rate with activation energy 0.84 ± 0.03 eV, and an initial exponential increase in optical response (1.6 ± 0.2 eV) followed by an exponential decrease in optical response (0.98 ± 0.08 eV). These contributions depended on both storage temperature and the dose given, leading to a nonlinear dose response with time at low storage temperatures and a high auto-oxidation rate at high storage temperatures. Conclusions: Thermal equilibration is important to the radiochromic dosimeter investigated due to an exponential change in dose response with irradiation temperature and a considerable postirradiation temporal change in response. For the dosimeter version investigated in this study, a compromise in storage temperature has to be made between increasing the nonlinearity of the dose response with time and inducing a high auto-oxidation rate. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","3D dosimetry; radiochromic; radiotherapy; temperature dependence","Activation energy; Digital storage; Dosimeters; Irradiation; Oxidation; Radiotherapy; Temperature distribution; Exponential increase; High storage temperatures; Irradiation temperature; radiochromic; Storage temperatures; Temperature dependence; Temporal dependence; Thermal equilibrations; Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870922846

The optimal energy management for housing applications necessitates the combined use of heat and electricity by the way of technologies like cogeneration engines, heat pumps and thermal storage which can be used to dephase the electricity and heat demand of the building of the district concerned. A major factor that will play a role in the effective usage of these technologies is the proper and optimal sizing of each of the conversion and storage units as per the demands of the occupants. Another factor, that may affect the optimal energy management of domestic applications is the pricing of electricity done through the energy exchanges around Europe. Energy management is especially important for Switzerland as it is seen as a major transit and exchange country in the European energy market owing to its position and the trade of energy between France, Germany, Italy and itself. Here, a study has been conducted that tries to link two of the above mentioned factors in the design of a polygeneration system design. This study aims to show the effect of implementation of cogeneration system (cogeneration engine with or without a back-up boiler) coupled with a heat pump to satisfy the needs of a building considering the use of an optimal predictive control strategy that is used to optimize the use of the storage tanks. The study aims to identify the differences in the demand with and without heat pump. Also, the study aims to show the potential for thermal/electric storage in a single family house for better management of demand from the grid. The effect of the implementation of thermal storage with cogeneration engine coupled with heat pump on the grid electricity is explored. The effect of change in the electricity prices and as well as of constraints imposed on the electricity variations through the day on the buildiing requirements with cogeneration engine coupled with heat pump and thermal storage over a day is studied and the different strategies are identified. The study is then extended to include different buildings with different energy demand profiles. The objective is to study any possible changes in the strategy of one building due to the presence of another building in the grid which can also buy and sell using the control strategies mentioned above. As a result, this also reveals the effect of the use of optimal control of multiple buildings connected to a micro grid on the sale or purchase of electricity from or to grid as well.

To reach this goal, energy savings in buildings is essential. Therefore, the focus on energy efficient measures in buildings and net zero energy buildings (NZEBs) has increased.Most buildings in Denmark are connected to electricity grids and around half are connected to district heating (DH) systems. Connecting buildings to larger energy systems enables them to send and receive energy from these systems. This paper's objective is to examine how excess heat production from NZEBs influences different types of DH systems.In the analysis three different types of DH systems are analyzed, and three technology development scenarios for each are created. The examination is from a technical perspective and looks into how the overall heat production within DH areas is affected by the NZEBs excess heat production from solar thermal collectors.The main findings are that the excess heat from NZEBs can benefit DH systems by decreasing the production from production units utilizing combustible fuels. In DH areas where the heat demand in summer months is already covered by renewable energy, adding seasonal heat storage is essential to utilize the NZEB production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","District heating; Excess heat; Net zero energy buildings; Renewable energy; Solar thermal","Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Solar heating; Denmark; DH systems; District heating system; Electricity grids; Energy efficient; Energy systems; Excess heat; Heat demands; Heat production; In-buildings; Production units; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar thermal; Summer months; Technology development; Zero energy building (ZEB); District heating; building; combustion; energy efficiency; heat balance; heating; renewable resource; technological development; temperature effect; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869880513

In this paper the focus is on how the heating sector can reduce its consumption of biomass, thus leaving biomass for other sectors, but while still enabling a 100% renewable energy system. The analyses of heating technologies shows that district heating (DH) systems are important in limiting the dependence on biomass and create cost effective solutions. DH systems are especially important in renewable energy systems with large amounts of fluctuating sources as it enables fuel efficient and low cost energy systems with thermal heat storages. DH increases the efficiency with the use of combined heat and power production (CHP), while reducing the biomass demand by enabling the use of other renewable resources such as large-scale solar thermal, large heat pumps, geothermal heat, industrial surplus heat, and waste incineration. Where the energy density in the building stock is not high enough for DH to be economical, geothermal heat pumps can be recommended for individual heating systems, even though biomass consumption is higher than the DH solutions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Combined heat and power; District heating; Heating technologies; Renewable energy systems","Cost benefit analysis; District heating; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Waste incineration; Biomass consumption; Building stocks; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power production; Cost-effective solutions; DH systems; District heating system; Energy density; Energy supplies; Geothermal heat; Heat pumps; Heating system; Heating technology; Low-cost energy; Renewable energy systems; Renewable resource; Solar thermal; Surplus heat; Biomass; biomass power; consumption behavior; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; energy use; heating; incineration; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869867621

Grid integrated energy storage combined with fast-ramping conventional generation can help to address challenges associated with power output variability. This paper proposes a risk mitigating optimal power flow (OPF) framework to study the dispatch and placement of energy storage units in a power system with wind generators that are supplemented by fast-ramping conventional back-up generators. This OPF with storage charge/discharge dynamics is solved as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. Chance constraints are used to implement the risk mitigation strategy. The model is applied to case studies based on the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system. First, we study the scheduling of spinning reserves and storage when generation and loads are subject to uncertainties. The framework is then extended to investigate the optimal placement of storage across different network topologies. The results of the case studies quantify the need for storage and reserves as well as suggest a strategy for their scheduling and placement. © 2012 AACC American Automatic Control Council).",,"Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Optimal control systems; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Conventional generation; Energy storage unit; Finite horizon optimal control; Integrated energy storages; Optimal power flows; Renewable energy source; Risk mitigation strategy; Wind generator systems; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869442174

Diet is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In this review, we focused on recent publications reporting on the effect of macro- and micronutrients on development and progression of NAFLD. In general, saturated fat and fructose seem to stimulate hepatic lipid accumulation and progression into NASH, whereas unsaturated fat, choline, antioxidants, and high-protein diets rich in isoflavones seem to have a more preventive effect. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which diet affects NAFLD is expanding, not in the least due to innovative techniques, such as genomics tools that provide detailed comprehensive information on a large high-throughput scale. Although most nutrients seem to interfere with the balance between hepatic de novo lipogenesis (endogenous synthesis of fatty acids) and lipid oxidation (burning fat for energy), there are also indications that diet can trigger or prevent hepatic lipid accumulation by influencing the interaction between liver, gut, and adipose tissue. This review now gives a current detailed overview of diet-mediated mechanisms underlying NAFLD development and progression and summarizes recent results of genomics (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) studies that contribute to improved staging, monitoring and understanding of NAFLD pathophysiology. © 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In molten fluoride salts, passive oxide films are chemically unstable, and corrosion is driven largely by the thermodynamically driven dissolution of alloying elements into the molten salt environment. Two alloys, Hastelloy® N and 316L stainless steel were exposed to molten FLiNaK salt in a 316L stainless steel crucible under argon cover gas for 1000 hours at 850 °C. Graphite was present in some of the crucibles with the goal of studying corrosion behavior of relevant reactor material combinations. In addition, a technique to reduce alloy corrosion through modification of the reduction-oxidation state was tested by the inclusion of zirconium to the system. Corrosion of 316L stainless steel was noted to occur primarily through surface depletion of chromium, an effect that was enhanced by the presence of graphite. Hastelloy® N experienced weight gain through electrochemical plating of corrosion products derived from the 316L stainless steel crucible.

Flexibility can be found in generation technologies with fast response times or in storage options. In the transport sector, the proportion of electric drive vehicles is expected to increase over the next decade or two. These vehicles can provide some of the flexibility needed in the power system, in terms of both flexible demand and electricity storage. However, what are the batteries worth to the power system? And does the value depend on battery capacity? This article presents an analysis of the integrated power and transport system, focusing on the sensitivity of the power system configuration according to battery capacity and price of the electric drive vehicle. The value of different battery capacities is estimated, given that the batteries are used for both driving and storage. Likewise, the prices at which the electric drive vehicles become of interest to the power system are found. Smart charge, including the opportunity to discharge (vehicle-to-grid) is used in all scenarios. Analyses show that the marginal benefits decrease the larger the battery.

Results show that passive heat storage can enable equivalent to larger reductions in excess electricity production and fuel consumption than heat accumulation tanks. Moreover, passive heat storage is found to be significantly more cost-effective than heat accumulation tanks.

This technically and economically feasible system is designed to use indirect solar heat to drive membrane distillation processes to overcome the unstable supply of solar radiation from sunrise to sunset. The solar heated membrane distillation desalination system in the present study consisted of hot water storage devices, heat exchangers, air gap membrane distillation units, and solar collectors. Aspen Custom Molder (ACM) software was used to model and simulate each unit and establish the cost function of a desalination plant. From Design degree of freedom (DOF) analysis, ten design parameters were investigated to obtain the minimum total annual cost (TAC) with fixed pure water production rate. For a given solar energy density profile of typical summer weather, the minimal TAC per 1m3 pure water production can be found at 500W/m2 by varying the solar energy intensity. Therefore, we proposed two modes for controlling the optimal design condition of the desalination plant; day and night. In order to widen the operability range of the plant, the sensitivity analysis was used to retrofit the original design point to lower the effluent temperature from the solar collector by increasing the hot water recycled stream.

Quantifying the associated system benefits may provide valuable design and policy insights.

These features may for example include grid stability issues in a system with several flexible demand types and storage options to help balance a high penetration of renewable energy. Flexible and accessible tools have the potential to fill this niche. This paper expands on the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). It describes how 'blocks of functionality' may be added to represent variability in electricity generation, a prioritisation of demand types, shifting demand, and storage options. The paper demonstrates the flexibility and ease-of-use of OSeMOSYS with regard to modifications of its code.

The initial field trial is ongoing in the injector of a Northern Alberta steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) well pair. The development of the completion technology suitable for thermal conditions, initial field trial results and the plans for further development are described in this paper. The application modeling shows that, depending on the level of heterogeneity present in the reservoir, a 45% reduction in the steam-oil ratio and an almost 70% increase in recovery can be achieved in a SAGD process when both improved injection conformance and producer differential steam-trap control can be applied in a segmented horizontal well pair. A cost-effective, intelligent-well completion solution to achieve this segmentation and control has the potential to add substantial value to field developments through improved steam conformance. This will result in increased energy efficiency and oil recovery. The method under development is also applicable to a wide range of other thermal EOR processes such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), steam drive, and variations, including, for example, those involving solvent additives. The initial field deployment in the injector well was initiated to prove the technology, to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying the steam distribution, and to obtain best practices for future developments. A successful installation and commissioning of the intelligent completion has validated the technology. Lessons learned are highlighted. Early injection test results and data show a significant increase in the understanding of the injection and production behavior in the well pair. A test program to optimize the distribution of the steam injection in the well is underway, and the results are discussed.

A conceptual division of losses in the system was created, separating the complete system into three parts according to their function. This conceptualization of the system yielded a meaningful definition of the concept of efficiency. Additionally, a thorough theoretical framework for the prediction of losses associated with energy storage and transfer in the system was developed. A large number of spin-down tests at varying pressure levels were performed. A separation of the measured data into the different physical processes responsible for power loss was achieved from the corresponding dependence on rotational velocity. This comparison yielded an estimate of the perpendicular resistivity of the stranded copper conductor of 2.5 × 10-8 ± 3.5 × 10-9. Further, power and energy were measured system-wide during operation, and an analysis of the losses was performed. The analytical solution was able to reproduce the measured distribution of losses in the system to an accuracy of 4.7% (95% CI).

The purpose of the presented research is to take this basis as the fundamental constituents of creating forms and organisations in architecture, so to have metabolic capacities. Enabled by algorithmic digital models with integrated physical properties of the environment and the solid matter applied in the model, the work studies the formation processes and final forms of an architecture derived by energy transfer. Rather than thinking in terms of a priori defined geometries and typologies, formations and forms are the resultant of points distributed in space from ground upward with various densities effecting connections, enclosures and volumes. Performance evaluation and communication to the designer is provided directly in the model during formations and allow there through a more precise understanding of why a form is developing how it is. Concretely, the derived forms are evolved on the basis of a continuous feedback between solar energy, which spreads downward, the distributed mass that holds and spreads energy through air and the energy from the earth such as water and 'nutrients' travelling upward. The results illustrate the ability to organise forms that exhibit high performance in holding and allocating energy, such as thermal storage and spreading of heat. Furthermore, the communicative formations allow the designer to apply design parameters to parallel numerical optimisation with proportional aspect so fundamental to architectural expression.

An abrupt change in input, variability of load conditions and grid faults cause the DC bus voltage to fluctuate which is normally compensated by PI controllers. This paper presents a parametric study carried out for improving the system performance of grid-tied photovoltaic with battery energy storage systems (BESS). The power converters such as the grid side voltage-sourced converter and bi-directional DC/DC converter are optimized by using the simplex optimization algorithm with objective of minimizing the DC bus voltage fluctuations under severe operating conditions. The advantage of adopting the proposed optimization method is analyzed by comparing the simulation results carried out using a set of optimized parameters with those of conventional trial and error method. The benefits of using BESS as an additional source for regulation are also discussed. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Battery energy storage systems; Photovoltaic; PI controller; Simplex optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865593672

Thermo-electrical energy storage (TEES) based on thermodynamic cycles is currently under investigation at ABB corporate research as an alternative solution to pump hydro and compressed air energy storage. TEES is based on the conversion of electricity into thermal energy during charge by means of a heat pump and on the conversion of thermal energy into electricity during discharge by means of a thermal engine. The synthesis and the thermodynamic optimization of a TEES system based on hot water, ice storage and transcritical CO2 cycles, is discussed in two papers. In this first paper a methodology for the conceptual design of a TEES system based on the analysis of the thermal integration between charging and discharging cycles through Pinch Analysis tools is introduced. According to such methodology, the heat exchanger network and temperatures and volumes of storage tanks are not defined a priori but are determined after the cycle parameters are optimized. For this purpose a heuristic procedure based on the interpretation of the composite curves obtained by optimizing the thermal integration between the cycles was developed. Such heuristic rules were implemented in a code that allows finding automatically the complete system design for given values of the intensive parameters of the charging and discharging cycles only. A base case system configuration is introduced and the results of its thermodynamic optimization are discussed here. A maximum roundtrip efficiency of 60% was obtained for the base case configuration assuming turbomachinery and heat exchanger performances in line with indications from manufacturers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Pinch Analysis; Synthesis; Thermo-electrical energy storage (TEES)","Carbon dioxide; Compressed air; Conceptual design; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Heat exchangers; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Synthesis (chemical); Wind power; Complete system; Composite curves; Compressed air energy storage; Corporate research; Cycle parameters; Energy storage systems; Heat exchanger network; Heat exchanger performance; Heat integration; Heat pumps; Heuristic procedures; Heuristic rules; Hot water; Ice storage; In-line; Intensive parameters; Management issues; Pinch analysis; Renewable energies; Roundtrip efficiency; Storage tank; System configurations; Thermal integration; Thermo-electrical energy storage (TEES); Thermodynamic cycle; Thermodynamic optimization; Transcritical CO; Thermodynamic properties; carbon dioxide; conceptual framework; design; electrical power; engine; heat flux; integrated approach; optimization; pump; renewable resource; storage; thermal power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865419723

The analyses point in the direction that in such context a CCS investment is not a suitable way to decrease CO2 emissions. Other alternatives are more cost effective and will fit better into the long-term implementation of sustainable energy systems. The reason is that CCS investments involve huge construction costs with the expectation of long lifetimes. Consequently, the CCS has to operate as part of large-scale power or CHP plants with high utilisation hours for the CCS investment to come even close to being feasible. However, seen in the light of transforming to sustainable energy systems, the number of utilisation hours of power and CHP plants will have to decrease substantially due to the energy efficiency measures in combination with the inclusion of renewable energy power inputs from wind and similar resources. Consequently, no power or CHP plants exist in future sustainable energy systems with sufficient utilisation hours to justify a CCS plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","100 Percent renewable energy systems; CCS, Carbon Capture and Storage; Energy system analysis; Sustainable energy systems","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Carbon capture and storage; CHP plant; Construction costs; Cost effective; Efficiency measure; Energy system analysis; Energy systems; Long lifetime; Power input; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Society of engineers; Sustainable energy systems; Investments; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combined heat and power; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; fossil fuel; future prospect; investment; power generation; renewable resource; sustainability; sustainable development; Denmark; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864382377

First the general context of a different approach based on 'rethinking' and the incorporation of ongoing integration of coming economical and environmental interests on infrastructure, in relation to the sustainable urban development and regeneration from the perspective of the tripod people, technology and design is elaborated. However, this is at different scales, starting mainly from the perspective of the urban dynamics. This approach includes a renewed look at the 'urban metabolism' and the role of environmental technology, urban ecology and environment behavior focus. Second, the potential benefits of strategic and balanced introduction and use of decentralized devices and electric vehicles (EVs), and attached generation based on renewables are investigated in more detail in the case study of the 'Merwe-Vierhaven' area (MW4) in the Rotterdam city port in the Netherlands. In order to optimize the energy balance of this urban renewal area, it is found to be impossible to do this by tuning the energy consumption. It is more effective to change the energy mix and related infrastructures. However, the problem in existing urban areas is that often these areas are restricted to a few energy sources due to lack of available space for integration. Besides this, energy consumption in most cases is relatively concentrated in (existing) urban areas. This limits the potential of sustainable urban regeneration based on decentralized systems, because there is no balanced choice regarding the energy mix based on renewables and system optimization. Possible solutions to obtain a balanced energy profile can come from either the choice to not provide all energy locally, or by adding different types of storage devices to the systems. The use of energy balance based on renewables as a guiding principle, as elaborated in the MW4 case study, is a new approach in the field. It may enhance existing communities, and in some cases result in both the saving and demolition of parts of neighborhoods, which were not foreseen, while at the same time direct introduction of flexible appliances within the energy system for (temporary) storage. It is concluded that the best achievable energy balance in the MW4 area consists of an elaboration in which a smart grid is able to shift the load of flexible devices and charge EVs via smart charging while energy generation is based upon the renewables biomass, wind, tides and the sun. The introduction of new sustainable technologies makes a protected environment for development evident. As for system configuration, the choices arise mainly from technical and social optimisation. In fact, the social, or user-related criteria will be decisive for enduring sustainability. © 2012 by the authors.","Case study; Energy approach planning; Flexible devices; Infrastructures; Storage; Sustainable energy balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864353231

The new controller is designed for a VSI-based STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) with a battery energy storage system (BESS). A combination of real power flow deviation, STATCOM bus voltage deviation and dc link voltage deviation is fed to the proposed hybrid controller which generates the control signals. The proposed hybrid controller uses a two-layer neuro-fuzzy PI control model which is a function based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy scheme. In order to avoid repeated computation of the controller parameters at different operating conditions, a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) technique is used to adapt the parameters. To demonstrate the application of the proposed controller, a number of case studies are carried out in two multimachine power transmission systems with STATCOM/BESS installed at one of the buses. The efficacy of the proposed controller is evaluated by a digital computer simulatio n using MATLAB under various transient disturbances and a wide range of operating conditions. Results are presented to verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed ideas.

Due to the thermal capacity of refrigerated goods and the rather simplistic control most commonly applied, there is a potential for distributing the system load over time in a more cost-optimal way. In this paper we describe a novel economic-optimizing Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that reduces operating costs by utilizing the thermal storage capabilities. A nonlinear optimization tool to handle a non-convex cost function is utilized for simulations with validated scenarios. In this way we explicitly address advantages from daily variations in outdoor temperature and electricity prices. Secondly, we formulate a new cost function that enables the refrigeration system to contribute with ancillary services to the balancing power market. This involvement can be economically beneficial for the system itself, while crucial services can be delivered to a future flexible and intelligent power grid (Smart Grid). Furthermore, we discuss a novel incorporation of probabilistic constraints and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) with economic MPC. A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) formulation of the system models allows us to describe and handle model as well as prediction uncertainties in this framework. This means we can demonstrate means for robustifying the performance of the controller. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Flexible demands; Model predictive control; Optimization; Robust performance; Smart Grids","Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Impulse response; Model predictive control; Optimization; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Smart power grids; Ancillary service; Balancing power market; Daily variations; Electricity prices; Finite-impulse response; Flexible demands; Intelligent power; Model predictive; Non-linear optimization; Nonconvex cost functions; Outdoor temperature; Prediction uncertainty; Probabilistic constraints; Refrigeration system; Robust performance; Second-order cone programming; Smart grid; Supermarket refrigeration; System loads; System models; Thermal storage; Predictive control systems; air conditioning; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; model validation; nonlinearity; numerical model; optimization; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864329545

The biodiesel fuels are palm methyl ester (PME), jatropha methyl ester (JME), coconut oil methyl ester (COME), 20% blends of PME with diesel fuel and 20% blends of JME with diesel fuel. The ordinary diesel fuel was used for comparison purposes. Various ASTM standard methods were used to evaluate all the samples at the interval of 180 h over a 2160 h (three months) duration. Oxidation stability of the samples was measured by induction period (IP) using a Rancimat instrument. Other properties such as density, viscosity, flash point, total acid number (TAN), and total base number (TBN) were measured. The results show that almost all fuel samples met the standard specifications regarding IP. The trends for density, viscosity and TAN increased, while the TBN decreased due to oxidation.

Solar collectors and absorption chiller price are the main contributors to the total system price. The effects of the unit prices of the absorption chiller and solar collectors depend on the technology development. However, electricity prices increases day by day due to the increased fuel prices. Also, storage option is taken into account to increase the load factor of the offered system. The effect of the carbon prices are also investigated for the offered system for different ton prices of the carbon. The best and worst scenarios are given with respect to the variation of the prices and load factor. The results show that, the payback time changes 2.18 to 20.3 years. With 2010 prices with 10 $ per ton carbon credit the payback time is calculated 10.1 years. However, the cost of electricity and carbon increases and the offered system payback time could be logical in less than ten years.","Absorption chiller; Carbon credit; Payback time; Solar energy","Carbon; Cooling systems; Costs; Digital storage; Refrigerators; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Absorption chillers; Carbon credits; Cost of electricity; Electricity prices; Load factors; Payback time; Technological development; Technology development; Absorption cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864246808

Endogenous Aβ peptides reflect the APP processing, and greater knowledge of different APP degradation pathways is important to understand the mechanism underlying AD pathology. When one analyzes longer Aβ peptides by low-energy collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), mainly long b-fragments are observed, limiting the possibility to determine variations such as amino acid variants or post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the N-terminal half of the peptide. However, by using electron capture dissociation (ECD), we obtained a more comprehensive sequence coverage for several APP/Aβ peptide species, thus enabling a deeper characterization of possible variants and PTMs. Abnormal APP/Aβ processing has also been described in the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C and the major large animal used for studying this disease is cat. By ECD MS/MS, a substitution of Asp7 → Glu in cat Aβ was identified. Further, sialylated core 1 like O-glycans at Tyr10, recently discovered in human Aβ (a previously unknown glycosylation type), were identified also in cat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is therefore likely that this unusual type of glycosylation is common for (at least) species belonging to the magnorder Boreoeutheria. We here describe a detailed characterization of endogenous APP/Aβ peptide species in CSF by using an online top-down MS-based method.

To recognize the CO2 capture dynamics by a quiescent water droplet, a theoretical analysis on the mass transfer of CO2 from the gas phase to the liquid phase is performed in this work, with emphasis on the effect of acoustic excitation upon the absorption process. The dimensionless fluctuated amplitude and frequency of the acoustic wave are in the ranges of 0.1-0.99 and 0.1-1000, respectively. The analyses suggest that an acoustic wave with smaller amplitude and higher frequency leads to a more significant energy decay in the droplet due to the role of damping played by the droplet. In contrast, pressure excitation along with larger amplitude and lower frequency has a pronounced effect on the mass transfer process, as a result of higher efficiency of energy penetrating into the liquid phase. From the perspective of achieving carbon capture and storage (CCS), the acoustic excitation with the dimensionless frequency of unity is recommended to capture CO2 by a droplet and the exposure time of the droplet should be controlled at the dimensionless aqueous diffusion time (τl) between 0.31 and 0.36.

Thus a large body of research is being assembled and several new routing protocols have been developed for wireless sensor networks which are unique from the protocols used in other fixed networks. In order to evaluate the performance of any routing protocol, routing metrics are used. But a little attention has been paid by the researchers to the evaluation metrics and design principles for routing protocols that should never be neglected while designing and evaluating routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. This paper depicts some vital evaluation metrics that are essential while designing, developing and evaluating the performance of routing protocols for wireless sensor networks.

We develop a solution approach, called the nonisothermal-negative-saturation (NegSat) solution approach, to solve efficiently nonisothermal compositional flow problems (e.g., CO2/water injection into geothermal reservoirs) that involve phase appearance, phase disappearance, and phase transitions. The advantage of this solution approach is that it circumvents using different equations for single-phase and twophase regions and the ensuing unstable switching procedure. In the NegSat approach, a single-phase multicomponent fluid is replaced by an equivalent fictitious two-phase fluid with specific properties. The equivalent properties are such that the extended saturation of a fictitious gas is negative in the single-phase aqueous region. We discuss the salient features of the simulations in detail. When two phases are present at the injection side, heterogeneity and layering lead to more CO2 storage compared with the homogeneous case because of capillary trapping. In addition, layering avoids movement of the CO2 to the upper part of the reservoir and thus reduces the risk of leakage. Our results also show that heterogeneity and layering change the character of the solution in terms of useful-energy production and CO2 storage. The simulations can be used to construct a plot of the recovered useful energy vs. maximally stored CO 2. Increasing the amount of CO2 in the injection mixture leads to bifurcation points at which the character of the solution in terms of energy production and CO2 storage changes. For overall injected-CO2 mole fractions less than 0.04, the result with gravity is the same as the result without gravity. For larger overall injected-CO 2 mole fractions, however, the plot without gravity differs from the plot with gravity because of early breakthrough of a supercritical-CO 2 tongue near the caprock. The plot of the useful energy (exergy) vs. the CO2-storage capacity in the presence of gravity shows a Z-shape. The top horizontal part represents a branch of high exergy recovery and a relatively lower storage capacity, whereas the bottom part represents a branch of lower exergy recovery and a higher storage capacity. copyright © 2012 Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Exergy; Flow control; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Recovery; Stochastic systems; Two phase flow; Water injection; Energy productions; Geothermal reservoir; Heterogeneous reservoirs; Layered reservoirs; Multicomponent fluid; Specific properties; Switching procedures; Systems of equations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863004670

A graphics- based targeting procedure based on Time Slices (TSLs) was proposed recently to handle this variability. It has been based on the construction of Composite Curves (CCs), Grand Composite Curve (GCC) and the Total Site Profiles for each time interval. However, a dedicated numerical algorithm can offer more useful features. This paper introduces a numerical algorithm to efficiently address large-scale TSHI problems involving variable supply and demand. The tool is an extension of the Total Site Problem Table Algorithm (TS-PTA) published recently. Due to its numerical nature, it locates the stream origins conceptually and precisely and it can be embedded into larger algorithms. TS-PTA allows rapid and precise determination of the Total Site targets utilities and heat storage, while still preserving the ability to show the curves used by the graphical methodology (e.g. GCC and Site CC, which are better for visualisation). Heat storage facilities are used in solving variable supply and demand problem. Total Site Heat Storage Cascade (TS-HSC) is introduced in this work for analysing heat excess in certain TSL that can be cascaded to the next TSL during start-up and operation. This novel tool also could be used for estimating the heat storage capacity required. The procedure is illustrated on a previously published case study, confirming the advantages of TS-PTA to the graphics-based targeting methodology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Heat storage; Total Site; Total Site Heat Integration; Total Site Heat Storage Cascade (TS-HSC); Total Site Problem Table Algorithm (TS-PTA)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862899671

To implement IOA, a multiple for-loop structure with a preset cost function is needed to globally calculate the best hybridization and energy management of the HES. For system hybridization, the optimal size ratio is evaluated by maximizing the HES energy stored capacity at various costs. For energy management, the optimal power distribution combined with a three-mode rule-based strategy is searched to minimize the total consumed energy. Combining above two for-loop structures and giving a time-dependent test scenario, the IOA is derived by minimizing the accumulated HES power. Simulation results show that 6% of the total HES energy can be saved in the IOA case compared with the original system in two driving cycles: ECE and UDDS, and two vehicle weights, respectively. It proves that the IOA effectively derives the maximum energy storage capacity and the minimum energy consumption of the HES at the same time.

However, features abatement triggers new reliability issues such as the single-event multi-bit upset (SMU) failure rates augmentation. To mitigate these failure rates, we propose a novel error mitigation mechanism that relies on a hybrid HW-SW technique. In our proposal, we enforce SoC SRAMs by implementing a fault-tolerant memory buffer with minimal capacity to ensure error-free operation. We utilize this buffer to temporarily store a portion of the stored data, named a data chunk, that is used to restore another data chunk in a fully demand-driven way, in case the latter is faulty. We formulate the buffer and data chunk size selection as an optimization problem that targets energy overhead minimization, given that timing and area overheads are restricted with hard constraints decided beforehand by the system designers. We show that our proposed mitigation scheme achieves full error mitigation in a real SoC platform with an average of 10.1% energy overhead with respect to a base-line system operation, while guaranteeing all the design-time constraints. © 2012 EDAA.",,"Embedded systems; Errors; Failure analysis; Ion beams; Programmable logic controllers; Static random access storage; Error free operations; Error mitigation; Hard constraints; In-process technology; Mitigation schemes; Optimization problems; System designers; Systems on chips; System-on-chip",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862102118

In this paper, the European petroleum refining industry is investigated and the prospects for future CO2 abatement in relation to associated infrastructure are assessed. A more efficient use of the adjacent infrastructure, e.g., district heating networks, natural gas grids, neighbouring industries, and CO2 transport and storage systems, could provide opportunities for additional CO2 emissions reduction. It is shown that access to infrastructures that can facilitate CO2 abatement varies significantly across countries and between individual refineries. The assessment shows that short-term mitigation options, i.e., fuel substitution and energy efficiency measures, could reduce CO2 emissions by 9-40 MtCO2/year (6-26% of the total refinery emissions). It is further shown that carbon capture and storage offers the greatest potential for more significant emission reductions in the longer term. However, the potential for CO2 capture varies significantly depending on the choice of technology, CO2 source, and scope of implementation (5-80% of the total refinery emissions). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Abatement options; Carbon capture and storage; Petroleum refining","Carbon capture; Data storage equipment; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Industry; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refining; Refining; Carbon capture and storage; District heating networks; Efficiency measure; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; European union; Fuel substitution; Mitigation options; Natural gas grids; Oil refineries; Refinery emissions; Storage systems; Carbon dioxide; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency; European Union; natural gas; oil industry; petroleum; refining industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860833773

Fuel cell scooters, by nature, have zero emissions, and they have the potential to replace current petroleum-propelled engine scooters. First, the fundamentals of fuel cells, including the critical technologies pertaining to fuel cell engines and hydrogen storage, were introduced. Then, the technical feasibility of fuel cell scooters was discussed in parallel with the hydrogen infrastructure model. The accomplishments of fuel cell scooters in Taiwan were presented. Moreover, the contribution of replacing petrol scooters by hydrogen fuel cell scooters to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and energy conservation was evaluated. Furthermore, industrial competition with regard to the development of fuel cell scooters was discussed on the basis of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. In conclusion, with mature fuel cell technology together with solid foundation of the scooter industry, Taiwan offers conditions that were conducive for the development of fuel cell scooters. Its social and technical capability will be proved on account of the leading demonstrations of fuel cell scooters in the world. If it can develop a successful business model, Taiwan could enjoy the advantages of tapping the huge global market for zero-emission scooters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Pumped hydropower remains the only mature and widely-adopted utility-scale energy storage technology. However, the selection and development of new pumped hydropower sites is heavily influenced by physical constraints such as terrain, as well as non-physical considerations such as the proximity of proposed reservoirs to settlements or environmentally or culturally sensitive sites. Hence, transforming existing reservoirs to pumped hydropower schemes is often considerably easier than developing completely new schemes. A model is proposed to calculate theoretical potential of a large area for the development of pumped hydropower schemes from existing conventional hydropower stations and from non-hydropower reservoirs. The methodology combines a new database of existing dams and reservoirs with a digital terrain model to identify suitable reservoirs for transformation, applies several constraints to eliminate unfeasible sites, then calculates the realisable potential in terms of power output and energy storage. The model is tested by applying it to the case of Turkey to produce country-level estimates of the theoretical and realisable potential for such transformations. In excess of 3800 GWh of realisable energy storage potential was identified from over 400 sites in the country. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Dams; Energy storage; Geographical information systems; Hydropower; Renewable energy; Turkey","Dams; Energy storage; Geographic information systems; Hydroelectric power; Reservoirs (water); Digital terrain model; Geographical Information System; Hydropower; Hydropower stations; Physical constraints; Power out put; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Storage potential; Storage technology; Turkey; Hydroelectric power plants; dam; database; digital terrain model; GIS; hydroelectric power; power generation; pump; renewable resource; reservoir characterization; theoretical study; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860001216

In this paper, this principle is applied to robotic systems by endowing them with high compliance series elastic actuators in which the electric motors are decoupled from the joints by elastic elements. Periodic motor inputs excite the natural dynamic motion of the robot and create a passivity-based running motion. An optimisation algorithm minimised energy expenditure and estimated the necessary initial model states and the coefficients of a parameterised excitation function for the simulations of a two-dimensional hopping monopod and a planar bounding quadruped. Gait synthesis within this framework was analysed with respect to energy consumption, particularly as a function of running speed. Different solution groups were found, each of them corresponding to a characteristically different movement which proved to be most efficient for the corresponding speed range. This shines a different light on the meaning of 'gait' in the context of robotics, and directly contributes to a better understanding of the creation and exploitation of different modes of locomotion in legged robotics.

A higher programming speed for Gd2O3-NC memories with nanostructure tunneling layers is obtained when compared with that of memories using a single tunneling layer. A longer data retention (&lt;15% charge loss after 104s) is also observed. This is due to the increased physical thickness of the nanostructure tunneling layer. The activation energy of charge loss at different temperatures is estimated. The higher activation energy value (0.13 to 0.17 eV) observed at the initial charge loss stage is attributed to the thermionic emission mechanism, while the lower one (0.07 to 0.08 eV) observed at the later charge loss stage is attributed to the direct tunneling mechanism.

The scheme utilizes two battery energy storage systems (BESS) in which the generated wind power charges one BESS while concurrently, the second BESS is to discharge power into the grid. The role of the two BESS interchanges when the BESS reaches specified state of charge/discharge. Furthermore, based on forecasted charging wind power and the monitored states of charge of the two BESS, the discharge power level from the generating station is determined and scheduled a few hours ahead.

Global warming, described as the greatest environmental challenge in the 21st century, is the increase in the average global air temperature near the surface of the Earth, caused by the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere called greenhouse gases (GHGs). These gases are emitted to the atmosphere mostly as a result of human activities, and can lead to global climate change. The economic losses arising from climate change presently valued at $125 billion annually, has been projected to increase to $600 billion per year by 2030, unless critical measures are taken to reduce the spate of GHG emissions. Globally, the power generation sector is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions today. The reason for this is that most power plants worldwide still feed on fossil fuels, mostly coal and consequently produce the largest amount of CO2emitted into the atmosphere. Mitigating CO2emissions in the power industry therefore, would significantly contribute to the global efforts to control GHGs. This paper gives a brief overview of GHGs, discusses the factors that aid global warming, and examines the expected devastating effects of this fundamental global threat on the entire planet. The study further identifies the key areas to mitigate global warming with a particular focus on the electric power industry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Latent heat TESs demonstrate advantages over sensible heat TESs for their high storage density and small temperature swing; however, lack of accurate knowledge in novel material properties and lack in a holistic design protocol often lead to difficulties in reaching technically viable storage design. With the aim of proposing a sound latent heat based TES design-to-validation protocol, this paper covers material property characterization through Temperature-history (T-history) method, heat exchanger design through heat transfer modeling, and model validation through experimental verification. A model for submerged cylindrically finned heat exchanger latent heat storage unit with phase change material was built. The results show that performance of gelled salt-hydrate based TES can be assessed with a pure conduction based model.

It requires partial purification of CO2 to concentrations above 50% in the flue gas, prior to separation. This purification can be realized with existing techniques like oxygen enriched coal combustion or CO2 separating membranes. Combined with a partial enrichment technique, Condensed Rotational Separation provides an answer that can compete with promising conventional techniques for CO2 capture, like oxy-fuel combustion or amine absorption. These conventional techniques produce a waste stream with a high CO2 purity that can be compressed to supercritical pressure for transport and storage. It is shown that the energy consumption of Condensed Rotational Separation is only slightly more than gas compression of a sequestration stream resulting from conventional separation techniques. The net result is that the total energy consumption becomes less because of the savings due to partial oxygen/CO2 enrichment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal-fired power plants","Centrifugation; Coal; Coal combustion; Energy utilization; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Purification; Centrifugal separation; Coal-fired power plant; Conventional techniques; Enrichment techniques; Gas compression; Oxyfuel combustion; Oxygen-enriched; Partial purification; Separation techniques; Supercritical pressures; Total energy consumption; Waste stream; Carbon dioxide; absorption; carbon dioxide; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); condensation; membrane; nitric oxide; oxygen; pressure effect; sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857993205

An experimental setup was designed and fabricated to simulate the charging and discharging operational modes of the system. 101 spherical capsules were filled with wax paraffin as PCM and packed in cylindrical container bed of 105 mm diameter and 420 mm long. The processes of the experimented storage system were simulated mathematically and solved numerically by finite difference technique. The analyses were carried out at two different mass velocity of the working fluid. The numerical model described the transient behavior of the system and it was in acceptable agreement with the experimental results. The transient period in the charging mode of the tested storage was around 30 min, while the energy recovery period in the discharging mode was around 60 min.

The machine system consists of a four-wheeled drive 4WD prime mover with front mounted machine attachments for the circle spraying operation. The configuration of the circle spraying attachment consists of a hexagonal curved spray boom, lifting arm, opening-tilting mechanism unit, storage tank, spray pump, solid cone nozzles, and associate hydraulic system. Field performance tests on the machine system showed an average effective field capacity of 7.89 ha per man per day and when compared to the earlier reported effective field capacity of the walking spray-operated equipment using Serena LT16 knapsack sprayer; a difference of 1.97 time for circle spraying of mature palms grove. Reduction in the human energy expenditure of 101.28 kJ man-1 h-1 or 10.68 % but an increase in the spraying cost of 1.53 USD ha-1 or 24.9 % were obtained with the machine system against the walking spraying-operated equipment using Serena LT16 knapsack sprayer. Justification for machine system to be cost effective could be satisfied if the present effective field capacity is increased to 1.263 time with good skilled operator or if the current R&amp;D cost is reduced to 0.41 time. This is because the improved field capacity of new machine system could not rationalize its current R&amp;D cost. Admittedly, the machine system has great potential to overcome the limitations with the current employed machine/equipment in the circle spraying operation of oil palms in the plantation.","Agricultural machinery; Chemical spraying; Mechanization; Oil palm cultivation","Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857817726

The kinetic parameters for the isothermal melt-crystallization process of the samples were determined with the Avrami and Lauritzen-Hoffman models. The crystallization activation energies were determined by the Arrhenius method. It was found that the both fillers yielded a significant increase in the storage modulus of PA6. Kinetic calculations showed that the MN has a more pronounced acceleration effect on the crystallization rate of PA6 than the GF. Introduction of a small amount of NA significantly favored the isothermal crystallization rate of GF-reinforced PA6 but did not accelerate that of MN-reinforced one. Based on the results, it has been highlighted that PA6 composites reinforced with surface-treated GFs and including a small amount of clay-like mineral as a cheap and easy-accessible minor filler could yield the best performance for the injection-molded PA6 parts because the GF enhances the mechanical properties and the clay-like mineral accelerates the crystallization rate. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Activation energy; Clay minerals; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fillers; Glass fibers; Injection molding; Isotherms; Kinetics; Microstructural evolution; Reinforcement; Crystallization activation energy; Differential scanning calorimetry methods; Interfacial interaction; Isothermal crystallization; Isothermal crystallization kinetics; Isothermal melt crystallization; Microstructural features; Rheological measurements; Crystallization kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857659479

However, the stability of these enzymes remains a major obstacle, particularly in liquid products, due to increased interaction between the enzymes and the other components of the detergent. The process of formulation involves extensive shelf-life stability studies where residual enzyme activities are correlated with formulation variations. As a way to improve the formulation process, we evaluated the possible use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as a tool to predict enzyme stability in liquid detergents. Thus, residual enzyme activity after incubation in a multitude of formulations was determined and compared to thermodynamic data obtained by DSC. The enzymes tested were a protease, an alpha-amylase and a lipase. We found a strong linear correlation between DSC-derived data, in particular T max (temperature at peak maximum of the transition from the folded to unfolded state) and enzyme activity studies with R 2-values: 0.98 (protease), 0.99 (amylase) and 0.98 (lipase), respectively. Thus, a higher T max for the same enzyme in a particular formulation is directly proportional to longer storage stability. These results suggest a new way of greatly accelerating this type of formulation study, allowing estimation of enzyme compatibility with a specific formulation on a daily, rather than the weekly or monthly basis used at present. © AOCS 2011.","Amylase; Detergent enzyme; Differential scanning calorimetry; Lipase; Liquid laundry detergent; Protease; Protein-surfactant interaction; Surfactant","Cleaning effect; Detergent enzyme; Enzyme stability; Formulation process; Higher T; Laundry detergents; Linear correlation; Liquid detergents; Liquid products; Lower energies; Peak maxima; Protease; Protein-surfactant interaction; Residual enzymes; Shelf life; Stability study; Storage stability; Surfactant; Thermodynamic data; Cleaning; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy utilization; Enzyme activity; Lipases; Liquids; Soaps (detergents); Stability; Surface active agents; Amylases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857361003

Activation of FXR in mice significantly improved high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. It has been reported that activation of imidazoline I-1 receptor by rilmenidine increases the expression of FXR in human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2 cell, to regulate the target genes relating to lipid metabolism; activation of FXR by rilmenidine exerts an antihyperlipidemic action. However, signals for this action of rilmenidine are still unknown. In the present study, hepatic steatosis induced in mice by high-fat diet was improved by rilmenidine after intraperitoneal injection at 1 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks. Also, mediation of I-1 receptors was identified using the specific antagonist efaroxan. Moreover, rilmenidine decreased the oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in Hep G2 cells. Otherwise, rilmenidine increased the phosphorylation of p38 to increase the expression of FXR. Deletion of calcium ions by BAPTA-AM reversed the rilmenidine-induced p38 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we suggest that rilmenidine activates I-1 receptor to increase intracellular calcium ions that may enhance the phosphorylation of p38 to higher the expression of FXR for improvement of hepatic steatosis in both animals and cells. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Farnesoid X receptor; Hepatic steatosis; Imidazoline I-1 receptor; p38; Rilmenidine","calcium ion; efaroxan; ethylene glycol 1,2 bis(2 aminophenyl) ether n,n,n',n' tetraacetic acid; farnesoid X receptor; imidazoline I1 receptor; oleic acid; rilmenidine; synaptophysin; animal experiment; animal model; article; cell strain HepG2; controlled study; fatty liver; human; human cell; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; Animals; Calcium; Cell Line, Tumor; Diet, High-Fat; Egtazic Acid; Fatty Liver; Humans; Imidazoline Receptors; Lipid Metabolism; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oleic Acid; Oxazoles; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857030777

The XFEL provides photons in an energy range between 0.2 and 24.8 keV [1]. XFELs unique time structure comprises bunch trains at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, where each train consists of 2700 bunches with a temporal separation of 220 ns. Each bunch itself consists of ∼ 1012 photons impinging in less than 100 fs. The challenges posed by this time structure will be addressed using a charge integrating device with dynamic gain switching and the possibility to store the analog signals on at least 200 storage cells. Up to now, three different prototype chips have been built, in order to investigate the different blocks of the final AGIPD chip. This paper will report on the results of the characterization of the first two prototype chips, namely AGIPD0.1 and AGIPD0.2. While the investigations on AGIPD0.1 focus on the readout chain (dynamic gain switching, linearity, etc.), the tests of AGIPD0.2 concentrate on the measurements involving the bump-bonded silicon sensor, such as the possibility of resolving single photons and pixel-to-pixel variations as well as the performance of the analog storage pipeline. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.","Instrumentation for FEL; Multi-modality systems; Radiation-hard detectors; X-ray diffraction detectors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856845223

Radix-4, parallel interleaver algorithms and their mapping on to hardware architecture is presented for multi-mode operations. The overheads associated with hardware multiplexing are found to be least significant. Other than flexibility for the turbo decoder implementation, the low silicon cost and low power aspects are also addressed by optimizing the storage scheme for branch metrics and extrinsic information. The proposed unified architecture for radix-4 turbo decoding consumes 0.65 mm 2 area in total in 65 nm CMOS process. With 4 SISO blocks used in parallel and 6 iterations, it can achieve a throughput up to 173.3 Mbps while consuming 570 mW power in total.

Addition of B increased the alloy initial discharge capacity but reduced the alloy capacity retention rate. The cyclic stability of Fe-including alloy was much better than that of C-including alloy, although both of them have almost the same initial discharge capacities. Both the alloy initial discharge capacity and the alloy cyclic stability were improved significantly in the presence of Pd. The analysis by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that Fe increased the corrosion resistance of the alloy without degrading the capacity retention rate.

Objective: We here hypothesized that infusion of medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCT) in healthy lean subjects does not lead to ectopic fat accumulation and hence does not result in lipid-induced insulin resistance. Design and Methods: Nine healthy lean male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with simultaneous infusion of 1) a 100% long-chain triacylglycerols (LCT) emulsion, 2) a 50/50% MCT/LCT emulsion, or 3) glycerol in a randomized crossover design. Muscle biopsies were taken before and after each clamp. Results: MCT/LCT infusion raised plasma free fatty acid levels to a similar level compared with LCT infusion alone. Despite elevated free fatty acid levels, intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) levels were not affected by the MCT/LCT emulsion, whereas LCT infusion resulted in an approximately 1.6-fold increase in IMTG. These differences in muscle fat accumulation did not result in significant differences in lipid-induced insulin resistance between LCT (-28%,P=0.003) and MCT/LCT (-20%, P < 0.001). Total skeletal muscle ceramide content as well as lactosyl- and glucosylceramide levels were not affected by any of the interventions. In addition, the distribution pattern of all ceramide species remained unaltered. Conclusions: Although we confirm that MCFA do not lead to ceramide and IMTG accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue in humans, they do induce insulin resistance. These results indicate that, in humans, MCFA may not be beneficial in preventing peripheral insulin resistance.

In the SBC simulations, we allow particles leaving the system to be truly ejected from the simulation, and randomly inject particles at the boundaries by resampling from the injection/ejection statistics collected from the current or previous simulations. With the SBC, we can measure thermodynamic quantities within the grand canonical ensemble, based on the particle number and energy fluctuations.

This article studies this process in a 2D geothermal reservoir derived from the Delft Sandstone Member below the city Delft (The Netherlands). In this process, often regions of two-phase flow are connected to regions of single-phase flow. Different systems of equations apply for single-phase and for two-phase regions. For this purpose, we have applied a new and effective solution approach, the so-called "" negative saturation"" (NegSat) solution approach. The results show that permeability and porosity heterogeneities in a geothermal aquifer significantly influence both heat extraction and CO 2 storage. Hence, reservoir characterization plays an important role in assessing the benefit of CO 2 storage and energy extraction. The CO 2-trapping mechanism is more efficient in the heterogeneous-permeability field because of the larger permeability heterogeneity contrasts and consequently larger capillary effects, compared to the homogeneous-permeability field. In particular, CO 2 banks are mainly formed in the highly permeable zones that are surrounded by less permeable zones. However, the existence of non-isolated highly permeable zones for some injected CO 2 concentrations leads to earlier breakthrough. Moreover, heterogeneity considerably weakens gravity effects. The frequent occurrence of evaporation and condensation, which is particularly effective close to the bubble point, substantially delays CO 2 breakthrough and leads to a larger amount of heat-energy production and CO 2 storage. Based on the simulations, it is possible to construct a plot of the recuperated heat energy versus the maximally stored CO 2 for a variety of conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Geothermal energy; Mixed CO 2-water injection; Non-isothermal compositional flow simulations; Phase appearance and disappearance","Bubble points; Capillary effects; Carbon sequestration; Effective solution; Energy extraction; Evaporation and condensation; Geothermal reservoir; Gravity effects; Heat energy; Heat extraction; Netherlands; Nonisothermal; Permeability heterogeneity; Phase appearance; Reservoir characterization; Single-phase flow; Solution approach; Systems of equations; Trapping mechanisms; Two-phase region; Aquifers; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Phase transitions; Two phase flow; Water injection; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; geothermal system; permeability; porosity; reservoir; single-phase flow; two phase flow; two-dimensional modeling; Delft; Netherlands; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855286342

Plant concentrations of organic phytochemicals were quantitatively analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. High amounts of both fertilisers produced high amounts of all nutrients and bioactive compounds analysed in fruit except total acidity and ellagic acid. There were major differences in compounds affecting taste in fruit, e. g., sugars (fructose and glucose), total soluble solids and pH, and also in anthocyanin content. The concentrations of secondary metabolites, vitamin C and ellagic acid in fruit also varied significantly between treatments, although the differences were smaller. Storage of blackberries showed variable effects in the different levels of compounds, and the changes found were small. Nutrient regime did not affect blackberry leaves to the same extent, and only minor changes were found.

Adipokines are markedly elevated in the plasma of uremic patients, mainly due to decreased renal excretion. They have pluripotent signaling effects on inflammation/oxidative stress (leptin, adiponectin, resistin), protein-energy wasting (leptin, adiponectin), insulin signaling (adiponectin, leptin, visfatin), endothelial dysfunction (visfatin), and vascular damage (adiponectin, leptin, resistin), which are prevalent in uremic patients. Obesity superimposed to uremia may further aggravate hyperadipokinemia, with the exception of adiponectinemia, which is mitigated by adiposity. Among adipokines and until more data become available, only leptin may be considered as a full uremic toxin owing to adverse effects on protein-energy wasting, cardiovascular damage, inflammation, and the immune system, which have been documented both clinically and experimentally. Resistin and visfatin display some features of uremic toxins, but more data are needed to consider these adipokines as true uremic toxins. In contrast, high levels of adiponectin and chemerin seen in uremia appear to be beneficial. Further research is needed to investigate whether selective removal of leptin, resistin, and visfatin and increments of adiponectin and chemerin levels may have clinical relevance in uremic patients. © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; leptin; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; resistin; adipose tissue; article; blood; drug toxicity; human; inflammation; metabolism; obesity; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiology; signal transduction; uremia; Adipokines; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Drug Toxicity; Humans; Inflammation; Leptin; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Resistin; Signal Transduction; Uremia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855185250

Characteristic peculiarities of the kinetic curve have been established and formulae to approximate the temperature-concentration dependence of the hydrolysis rate are proposed. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in the rate constant k of borohydride hydrolysis, and the temperature dependence of k satisfactorily obeys Arrhenius' equation. The influence of solution alkalinity on the borohydride hydrolysis rate was explored. Within the temperature range studied, the k = f(C OH -) curve consists of two fragments, each with the prevalence of one of two different mechanisms (paths) of borohydride hydrolysis. In highly-alkaline aqueous solutions, non-catalytic hydrolysis mainly occurs, whose rate is determined by temperature, being pH-independent. At lower alkalinity, the hydrolysis rate sharply increases due to catalysis by H + ions. A power dependence of k on the H + concentration has been found; the point where the mechanisms are switched is determined by temperature. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, the heartwood fuel had high levels of extractives (≈19%) compared to the other fuels (2-8%) and thereby ≈16% higher energy contents but caused disturbances during milling, storage, feeding and gasification.

Systematical alloy designing indicated that Mg 0.80Ti 0.15Al 0.05Zr 0.05Ni 0.95 alloy has the best electrode performance. The atomic fractions in this alloy were believed to be optimum to get the reasonable amount of hydrogen storage with the improved cyclic stability. Titanium was estimated to enter into Mg(OH) 2 layer during the discharging process and make this barrier layer more penetrable by elemental hydrogen. Al and/or Al-oxides were predicted to dissolve selectively throughout the barrier hydroxide layer and thus reduce the stability of this layer. The main contribution of Zr was estimated to arise from its large atomic size that Zr atoms can create extra sites for the elemental hydrogen in the alloy structure. As the alloy charge transfer resistances decreased, the alloy retention rates increased. Improvement in the alloy capacity retaining rate was also closely related with the hydrogen diffusion coefficients in the alloy. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A number of scenarios have been set up, including sensitivity on CO2 and oil prices, inclusion/exclusion of electric drive vehicles, and change in investment possibilities in flexible power plants. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are shown to be competitive in all scenarios except the low oil scenarios. The increased electricity consumption for the electric vehicles is covered by wind power in Denmark and Norway and by coal production in Finland and Germany. The competition between wind power and coal is dependent on fuel price and CO2 price assumptions. Furthermore, introducing the flexibility of electric drive vehicles helps decrease cycling on the remaining power plants.

In the composite materials, the fatty acids act as latent heat storage material whereas PnBMA serves as supporting material, which prevents the leakage of the melted fatty acids. The maximum encapsulation ratio for all fatty acids was found to be 40 wt%. The composites that do not allow PCM leakage in melted state were identified as form-stable PCMs. The compatibility of fatty acids with PnBMA is investigated by optical microscopy (OM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Thermal properties and thermal reliability of the form-stable composite PCMs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DSC analysis revealed that the form-stable composite PCMs had melting temperatures between 29.62°C and 53.73°C and latent heat values between 67.23 J/g and 87.34 J/g. Thermal stability of the composite PCMs was studied by thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis and the results indicated that the form-stable PCMs had good thermal stability. In addition, thermal cycling test showed that the composite PCMs had good thermal reliability with respect to the changes in their thermal properties after accelerated 5,000 thermal cycling. On the basis of all results, it was also concluded that the prepared form-stable composite PCMs had important potential for many thermal energy storage applications such as solar space heating of buildings by using wallboard, plasterboard or floors integrated with PCM. © 2011 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Encapsulation ratio; Fourier transform infrared; Melting temperatures; Poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (Pn-BMA); Supporting material; Thermal cycling test; Thermal gravimetric; Thermal reliability; Building materials; Characterization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fatty acids; Heat storage; Isomers; Latent heat; Optical microscopy; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal cycling; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic stability; Thermography (temperature measurement); Walls (structural partitions); Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83955165238

The NegSat solution approach solves efficiently any non-isothermal compositional flow problem that involves phase disappearance, phase appearance, and phase transition. The advantage of the solution approach is that it circumvents using different equations for single-phase and two-phase regions and the ensuing unstable procedure. This paper shows that the NegSat solution approach can also be used for non-isothermal systems. The NegSat solution approach can be implemented efficiently in numerical simulators to tackle modeling issues for mixed CO 2-water injection in geothermal reservoirs, thermal recovery processes, and for multicontact miscible and immiscible gas injection in oil reservoirs. We illustrate the approach by way of example to cold mixed CO 2-water injection in a 1D geothermal reservoir. The solution is compared with an analytical solution obtained with the wave-curve method (method of characteristics) and shows excellent agreement. A complete set of simulations is carried out, which identifies six bifurcations. The two main bifurcations are (1) when the most downstream compositional wave is replaced by a compositional shock and (2) when an extra Buckley-Leverett rarefaction appears. The plot of the useful energy (exergy) versus the CO 2 storage capacity shows a Z-shape.

PolyPs are widely used as reagents in water treatment, fertilizers, flame retardants and food additives due to its unique properties, inexpensiveness, nontoxicity and biodegradability. The practice of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), based on PolyP accumulation by sludge bacteria, is an accepted and low-cost strategy for controlling eutrophication. PolyPs are present in the cells of all living organisms, from bacteria to mammals. They perform numerous functions in the cells: phosphate and energy storage, sequestration and storage of cations, formation of membrane channels, cell envelope formation and function, gene activity control, regulation of enzyme activities, stress response and stationary phase adaptation. PolyPs participate in bone tissue development and in the blood coagulation cascade and are promising candidates in therapy for bone and blood diseases. They may also have application in creating novel bone substitute materials, serving as carriers for prolonged action drugs, and acting as a phosphodonor in enzymatic synthesis of biologically active compounds. The importance of polyphosphate kinases in the virulence of pathogens forms a basis for the development of new antibiotics.

More specifically, the food industry can contribute by reducing the number of energy-dense products; by improving the nutrient profile of processed food through the reduction of salt, added sugar, trans-fatty acid, and saturated fat content. As a result, food science and technology are prompted to create a new framework for these food-based dietary guidelines, principally in the areas of food physics, methods of food storage and preservation, nutrient restoration and fortification of foods, and the development of health-focused designer foods and functional foods. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some further opportunities for new product development and nutrition research.

Although various studies have investigated technology acceptance, most technology acceptance studies focused on a limited set of factors that can influence public acceptance, and were not based on a comprehensive framework including key factors influencing technology acceptance. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework of energy technology acceptance, based on a review of psychological theories and on empirical technology acceptance studies. The framework aims to explain the intention to act in favor or against new sustainable energy technologies, which is assumed to be influenced by attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norm. In the framework, attitude is influenced by the perceived costs, risks and benefits, positive and negative feelings in response to the technology, trust, procedural fairness and distributive fairness. Personal norm is influenced by perceived costs, risks and benefits, outcome efficacy and awareness of adverse consequences of not accepting the new technology.

The TES system can balance the energy demand between the peak (daytimes) and off-peak hours (nights). The cool-energy is usually stored in the form of ice, phase change materials, chilled water or eutectic solution during the nighttimes and used in the daytime. A well-designed TES system would effectively decrease the electricity demand with a reasonable cost. This paper summarizes the findings, investigations and analysis of the TES systems for the space cooling applications. In this regards, different types of storage technologies, as well as various operating strategies, are discussed and some of the outstanding case studies are presented. Since the TES system can provide any portion of the required cooling load, the designer must focus on the best practical and economical solution, which is mainly influenced by localized parameters. It is evident that to improve the available designing standard, a sustainable investigation on localized parameters such as the electricity demand trend, the peak and off-peak hours, the climate change profiles, the electricity tariff rate and the system setup costs are still required. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current development of smart (micro)grids with substantial amount of DG (""DisGenMiGrids"") suffers from a focus on mere 'technology'. Ongoing problems with deployment of renewable energy have shown that implementation is largely determined by broad social acceptance issues. This smart grid development is very important for further renewables deployment, but again there is a tendency to continue the neglect of social determinants. Most technical studies apply implicit and largely unfounded assumptions about the participation in and contribution of actors to DisGenMiGrid systems. This lack of understanding will have severe consequences: smart grids will not further renewables deployment when there are hardly actors that are willing to become part of them. This review is a first attempt to address the social construction of smart electricity grids. As institutional factors have proved to be the main determinants of acceptance, these will also be crucial for further renewables deployment in micro-grid communities. Elaboration of the institutional character of social acceptance and renewables' innovation calls for an institutional theory approach involving Common Pool Resources management, because these socio-technical systems aim to optimise the exploitation of natural resources. Citizens/consumers and other end-users increasingly have the option to become more self-sufficient by becoming co-producers of electricity. They may optimise the contribution of DG when they cooperate and insert their renewable energy in a cooperative microgrid with mutual delivery. Moreover, the option to include 'distributed storage' capacity (electric vehicles) in these microgrids, enables an increasing share of renewables deployment. However, all these options should be institutionally opened. This requires much self-governance and flexible overall regulation that allows microgrids. The research agenda should focus on how such new systems become institutionally embedded, and how they are socially constructed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An extremely large percentage (ca. 85%) consumed energy by vehicles is converted to waste heat, i.e. invalid work. To improve working efficiency of vehicles and to retrieve waste energy from vehicles are two essential energy topics in the 21st century. This work presents a mechanical system which will be built in the decelerating downhill roadways to capture the waste energy of vehicles and is internationally patented by the Taiwanese Yeu-Chun green energy technology incorporated company. This developed system is mainly composed of the piston plates and the instantaneous electric generating apparatus in connection with the potential energy storage. In process, the piston plates are built in the decelerating downhill roadways and pressed by the decelerating vehicles for waste energy capturing. The captured energy is either first saved into the potential energy storage for energy collection and then discharged to drive the electric generators or directly applied to the electric generation. The hydraulic drive technique is applied in this system for force transfer from vehicles to the electric generators while vehicles are running over the piston plates.

However, increasing penetration levels of intermittent renewables is challenging that position. The paradigmatic case of West Denmark indicates that distributed operators are capitulating as wind power penetration levels are moving above 25%; some operators are retiring cogeneration units entirely, while other operators are making way for heat-only boilers. This development is jeopardizing the system-wide energy, economic, and environmental benefits that distributed cogeneration still has to offer.The solution is for distributed operators to adapt their technology and operational strategies to achieve a better co-existence between cogeneration and wind power.Four options for doing so are analysed including a new concept that integrates a high pressure compression heat pump using low-temperature heat recovered from flue gasses in combination with an intermediate cold storage, which enables the independent operation of heat pump and cogenerator.It is found that an electric boiler provides consistent improvements in the intermittency-friendliness of distributed cogeneration. However, well-designed heat pump concepts are more cost-effective than electric boilers, and in future markets where the gas/electricity price ratio is likely to increase, compression heat pumps in combination with intermediate thermal storages represent a superior potential for combining an intermittency-friendly pattern of operation with the efficient use of electricity in heating and cooling production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed cogeneration; Intermittent renewables; Smart Grid; Techno-economic optimization","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Cold storage; Energy policy; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Wind power; Co-existence; Denmark; Distributed cogeneration; Distributed operators; Energy systems; Environmental benefits; Heat pumps; High pressure compression; Low temperatures; Operational strategies; Penetration level; Price ratio; Renewables; Smart grid; Sustainable energy policy; Techno-economics; Thermal storage; Wind power penetration; Smart power grids; carbon dioxide; cogeneration; cooling; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; heating; low temperature; optimization; paradigm shift; sustainable development; wind power; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80755184619

Thermal energy was transferred to the calculation domain through the base of heat sink. The n-eicosane was adopted inside the heat sink cavity as the Phase Change Material (PCM) for latent heat storage. The governing equations were solved numerically by a control-volume-based finite-difference method using a power law discretization scheme to describe the heat transfer in the simulated system. The melting mushy zone, around the phase change boundary, was predicted by an enthalpy-porosity approach. In addition, the PCM-air VOF (Volume of Fluid) model was adapted to solve PCM-air gap boundary which was caused by PCM's volume expansion for the difference of variable density. In this study, numerical computations have been conducted for various power levels (2 W-4 W), different orientations (vertical/horizontal/slanted), and charge and discharge modes.

A significant redistribution of Li+ from the phosphate glass surface layer into the subsurface LiFePO4 phase constitutes a rapid electrostatic storage component, and - more importantly - this Li+ redistribution constitutes a "" heterogeneous doping"" enhancing the defect concentrations on both sides of the interface. The resulting deviations from local electroneutrality qualitatively change the transport properties. For temperatures close to room temperature simulations yield an enhancement of ion mobilities in surface-modified LiFePO4 by up to three orders of magnitude via the mesoscopic multiphase effect. A layer-by-layer analysis of ion mobility in structurally relaxed heterostructures indicates a continuous variation of the mobility as a function of the distance from the interface with the maximum mobility close to the interface. For nanoparticles of suitably chosen dimensions, Li+ diffusion remains enhanced compared to bulk values even at the center of the cathode material crystallites. Moreover, the role of LiFe//FeLi antisite defects for the dimensionality of ion migration in bulk and nanostructured LiFePO4 is analyzed yielding criteria for a transition from one-dimensional to higher-dimensional long-range migration. This allows reconciling discrepancies between experimental single crystal studies and previous theoretical studies for the ordered LiFePO4 structure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Heterogeneous doping; Lithium ion batteries; Mesoscopic multiphase effect; Nanostructured energy storage materials","Cathodes; Charging (batteries); Crystal structure; Defects; Ions; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Molecular dynamics; Phase interfaces; Single crystals; Superconducting materials; Surfaces; Transport properties; Heterogeneous doping; Lithium ion batteries; Mesoscopics; Nano-structured; Lithium; cation; concentration (composition); electrical conductivity; electrode; electronic equipment; lithium; mobility; molecular analysis; nanotechnology; phosphate (inorganic); storage structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053330783

The challenges cover different time scales from intra-hour, intra-day/day-ahead to several days and seasonal level. Along with flexible electricity demand options, various electricity storage technologies are being discussed as candidates for contributing to large-scale wind power integration and these also differ in terms of the time scales at which they can operate. In this paper, using the case of Western Denmark in 2025 with an expected 57% wind power penetration, wind power impacts on different time scales are analysed. Results show consecutive negative and high net load period lengths indicating a significant potential for flexibility measures capable of charging/activating demand and discharging/inactivating demand in periods of 1. h to one day. The analysis suggests a lower but also significant potential for flexibility measures charging/activating demand in periods of several days. In addition, the results indicate a physical potential for seasonal electricity storage. In the study, a number of large-scale electricity storage technologies - batteries, flow batteries, compressed air energy storage, electrolysis combined with fuel cells, and electric vehicles - are moreover categorised with respect to the time scales at which they are suited to support wind power integration. While all of these technologies are assessed suitable for intra-hour and intra-day/day-ahead power balancing only some are found suited for responding to several days with high/low net loads and even fewer for seasonal balancing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity storage; Net load; Power system balancing; Wind power","Compressed air energy storage; Denmark; Different time scale; Electricity demands; Energy systems; Flow batteries; Large-scale wind power; Net load; Period length; Physical potentials; Power balancing; Power system balancing; Storage technology; Time-scales; Wind power integrations; Wind power penetration; Cold storage; Compressed air; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Time measurement; Wind power; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity supply; electrokinesis; fuel cell; renewable resource; storage; technological development; timescale; wind power; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961126617
