The side chains for the polymer structure were optimized through metadynamics simulations, which revealed the use of octadecanol esters generates ideal free energy surfaces for drug encapsulation and release. Nanoparticles were synthesized using a solvent evaporation-precipitation method by mixing the polymer solution in acetone into water; upon acetone evaporation, a nanodispersion with an average particle size of ∼150 nm was obtained. Gentamicin sulfate, possessing five amino groups, was spontaneously entrapped in the nanocarrier by ionic interactions. Encapsulation efficiency increases significantly with the increase in pH and ionic strength. In vivo results demonstrate high gentamicin (GM) content in the enteric chamber (AUC 8207 ± 1334 (μg min)/mL) compared to 3% GM solution (AUC 2024 ± 438 (μg min)/mL). The formulation was also able to significantly extend the release of gentamicin when applied to rabbit cornea.

This would entail not only covering operational energy use, but also embodied energy and displacing embodied greenhouse gas emissions in construction materials and renewable energy systems, across their supply chains. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of achieving net zero life cycle primary energy and greenhouse gas emissions (NZLCPEGHG) buildings. We use a case study apartment building in Sehaileh, Lebanon and conduct a life cycle cost, energy and greenhouse gas emissions analysis over 50 years of a business-as-usual building and its NZLCPEGHG counterpart. Results show that a 6.5 kWp solar photovoltaic array, solar hot water, an improved operational energy efficiency, an all-electric operational energy demand, and a reduced embodied energy, can achieve a NZLCPEGHG apartment unit (154 m2, 4 occupants) in a four-storey building. Installing battery storage (or not) is critical regarding life cycle cost, swinging the net present value from −46 to +47 USD2020/(m2-of-gross-floor-area) over 50 years. The greenhouse gas emissions factor of the electricity grid is key to achieving a NZLCPEGHG building, with cleaner grids making it harder to displace embodied greenhouse gas emissions. We argue, inter alia, for a more transparent and comprehensive definition of NZLCPEGHG buildings, policy that subsidises this level of performance to cover additional capital costs, and reducing the initial embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions that might never be paid-back or displaced. These measures will help address the current climate emergency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Lebanon; Life cycle cost analysis; Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis; Photovoltaic; Residential buildings; Zero carbon","Apartment houses; Artificial life; Building materials; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Zero energy buildings; Apartment buildings; Life cycle energies; Life cycle primary energies; Mediterranean climates; Net present value; Operational energy; Renewable energy systems; Solar photovoltaics; Energy efficiency; building; climate conditions; emission inventory; energy efficiency; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Mediterranean environment; Lebanon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092097545

Due to the Swiss moratorium against the export of spent nuclear fuel in 2006 and the non-availability of a nuclear repository it was necessary to store the spent fuel locally at the nuclear power plant site. The prolongation of this moratorium in 2016 does not allow reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in the next years. As a direct conclusion from this moratorium it was decided to build a wet storage pool at Gösgen/Däniken which entered operation in 2008 with a capacity of 504 fuel assemblies. In a second stage of completion another 504 fuel assemblies can be stored in the pool. Two cooling towers will be available for the passive cooling of the wet storage pool with a maximum cooling capacity of 1.5 MW after the second stage of completion. In this wet storage pool only spent nuclear fuel elements will be stored, which have been stored before more than four years in an at reactor spent fuel pool. This means that the nuclear heat of a single 15x15 rod nuclear fuel assembly (FA) used in the NPP Gösgen is at 1.6 kW maximum, when it is stored in the wet storage pool. The present work describes postulated severe accidents with total loss of cooling in the wet storage pool (WSP) of the Gösgen/Däniken nuclear power plant. The accident progression in a spent fuel pool and even more in a wet storage pool is very slow due to the low nuclear decay heat. Therefore the investigation of such kind of accident was not assumed to be of high importance for a long time. The overall accepted assumption of an energy recovery after at least 24 h would not lead to boiling of a spent fuel pool due to the low decay heat. The severe accident in Fukushima Daiichi (2011.03.11) following the great Eastern earthquake and the related tsunami has shown that the power recovery can be delayed much longer, e.g. for more than a week. This long time of loss of cooling could endanger a spent fuel pool especially if the whole core is unloaded into the pool like in Fukushima Daiichi unit 4. Main goal of the work is to achieve information about the timing of postulated severe accidents in the wet storage pool and to define time frames for accident management measures to prevent fuel damage and fission product release. In every of the calculations more than three weeks passes before fuel uncovery would lead to fission product release. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","MELCOR; Severe Accident; Spent fuel pool","Cooling; Fission products; Fuel storage; Fuels; Information management; Lakes; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel elements; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Pressurized water reactors; Radioactive waste storage; Waterworks; Accident management; Energy recovery; Fukushima daiichi; Maximum cooling capacity; Nuclear fuel assemblies; Nuclear repositories; Spent fuel pools; Spent nuclear fuels; Nuclear fuel reprocessing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092079904

Also, finding the optimum design parameters and operating conditions requires many experimental tests and intricate mathematical models. Besides, improving the energy efficiency and lacking technical feasibility of the combined geothermal systems are other challenges concerning geothermal systems. To cover the mentioned challenges, in the current study, a hybrid geothermal/absorption refrigeration system (ARS) incorporated with solar thermal collector, desalination unit and hydrogen storage system is designed and assessed. The proposed system is investigated by developing two methods of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as thermodynamic model. The intelligent methods are multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network optimized with imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), MLP-ICA, and MLP optimized with genetic algorithm (GA), MLP-GA. These methods are manufactured based on the solar irradiance, cooling water temperature difference, ambient temperature, pinch-point temperature, evaporating and condensing temperatures as independent parameters. These parameters are utilized to obtain the power generation, coefficient of performance of the ARS (COPchiller), heat exchanger area of the ARS, and cycle thermal efficiency. The obtained results show that simulation of the system by MLP-ICA was successfully carried out and this model operates substantially better than the MLP-GA for simulating the behavior of the system. Also, the payback time for the proposed system (with the interest rate of 3%) was obtained around 8 years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption refrigeration system; Desalination unit; Genetic algorithm; Geothermal energy system; Imperialist competitive algorithm; Solar thermal collector","Absorption refrigeration; Cooling water; Desalination; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Geothermal fields; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal wells; Hydrogen storage; Multilayers; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Temperature; Cooling water temperature; Geothermal energy systems; Hydrogen storage system; Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA); Imperialist competitive algorithms; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Optimum design parameters; Solar thermal collector; Multilayer neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091587747

Specific issue represents repair and renewal of old or historically valuable buildings, where the newly applied materials must be compatible with those originally used in the past. Taking into consideration the necessity to decrease the energy consumption of existing buildings with valuable aesthetic facades and appearance, use of repair renders with improved thermal insulation performance represents acceptable solution to adopt the present building stock to actual thermal requirements. In this paper, complex characterization of non-hydrophobized lightweight renders designed at once for repair and thermal insulation purposes was performed. In composition of designed materials, silica sand was partially or fully replaced with expanded perlite of the similar grain size distribution, whereas the workability of fresh renders was maintained on the same level. Among broad experimental campaign, structural parameters, moisture and heat transport and storage properties, and mechanical parameters of the hardened renders were assessed in dependence on time of samples maturing. Frost resistance test was conducted to characterize renders durability. The use of lime and natural hydraulic lime in composition of perlite lightened mortars enabled to meet all the criteria on rendering and masonry mortars taking into consideration their functionality, compatibility, durability and thermal insulation performance. These mortars well found usable for repair of historical masonry and even in conservation of heritage protected buildings. On the other hand, the cement-lime renders were found to be incompatible, too rigid and less permeable both for water and water vapor than required by culture heritage authorities, related technical standards and directives for repair renders. Nevertheless, these can find use in the construction of new buildings as thermal insulation and general purpose mortars. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Frost resistance; Hygric performance; Lightweight renders; Mechanical and thermal properties; Microstructure; Perlite; Repair and thermal insulation mortars","Binders; Buildings; Durability; Electric circuit breakers; Energy utilization; Grain size and shape; Historic preservation; Lime; Mortar; Pearlite; Repair; Silica; Silica sand; Experimental campaign; Grain size distribution; Insulation performance; Mechanical parameters; Repair and renewals; Research and development; Structural parameter; Thermal requirements; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090213252

In this study, liquefied natural gas, liquid ammonia and methanol are proposed to transport the energy of natural gas in different forms to overseas. Due to temperature difference between the energy storage medium and the ambient, a portion of liquefied energy carriers mass is lost as boil-off gas (BOG). Therefore, a technical assessment based on energy and exergy analyses is conducted in this work to assess the total required energy and losses due to BOG for each energy carrier. To make a fair comparison among the energy carriers, the ship volume capacity is the fixed factor. The results show that the total daily energetic BOGs for LNG, ammonia, and methanol are calculated as 0.610%, 0.098%, 0.034% while the exergetic BOGs are 0.491%, 0.068%, 0.032%, respectively.

Even with recently introduced second generation Ru based catalysts with superior performance over commercial Fe based catalysts, there is still place for upgrading with new approach using advanced materials in catalyst formulation. The alkali and alkaline metal promoted Ru supported carbon and metal oxide catalyst attracted attention at initial stage and extensively studied for NH3 synthesis in the 20th century. Until recently, advanced materials such as electrides, hydrides, nitrides, oxides and oxy-hydrides-nitrides studied as support and active component of catalyst fascinated much attention, with milder reaction conditions for NH3 synthesis. These materials with unique properties of reversible storage of electrons, hydrides, nitrides and oxygen vacancies enrich electron density on Ru catalyst and cleave N≡N bond with very low activation energy (&lt;60 kJ/mol). The mechanistic understanding of these materials leads to the fact that activation N≡N bond is no more rate-determining step (RDS). Instead, formation of N−H bond is RDS, pushing towards an innovative research directions and scientific basis for development of new catalysts.

The study proposes an approach that can minimize the utilization of the grid for electricity usage in the load and maximize the sale from renewable energy (photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT)). Besides, the battery storage is permitted to sell the excess power during high price period. A time-of-use (ToU) and step-rate tariffs are incorporated in the model to control the efficiency of the utility grid and also to consider the fluctuation of the electricity price. Therefore, two energy management methodologies are developed to adjust the tariffs for great benefits. Various residential feed-in tariffs (FIT) are implemented in order to reach the potential of cost-saving and earn more cost-benefit. A typical Moroccan house, containing a grid-connected PV-WT-Battery system, is used for study validation. On the one hand, simulation results show that the developed energy management strategies are effective in controlling the power sources optimally. On the other hand, applying the method under a greater FIT, a lesser requirement of battery capacity will be performed as well as a maximum cost saving. Then, the model as a Non-Linear Problem (NLP) is compared with another existing optimization approach to ascertain the effectiveness and validity of the algorithm. © 2020.

In order to combat these challenges, several technologies such as the use of energy storage systems, hybrid energy storages system and hybrid systems have been used to provide fast frequency response and regulation. This paper gives a comprehensive review of these technologies thus highlighting their applications, merits and demerits for frequency regulation in renewable energy sourced grid.

The methodology consisted of developing different experiments to evaluate the biogas performance in each of the selected biomasses. The percentage of CH4 and CO2 was determined by gas chromatography, from which the following results were obtained: by rinds of, potato (35.64% CH4), papaya (1.64% CH4), pineapple (0.11% CH4), pea (16.13% CH4), banana (0.39% CH4), bean (0.76% CH4), sugarcane bagasse (80.85% CH4), wet sugarcane bagasse (96.06% CH4), semi-dry sugarcane bagasse (91.39% CH4) and potato peel with sugarcane bagasse (58.74% CH4). After the methane quantification in the different codigestion, the sugarcane bagasse presented better results with a 15% increase in the generation of methane when it was pretreated.

In that context, PD engineers make use of complex and computationally expensive models that impose time-consuming industrial practices to reach an adequate PD design. In this article, we propose a general surrogate-based methodology for fast and reliable analysis and design optimization of PD networks (PDN). We first formulate a generic surrogate model methodology exploiting passive lumped models optimized by parameter extraction to fit PDN impedance profiles. This PDN modeling formulation is illustrated with industrial laboratory measurements of a fourth generation server CPU motherboard. We next propose a black box PDN surrogate modeling methodology for efficient and reliable PD design optimization. To build our black box PDN surrogate, we compare four metamodeling techniques: support vector machines, polynomial surrogate modeling, generalized regression neural networks, and Kriging. The resultant best metamodel is then used to enable fast and accurate optimization of the PDN performance. Two examples validate our surrogate-based optimization approach: a voltage regulator (VR) with dual power rail remote sensing intended for communications and storage applications, by finding optimal sensing resistors and loading conditions; and a multiphase VR from a fifth-generation Intel server motherboard, by finding optimal compensation settings to reduce the number of bulk capacitors without losing CPU performance. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Impedance profile; intellectual property (IP) protection; metamodels; microprocessor; motherboard; optimization; power delivery network (PDN); power integrity (PI); surrogate modeling; voltage regulator (VR)","Electric power transmission; Electromagnetic pulse; Energy utilization; Green computing; Optimization; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Voltage regulators; Generalized regression neural networks; Laboratory measurements; Low energy consumption; Meta-modeling technique; Microprocessor architectures; Power delivery network; Surrogate-based analysis; Surrogate-based optimization; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097995934

In this article, a new methodology is presented for calculating the optimal structures of desalination plants that are power-supplied by RES and cooperate with smart grids. The proposed technique takes into account the tradeoff between the three alternative degrees of freedom in the operation of the overall desalination plant, i.e., battery storage, water storage, and dynamic exchange of energy with the smart grid. The design results verify that the economically optimized configurations derived by applying the proposed design tool are capable to cover the water requirements of the consumers and support the operation of the electric grid by injecting the RES-generated energy surplus. Numerical results are also presented, demonstrating that the application of the proposed methodology enables to reduce the lifetime cost of the desalination plant by 60% compared with the exclusive use of electric grid energy. Also, by employing the total lifetime cost of the grid-connected RES-based desalination plant as objective function of the optimal design problem, the economical viability of the desalination system is improved. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Desalination; optimization; renewable energy sources; smart grid; water supply","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Desalination; Electric power transmission networks; Potable water; Renewable energy resources; Structural optimization; Water filtration; Desalination systems; Design optimization; Economical viability; Environmentally-friendly technology; Objective functions; Optimized configuration; Renewable energy source; Water desalination; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097110064

Due to recent technological advances in bidirectional power transfer, EVs could serve not just as transportation tools but also as electric storage units for the grid. As a result, battery management is now more crucial than ever to control the energy transfer to and from the battery pack, while keeping all battery parameters within a safe and optimal region. In order to do so, accurate knowledge of SOC is of significant importance, since it reflects the inner state of the battery. This paper proposes, a multi-innovation theory to enhance the estimation accuracy of the unscented Kalman filter. By expanding a single innovation voltage value to multi-innovations consisting of the previous and current values of the battery's output, the accuracy of the UKF is drastically improved. All the design aspects of the proposed MI-UKF are detailed. Moreover, a hybrid Levenberg Marquardt approach is implemented for battery internal parameter identification. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed MI-UKF is robust against unpredicted operational conditions, and it can enhance the accuracy of the UKF with more than 1%. © 2020","Battery management system; Electric vehicle; Multi innovation theory; State of charge estimation; Unscented Kalman filter; Vehicle to grid technology","Battery Pack; Charging (batteries); Electric tools; Energy transfer; Kalman filters; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery Management; Innovation theory; Levenberg-Marquardt; Operational conditions; State-of-charge estimation; Technological advances; Unscented Kalman Filter; Vehicular applications; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095441287

Much research has been conducted on the material use of lignin, but the lignin commercialization process is still under development; few commercial production facilities and larger-scale applications are available. Therefore, we present a review of recent research papers on the economic perspectives on lignin. Recent Findings: Research has been conducted on lignin application areas such as lignin-derived polymeric materials, polymer and composite systems, applications for microsized and nanosized lignin, energy storage, and renewable chemicals. On the whole, the life cycle assessment results indicate that lignin-based innovations can be environmentally beneficial. Techno-economic studies identified the lignin feedstock cost and the achievable product price as the most sensitive factors. Recently, researchers pointed out information asymmetries between different stakeholder groups concerning lignin-containing products. Summary: Although most of the relevant papers presented a technical perspective of lignin, a smaller set of general economic statements about lignin appear in these papers. These statements refer to lignin underutilization, limited markets, resource abundancy, and barriers to utilization. The literature on technical lignin with an economic perspective can be divided into two different streams: several techno-economic papers and fewer socio-economic papers. The former placed a primary focus on production processes from a profit maximization perspective, but attempts were also made in the latter to explain the socio-technical innovation system. To date, lignin researchers have focused mainly on internal (direct) factors but have not yet sufficiently considered external (indirect) factors. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cross-sectoral collaboration; Lignin biorefinery; Lignin innovation; Lignin market; Lignin sustainability; Lignin techno-economic",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094210880

However, it is well known that temperatures between 20 °C and 42 °C promote the multiplication of Legionella species, which are the causative agent of the Legionnaires' disease, a life-threatening form of pneumonia. Conventional tank water heating systems could be reservoirs of Legionella species, and that is why the replacement of these systems with tankless point-of-use water heating (POUWH) systems may keep a low-risk concentration of Legionella pneumophila in the water delivery and reduce energy consumption. This strategy may attain its maximum effectiveness in continental climate regions like Kazakhstan, where water mains-supply does not exceed 20 °C all year-round. Nevertheless, as POUWH systems depend on electricity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may change compared to storage-based or even in-line water heating systems, depending on the energy source of grid electricity and the base-case heating system. This study assesses the use of POUWH systems in Nur-Sultan city, the capital of Kazakhstan, and compares it with commonly used electric and natural gas storage-type water heating systems. The power grid in the country heavily depends on coal (~70%), and the present analysis demonstrates that POUWH is economically competitive and reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared with electric storage-type water heating (ESWH). However, the opposite happens when POUWH is compared with natural gas storage-type water heating (NGWH). The financial analysis revealed the fuel cost as the most influential factor in economic viability. Despite its debatable economic advantage, POUWH is favored by its intrinsic lower risk of Legionella sp. concentration in delivered hot water, a crucial element that should be considered in a final decision. © 2020 International Energy Initiative","Feasibility; In-line water heating system; Legionella; RETScreen; Tankless water heater","Artificial life; Coal storage; Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Natural gas; Continental climate; Economic advantages; Environmental implications; Influential factors; Legionella pneumophila; Reduce energy consumption; Residential sectors; Water heating systems; Heating; consumption behavior; energy efficiency; energy use; feasibility study; heating; pathogenicity; temperature effect; Kazakhstan; Legionella; Legionella pneumophila; Legionella sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094175782

The synergy between graphene and aluminium trifluoride enhances the intrinsic electrochemical properties of pristine LiMn2O4 (LMO) and reduced Mn+3 dissolution. The unique composite effectively reduced Li+ diffusion distances with less polarization as it effectively accommodates the structural transformation during Li+ ion charge and discharge. The electrochemical interrogation revealed faster charge transportation and decrease in charge transfer resistance due to inhibition of the pronounced pile-up of Li+ ions and undesired Mn3+ ions on the surfaces. The electrochemical performances were tested in LiNO3 aqueous electrolyte and the cell delivered a capacity of 90 mA h g−1 based on the total weight of the active electrode materials.

Generally, the liners delayed the cooling rate significantly. Non-perforated and micro-perforated liners are similar in terms of airflow resistance and cooling rate, both delayed the optimum cooling time by 5 h compared to the plastic-free case.

To investigate the applicability of this technology, six selected Kazakhstan sedimentary basins (the Precaspian, Mangyshlak, South-Torgay, Ustyurt, Chu-Sarysu, and Zaysan basins) were evaluated and ranked for geologic CO2 storage deployment in terms of containment, capacity, and feasibility. The effective CO2 storage capacities in oil reservoirs, gas reservoirs, and saline aquifers were estimated for each basin using the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) and USDOE methods. The evaluations revealed that the Precaspian Basin is the most suitable for geological CO2 storage, followed by the Mangyshlak, South Torgay, and Ustyurt basins. The total effective CO2 storage capacity of the country is estimated to be ∼583 Gt, of which ∼539 Gt corresponds to the abovementioned four suitable basins where most of injected CO2 is expected to be stored in the hydrodynamic traps. The results suggest that four sedimentary basins identified in this study have prospectivity to reduce GHG emissions of Kazakhstan significantly and thus enable the decarbonization of national economy to achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; CO2 storage capacity; Greenhouse gases; Kazakhstan; Paris agreement; Sedimentary basins","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economics; Gas emissions; Hydrogeology; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Sedimentology; Settling tanks; Carbon sequestration; Green economies; Hydrodynamic traps; Land resources; National economy; Oil reservoirs; Saline aquifers; Sedimentary basin; Greenhouse gases; annual variation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; sedimentary basin; Kazakhstan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093686421

However, the cost of kWhe produced is relatively high compared with fossil resources and can be reduced by integrating a cogeneration system exploiting waste energy. In this study, a technico-economic evaluation of a 1 MWe CSP plant with a condensation heat (85 °C) is investigated. The temperature constraint is set to meet the thermal separation needs of the draw solution of a forward osmosis desalination process. The purpose of this study focuses on the factors involved in reducing the cost per kWhe, which are the selection of the organic fluid used in the organic Rankine cycle and the appropriate choice of the solar multiple (SM) according to the appropriate storage hours (SH) maximizing the CSP thermal efficiency. The performance of different organic fluids was compared, based on the calculation of the thermodynamic cycle efficiency. The cyclopentane was retained for its reduced cost. Operating with this fluid, a sensitivity analysis was realized to test the effect of the solar multiple and storage hours on the power plant. It allows us to conclude that different appropriate combination between storage hours and solar multiple can be chosen, for the needs of our project, we opt for 8 h and 1.85, respectively. Thus, in this case, the cost of kWh was found to be 23.95¢.

A coniferous forest modifies the snowpack energy balance by reducing the total amount of solar shortwave radiation (SWR) and enhancing the role of longwave radiation (LWR) emitted by trees. This study focuses on changes in SWR and LWR at three sites with different canopy structure (Bohemian Forest, Czechia), including one site affected by the bark beetle (Ips typographus). Measurements of incoming and outgoing SWR and LWR were performed at all sites equipped with CNR4 Net Radiometers for three cold seasons. In addition to SWR and LWR, sensible and latent heat, and ground heat and energy supplied by liquid precipitation were calculated. The results showed that net SWR at the healthy forest site represented only 7% of the amount at the open site due to the shading effect of trees. In contrast, net LWR represented a positive component of the snowpack energy balance at the healthy forest site and thus contributed the most to snowmelt. However, the modelled snowmelt rates were significantly lower in the forest than in the open area since the higher LWR in the forest did not compensated for the lower SWR. The progressive decay of disturbed forest caused the decrease in mean net LWR from −3.1 W/m2 to −12.9 W/m2 and the increase in mean net SWR from 31.6 W/m2 to 96.2 W/m2 during the study period. These changes caused an increase in modelled snowmelt rates by 50% in the disturbed forest, compared to the healthy forest site, during the study period. Our findings have important implications for runoff from areas affected by land cover changes due to either human activity or climate change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","disturbance; longwave radiation; shortwave radiation; snowmelt; snowpack energy balance","Catchments; Climate change; Energy balance; Flood control; Floods; Light water reactors; Snow melting systems; Bohemian forests; Canopy structure; Coniferous forests; Disturbed forests; Human activities; Land-cover change; Long-wave radiation; Short-wave radiation; Forestry; catchment; coniferous forest; energy balance; flooding; forecasting method; longwave radiation; shortwave radiation; snowmelt; Bohemian Forest; Bohemian Massif; Coleoptera; Ips typographus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092762740

Currently it is used mainly for producing heat and power, which make buffer storage essential due to seasonal variations in the demand for energy. The storage of bark is associated with problems like the occurrence of self-heating, biomass losses, and the reduction of its quality as fuel. Extraction of valuable extractives from the bark before burning is an interesting option when aiming to increase the value of this side-stream. However, the content of extractives starts to decrease immediately after tree felling and this degradation continues during storage. This study examined changes in fuel quality and extractive amounts during the storage of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark from sawmills. The moisture content of the bark decreased five percent during the storage period of eight weeks. The temperature in the storage pile rose within one week to over 50° and there was evidence of appreciable initial biological activity within the bark. The dry matter losses of spruce bark were on average six % per month. The content of acetone-soluble extractives decreased significantly, being 66.2% of the original amount after eight weeks’ storage. The most significant changes in extractive content occurred within the two first weeks of storage when 30% of the extractives were lost. This means that in order to utilize these valuable compounds, the material should be sent for further processing as soon as possible after debarking. © 2020","Bark; Dry matter loss; Extractive content; Norway spruce; Storing","Acetone; Bioactivity; Biomass; Buffer storage; Piles; Plants (botany); Dry matter loss; Energy content; Fuel quality; Heat and power; Norway spruce; Seasonal variation; Storage periods; Storage piles; Fuel storage; bark; degradation; dry matter; extraction method; seasonal variation; temperature effect; Finland; Norway; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092717080

The local market creates opportunities for competition among distributed energy resources, however it may also lead to exercising market power. In the day-ahead market, the strategic revenue maximization of the distributed energy resources is modelled through a bi-level optimization. The upper-level in the bi-level optimization is from the strategic distributed energy resource's perspective and the lower-level problem is from the local market operator's perspective. The balancing market (where there is perfect competition) is modelled by the shrinking rolling horizon approach. A wind farm with a storage system is considered as a case study of a strategic distributed energy resource to evaluate its profitability within the proposed revenue maximization problem. The revenue of the wind farm in the local market is compared with the one in a (business-as-usual) centralized market where it cannot exercise market power. Sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changing the distribution system parameters e.g. the branch resistances and the loads, on the revenue of the wind farm and its bidding behaviour is performed. Moreover, the role of the storage system on the revenue of the wind farm is studied. Results show that an overloaded or weak distribution system will positively influence the strategic position of the wind farm. Finally, it is shown that depending on the existence of market power, a storage system can bring extra revenues for the wind farm, by hedging against its uncertain output. © 2020 The Author(s)","Distributed energy resources; Distribution system constraints; Electrical storage systems; Local market; Market power; Wind energy","Competition; Electric power system interconnection; Sensitivity analysis; Wind power; Bi-level optimization; Business-as-usual; Centralized market; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Perfect competition; Revenue maximization; Revenue maximization problem; Power markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092524295

Typically, this results in the necessity of performing RES curtailment to preserve the stability of the network. This has adverse consequences for the environment, as the replacement is assured by fuel-fired pollutant power stations. To avoid such issues, the RES variability can be compensated with storage systems, in particular Water Pumped Storage Systems (WPSS), which are particularly relevant in island contexts. In this work, we propose a new approach to help the decision-making processes of designing WPPS that are both technical and economically feasible and include the uncertainty of design parameters. This is done by using a metaheuristic optimization method Particle Swarm Optimization that finds out the solution that maximizes the Net Present Value of the project using a model that couples the energy balance model and the economic model. It was found that the input with most impact in the NPV of the projects is the wind energy availability. It is important to mention also the impact of the uncertainty of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), which, when increases 50% combined with a project reduced lifetime, may lead to a negative NPV. The model, with the necessary adaptations, can be used to study WPSS on similar power systems, therefore contributing to a preliminary assessment of the technical and economic viability of this type of systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Isolated power systems; Net present value; Particle swarm optimization; Renewable energy sources; Water pumped storage systems","Decision making; Microgrids; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Small power plants; Wind power; Capital expenditures; Decision making process; Energy availability; Energy balance models; Isolated power system; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Preliminary assessment; Renewable energy source; Design; alternative energy; decision making; design; optimization; sensitivity analysis; water supply; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092201798

At the same time, sustainability concerns are driving systemic changes in both systems. This article introduces the concept of the energy-mobility system, which is a result of this convergence, and proposes an integrated framework for policy and governance of the energy-mobility system. The framework focuses on cross-sectoral policy ambitions related to climate change mitigation, namely reducing energy consumption, electrifying fossil fueled transport, decarbonizing electricity generation, promoting resilience, and integrating green infrastructure management. Public policy and the corresponding regulation are no longer conceptualized and executed in each sector separately. An integrated policy framework is indeed needed for the energy-mobility system, so that the institutions remain relatively aligned with the technological developments. The requirements for effective governance of the energy-mobility system are then discussed, which include an energy-mobility system operator. The potential for the policy and governance framework is addressed through a case study of the Swiss Federal Railways, which as the owner and operator of a fully electrified rail network and associated electricity infrastructure is already close to taking up such a role. While the Swiss case is unique, it can offer insight for other countries developing their regulatory approach to the convergence of the energy and mobility systems. © The Author(s) 2020.","convergence; Energy-mobility system; railways; regulation; sector coupling; sustainability; Switzerland; transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092138066

Dilocarcinus pagei is a native crab that is commonly found in fish culture ponds and presents an attractive reddish-brown coloration. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate this crab as a natural source of astaxanthin and to assess how the stability of this pigment was affected by different vegetable oils (soy and sunflower) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) presence over a range of temperatures used in feed processing technology like extraction, cooking, extrusion and storage. Individuals of D. pagei were collected and homogenized. Carotenes were extracted from different samples using acetone. The extractions were analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The percentages of remaining astaxanthin dissolved in soy and sunflower oils with or without BHT (0.1%) were estimated before and after being incubated at 50 °C. Astaxanthin dissolved in both oils with BHT were exposed to different temperatures between 25 °C and 180 °C. Samples were taken at different intervals of time and astaxanthin was measured at λmax490 nm by a spectrophotometer. The degradation rate of astaxanthin at each temperature in both oils was estimated. The results showed that D. pagei would be an alternative as a natural source of astaxanthin since its concentration values (231.5 μg/g dry matter) are similar to those present in other species commercially exploited. The two-ways Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the presence of BHT (P = 0.03) and the oils (P < 0.01) used as dissolvent affect the percentages of remaining astaxanthin independently of the oil used (P = 0.06). The astaxanthin degradation rates in sunflower were higher than those in soy oil at all tested temperatures, being significantly different (P < 0.05) at temperatures from 25 °C to 120 °C but not at 180 °C. The activation energies calculated for soy oil was 88.7 kJ/mol while for sunflower oil, it was 85.5 kJ/mol. Astaxanthin was more stable in soy oil than in sunflower oil. Moreover, commercial soy oil is a cheap ingredient and a good source of unsaturated fatty acids (ω3, ω6 and ω9). Thus, soy oil would be recommended as a solvent to extract the pigment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","extruded food; feed component; Freshwater crabs; ingredients; Salmonids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091929655

To realize grid-scale applications of the energy storage devices, there remain several key issues including the development of low-cost, high-performance materials that are environmentally friendly. This study explores the synergic contribution of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on metal organic framework (MOF) as positive electrode for asymmetric supercabattery. The structural elucidation of the synthesised hybrid material and its precursors were characterised using XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical analysis of the synthesised hybrid material and its precursors was achieved using CV, GCD and EIS. The electrochemical behaviour of NF-rGO/MOF hybrid obtained from the three-electrode system exhibited a battery-type behaviour and accomplished an improved specific capacity of 459.0 Cg−1 at the current density of 1.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the two-electrode system fabricated in an asymmetric configuration made of NF-rGO/MOF hybrid as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode studied in 3.0 M KOH electrolyte, exhibited specific capacity of about 48.81 Cg−1 at the current density of 0.4 A g−1, the corresponding maximum energy density of 11.0 Wh kg−1 and the maximum power density of 640.45 W kg−1.

The high volume of fruits produced in the hottest months of the year in a short period causes a high percentage of fruit rot. This is, especially, more challenging for countries with low quality electricity grids, e.g. India. This study proposes the use of in-site off-grid solar-driven cold storage systems integrated with an auxiliary heater for year-round storage of agricultural products (potato in an Indian farming area, just as a reference case). The purpose of the research is to assess which type of solar collector is the best solution from the energy and economic point of view. For this, the required annual cooling load of a 5 TR cold storage of potato is calculated and then, the effect of different types of collectors in heat provision on the performance of the cold supply unit is investigated. The results show that when the system is integrated with PTCs, the performance of the system is much less effective compared to when integrated with ETCs and FPCs. From an energy point of view, FPC, ETC performed at the higher energy efficiency, while in the economic assessments, considering the technical effectiveness of different configurations, an ETC-integrated arrangement reveals the best economical solution with a payback period of 11 years with the storage of 20 tonnes of potato.

Large companies report their GHG emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol in terms of direct and indirect GHG emissions. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of distillery by-products can replace up to 64% of the natural gas consumption of the distillery and could reduce direct GHG emissions by 54% and indirect GHG emissions by 11,389 tCO2eq (41% of direct savings) if digestate replaces synthetic fertiliser used to cultivate barley consumed by the distillery. The replacement of animal feed produced by the distillery with imported animal feed (distillers’ grains from the USA and soybean meal from Argentina) could, in a worst-case scenario, negate a significant portion of direct and indirect GHG emission savings. The decision as to whether the GHG emissions associated with imported animal feed should be included in the calculation is not clear cut and can be subjective. Digestate management, particularly storage and transportation may pose a significant barrier to the implementation of an AD plant processing distillery by-products. Alternative methods of digestate transportation such as pipelines, and digestate treatment (separation, drying, and evaporation) should be assessed to mitigate logistical issues.

A heuristic approach based on a genetic algorithm is developed and programmed into MATLAB to solve the sizing-optimization problem. The objective function was considered by providing two minimums, namely the levelized cost of energy (LCE) and the loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Sizing-optimization solutions are obtained and analyzed using a time series energy exchange during a representative week in each season to decide the appropriate component size of a PV-Wind based hybrid system (PWHS). The lowest LPSP ratio corresponds to the higher LCE value and the opposite too. The optimal economic solution was: LCE= 0.1915 $/kWh for a given LPSP value, the correspondent PWHS configuration is composed of 9.5 kWp of PV panels, 1 kW of the wind turbine generator and 6.5 kWh of batteries capacities, thus represent a total present value (TPV) equal to 39541$.

However, non-linear and viscoelastic behaviour of most soft biological tissues complicates the evaluation of their mechanical properties. In the current study, a method for measuring hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity of bovine and porcine hepatic parenchyma in tension is presented. First, non-linear stress–stretch curves resulting from ramp loading and unloading, were interpreted based on a hyperelastic framework, using a Veronda–Westmann strain energy function. Strain-specific elastic moduli, such as initial stiffness EI, were thereupon defined in certain parts of the stress–stretch curves. Furthermore, dissipated and stored energy density were calculated. Next, the viscoelastic nature of liver tissue was examined with two different methods: stress relaxation and dynamic cyclic testing. Both tests yielded dissipated and stored energy density, as well as loss tangent (tanδ), storage modulus (E′), and loss modulus (E′′). In tension, stress relaxation was experimentally more convenient than dynamic cyclic testing. Thus we considered whether relaxation could be used for approximating the results of the cyclic tests. Regarding the resulting elastic moduli, initial stiffness was similar for porcine and bovine liver (EI∼30kPa), while porcine liver was stiffer for higher strains. Comparing stress relaxation with dynamic cyclic testing, tanδ of porcine and bovine liver was the same for both methods (tanδ=0.05−0.25 at 1 Hz). Storage and loss moduli matched well for bovine, but not as well for porcine tissue. In conclusion, the utilized Veronda–Westmann model was appropriate for representing the hyperelasticity of liver tissue seen in ramp tests. Concerning viscoelasticity, both chosen testing methods – stress relaxation and dynamic cyclic testing – yielded comparable results for E′, E′′, and tanδ, as long as elasticity non-linearities were heeded. The here presented method provides novel insight into the tensile viscoelastic properties of hepatic tissue, and provides guidelines for convenient evaluation of soft tissue mechanical properties. © 2020 The Authors","Dynamic mechanical analysis; Hepatic tissue; Hyperelasticity; Stress relaxation; Tensile testing; Viscoelasticity","Biomechanics; Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Frequency domain analysis; Histology; Mammals; Stiffness; Strain; Strain energy; Stress analysis; Stress relaxation; Unloading; Viscoelasticity; Biological tissues; Soft biological tissue; Storage and loss modulus; Strain energy functions; Time and frequency domains; Viscoelastic behaviour; Viscoelastic characterization; Viscoelastic properties; Tissue; article; bovine; controlled study; human tissue; leisure; liver parenchyma; liver tissue; medical education; nonhuman; nonlinear system; pig; practice guideline; rigidity; soft tissue; stress; tension; viscoelasticity; animal; biological model; elasticity; liver; mechanical stress; viscosity; Young modulus; Animals; Cattle; Elastic Modulus; Elasticity; Liver; Models, Biological; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090010236

The moisture content of the final product should be below 10%, to ensure safe storage, and elimination of microorganism growth (particularly moulds). The present study aims to identify the optimal drying process for removing moisture from SCG and to investigate changes to the composition of SCG due to drying, at temperatures around 75 °C, so that the dried SCG to qualify as renewable energy source. Three drying processes were employed for SCG drying (with initial moisture content of about 65%): oven drying, solar drying and open air sun drying, while SCG samples were placed in aluminium trays with thicknesses of 1.25, 2.5 and 4 cm. Based on the experimental results for SCG samples with thickness 2.5 cm, the open air sun drying process required 10 h to reach final moisture content of 37%, while solar drying achieved 10% moisture content in 10 h and oven drying achieved 7% moisture content in 6 h. The solar drying process proved as the most advantageous, due to low energy requirements and adequate quality of dried SCG. Also, experiments indicated that SCG storage at “normal room conditions” resulted to equilibrium moisture content in SCG of 8%, regardless of the initial moisture content. Furthermore, instrumental analyses of the SCG, revealed changes to its composition for a number of chemical groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, phytosterols, alkaloids, lactones, alcohols, phenols, pyrans and furans, among others.

A stepped area is constricted at the center of the nanowire with proportions of length (d = 50 nm) and width (λ = 50 nm) to pin the magnetic domain wall (DW) with high barrier potential energy to achieve a high information storage capacity. From this study, it was found that the DW with different structures was pinned at the stepped area with high stability. Also, a reduction of VDW behaviors due to its chirality and polarity has been obtained according to saturation magnetization (Ms). By increasing the values of Ms, the VDW attraction to the nanowire edges based on its chirality and polarity becoming less and VDW moves in a straight line towards the stepped area. Therefore, with high values of MS, the VDW is stable in type and moves towards the stepped area with a speed of 500 m/s until pinning there. In addition, the symmetry of the stepped area design helps the VDW to move in a straight line through the stepped area and maintain its magnetization configuration during the depinning. This is important for writing and reading the information in storage memory devices. Furthermore, current density values (J) have affected the stability of the VDW by decreasing the VDW behaviors regarding its chirality and polarity. With low driven current density values, the VDW kept its structure until reaching and got pinning at the stepped area. Further investigations were done to examine the transverse domain wall (TDW) and VDW depinning through the stepped area. The results have shown that TDWs have a high barrier potential than VDWs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Micromagnetic simulation; Spin transfer torque; Stepped nanowire; Vortex domain wall","Chirality; Domain walls; Magnetic domains; Magnetic storage; Nanowires; Potential energy; Saturation magnetization; Van der Waals forces; Vortex flow; Barrier potential; Depinning; Different structure; In-plane magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic nanowires; Magnetization configuration; Micromagnetic simulations; Vortex domain wall; Magnetic anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089432964

The first stage concerns the impact of long-term wind uncertainty through the annual variation of wind capacity factor. The second stage deals with the problem of short-term uncertainty using the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. A polyhedral uncertainty set is introduced through its variance-covariance matrix considering the correlation between the uncertain coefficients of different wind sites. Various GEP results are presented for different wind uncertainty scenarios. The results have demonstrated that the correlation among the uncertain coefficients yields a less conservatism robust solution. Various solutions to cope with the short-term wind uncertainty impact are proposed.

Current models within available literature do not include the constraint which forbid small renewable energy producers to share their excess power through the national grids; this leads to prosumers dissipating their excess power generated or using costly energy storage systems. Additionally, most of these models look at the savings made by the Peer-to-Peer community, without computing the cost reduction or benefit of each prosumer taken individually. Thus, these models are not suitable or directly applicable to many countries such as South Africa. For these reasons, the main aim of this paper is to develop a Peer-to-Peer energy sharing model that considers the above mentioned gaps. The proposed system consists of two prosumers; a residential prosumer that employs a roof mounted photovoltaic system with energy storage capabilities, and commercial prosumer with a dual-tracking photovoltaic system. The prosumers are connected to each other by power lines for P2P operation. The developed model minimizes both prosumers’ operation costs by maximizing the use of the power from the renewable energy sources; optimally managing the internal power sharing between the prosumers; and minimizing the use of the electrical utility operating with the Time-of-Use rate. The study uses the dissimilarity and complementarity of the load patterns in the South African residential and commercial energy sectors as an asset to implement the Peer-to-Peer energy sharing between the prosumers operating in these two sectors. Using a case study in South Africa, the results have demonstrated that, as compare to using the grid as sole power source, the residential prosumer can achieve a total daily cost reduction of 62.71% in summer and 68.99% in winter; while the commercial can achieve 81.31% and 31.69% in winter. For a 20 years’ project, using the grid as baseline for the comparison, the lifecycle cost analysis have projected the residential prosumer to break-even after 16.35 years and save 19.5%; while the commercial prosumer can break-even after 5.3 years and save 55.2%. Moreover, this study shows the ability of the developed model to simulate systems with different components, demands, resources as well as costs. The model developed in this study may assist researchers and engineers interested in the optimal operation of prosumers in Peer-to-Peer energy sharing schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy sharing; Microgrid, Peer-to-Peer, Prosumer, Optimal energy management, Time of Use","Battery storage; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Housing; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Electrical utilities; Energy storage systems; Life-cycle cost analysis; Peer-to-peer communities; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Roof mounted photovoltaic systems; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088633368

To avoid early degradation, unexpected explosion, energy loss, and ensure a safe storage, stabilizing agents are often introduced within its compositions. Conventional stabilizers, such as aromatic amines like diphenylamine (DPA) and urea, can produce carcinogenic/toxic substances during propellants shelf life. Thus, a need for alternative stabilizing agents, which offer similar/better effectiveness and display a non/low toxicity, remains a challenge. This paper investigates the stabilizing effect of two organosolv lignins (OL), obtained from Aleppo pine (AP) and Eucalyptus globulus (EG), on NC. For this purpose, conventional stability tests and kinetic modeling are applied for different samples (S1-S4) using 3% of stabilizer, which are S1, pure NC; S2, NC + DPA; S3, NC + OL(AP); and S4, NC + OL(EG). Beforehand, FTIR spectroscopy and DSC analysis have been used to check the compatibility of these potential stabilizers and NC. The obtained results via Bergmann-Jung and vacuum stability tests suggested that the prepared mixtures are stable.

This includes the use of storage and smart appliances. However, such means are not stimulated in the electricity market(s) as there is insufficient demand for flexibility from these appliances. This originates from the current lack of value for flexibility, and, consequently, of incentives for investing in electric and electronic equipment (EEE) able to provide it. One solution could be to include ‘smartness’ in the design and labelling of appliances. This article introduces the idea of expanding already existing legal instruments - the energy labelling and ecodesign frameworks – to include the ‘flexibility potential’ of household EEE. This would link regulation for such equipment to the requirements of a more efficient electricity system and allow for standards and methods to assess potential system efficiency gains to be created, and ideally, a market for the production and sale of equipment providing DSR. Ultimately, it would contribute to increased efficiency of EEE and especially of the electricity system. Considering that energy and resource efficiency are priorities in EU law and policy, the article proposes a ‘full-chain approach’ that expands the concept of lifecycle of household EEE to include their potential to interact with the local electricity network by means of DSR. The article studies EU policy instruments addressing energy and resource efficiency, and EU legislation on the electricity system with a focus on household EEE and their potential to increase energy efficiency by DSR. © 2020 The Author(s)","Demand side response; Eco-design; Energy efficiency; Energy labelling; EU legal framework; Household electric and electronic equipment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087012711

The waste products of the aluminum industry are categorized as hazardous and generally enter municipal waste landfills in the form of aluminum dross and salt cakes. Hence, aluminum industries in the UAE are currently searching for alternative uses and disposal methods for these waste derivatives. This paper investigates the plausible impacts of the aluminum waste products such as dross and salt cakes, through material characterization and leaching studies at different reaction conditions. The salt cake and dross from UAE were characterized by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). The CEC values for salt cake and dross were 425.8 and 408.8 meqH+/100 g sample, respectively. The FTIR spectra for both wastes showed clear bands for Al (OH)3 and organic functional groups. A treatment with acidic, neutral and basic aqueous solutions was performed to both waste products and the results showed that the acid leachate is accompanied with gas evolution and heavy metals, including high concentrations of Al. The findings of this study prove that aluminum dross and salt cakes could have hazardous implications not only in the landfill but also in the surrounding environments. A feasible treatment method using acid is suggested in light of the experimental results to reduce the negative implications of the landfill process while keeping up with guidelines and goals regarding environmental waste management of aluminum waste products in the UAE. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum Dross; hazardous waste production; landfills; metal leachates; Salt Cakes; United Arab Emirates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086649115

The permselectivity of the 3D rGO aerogels with different C/O ratios was investigated using neutral, positive, and negative redox mediators. The neutral and cationic redox mediators permselectively adsorb within the rGO aerogels via π-πand noncovalent electrostatic interactions, respectively. In contrast, the anionic redox mediator does not adsorb within the 3D rGO aerogels due to the repulsion force. The 3D rGO can be used as an absorbent for toxic dye removal such as methylene blue (MB). The in situ electrochemical spectroscopy suggests that the 3D rGO prefers to adsorb the reduced form of MB.

Nowadays, many greenhouses in northwestern Europe are equipped with combined heat and power plants and gas boilers to generate heat, power for lighting and carbon dioxide as a fertilizer. These three drivers do not allow much flexibility to profit from opportunities on the energy spot market. Recently, large seasonal storage devices have become commercially available (e.g., Ecovat systems). In this study, their impact on the operational costs and the carbon dioxide emission was examined. A real-world case study was used, where data of nine greenhouses and 21 CHP’s were incorporated. The novelty of this research was that seasonal heat storage in the greenhouse horticulture industry was quantified. Therefore, a simulation, based on a control problem was performed. This allowed us to make comparisons between different situations. We determined that heating costs can be reduced by 0.50 to 6.15 € m-2 year-1 and carbon dioxide emissions by 700 g m-2 year-1. Next, sensitivity analyses were performed. We concluded that i) the optimal energy storage size is approximately 550 m3 ha-1 or 50.000 m3 for this case study; ii) insulation properties of the storage device may in reality differ from design values. Therefore, the sensitivity of cost reduction with respect to insolation is examined, but this is not a critical parameter, and iii) carbon capture techniques have a modest impact on the operational costs (-0.03 € m-2 year-1). © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Most of the artificial lighting still exists of high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, but light-emitting diode (LED) modules find more and more their way into commercial greenhouses. Nowadays, LEDs are often installed on top of an already existing HPS installation. This way, light intensity and yield is increased, but also the associated electricity consumption. Question remains where the optimum lies, considering yield cannot be increased indefinitely and energy consumption must remain sustainable. In order to find the optimal light intensity, a trial was set up at Research Centre Hoogstraten, Belgium, in October 2017. A tomato greenhouse compartment was equipped with LED toplight modules. By installing the modules in a predefined symmetric pattern and turning the plants locally, 20 treatments with different light intensities were obtained in the same greenhouse. The light intensities ranged between 75 and 330 µmol m-2 s-1. A comparison in crop parameters, yield and fruit quality was made for every light intensity. Additionally, the efficiency in light use was determined. Results show that crop parameters are not influenced significantly by the different light intensities. However, yield and fruit weight are positively influenced. Moreover, despite the high light intensities applied, there is still a linear relationship between yield and light intensity. The efficiency in light use is inversely proportional to the applied light intensity.

The vanillin vitrimer resins were synthesized through a protocol with a two-step reaction: methacrylation and imination with diamine or triamine. The obtained vinyl ester resins with imine bonds and vinyl groups could be photocured into thermosets in 10 min at room temperature. The cured thermosets had good solvent resistance against common solvents, good thermal stability up to about 250 °C as measured by thermogravimetry, and high storage modulus (1.6−3.4 GPa as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis). Owing to the reversibility of the imine bond, both thermosets exhibited typical vitrimer behavior including stress relaxation and thermal reprocessability, while their activation energy for the imine exchange reaction and recovery ratio of tensile stress after reprocessing varied due to different cross-linking densities. Furthermore, both thermosets could be chemically recycled in hexylamine through an imine exchange reaction. The presented new strategy, thus, paves the way for production of fast-curing, chemically and thermally stable, but still thermally reprocessable and chemically recyclable imine vitrimers from abundant biobased building blocks. © 2020 American Chemical Society","Biobased thermoset; Imine; Photocuring; Recycling; Thermally reprocessable; Vanillin; Vitrimer","Activation energy; Amines; Crosslinking; Curing; Resins; Stress relaxation; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Vinyl resins; Building blockes; Cross-linking density; Exchange reaction; Reprocessability; Solvent resistance; Thermally stable; Two-step reactions; Vinyl ester resin; Thermosets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096704492

Here, we have prepared and studied ether-free polyfluorenes tethered with N,N-dimethylpiperidinium (DMP) and 6-azonia-spiro[5.5]undecane (ASU) cations, respectively, attached through heteroatom-free alkyl spacers. By employing alkyl-alkyl Suzuki cross-coupling, these alicyclic quaternary ammonium cations are attached at the 4-position to impede ionic loss. Thus, all the β-hydrogens sensitive to elimination reactions are placed in strain-free rings able to fully relax by the spacer flexibility. Consequently, the AEM carrying DMP cations shows a very high alkaline and thermal stability, retaining more than 91% of the cations after 2400 h immersion in 2 M NaOH at 90 °C. Compared with corresponding AEM functionalized with N-alkyl-N-methylpiperidinium (AMP) cations [conventionally tethered via the 1(N)-position], the ionic loss by β-elimination is successfully reduced by up to 92%. The AEM functionalized with DMP also reaches a high hydroxide conductivity of 124 mS cm-1 at 80 °C. Consequently, tethering piperidine-based cations via the 4-position instead of the 1(N)-position results in AEMs with substantially improved thermal and alkaline stability, combined with high hydroxide conductivity.

Full control of the ferroelectric polarization in ultrathin films of ferroelectric perovskites needs to be achieved in order to apply this class of materials in modern devices. However, ferroelectricity itself is not well understood in this nanoscale form, where interface and surface effects become particularly relevant and where loss of net polarization is often observed. In this work, we show that the precise control of the structure of the top surface and bottom interface of the thin film is crucial toward this aim. We explore the properties of thin films of the prototypical ferroelectric lead titanate (PbTiO3) on a metallic strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3) buffer using a combination of computational (density functional theory) and experimental (optical second harmonic generation) methods. We find that the polarization direction and strength are influenced by chemical and electronic processes occurring at the epitaxial interface and at the surface. The polarization is particularly sensitive to adsorbates and to surface and interface defects. These results point to the possibility of controlling the polarization direction and magnitude by engineering specific interface and surface chemistries. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The coal and lignite super-critical power plants have 1000 MW net output with a 90% decarbonization rate. Corresponded non-decarbonized cases were also considered to calculate the energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture. In-depth evaluations covered the following elements: characterization of decarbonized super-critical power plants with CaL cycle with/without solid sorbent storage; defining a detailed integrated assessment methodology; performing detailed calculations of the main performance indexes and sensitivity studies using various key technical and economic elements. Base load operation without solid storage (as reference) and flexible part load operation with solid storage were assessed to see their influence on the overall performance indicators.

This is a first time report on the simultaneously Ni@Cu doped Fe1 – xMxS2 (M = Ni@Cu = 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 at %) thin films fabricated by a simple chemical spray pyrolysis technique. In this paper we investigate the impact of doping on the structural, chemical states, optical properties and band gap nature by different characterization techniques. The SEM results show that surface morphology and granular grain size changes with the increment of Ni@Cu content which are coherent with the XRD results. The EDX and XPS measurements exhibit that the films are composed of Fe, S, Ni, and Cu elements whilst the films were slightly oxidized due to processing in the atmospheric conditions. Spectroscopy ellipsometry (SE) analysis demonstrates that the indirect band gap gradually increased from 1.38 eV (FeS2) to 1.64 eV (Ni@Cu = 10 at %) while at higher doping the band gap was decreased to 1.53 could be due to incomplete doping. So, the band gap of FeS2 can be tuned in between 1.38 and 1.64 eV by simultaneous Ni@Cu doping could be a suitable candidate for absorber application in solar cell devices. The other optical constants (dielectric constants, refractive index and extinction coefficient) explicitly carried out using SE measurement. Interestingly, progressing the absorption nature and bang gap in the visible region disclose a significant impact on the optical properties for optoelectronics applications. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,"Copper metallography; Energy conservation; Energy gap; Iron metallography; Morphology; Nickel compounds; Nickel metallography; Pyrites; Refractive index; Semiconductor doping; Solar absorbers; Solar cells; Spray pyrolysis; Sulfide minerals; Surface morphology; Thin films; Transition metals; Atmospheric conditions; Characterization techniques; Chemical compositions; Chemical spray pyrolysis; Extinction coefficients; Solar cell devices; Solar-cell applications; Spectroscopy ellipsometries; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096364235

This demands more flexibility, energy-efficiency, safety, and light-weight in thermotherapy packs and hot clothing. Heteroatom doping is a metal-free, cost-effective way to improve carrier concentration and hence electrical and thermal conductivity in reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) thus rendering it suitable for wearable joule heaters. However, the current doping techniques result in complex chemical structures that hinder phonon propagation and suffer other problems such as low yield, low scalability, and rigidity of the final product. Here, we disclose a novel and facile, low-temperature technique for nitrogen doping and photoreduction of graphene oxide (GO) films for high-performance, flexible graphene-based electrothermal heaters. The nitrogen atoms are introduced into the GO lattice with the aid of ultrasonic power in a wet chemical doping phase and maskless, automated, rapid CO2 laser scanning is used for the concurrent removal of oxygen-containing functional groups and the rearrangement of nitrogen atoms in the graphene lattice. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveal up to 5.43% nitrogen dopant concentration with a high carbon to oxygen ratio of 16, while Raman studies uniquely show improved atomic ordering with ID/IG ratio of 0.51 in the nitrogen-doped Laser reduced graphene oxide (N-LrGO) films. The fabricated N-LrGO heater has a sheet resistance of 26 O/sq. and attains a higher steady-state temperature of up to 245.7 °C at a low driving voltage of 9 V with a low power demand of 0.7 Wcm−2 and a heating rate of 103 °C/s. Its excellent temperature distribution and high flexibility join with the scalability of the preparation technique to demonstrate great potential for its incorporation with next-generation wearable electronics powered by low voltage portable energy storage devices. © 2020","Electrothermal heaters; Laser writing; Nitrogen-doped graphene; Ultrasonic doping; Wearable electronics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094597531

The hydrogen storage performance of two differently modified graphene surfaces, particularly Cu-doped and Cu-decorated circumcoronene (CC), is investigated using density functional theory, 6-311G* basis set and Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). It is found that the Cu-doped CC is able to bind three H2 molecules on one Cu atom, while the Cu-decorated CC is able to bind up to five H2 molecules on one Cu atom. Changes in the topology of charge density upon the H2 adsorption are evaluated under the formalism of QTAIM analysis. The QTAIM analysis of bond critical points as well as the density of states analysis show that the interaction between Cu and adsorbed H2 molecules can be considered as a physisorption (a van der Waals type interaction). Overall, the results presented in this study point out that the Cu-decorated graphene surfaces are more suitable potential candidates for hydrogen storage than the Cu-doped ones.

We analyze the impact of the new PVSC regulation on residential, commercial and industrial prosumers’ profitability (internal rate of return). We provide a wide range of results that allow us to explore future profitability depending on the evolution of installation costs, the opportunities of shared self-consumption or storage, and even the potential emergence of new business models. We find that all segments obtain now positive profitability in average conditions. Whereas the residential segment has the lowest profitability level, it has the highest potential by decreasing installation costs and increasing the share of self-consumption, given its higher retail prices. Finally, we identify potential new business models by exploiting the prices and costs differentials across segments and maximizing the share of self-consumed electricity.

By combining 1.5D reactor modelling with flowsheet simulation of a complete full-scale cogeneration plant, this study assesses the applicability and potential of an advanced CO2 capture technology, namely chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU), for CO2 capture from a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant generating electricity, district heat (DH) at 75–90 °C supply and 45 °C return temperatures, and process steam at 10 and 4.5 bar(a) pressures. Nordic wood (50% wet-basis moisture) is used as fuel. The key performance indicators of the CLOU-integrated CHP plant were quantified and compared with those of a non-CCS reference plant. Part-load operation at reduced DH loads was considered. At 100% fuel load, the CLOU plant captured 99.0% of the CO2 from the combustion of biomass and still achieved a net efficiency of 80.1%LHV, a value very close to that of the reference plant without CO2 capture or flue gas condensation (81.1%LHV).

For a long-distance ocean transportation, transfer of energy carriers via ocean tankers is considered as a decent solution compared to pipelines. Due to cryogenic temperatures of energy carriers, heat leaks into storage tanks of these carriers causes a problem called boil-off gas (BOG). BOG losses reduce the quantity of energy carriers, which affects their economic value. Therefore, this study proposes to examine the effects of BOG economically in production and transportation phases of potential energy carriers produced from natural gas, namely; liquefied natural gas (LNG), dimethyl-ether (DME), methanol, liquid ammonia (NH3), and liquid hydrogen (H2). Mathematical approach is used to calculate production and transportation costs of these energy carriers and to account for BOG as a unit cost within the total cost. The results of this study show that transportation costs of LNG, liquid ammonia, methanol, DME, and liquid hydrogen from natural gas accounting for BOG are 0.74 $/GJ, 1.09 $/GJ, 0.68 $/GJ, 0.53 $/GJ, and 3.24 $/GJ, respectively. DME and methanol can be more economic compared to LNG to transport the energy of natural gas for the same ship capacity. Including social cost of carbon (SCC) within the total cost of transporting the energy of natural gas, the transportation cost of liquid ammonia is 1.11 $/GJ, whereas LNG transportation cost rises significantly to 1.68 $/GJ at SCC of 137 $/t CO2 eq. Consequently, liquid ammonia becomes economically favored compared to LNG. Transportation cost of methanol (0.70 $/GJ) and DME (0.55 $/GJ) are also lower than LNG, however, liquid hydrogen transportation cost (3.24 $/GJ) is still the highest even though the increment of the cost is about 0.1% as SCC included within the transportation cost. © 2020 The Authors","BOG cost; Energy carriers; Energy export; Ocean Tanker; Synthetic fuels; Transportation cost","Ammonia; Carbon; Cost accounting; Cryogenic liquids; Economic and social effects; Energy transfer; Gases; Liquefied natural gas; Methanol; Potential energy; Wetlands; Comparative costs; Cryogenic temperatures; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Mathematical approach; Production and transportations; Social cost of carbon; Sustainable energy; Transportation cost; Natural gas transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088301005

In this study, the performance energy and exergy of two products of Dosidicus gigas and Mytilus Chilensis were analyzed undergoing microwave treatment. Basically fitting of five well-known empirical models was tested for the two types of seafood. Statistical and empirical modeling of the drying curves revealed that the Page model was the most suitable to fit the drying experimental curves of Mytilus and Dosidicus gigas. Various microwave power outputs at (90,160,360, 600, and 750 W) were tested to evaluate their influence on drying kinetics and moisture diffusivity of seafood samples. Specific energy consumption varied from 1.76 to 11.42 and 5.20 to 11.34 MJ/kg for Dosidicus gigas and Mytilus Chilensis respectively. The best exergy and energy aspect appears to be at 90 W microwave power for the drying products. Also, the improvement potential increased with an increase in microwave power, and its values for both products were ranging from 0.58 to 29.70 kJ/kg water. The effective moisture diffusivity increased as well as the microwave generation increased. The activation energy was determined using Arrhenius Law with values of 9.34 and 9.36 kW/kg for Dosidicus gigas and Mytilus Chilensis respectively. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Activation energy; Drying kinetics; Energy exergy analysis; Food storage; Moisture diffusivity","Activation energy; Energy utilization; Exergy; Kinetics; Microwave generation; Microwave irradiation; Microwave materials processing; Moisture; Drying characteristics; Effective moisture diffusivity; Energy and exergy; Exergy and energy; Experimental curves; Microwave treatment; Moisture diffusivity; Specific energy consumption; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088099359

Our findings show that the biaxial strains played a key role in improving the de/absorption thermodynamic properties of MgCoH3 compound. Precisely, the formation energy shifted from −71.30 kJ mol−1 per H2 for unstrained MgCoH3 to −37.29 kJ mol−1 per H2 under the compression of −6% strain and the desorption temperature also decrease to 285.34 K compared with 545.52 K for free strained MgCoH3, which is close to optimum values for the practical application (289–393 K and −40 kJ mol−1 per H2). Noteworthy, the diffusion barrier energy of hydrogen atom in strained MgCoH3 is also calculated using the nudged elastic band method (NEB) and the obtained values decrease with the strain magnitude, which can accelerate the kinetic of hydrogenation process of MgCoH3. In addition, the band structures, phonon dispersion curves, the corresponding partial and total phonon density of states, also the thermal properties including the specific heat capacity, entropy and phonon free energy in terms of temperature with the variation of strain magnitude are predicted within the harmonic approximation.

Traditional lignocellulosic biomass sources, used by Man since immemorial times, begin to suffer the effects of overuse, which is why to find new sources is so urgent, especially if those are associated with industrial or agroforestry waste sources. In this context, several options arise, some of which are object of concern, given the large volumes produced, and the environmental impacts associated with them. Olive pomace is one of these cases. Portugal assumes a prominent role in the production of olive oil and is, therefore, also a major producer of waste related with olive oil industry. Energy recovery of olive pomace is something that has been referenced in the bibliography since long ago. However, traditional forms of recovery, such as direct combustion, did not shown to be the best option, given the high content of volatiles of the product, and the problems associated with its storage and transportation. Thermochemical conversion technologies, such as torrefaction or pyrolysis, can play a decisive role here, since in addition to the increment in energy density, allow a very significative volume reduction, facilitating storage and transportation. In the present study, torrefaction and pyrolysis tests were carried out on olive pomace samples at different temperatures, respectively, 300, 400 and 500 °C, followed by the characterization of the obtained materials. There was a significative improvement in the energy content of the materials. The characterization of the Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) was also carried out, allowing comparison with coal grindability, and leaving an open door for the possibility of these residues being used as coal substitutes in coal-fueled power plants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass waste; Circular economy; Energy recovery; Olive pomace; Thermochemical conversion technologies","Coal; Coal combustion; Environmental impact; Olive oil; Pyrolysis; Recovery; Waste incineration; Coal grindability; Coal-fueled power plants; Direct combustion; Hardgrove grindability indices; Improvement methods; Storage and transportations; Thermochemical Conversion; Volume reductions; Petroleum industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087015753

It is mainly used as a fuel, making its storage unavoidable due to seasonal variation in energy demand. Storing bark can lead to high energy losses but can also increase its fuel quality, e.g. by reducing its moisture content (M) and increasing its net calorific value (Q). Covering wood chip stacks with semi-permeable fabric sheets can improve fuel quality and reduce dry matter losses (DML) during storage. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the effect of similar coverage during storage on the fuel quality and energy recovery of stored bark. Two bark stacks of 1000 and 1400 m3 were established, with half of each stack being covered with a water-resistant, vapour-permeable fabric. The temperature, M, and Q were measured in each stack immediately after construction and after three and seven months of storage. Additionally, the DML, total accessible energy, and economic value of each stack were calculated at the same time points. The combined changes in fuel quality and DML reduced the amount of accessible energy by 13.7% in the uncovered parts but increased that in the covered parts by 0.6%. The economic value of the covered parts was unchanged after storage whereas that of the uncovered parts was reduced by 14%. Covering bark stacks with semi-permeable fabric during storage could thus increase the profitability of bark fuel supply chains. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Coverage; Dry matter losses; Forest; Moisture content; Residues; Supply","Energy dissipation; Fuels; Supply chains; Wood products; Covering material; Dry matter loss (DML); Economic values; Energy demands; Energy recovery; Net calorific value; Seasonal variation; Water resistant; Fuel storage; Bark; Components; Fuels; High Energy; Quality; Seasonal Variation; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086916784

Hydrogen, a common heat transfer medium, also provided the reactor's cooling requirements. Particular focus was placed on evaluation of the flow configuration within the reactor (co- and counter-current flow), because improved thermal management may offer enhanced CO2 methanation reaction equilibrium. The effects of the following, within specified ranges, were determined, in terms of the reactor's thermal behaviour and the resulting methanation performance: the total methanation flow (4–7 NL min−1), coolant flow (0.8–5.6 NL min−1) and reaction pressure (5 and 10 barg).

The results showed that the ICSHTI presents a mean daily efficiency around 51.60% and a heat loss coefficient equal to 5.51 W/m2K. Results also showed that the energy loaded from the ICSHTI is about 4,669 MJ which represents about 57% of the total domestic hot water (DHW) needs by considering only solar energy. By considering different scenarios of climatic conditions, TRNSYS and SOLO investigations showed that the average solar fraction is about 67 and 28% in hot and cold regions, respectively. To evaluate the feasibility of integrating the ICSHTI in local market, a comparison against the most commercialized DHW systems namely the flat-plate solar collector (FPC) was conducted. The results showed that the FPC is more economical than the ICSHTI with a yearly economy YOER and a payback period PT equal to 120.2 US$/year and 12 years for the FPC and 102.3 US$/year and 14.3 years for the ICSHTI when we considered the PT based on electric water heater. However, when we considered a PT based on gas water heater, the ICSHTI system becomes more economical than the FPCDHW with a PT equal to 18.5 years and 20.5 years, for the two systems, respectively. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","domestic hot water; honeycomb transparent insulation; integrated collector storage; more economical","Heat losses; Honeycomb structures; Investments; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Water heaters; Economic performance; Electric water heaters; Experimental and numerical studies; Flat-plate solar collectors; Heat loss coefficients; Integrated collector storage; Long term performance; Transparent insulations; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084438178

AMY 1–3 are composed of a calcitonin core receptor (CTR) and associated receptor-activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) 1–3. Using RAMP1, RAMP3 and RAMP1/3 global KO mice, this study aimed to determine whether the absence of one or two RAMP subunits affects food intake, glucose homeostasis and metabolism. Of all the RAMP-deficient mice, only high-fat diet fed RAMP1/3 KO mice had increased body weight. Chow-fed RAMP3 KO and high-fat diet fed 1/3 KO male mice were glucose intolerant. Fat depots were increased in RAMP1 KO male mice. No difference in energy expenditure was observed but the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was elevated in RAMP1/3 KO. RAMP1 and 1/3 KO male mice displayed an increase in intermeal interval (IMI) and meal duration, whereas IMI was decreased in RAMP3 KO male and female mice. WT and RAMP1, RAMP3, and RAMP1/3 KO male and female littermates were then assessed for their food intake response to an acute intraperitoneal injection of amylin or its receptor agonist, salmon calcitonin (sCT). RAMP1/3 KO were insensitive to both, while RAMP3 KO were responsive to sCT only and RAMP1 KO to amylin only. While female mice generally weighed less than male mice, only RAMP1 KO showed a clear sex difference in meal pattern and food intake tests. Lastly, a decrease in CTR fibers did not consistently correlate with a decrease in amylin- induced c-Fos expression in the area postrema (AP). Ultimately, the results from this study provide evidence for a role of RAMP1 in mediation of fat utilization and a role for RAMP3 in glucose homeostasis and amylin's anorectic effect. © 2019 IBRO","amylin; area postrema; fat; glucose homeostasis; metabolism; RAMP","amylin; calcitonin core receptor; calcitonin receptor; glucose; protein c fos; receptor activity modifying protein 1; receptor activity modifying protein 3; salcatonin; unclassified drug; amylin; calcitonin receptor; glucose; Ramp1 protein, mouse; receptor activity modifying protein 1; animal experiment; animal tissue; area postrema; Article; body weight gain; cohort analysis; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; female; food intake; glucose homeostasis; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; hormonal regulation; immunohistochemistry; intermeal interval; knockout mouse; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; meal duration; mouse; nonhuman; nutritional parameters; priority journal; protein analysis; protein deficiency; protein expression; protein function; respiratory exchange ratio; respiratory tract parameters; sex difference; wild type; animal; eating; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; Animals; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Female; Glucose; Islet Amyloid Polypeptide; Male; Mice; Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1; Receptors, Calcitonin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078727291

The land-fill disposal and open dumping of generated ash have serious environmental and health problems, primarily due to groundwater contamination. Further, non-availability of land for further dumping is another major problem associated with it. Considering the problems associated with agriculture waste ash, three types of nano agriculture waste ash were used in this study to modify asphalt binder and mixture. Rice husk ash, Sugar cane bagasse ash and Wheat straw ash were first reduced to Nanoscale using a ball mill. The size and chemical properties of these samples were studied using particle size analyser, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. Then these samples were mixed with asphalt binder at 2%, 4% and 6% by weight of asphalt binder. All modified binder samples were then tested for storage stability, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, penetration, softening point, ductility, performance grading and frequency sweep. All asphalt mixtures prepared using modified binder samples were tested for bitumen-bond strength, rolling bottle, dynamic modulus, cooper wheel tracker and four point beam fatigue. The results confirmed Nano size of each type of agriculture waste ash and amorphous SiO2 as their major chemical component. Further, asphalt binder and mixture samples modified with 6% nano rice husk ash, 6% nano sugar cane bagasse ash and 4% nano wheat straw ash performed better against moisture damage, rutting with the negligible negative effect on fatigue resistance. From the results it can be concluded that incorporation of each nano agriculture waste ash in asphalt binder and mixture is a sustainable and environmental friendly way of its disposal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asphalt binder; Asphalt mixture; Rice husk ash; Sugar cane bagasse ash; Sustainable solution; Wheat straw ash","Agricultural robots; Bagasse; Bottles; Fatigue of materials; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Grading; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Mixtures; Particle size; Silica; Straw; Sugar cane; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Agriculture wastes; Chemical component; Energy productions; Environmental-friendly; Groundwater contamination; Sugar cane bagasse ashes; Sustainable solution; X ray fluorescence; Asphalt mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089911617

This presents an opportunity for fossil fuel exporting desert countries to diversify and transition not only the domestic economy towards solar but also to become an exporter of solar energy through a suitable energy carrier. This paper investigates ammonia (NH3) as a promising carrier option. Essential chemical industries rely on conventionally produced ammonia as the intermediate product from which a wide variety of fertilizers and industrial products are produced. This work presents a methodology for designing, simulating and optimizing an industrial-scale facility that utilizes solely renewable electricity, applied in the context of UAE – a major ammonia exporter. Hydrogen is obtained from desalinated seawater electrolysis and nitrogen from air separation that is then processed in the Haber-Bosch process. A simulation of the integrated plant, that includes desalination, electrolysis, air separation, refrigeration and storage, is carried out in the Aspen Plus® environment. A large-scale plant continuously operated has a specific energy consumption of 10.43 kWh/kg-NH3 and an electric process efficiency of 37.4%. The optimal configuration of generation and storage to operate this plant based on hourly resolution operations and considering options of flexible sub-processes is specified with linear optimization. The fully renewable and cost-optimally configured system entails 3.5 GW of PV, 0.24 GWh of battery storage, and achieves about 37% efficiency for the UAE conditions. The levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) for this base case is estimated at $718/ton-NH3 and further reductions are possible under the expected technical advancements at $450/ton making it directly competitive with conventionally produced ammonia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy transition; Green ammonia; Hydrogen economy; Industrial optimization; Renewable energy integration","Chemical industry; Climate change; Computer software; Desalination; Electrolysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Hydrogen production; Linear programming; Solar energy; Climate change mitigation; Intermediate product; Linear optimization; Renewable electricity; Seawater electrolysis; Specific energy consumption; Technical advancement; Variable renewable energies; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087279184

To justify this claim, a systematic approach has been employed to evaluate the performance of the combo device. In this regard a novel material is synthesized via hydrothermal technique and later on physically blended with polyaniline (PANI) to boost the performance of the pristine material. This matrix material expresses excellent performance by showing a specific capacity of 154 C/g in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and 162 C/g in galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD). Furthermore, this electrode material was sandwiched with activated carbon to fabricate the supercapattery device. The supercapattery performance was evaluated through CV, GCD, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This device indicates a specific capacity of 104 C/g, 23.11 Wh/kg specific energy, and 6400 W/kg of specific power. Finally, a theoretical Dunn's model was applied to eliminate the faradaic and non-faradaic contribution of the real device. It was evidenced that the device storage was not purely faradaic (diffusive) neither non-faradaic (capacitive), but it is the combination of both contribution. The capacitive and diffusive contribution was found dependent on the scan rate and was due to the time offered to the ions for interaction with the electrode material. Our study offers the development of novel metal-organic framework/polyaniline-based electrode material for supercapattery devices as well as a unique route to probe the performance of the supercapattery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric supercapacitor; Capacitive/diffusive; MOF; PANI; Supercapattery","Activated carbon; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Polyaniline; Electrode material; Galvanostatic charge discharges; Hydrothermal techniques; Matrix materials; Polyanilines (PAni); Pristine materials; Specific capacities; Specific energy; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088229958

System-wide MACCs are derived using scenario ensembles from Irish TIMES energy systems model. Decomposition analysis is then used to associate decarbonization options with carbon abatement costs. In addition, energy systems analysis is carried out on the underlying scenario ensembles that are used to generate the MACCs to capture more technological details and to reflect interactions among technologies. The results show that MACCs are highly dependent on model assumptions and the availabilities of bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies play critical roles. The paper also shows how key mitigation measures can be ranked and classified into categories of resilient (wind energy, CCS, electric vehicles, biofuels), tipping-point (electrifying building heating, biomass plants), and niche (ocean energy) technologies. © 2020","Carbon Price; CO2 mitigation; Energy systems modelling; Marginal abatement cost curve","Biomass; Carbon capture; Decarbonization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Systems analysis; Wind power; Analytical approach; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Decomposition analysis; Energy systems analysis; Energy systems modeling; Marginal abatement cost curves; Mitigation measures; Pre-industrial levels; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; ensemble forecasting; European Union; global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087700630

Besides the operational benefits attributed to the presence of storage, the contribution of the ESS to the overall capacity adequacy of the system remains an issue open to investigation, that becomes ever more important in view of the withdrawal of thermal generation in the way towards decarbonizing the electricity sector. This paper examines the contribution of ESS to the capacity adequacy of weakly interconnected island systems, applying both a deterministic and a probabilistic approach. In both variants, the ESS operating profile is derived from the implementation of a load-levelling methodology, aiming at shaving the peaks of the daily load curve. In the paper, the load-levelling is implemented as a mixed integer quadratic constraint problem. The fundamental principles for the implementation of deterministic and probabilistic approaches for the calculation of ESS contribution to capacity adequacy are also presented and discussed. Simulation results for a study case island system reveal that ESS of limited energy capacity contribute only with a fraction of their installed power capacity to the overall system adequacy, while a maximum achievable contribution of storage to capacity adequacy exists, regardless of the evaluation method employed. © 2020, CIGRE.

The new associated electronic system will provide improved precision tracking and triggering for the expected high background rates.

It buffers, filters and aggregates the digitized data from up to 512 upgraded muon detectors and distributes phase-adjustable clock signals and control commands. It is fundamental to verify the robustness of ROC and its data integrity despite the neutron dose at which it is expected to be exposed. This paper briefly describes the ROC architecture, data formats, die layout and implemented techniques for the mitigation of radiation effects. The ROC test apparatus and irradiation testing are thoroughly presented, giving emphasis to the immunity to the produced single event upsets (SEUs) and the effects of data corruption inside its SRAM.

Generally, the proposed control consists on providing voltage and frequency (V-f) support to the grid instead of high load addition and ensuring an active and reactive power (P-Q) control. However, the main contribution of this work consists of improving the performance of the control techniques of gridconnected photovoltaic system by using another type of controller instead of the conventional PI controller and making a comparison between the two types of correctors (PI and PR controller) in order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed control.

This may be described as maximising Annual Worth (AW). However, one drawback of sizing microgrid BESS using AW is that the scale of investment is not taken into consideration. This can lead to unrealistic BESS sizes. This article presents two multi-objective optimisation (MOO) models to account for the scale of investment required in sizing BESS. The first model, Paired Comparison, utilises two objective functions: Daily Worth (DW), which maximises daily benefit cost differences a BESS installation provides a microgrid; and Daily Cost (DC), which minimises the daily cost of a BESS installation. The second model, called Rating Method, uses the objective functions DW and Daily Benefit-Cost Ratio (DBCR), the latter of which maximises the relative measure of BESS benefit and BESS cost. Both models are solved for a test microgrid system under three different scenarios using Compromise Programming (CP). For system designers who rank objective functions by importance, the Rating Method is the appropriate approach, whereas system designers who rank objective functions by absolute values should use Paired Comparison. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","annual worth; battery energy storage systems; compromise programming; equivalent annual cost; Multi-objective optimisation; net present value, benefit-cost ratio; normal boundary intersection method","Cost benefit analysis; Electric batteries; Investments; Microgrids; Multiobjective optimization; Systems analysis; Battery energy storage systems; Benefit cost ratios; Compromise programming; Cost differences; Financial objectives; Micro-grid systems; Objective functions; Paired comparison; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093497878

The Ʌ-shaped frontal walls are installed face-to-face at an angle to each other and mutually shield their own thermal radiation, which decreases the radiation heat losses by 27% compared with linear photovoltaic modules of the known designs. The photocurrent generated by cooled solar cells is directed to a system for charging chemical batteries and the thermal energy released is transmitted to the unconsumed intermediate heat-transfer fluid and then, through the surface of coil pipes of counter-current heat exchangers, to the consumed process water of the outer circulation circuit. The further transportation of thermal energy to the storage system occurs by natural circulation of the consumed process water through the temperature gradient formed by the control system over the height between the heat source, the heat exchanger, and the heat receiver, an insulated container (a heat accumulator). For the first time, efficient controlled transportation of heat has been implemented without using a circulation pump owing to the excess thermal energy released during the conversion of solar energy by the solar cells and a photo-selective film installed in the focal spot of the optical concentrator. Thus, a possibility of increasing the temperature of the heat-transfer fluids at the cogeneration system outlet has been offered. A two-circuit circulation system allows for separation of unconsumed heat-transfer fluids (antifreezing solutions) and the consumed fluid (the process water) by the pressure in the channels and installation of a linear counter-current heat exchanger that performs the functions of a supporting platform’s mechanical axis along the rotational axis of the optical concentrator. The system uses a dual-axis solar tracking concentrating system comprised of flat mirrors installed at an angle to the horizon. The arrangement of the Ʌ-shaped photovoltaic modules on the supporting framework in series along the heat-transfer-fluid path allows for a reduction in the overall dimensions of the channels, an increase in the total efficiency of the solar cells, and simplification of the encapsulation technology. A method for calculating the output of the cogeneration plant is provided. The method is based on the experimentally measured characteristics of silicon solar cells and heat losses in the channels of the linear photovoltaic modules. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","circulation system; heat exchanger; linear photovoltaic modules; optical concentrator; silicon photovoltaic cells; specific output","Cogeneration plants; Concentration (process); Conversion efficiency; Heat exchangers; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Circulation systems; Cogeneration systems; Encapsulation technology; Natural circulation; Optical concentrators; Photovoltaic modules; Radiation heat loss; Supporting platform; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091449381

Physiological and behavioral demands related to an efficient immune response entail a series of costs that compete with other vital activities, specifically energy storage, growth, reproduction, and maintenance functions. Here, we characterize the thermal biology and health status by the presence of injuries, ectoparasites, body condition, and individual immune response capacity (using phytohemagglutinin in a skin-swelling assay) of the southernmost lizards of the world, Liolaemus sarmientoi, endemic to a sub-optimal, cold environment in Patagonia, Argentina. In particular, we study the effect of a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS-treatment) on thermoregulation. We found that the field-active body temperature (Tb) was much lower than the preferred body temperature (Tp) obtained in the laboratory. All the individuals were in good body condition at the beginning of the experiments. The phytohemagglutinin test caused detectable thickening in sole-pads at 2 h and 24 h post-assay in males and non-pregnant females, indicating a significant innate immune response. In the experimental immune challenge, the individuals tended to prefer a low body temperature after LPS-treatment (2 h post-injection) and developed hypothermia, while the control individuals injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), maintained their body temperature throughout the trial. In both the LPS-treatment and PBS-control individuals, BC declined during the experiment. Hypothermia may allow this southernmost species to optimize the use of their energetic resources and reduce the costs of thermoregulation in a cold-temperate environment where they rarely attain the mean Tp (35.16 °C) obtained in laboratory. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Body condition; Hypothermia; Infection; Liolaemus sarmientoi; Lipopolysaccharide; Thermoregulation","lipopolysaccharide; phosphate buffered saline; phytohemagglutinin; lipopolysaccharide; adult; animal experiment; Argentina; Article; body temperature; cellular immunity; cold; controlled study; ectoparasite; environmental temperature; female; health status; hypothermia; immune response; infection; innate immunity; Liolaemus sarmientoi; lizard; male; nonhuman; puerperium; reproduction; thermoregulation; acclimatization; animal; animal behavior; body temperature; cold; drug effect; immunology; physiology; Acclimatization; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Temperature; Cold Temperature; Lipopolysaccharides; Lizards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090049732

Manufacturers develop new technologies to process sensitive food materials to supply new products with improved properties and high quality. The process in which the air is cooled sensibly while the moisture is removed from food is called cooling with dehumidification process. The system fundamentally acts as a heat pump, which pumps the heat from the dehumidified air to a different air stream in another area, with the aid of a refrigerant gas to carry the heat. This article reviews the potential of low-temperature heat pump dehumidifier drying used in the food industry. Moreover, this describes the principle of cooling with dehumidification (CWD) process, the importance of studying psychrometric charts to understand CWD process, measures used in identify energy efficiency, comparison of this method over common dryers, applications, advantages and limitations of the CWD drying method.

Furthermore, uncoordinated patterns of charging and discharging the GIESBs are able to expand voltage profiles of power grids beyond their limits, while considering extra generation from photovoltaic arrays (PVs) and wind turbines (WTs). Therefore, a decentralized power management scheme is proposed in this paper to mitigate such impact on grid voltages and to improve the performance of the GIESBs with PVs and WTs. The proposed scheme develops three clusters of different objective functions to coordinate charging and discharging cycles of the GIESBs based on mixed integer linear programming, considering state of charge (SoC) and depth of discharge (DoD) of the batteries. The first cluster minimizes the power-charging cost of the GIESBs by utilizing time of use tariffs. The second cluster minimizes the charging power of the GIESBs, employing per unit generation from PVs and WTs, whereas the third cluster minimizes the discharging power of the GIESBs, using per unit consumption of residential loads. Simulation results of six scenarios show that, although the proposed scheme of the first cluster reduces operational costs of the GIESBs, it cannot maintain system voltages within the limitations. With the second and third clusters, the proposed scheme exhibits a better performance in stabilizing grid voltages, while maintaining the SoC and DoD within their boundaries to underpin state of health of the batteries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage systems; Electricity grids; Mixed integer linear programming; Photovoltaic and wind generation; Power flow; Time of use and feed in tariffs","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Integer programming; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Depth of discharges; Integrated energy storages; Intermittent renewables; Mixed integer linear programming; Objective functions; Photovoltaic arrays; Power management scheme; Time-of-use tariffs; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089540628

The optimum conditions for reactions were studied using a mixture of guaiacol and H2O2 as substrate for POD and pyrogallol for PPO. The experimental work indicated that optimum pH for both enzymes was 7.0; meanwhile optimum temperature was 30°C for POD and 25°C for PPO. Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) values for POD were 8.33 and 8.00 mM for guaiacol and H2O2, respectively. The Km value was 5.88 mM pyrogallol for PPO. Thermal inactivation results revealed that the inactivation kinetics followed a monophasic first-order model. Activation energies (Ea) were 74.68 and 112.97 kJ/mol for POD and PPO, respectively. Therefore, POD was more heat-stable than PPO. This result is very useful to optimize pomegranate processing (canning or freezing), which represents the most important food industries in many tropical and subtropical regions. Practical applications: Pomegranate has been attracted more interest due to its antioxidant and nutritional values. For industrial applications, there is a growing interest to obtain pomegranate products such as juice, jams, food supplements, etc. It is well established that the residual activities of endogenous enzymes in either raw materials or processed products may cause loss of quality during storage. Inhibition of enzymatic browning is an important factor to maintain pomegranate quality. This work offers a better insight of characterization of browning enzymes and their thermosatbility, which will be useful to control the possible browning of pomegranate arils during processing and storage. In addition, the results of this study is very important in pomegranate processing where it showed a higher temperature with shortened time can be applied. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","optimum conditions; peroxidase; polyphenol oxidase; pomegranate arils; thermal inactivation","Activation energy; Alcohols; Canning; Enzymes; Food storage; Thermal processing (foods); Tropics; Activation energies (Ea); First-order models; Inactivation kinetics; Optimum conditions; Optimum temperature; Processed products; Subtropical regions; Thermal inactivation; Plants (botany)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089396752

As part of these adaptations, leptin and insulin concentrations increase in the maternal circulation during pregnancy. Central effects of leptin and insulin, however, are counterproductive to pregnancy, as increased action of these hormones in the brain lead to suppression of food intake. To prevent this, it is well documented that pregnancy induces a state of leptin- and insulin-insensitivity in the brain, particularly the hypothalamus, in a range of species. While the mechanisms underlying leptin- or insulin-insensitivity during pregnancy vary between species, there is evidence of reduced transport into the brain, impaired activation of intracellular signalling pathways, including reduced leptin receptor expression, and attenuated activation of downstream neuronal pathways, especially for leptin insensitivity. Pregnancy-induced changes in prolactin, growth hormone and leptin are discussed in terms of their role in mediating this reduced response to leptin and insulin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hypothalamus; Insulin; Leptin; Pregnancy","glucose; growth hormone; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; prolactin; insulin; leptin; adaptation; circulation; endocrine system; energy balance; food intake; glucose homeostasis; hormone action; hormone resistance; hormone sensitivity; hormone transport; human; hypothalamus; insulin sensitivity; intracellular signaling; leptin insensitivity; lipid storage; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; protein expression; Review; animal; brain; eating; energy metabolism; female; homeostasis; metabolism; pregnancy; signal transduction; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Brain; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Female; Homeostasis; Humans; Insulin; Leptin; Pregnancy; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089156024

Results showed that its performance was as good as theirs. Nanocapsules of the PCM coated with TiO2 were prepared and characterized physical, thermal and morphologically. Thermal studies were carried out in a device designed and constructed simulating a water heater, and a reduction of about 70% of the PCM phase thermal resistance due to the TiO2 shell was observed.

Due to the brain's limited energy storage, the oxygen and glucose necessary to support brain functions depends on the correct blood supply. The main components of the arteries are smooth muscle cells, which are considered the main regulators of vascular tone and blood flow distribution. The information currently available on the functioning of the cerebral arteries and their cell constituents is extremely scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop an in vitro model of smooth muscle cells derived from rat middle cerebral artery. Explants were collected from rat middle cerebral artery and adhered to collagen-coated culture dishes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that the cells present in the culture expressed α-actin, a protein characteristic of the contractile phenotype of these cells. In addition, these cells did not express the endothelial marker, vWF. To evaluate the functionality of these cells the response to contractile agents, serotonin and noradrenaline, and to relaxing agent, sodium nitroprusside was determine by Planar Cell Surface Area analysis. Together the data obtained show that the cell culture obtained through the procedure described resulted in cells presenting the markers characteristic of smooth muscle cells and maintaining the usual contractile response, indicating that the cells obtained through this may be used as a model for characterization and study of functional behavior of the middle cerebral artery, as well as interaction studies between vascular and neuronal system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cell culture; Cerebrovascular diseases; Contractility; Middle cerebral artery; Smooth muscle cells","alpha actin; nitroprusside sodium; noradrenalin; serotonin; actin binding protein; calcium binding protein; calponin; cytoskeleton protein; muscle protein; nitroprusside sodium; noradrenalin; serotonin; Smtn protein, rat; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; cell function; cell isolation; cell surface; cells by body anatomy; controlled study; explant; female; immunocytochemistry; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; middle cerebral artery; nonhuman; phenotype; rat; smooth muscle cell; surface area; Western blotting; Wistar rat; animal; cell culture; cell separation; cytology; drug effect; metabolism; middle cerebral artery; smooth muscle cell; umbilical cord; Animals; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Cell Separation; Cells, Cultured; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Microfilament Proteins; Middle Cerebral Artery; Muscle Proteins; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Nitroprusside; Norepinephrine; Phenotype; Rats; Serotonin; Umbilical Cord",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087114647

DC microgrids offer many advantages rather than AC microgrids. In spite of the numerous features and advantages of DC microgrids, their protection faces significant challenges such as self-limited current of photovoltaic (PV) systems, long time constant of wind energy systems, dependability on communication systems, etc. The paper introduces a new protection scheme for DC microgrids using the rate of power (dP) and rate of voltage (dV) and mapping them as dP-dV profile. The new scheme is titled as smart power/voltage relay (SPV-Relay). The proposed scheme is applicable for all types of renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage systems independent of the power rating and configuration of the DC microgrid. The proposed concept of SPV-Relay is described and the method used for fault discrimination is explained. The relay characteristics are developed considering all the DC microgrid components.

A complex interplay between the Chl molecule and its microenvironment determines its transition energy. Interactions such as excitonic coupling with one or more pigments (Chls or carotenoids), axial ligation to the magnesium center, or electrostatic interactions between Chl and nearby amino-acid residues all influence the photophysical properties. Here we use time-resolved photodissociation action spectroscopy to determine transition energies of Chla/b complexes in vacuo to directly compare the impact of a negatively charged axial ligand (formate) to that of exciton coupling between two Chls. Experiments carried out at the electrostatic ion storage ring ELISA allow dissociation to be sampled on hundreds of milliseconds time scale. Absorption-band maxima of Chla-formate complexes are found at 433 ± 4 nm/2.86 ± 0.03 eV (Soret band) and in the region 654-675 nm/1.84-1.90 eV (Q band) and those of Chla dimers tagged by a quaternary ammonium ion at 419 ± 5 nm/2.96 ± 0.04 eV (Soret band) and 647 nm/1.92 eV (Q band). The axial ligand strongly affects the Chla transition energies causing redshifts of 0.21 eV of the Soret band and 0.04-0.1 eV of the Q band compared to Chla tagged by a quaternary ammonium. Slightly smaller shifts were found in case of Chlb. The redshifts are approximately twice that induced by excitonic coupling between two Chlas, also tagged by a quaternary ammonium ion. Axial ligation brings the absorption by isolated Chls very close to that of photosynthetic proteins. © the Owner Societies.",,"Chlorophyll; Dimers; Electrostatics; Energy transfer; Ligands; Proteins; Red Shift; Action spectroscopy; Amino acid residues; Charge separations; Gas phase spectroscopy; Negatively charged; Photophysical properties; Photosynthetic proteins; Quaternary ammonium; Ions; chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; formic acid derivative; quaternary ammonium derivative; chemistry; color; procedures; spectroscopy; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Color; Formates; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Spectrum Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091601529

Compared to the thermodynamic limit of macroscopic systems, significantly enlarged adsorbate coverage under nanoconfinement constitutes a major finding of the modeling. Concomitantly, nanoconfined adsorbates are expected to exhibit extra thermal stability against desorption. These effects on adsorption are explored using canonical partition-functions as well as an original relationship between coverage variations and the Langmuir constant, both in the frameworks of the ideal gas and lattice-gas models. With reported DFT adsorption-energies as input, adsorption isotherms are derived numerically for H2 on Ti-doped graphene-like nanostructures. Remarkable deviations from the classical Langmuir isotherm are predicted for the first time, namely, system-size dependent enhanced H2 adsorbate coverage. The effects are computed also for CO2 inside MOF single-molecule traps, including their relationships to adsorption-energy, specific-heat and to coverage fluctuations. According to preliminary modeling, nanoconfinement effects are anticipated also for adsorption in nanopores undergoing molecular exchange with the external environment, and for impurity segregation in nanoparticle and nanocrystalline solids. The entropic origin of the nanoconfinement effect on equilibrium adsorption (NCEEA) is demonstrated analogously to the nanoconfinement effect on equilibrated chemical reactions studied by us previously.

In photoautotrophic conditions, Rhodopseudomonas palustris' growth requires electrons provided by inorganic donors to produce enough reducing equivalents to complement energy generation by light. When growing photo heterotrophically, these electrons are provided by organic donors, and the excess of reducing power is balanced through carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation or through the reduction of other electron acceptors. Here we report the electrochemical characterization of an autochthonous R. palustris strain identified as AZUL, which is capable of not only accepting electrons from an electrode (cathodic conditions) during photoautotrophic growth but also using the electrode as an electron acceptor (anodic conditions) under a photoheterotrophic conditions. In the first condition, cells were able to grow and accept electrons from an electrode polarized at negative potentials (i.e. replacing inorganic electron donors). We propose that R. palustris AZUL presents mechanisms for both direct and indirect electron uptake, as evidenced by growth curves and cyclic voltammetry experiments. When grown in anodic conditions, cells formed biofilms with a particular architecture on poised graphite electrodes. We detected a specific voltammetric profile characterized by two reduction processes at 0.2 and 0.4 V and an oxidation process at 0.57 V (vs Ag/AgCl). These redox signals progressively changed with the time of growth towards an oxidation catalysis signal with a gate potential of 0.5 V. Biofilm charge accumulation experiments indicated that this bacteria accumulates electrons that can be subsequently discharged upon polarization. The results presented herein suggest that R. palustris AZUL is capable of exchanging electrons with an electrode in a bidirectional fashion. In addition, our experiments indicate that this strain has a mechanism of redox balance that includes charge storage in redox molecules that can transfer charge to the extracellular space when a high potential acceptor is available. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Exocellular electron transport; Microbial electrochemistry; Phototrophy; Redox balance; Rhodopseudomonas palustris","Bacteria; Biofilms; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrons; Graphite electrodes; Machinery; Metabolism; Reduction; Charge accumulation; Electrochemical characterizations; Extracellular space; Oxidation catalysis; Photoautotrophic conditions; Photoautotrophic growth; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; Voltammetric profiles; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088917280

In CLC, an oxygen carrier is used to convert the fuel and the produced CO2 is inherently separated from air components, which makes it suitable for CCS. The CLC of biomass is a way to generate negative CO2 emissions. However, interactions between ash and oxygen carriers are a tough challenge as biomass-derived ashes consist of large amounts of reactive ash-forming matter such as alkaline and alkali earth metals. As iron-based oxygen carriers are one of the most commonly used ones, the interaction of the pure iron oxide and biomass-derived ash-forming matter needs to be further understood to overcome the deactivating effects of ash components on the oxygen carriers. Even though ash components may exist in different forms, the effects of K- and Na-based carbonates, chlorides, nitrates, phosphates, and sulfates on the pure iron oxide were mainly investigated in this study. The effect of synthetic biomass-derived ash on the iron oxygen carriers was also investigated to reveal the phases causing agglomeration or deactivation of the oxygen carriers. Experiments were performed at 950 °C for 5 h under both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. After experiments, the obtained phases were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping was performed by using scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results showed that the Fe oxygen carrier was worst affected by KCl, KH2PO4, and NaNO3 in terms of agglomeration among the used salts. The presence of K and Si together in the ash caused a ""bridge""formation between the oxygen carrier and the ash constituent, which increased the agglomeration. A strong Ca deposit on the outer layer of the Fe oxygen carrier was also observed when a mixture of salt was used to mimic ash. Even though some discrepancies were observed, generally thermodynamic calculations were successful in estimating the experimentally observed phases. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Agglomeration; Alkalinity; Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Climate change; Combustion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Iron oxides; Nitrogen compounds; Oxygen; Potassium compounds; Salts; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium nitrate; Sulfur compounds; Alkali earth metal; Ash-forming matter; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Chemical-looping combustion; Elemental mapping; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Reducing atmosphere; Thermodynamic calculations; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095445746

This disease is associated with alterations in insulin action and lipid metabolism, generating hyperglycemia and dyslipidemias. Currently, it is necessary to develop new or known drugs that promote the sensitization of insulin action. Thus, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) is probably the key to doing this. PPARs participate in maintaining an energetic balance between storage and the expenditure of energy. The activation of PPARγ produces the storage of energy, mainly as glycogen and fat. Meanwhile, PPARα activation promotes lipid degradation. Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid of numerous edible and medicinal plants, decreases hyperglycemia and lipid accumulation. However, the effects on PPARs and their regulated genes are unknown. Our aim was to determine the effects of OA on PPAR γ/α expression and their regulated genes (adiponectin, type 4 glucose transporter, fatty acid transport protein, and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase) in C2C12 myoblasts by RT-PCR, Western blot, GLUT-4 translocation, and lipid storage in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In C2C12 myoblasts, OA increased the expression of mRNA in both PPARγ/α and their regulated genes; also, PPARγ, GLUT-4, and FATP-1 protein expression increased, as well as GLUT-4 translocation. In 3T3-L1, OA increased the expression of mRNA in both PPARγ/α and maintained lipid storage unchanged. In conclusion, OA exhibited a dual action on PPARγ/α, which might explain in part its antihyperglycemic effect. This compound represents an alternative for designing novel therapeutic strategies in the control of T2D. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Diabetes mellitus; Dual agonists; Myoblasts; Oleanolic acid; PPARα; PPARγ","fatty acid transporter 4; glucose transporter 4; messenger RNA; oleanolic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; antidiabetic agent; antilipemic agent; glucose transporter 4; oleanolic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; Ppara protein, mouse; Pparg protein, mouse; Slc2a4 protein, mouse; 3T3-L1 cell line; animal cell; Article; C2C12 cell line; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; dyslipidemia; energy expenditure; enzyme activation; gene control; gene expression; lipid degradation; lipid storage; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting; adipocyte; animal; drug effect; dyslipidemia; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; protein transport; signal transduction; skeletal myoblast; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dyslipidemias; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Hypoglycemic Agents; Hypolipidemic Agents; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Myoblasts, Skeletal; Oleanolic Acid; PPAR alpha; PPAR gamma; Protein Transport; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088808020

The solar system uses photovoltaic-thermal panels and has neither a battery nor a heat pump. The elimination of the battery and heat pump is proposed to reduce the cost of the system to motivate the building owners to adopt the solution as a cheaper energy system for their buildings. In this way, the building energy system would be able not only to produce a major portion of the heat and electricity demands of the households but also to supply its excess production to the grids to decrease the energy bill of the building. As district heating systems are on the verge of a transformation to their next generations, it is important to know how this system would respond to the future designs and standards of district heating systems. That is why the simulations are accomplished based on different district heating integration scenarios, i.e. existing, low-temperature, and ultralow-temperature district heating systems. For doing the simulations and comparative analysis on the performance of the system in various dynamic operating conditions, TRNSYS software is employed. The results show that the ultralow-temperature district heating model is the most suitable case for integration with the proposed system.

In this study, we used a natural material obtained from thin bands of sedimentary rocks known as Banded Iron Formation (BIF). BIF powders (pristine and ball-milled) were used as catalysts for the large-scale production of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) via an aerosol-assisted catalytic chemical vapor deposition (AACCVD) experiment. The morphology and composition profiles of the BIF powders and N-MWCNT samples were analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and Raman spectroscopies, and thermogravimetric analysis. XRD characterizations revealed that the BIF powders were mainly composed of quartz and hematite. This result was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The production efficiency of 340% wt./wt. of the N-MWCNTs was obtained by 1 h ball-milled BIF powders. The specific surface area of the N-MWCNTs reached 37.87 m2/g. The type of nitrogen doping, oxygen functional groups, silicon, and carbon species (sp2 and sp3) hosted at the surface of the N-MWCNTs were quantified by XPS. The electrochemical response of electrodes composed of the N-MWCNTs were studied via cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance, and coulombic efficiency determination to assess the possible applications of our synthesized materials as energy storage or sensor systems.

This article deals with the designing methodology of an intelligent control based grid-connected a hybrid system composed of renewable energy source (RES) and storage system (SS). RES is a photovoltaic (PV) source and SS is a process of hydrogen transformation system (H2TS) which composed of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) for decomposition water by using the PV power, a tank used for gas storage and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC) to transform the H2 to the electrical energy. The interconnection of the grid with the power generation system (PGS) is ensured through using a DC/AC hysteresis converter and it can synchronize current with the grid voltage among an independent control of active (P) and reactive (Q) power through a possibility of the Q compensation. In the proposed system, three algorithms are applied; two used inside generation and the third is used inside the grid. Perturb and observe (P&amp;O) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control algorithm always finds optimal power in the PV generator. A simple cascade controls loop of DC-DC boost converter and operate the FC generator to ensure maximum power and to regulate the DC Bus voltage. In addition, adaptive fuzzy logic control (FLC) unit is developed to control the DC/AC inverter, with adopting an off-line optimization based on genetic algorithms (GAs) applauded for tune different issues as scaling factors of the FLC and PIDs gains of the PV and the H2TS control loops.

The methodology applied includes an estimation of the bike's range under different routes and riders, the riders' opinions and a financial evaluation of the hydrogen fuel cost compared to other urban vehicle alternatives. The results showed a minimum median range-to-energy consumption ratio of 20.5 km/kWh, while the maximum hydrogen cost was found to reach 0.025 €/km when refuelling the hydrogen bicycle in an autonomous hydrogen station.

The first step includes an exhaustive search of optimal low cost source-sink connections to process non-linear information involving pipeline, multistage compressor sizing and costing into linear/piece-wise linear optimal costs. The second step applies these models in the linear multi-period optimization model to design cost optimal CO2 reduction networks.

Solar energy collectors are the significant part of Solar Energy Thermal Power Plant (STP), which can be operated at a particular feasible range for utilizing the solar resource with its intermittent inputs. The life span of solar thermal power plant can be increased by designing the controller with a closed loop. The proposed hybrid design of solar plant involves a controller with closed loop transferring the solar energy to the heat transfer liquid, namely therminol oil, which acts as a medium for transferring heat in Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) having single-phase flow. The concentrators are the parabolic reflectors focusing the rays on the line with a focal point using tracking mechanism having one axis. Solar collectors are utilized in the power converting technique of solar thermal energy, which concentrates sunlight for preparing Rankine cycle heat of high temperature. The steam turbine is driven by the superheated vapor using Rankine cycle with the shaft of the steam turbine connected to the generator for producing electricity. The life span of the Solar Energy Thermal Power Plant is enhanced as proposed design for solar collectors uses therminol oil as the heat transfer liquid. The controller design is implemented using Predictive Function Control (PFC) or Static Feed Forward (SFF) control with Proportional Integral Controller (PI) which provides the best performance with the added advantage of direct heat storage in the thermal plant. The simulated results are obtained for the proposed design of collector with the rate of change of variation and cost function of manipulated parameters, which are constant for the proposed controller but vary drastically for the conventional PI controller.

Carbon dioxide adversely affects the environment, therefore, its utilization and storage are critical. In this work, a simplistic approach of single-stage membrane units combine with amine absorption processes with different commercial amines was investigated. An increase in CO2 concentration in the feed gas results in a substantial increase in the thermal energy consumption of the stripper reboiler were using a hybrid amine-membrane setup can effectively reduce energy consumed in the reboiler. Both the amine absorption process and membrane process are simulated using Aspen HYSYS V10. Since the membrane is not available in Aspen HYSYS V10 unit operation package; it is programmed and added as custom user operation. Moreover, a new acid/ amine-based fluid package builds in a combination of the Peng-Robinson equation of state for vapor phase and electrolyte non-random two liquid-based activity model for the liquid phase were used in this study. Furthermore, energy consumption in CO2 capture using different alkanolamine such as N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), monethanolamine (MEA), deithanolamine (DEA), piperazine (PZ), triethanolamine (TEA) are also studied.

Increase of natural gas production and supply causes drawback of onshore infrastructure and many environmental restrictions. As solution, offshore large-scale terminals especially Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) type is becoming commercially competitive and effective alternative for the areas where onshore gas supply infrastructure is not feasible. LNG production consumes around 850 kJ/kg of LNG energy and it is just dumped into seawater or in the atmosphere despite reusing as extra energy source. In this paper, we review the cold energy economy as well as current status of LNG cold energy utilization technologies. Moreover, current and emerging cybersecurity trends after LNG cold energy implementation at FSRU are proposed and discussed to broaden the perspectives of the researchers in the community and industry experts. Finally, the review concluded with a practical recommendation of implementation of LNG Cold Energy Hub concept for future energy systems.","cold energy economy; energy efficiency; FSRU; cybersecurity; LNG cold energy utilization; LNG infrastructure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096572745

In this paper, a renewable and green microgrid is proposed aiming to zero emission power generation; the microgrid consists of biogas plant, biodiesel plant, photovoltaic system, wind turbines, battery energy storage system, load, and electric vehicles. The main contribution of this paper is providing the frequency stability enhancement of the proposed microgrid through controlling the electric vehicles batteries using fuzzy logic controller based on three main factors, the state of charge of the electric vehicles batteries, the microgrid frequency deviation signal, and the departure time of the vehicle that is set in advance by the owner. This work is discussing three scenarios, in the first one, the batteries of the electric vehicles are going to be charged directly once they get plugged into the charging point, in the second one, the electric vehicles batteries are going to be charged based on fuzzy charging control technique, in the third scenario, the vehicle to grid concept is applied, so the charging and discharging of the electric vehicles batteries are going to be controlled through fuzzy logic controller. © 2020 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Biodiesel Plant; Biogas Plant; Electric Vehicles; Frequency Stability; Fuzzy Logic Controller; Particle Swarm Optimization; Photovoltaic; Wind Energy; Zero-Emission Microgrid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095857197

It is one of the new areas of research because it provides the solution to problems related between the provided and the required energies. Paraffin is a common phase change material (PCM) that used in many applications in thermal energy storage (TES) systems. However, the main disadvantage is their low thermal conductivities. However, using metallic additives to improve effective thermal conductivity of PCM can lead to decreasing effective heat capacity and the thermal energy stored. An experimental study is carried out to analyze the thermal behavior of the paraffin melting in a thermal cavity integrating different metals (zamak, aluminum and copper) with different configuration. The originality of study is to try to predict the best duo that respects both the improvement of thermal conductivity and energy stored.

HRESs are notably used to meet the needs of residential loads. Nevertheless, power surplus and shortages still represent issues that must be handled by energy management systems. In this paper, a novel method for optimal energy management of a grid connected micro-grid composed of five smart Moroccan prosumers is presented. The proposed energy management strategy is organized using three levels, namely, HRES level, load-scheduling level, and communication-sharing level between HRESs. The first two levels of energy management are processed at the local level, i.e., inside each smart home. For the third level, our paper demonstrates the feasibility of interactions and communication between the five different houses interconnected using an optimized infrastructure topology as a smart neighborhood grid. Each of these houses is empowered by their own hybrid renewable energy system made of possible system hybridization based on PV (Photovoltaic), wind turbine, and battery storage system. This helps each house to manage its surplus and to deal with energy shortage through the proposed multi-level system's energy management algorithm. The application of information and communication technologies enables the set of smart homes connected in a micro-grid framework to contribute to the emergence of the concept of the internet of sustainable green things. Simulations conducted by the MATLAB platform validate the proposed methodology, which relies on micro-grid surplus injection and neighborhood storage during extreme surplus, else load dynamics thereafter micro-grid-injected energy recovering during hybrid energy deficit. The proposed system manages the energy produced by HRESs and reduces the energy demanded by the utility grid using the proposed topology that connects houses and ensures interactions between the micro-grid and the utility. The results show that the frequency of micro-grid deficiency was significantly reduced due to the established micro-grid with the five houses according to the proposed topology and the developed multi-level management system. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Ambient intelligence; Automation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Houses; Intelligent buildings; MATLAB; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Topology; Battery storage system; Energy management algorithms; Energy management strategies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Multi-level systems; Renewable energy source; Residential loads; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092634653

Consequences of GDM include increased risk of macrosomia and birth complications in the infant and an increased risk of maternal type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after pregnancy. There is also a longer-term risk of obesity, T2DM, and cardiovascular diseases in the child. GDM is the result of impaired glucose tolerance due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction on a background of insulin resistance that physiologically increases during pregnancy. The strongest clinical predictors of GDM are overweight and obesity. The fact that women with GDM are more likely to be overweight or obese suggests that adipose tissue dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of GDM, similarly to T2DM. Adipose tissue is not only involved in energy storage but also functions as an active endocrine organ secreting adipokines (specific hormones and cytokines) with the ability to alter insulin sensitivity. Recent evidence points to a crucial role of numerous adipokines produced by fat in the development of GDM.

This paper discusses some of the key issues as regards the slow progress in achieving environmental sustainability in the cement industry. Techniques such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), material substitution, alternative fuels and energy efficient technologies have been proposed as means of mitigating the negative environmental impact of cement production. It was observed that much progress has been made in the area of eco-friendly research innovations. These innovations (considered as disruptive by the mega co-operations) have had issues at the entrepreneurial stage. These so-called disruptive technologies have struggled to meet some performance requirements and satisfy funding evaluators thus are still difficult to fully commercialise. The systematisation of the environmental sustainability problem was discussed as a possible way forward both in the environmental, economic and social domain. Looking into the future, a greater emphasis on systematised decision-based approach could help breach the gap between on-paper plans and practical implementations to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2020, Zhejiang University Press.","Cement; Environment; Global warming; Pollution; Sustainability; Waste",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092397885

It has been demonstrated that the use of an ice-based cold storage system can reduce the total cost of energy in the context of an isolated microgrid where the main goal is the procurement of the electrical and cooling demand. In this article, we consider the potential from the thermal inertia of the buildings as an additional source of flexibility. To this end, a controller that takes into account the interior temperature of the buildings as an optimization variable is developed. Additional to the flexibility, a better utilization of the available renewable resources can thus be acquired. A simulator is implemented in which every microgrid component is modeled in detail in order to simulate the operations of the entire system. The results show that the combination of the cold storage system with the dynamic control of the indoors temperature can reduce the operating costs of the microgrid by 68%. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Cold storage (CS); control strategies; dynamic building control; microgrid; optimal sizing","Cold storage; Cost reduction; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Cost of energies; Dynamic controls; Integrate renewable energies; Interior temperature; Optimization variables; Renewable resource; Thermal dynamics; Thermal inertia; Microgrids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091749872

The feasibility of the proposed strategy is assessed with a state of charge model for the EVs delivering FCR, based on one year of system frequency measurements including the conversion losses in the charger and a dynamic model of the heat pump system. Both models were previously validated against experimental data. The proposed operation of the EVs was experimentally validated as part of this study. The heat pump offsets the energy content of the frequency deviations for 25 EVs and thereby enables them to bid a larger power capacity on the FCR market without violating energy constraints of the battery capacity. For the case of 2018 an additional income from capacity and power price payments was obtained that could not be generated by the EVs or the heat pump alone. This synergy effect was shown to be highly dependent on the achievable capacity payments, which were relatively high for the 2018 case. © 2020","Ancillary services; Electric vehicles; Frequency control; Large-scale heat pump; Vehicle-to-Grid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090159008

It is known that insulin can acutely stimulate FA synthesis in adipocytes; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear. The rate-limiting step in FA synthesis is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), known to be regulated through inhibitory phosphorylation at S79 by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Previous results from our laboratory showed an inhibition of AMPK activity by insulin, which was accompanied by PKB-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK at S485. However, whether the S485 phosphorylation is required for insulin-induced inhibition of AMPK or other mechanisms underlie the reduced kinase activity is not known. To investigate this, primary rat adipocytes were transduced with a recombinant adenovirus encoding AMPK-WT or a nonphosphorylatable AMPK S485A mutant. AMPK activity measurements by Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assay revealed that WT and S485A AMPK were inhibited to a similar degree by insulin, indicating that AMPK S485 phosphorylation is not required for insulin-induced AMPK inhibition. Further analysis suggested an involvement of decreased AMP-to-ATP ratios in the insulin-induced inhibition of AMPK activity, whereas a possible contribution of phosphodiesterases was excluded. Furthermore, we show that insulin-induced AMPK S485 phosphorylation also occurs in human adipocytes, suggesting it to be of an importance yet to be revealed. Altogether, this study increases our understanding of how insulin regulates AMPK activity, and with that, FA synthesis, in adipose tissue.

Since this region is physically inaccessible, there is a need to realize modeling and simulation of the hydrogen adsorption and storage process under reservoir conditions. Motivated by the previous problem, in this work, based on recent reports of hydrogen production from oil fields, we present a theoretical methodology to describe the process of hydrogen adsorption on naturally fractured and carbonated (limestone (CaCO3)) reservoirs and to quantify their storage capacity. Firstly, the calcite rock model was optimized inside a simulation cell containing a vacuum layer, for which energy optimization techniques based on density functional theory were used. Subsequently, using ab initio methods also based on DFT, calcite rock was characterized obtaining structural, electronic, vibrational, thermodynamic properties, and Mulliken population analysis of CaCO3. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were performed in order to simulate the adsorption process and obtain percentages of hydrogen adsorption on (110) surface of the (2 × 2) CaCO3 supercell, for N = 3, 5, 10 hydrogen molecules. The molecular dynamics simulations showed that the surface of CaCO3 rock has hydrogen capacity of only 0.42 mass %. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atomic simulations; Hydrogen adsorption; Limestone rock; Oil reservoir; Storage of hydrogen","calcium carbonate; hydrogen; limestone; ab initio calculation; adsorption; Article; chemical structure; density functional theory; energy; enthalpy; entropy; heat; molecular dynamics; oil field; priority journal; rock; simulation; storage; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089730997

Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C describe fundamental transformations in energy systems and typically rely on emission reductions combined with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere, mostly through large-scale application of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). These options face several difficulties, such as reliance on underground CO2 storage and competition for land with food production. Here, using the PROMETHEUS global energy system model, alternative deep mitigation pathways are explored, in light of the revised carbon budgets specified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5 °C. The pathways assess the potential contribution of energy efficiency improvements and more rapid electrification of energy services based on renewable energy. Although these alternatives also face specific implementation challenges, they are found to significantly reduce the need for CDR and BECCS, but not fully eliminate it, and offer an effective way to diversify transition pathways to meet the Paris targets. Achieving the 1.5 °C target is technically feasible but requires immediate, ambitious, and global action, based on large-scale deployment of renewables, early retirement of fossil-based power plants, accelerated efficiency improvements, and expansion of carbon-free options in end-uses. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The plant characteristics were evaluated using energy and exergoeconomic criteria and a robust coal gasification/combustion mathematical model that can predict temperature, converted fraction and particle size distribution for solids have been used for a high pressure fluidized bed. Other models based on Python, Aspen Hysys and Microsoft Excel have been used too. Integrating carbon sequestration reduces the global energy and exergy efficiencies of all power plants (up to 10%). However, the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a promising technology utilizing coal for generating electrical energy and direct compression of CO2 (11–20 MPa). Similarly, integrating gasification with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC), allows for the pre-combustion capture of CO2, with the advantage of lower initial investment costs. The oxy-fuel combustion (OXY) plant offers high energy and exergy efficiencies, but the exergoeconomic cost of CO2 is increased by 31 USD/t as compared to IGCC. The conventional thermoelectric (CT) plant exhibit disadvantages due to their simple power cycle and the elevated initial investment costs. This suggests that coal-gasification based plants are the best alternatives for CO2 production for EOR and co-generated electrical power. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; Enhanced oil recovery; Exergy; Gasification; Power generation; Utilization and storage","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal gasification; Coal gasification plants; Coal industry; Costs; Exergy; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Metal recovery; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Petroleum industry; Precombustion; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Carbon sequestration; Coal based power plants; Direct compression; Energy and exergy efficiency; Enhanced oil recovery; High-pressure fluidized bed; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Plant characteristics; Enhanced recovery; carbon dioxide; coal-fired power plant; enhanced oil recovery; numerical model; particle size; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086940743

The current ammonia production route is very energy and carbon-intensive, relying greatly on natural gas both as feedstock as well as for heat and power generation within the plant. In the present work, a cradle-to-gate environmental assessment of conventional and greener hydrogen production routes integrated with ammonia synthesis is carried out according to ReCIPe impact assessment method. Hydrogen production through conventional steam methane reforming coupled with gas-liquid carbon dioxide absorption by amines and chilled ammonia, electrolysis, and iron-based chemical looping are analysed and compared. Mass and energy balances from process flow modelling are used as inputs for the environmental evaluation using Life Cycle Assessment. The system boundaries considered in this work include: i) main processes: ammonia production, hydrogen production, carbon dioxide separation; ii) upstream processes: nitrogen, natural gas, ilmenite, Methyl-DiEthanol-Amine, chilled ammonia and catalysts supply chains, iii) downstream processes: carbon dioxide compression, transport and storage, degradation/disposal of solvents/oxygen carrier. The results show that natural gas-based ammonia synthesis integrated with chemical looping hydrogen production gives the highest reduction in Global Warming Potential while six out of the nine investigated impact indicators (excluding Global Warming Potential) suffer an increase between 30% and 60%.

This raises serious concerns, mainly related to health problems due to particulate emissions from firewood combustion. Several initiatives have been considered by the Chilean government to address this, including heat electrification goals. In addition, the Chilean power system is undergoing a decarbonization process. This paper analyzes the impacts of firewood heat electrification over the Chilean power system's decarbonization process until 2044, based on a capacity expansion planning model and an estimation of firewood heat demand, to account for major changes in load shape and spatial distribution. The results show that there is a large increase in the power system total cost (ranging from 5.6% to 19.4%), with flexibility requirements becoming larger in the south. Technologies that strongly depend on local resource availability, such as wind and concentrated solar power, present changes in their systemic value, altering the need for storage and flexibility. Also, aspects such as household insulation, electrification efficiency, and smart heating technologies would significantly impact the process in terms of cost reduction and optimal generation mix. The policy implications for the Chilean power system are presented, within the broader discussion of the overall firewood problem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Energy systems integration; Firewood; Heat electrification; Power systems planning","Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Public policy; Solar energy; Capacity expansion planning; Concentrated solar power; Heating technology; Local resources; Low qualities; Optimal generation; Policy implications; Residential heating; Heating; combustion; electricity generation; energy planning; energy policy; heat source; power generation; power plant; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086505858

The relation between maternal and fetal mitochondrial function needs attention due to heritage. Objectives: To evaluate the use of the staining methods TetraMethylRhodamine Methyl Ester (TMRM) and Mitotracker Green (MTG) for flow cytometric measurements of umbilical cord blood mitochondrial function. Methods: 53 euthyroid at-term pregnant women and their offspring were included by blood collections. The offspring had blood drawn from the clamped umbilical cord. Flow cytometry with MTG, TMRM and Propidium Iodide were performed the following day. A cell count (antibody coating and flow cytometry) was performed for 9 maternal and cord samples. As a quality control, blood of 32 healthy donors was evaluated by flow cytometric analyzes same day as sampling and the following day to test stability of the measurements. Results: Cord mitochondrial measurements were lower than maternal. Maternal and cord mitochondrial function were positively correlated, especially reflected by MTG fluorescence-intensity (FI). Samples stored presented with very changed fluorescence patterns. However, the fluorescence intensity ratios MTG/TMRM of stained white blood cells were related within same day measurements, depicting an extensive and common bioenergetic cellular change. Conclusion: Cord blood flow cytometry by MTG- and TMRM- staining is possible with fluorescence intensity positively correlated to maternal fluorescence intensity. Storage of blood triggers mitochondrial dynamics. The methods are applicable with certain reservations, and they benefit from their non-invasive character compared to mitochondrial evaluation by muscle-biopsies. © 2020 Medisinsk Fysiologisk Forenings Forlag (MFFF).","cell death; Fetal blood; flow cytometry; membrane potential; mitochondria; mitochondrial; pregnancy","propidium iodide; tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; aldehyde; fluorescent dye; mitotracker green FM; rhodamine; adult; Article; cell composition; cell count; cell shape; cesarean section; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dead cell percentage; descriptive research; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy transfer; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence; fluorescence intensity; gestational age; granulocyte; human; leukocyte differential count; lymphocyte; major clinical study; maternal blood; mitochondrion; monocyte; newborn; observational study; pregnant woman; priority journal; progeny; umbilical cord blood; chemistry; cytology; energy metabolism; fetus blood; flow cytometry; male; mitochondrion; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; staining; Aldehydes; Cesarean Section; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fetal Blood; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mitochondria; Pregnancy; Propidium; Rhodamines; Staining and Labeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086425842

A comparative study illustrates the phases’ catalytic activity towards hydrogen production through electrochemical water reduction as well as hydrogen retrieval by hydrolysis of hydrogen storage materials (ammonia-borane and NaBH4). Charge separation between the Niδ+ and Pδ− sites in the various Ni–P phases plays a key role in achieving the desired efficacy of the catalytic reaction. Ni2P exhibited a significant enhancement towards the hydrogen evolution reaction, with an overpotential of 126 mV at J= 10 mA cm−2 in acid and 180 mV in alkaline. Ni12P5 was the most efficient catalyst, with a turnover frequency (TOF) = 23.0 min−1 for hydrogen evolution from ammonia-borane, and TOF= 17.3 min−1 from NaBH4, which is in accordance with noble metal nanoparticles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boron hydrides; Charge transfer; Electrocatalysis; Growth mechanism; HER; Hydrogen retrieval; Hydrogen storage","Ammonia; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis; Metal nanoparticles; Phosphorus compounds; Precious metals; Reduction; Sodium Borohydride; Catalytic reactions; Charge separations; Comparative studies; Efficient catalysts; Growth mechanisms; Hydrogen evolution; Hydrogen generations; Turnover frequency; Nickel compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086307470

X-irradiation generates free electrons and holes, some of which are trapped at lattice defects and impurities. Irradiation with visible (red) light frees the electrons from their traps and they can recombine with the trapped holes, with the energy of recombination appearing as blue luminescence from the europium ion. Although the electron trap is widely held to be a bromine vacancy, the nature of the hole trap is as yet undetermined. Here we report on the remarkable sharp-line photoluminescent emission of Eu2+ ions which appears below 50 K in activated europium-doped cesium bromide and comprises over 20 individually resolvable lines. These patterns of vibronics may give some insight into the nature of the hole trap. A detailed analysis shows that the vibronics comprise five separate patterns, but with a common vibrational frequency of ~123 cm−1. The vibronic patterns are attributed to Br2− molecular ions adjacent to the europium ion. An interpretation of the observed spectra in terms of a Eu2+-Eu3+ ion pair charge compensated by two cation vacancies and a substitutional O2− ion is discussed. © 2020 The American Ceramic Society","europium; fluorescence; hydrolysis; luminescence","Cesium compounds; Hole traps; Ions; Irradiation; Light emission; Phosphors; Trapped ions; X ray radiography; X rays; Blue luminescence; Cation vacancies; Defects and impurities; Photoluminescent emission; Radiographic imaging; Second generation; Vibronic spectra; X-ray storage phosphor; Europium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085660433

These new materials have potential application in many domains, as support materials, or microscaffolds for (photo)catalysis, biomedical materials, energy storage, or separation, etc. In order to achieve microspheres with the desired coexisting porosity, a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion is prepared, and phase separation between siloxane-rich domains and water-rich phase is promoted to occur within the aqueous droplets of the emulsion. No specific gelation promoting additives are employed in this work, contrary to other works present in the state of the art. Instead, the silane combination was selected to provide an inherent gelation capability, through the oxirane group of the epoxy silane employed. The obtained microspheres display a diameter and a characteristic size ranging from 26 to 130 µm and 149 ± 11 to 485 ± 38 nm, respectively, as well as a large amount of interconnected macropores, peaked at 164–405 nm, depending on the sample, i.e., on the hydrolysis and emulsification parameters. Longer hydrolysis time and lower hydrolysis pH were found to lead to smaller but more porous microspheres, and higher amount of surfactant was found to lead to smaller microspheres. The achieved microspheres are silica based, of hybrid nature with some organic epoxy functionality, if dried at 150 °C, or of inorganic nature, if heat treated at 700 °C.

Such molecules offer a promising solution for solar energy storage applications. Different molecular systems have been investigated for MOST applications, such as norbornadienes, azobenzenes, stilbenes, ruthenium derivatives, anthracenes, and dihydroazulenes. The polycyclic strained molecule norbornadiene (NBD), which photoconverts to quadricyclane (QC), is of great interest because it has a high energy storage density and the potential to store energy for a very long time. Unsubstituted norbornadiene has some limitations in this regard, such as poor solar spectrum match and low quantum yield. In the past decade, our group has developed and tested new NBD systems with improved characteristics. Moreover, we have demonstrated their function in laboratory-scale test devices for solar energy harnessing, storage, and release.This Account describes the most impactful recent findings on how to engineer key properties of the NBD/QC system (photochemistry, energy storage, heat release, stability, and synthesis) as well as examples of test devices for solar energy capture and heat release. While it was known that introducing donor-acceptor groups allows for a red-shifted absorption that better matches the solar spectrum, we managed to introduce donor and acceptor groups with very low molecular weight, which allowed for an unprecedented solar spectrum match combined with high energy density. Strategic steric hindrance in some of these systems dramatically increases the storage time of the photoisomer QC, and dimeric systems have independent energies barriers that lead to an improved solar spectrum match, prolonged storage times, and higher energy densities. These discoveries offer a toolbox of possible chemical modifications that can be used to tune the properties of NBD/QC systems and make them suitable for the desired applications, which can be useful for anyone wanting to take on the challenge of designing efficient MOST systems.Several test devices have been built, for example, a hybrid MOST device that stores sunlight energy and heat water at the same time. Moreover, we developed a device for monitoring catalyzed QC to NBD conversion resulting in the possibility to quantify a significant macroscopic heat generation. Finally, we tested different formulations of polymeric composites that can absorb light during the day and release the energy as heat during the night for possible use in future window coating applications. These lab-scale realizations are formative and contribute to pushing the field forward toward the real-life application of MOST systems. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088860844

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel heterostructure material of snowflake-like Co3O4 nanomaterials attaching on the tip of CuO nanorod arrays supported on three-dimensional copper foam via facile and effective approach. The obtained Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF has been used as efficient electrocatalyst for accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline condition, in which a very low overpotential of 340 mV, which was even lower than that of the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, was required to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm−2, together with a small Tafel slope value of 73.3 mV dec−1. The unique heterostructure and excellent mesoporous characteristic of the Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF materials were the main reasons for its large electrochemical active surface area. Furthermore, the Co3O4-CuO NRs/CF exhibited a much higher electrocatalytic activity than those of the CuO NRs/CF (384 mV at 20 mA cm−2, 139.6 mV dec−1) and Co3O4/CF (360 mV at 20 mA cm−2, 95.3 mV dec−1), as its courterparts. This deomstrated that formation of hetorostructure between snowflake Co3O4 and CuO NRs resulting in enhancing OER performance. In addition to excellent catalytic activity, this catalyst also showed remarkable stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction for at least 30 h under constant potential of 1.6 V in the alkaline condition. The highly catalytic performance for the OER reaction was ascribed to the merits of a unique heterostructure, 3D nanoarrays feature and the synergistic effect between Co3O4 and CuO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cobalt oxide; copper oxide; electrocatalyst; heteronanorods; oxygen evolution reaction","Catalyst activity; Copper oxides; Electrocatalysts; Energy conversion; Mesoporous materials; Nanorods; Oxygen; Ruthenium compounds; Snow; Alternative energy source; Catalytic performance; Effective approaches; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical active surface areas; Electrochemical oxygen; Heterostructure materials; Three-dimensional frameworks; Oxygen evolution reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086799397

However, the advent and diffusion of alternative fuel vehicle technologies could result in vehicle transport becoming a major energy load in urban energy systems in addition to heating and electricity. The building and personal transport sectors both have a large potential for CO2 emissions reductions, however the energy must come from mainly renewable sources. In this work, a multi-objective optimisation model is developed that considers a multi-energy system and minimises both the total cost and life-cycle emissions of both the buildings and vehicles. The model selects both the conversion and storage technologies that the community uses to produce electricity and heat, as well as vehicle powertrain types. The resulting Pareto solutions rely on transitions away from internal combustion engine vehicles to battery electric vehicles, and to a much lesser extent plug-in hybrid vehicles. The heating energy is decarbonised with a transition to heat pumps and away from gas boilers. The optimisation model is tested with 77 vehicles and 50 buildings, and results shows that the emission reductions could be as high as 79% by 2035 and 85% by 2050. © 2020","Decentralised energy systems; Multi-objective optimisation; Power-to-Mobility; Renewable energy sources; Storage technologies","Battery electric vehicles; Emission control; Life cycle; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Urban transportation; Alternative fuel vehicles; Emissions reduction; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life cycle emissions; Multi-energy systems; Optimisation models; Urban energy systems; Vehicle powertrains; Multiobjective optimization; alternative fuel; carbon emission; combustion; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy planning; engine; heating; multiobjective programming; optimization; storage structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086095397

However, the operational performance of such type of micro-grid system depends on many factors (e.g. techno-economic sizing, energy management among the sources, market energy prices dynamics, energy dispatch strategies, etc.). In this paper, a typical Indian institutional energy system has considered for techno-economic performance evaluation for operating as a smart micro-grid under market energy pricing dynamics. The institutional energy system has integrated PV, battery storage and DG for operating as a smart micro-grid. An operational energy dispatch strategy for micro-grid has proposed and evaluated for maximizing the local energy resources utilization with contemplation of peak demand and grid outage conditions under market energy pricing dynamics. With techno-economic sizing of PV, battery and DG of considered system; the peak demand has reduced by 10%, DG contribution by 92% and annual energy savings by 45% compare to operation of base system. With proposed energy management strategy, the annual battery energy throughput has increased from 0.4% to 10%, and the DG's contribution has decreased from 7% to 5% with 10% reduction in levelized cost of energy (CoE) compare to case with techno-economic sizing of PV, battery and DG for considered system. With inclusion of electrical energy pricing dynamics scenario, it has observed that the CoE has increased by 89% with change in time-of-use (ToU) tariff from 100% to 200% and considering energy-selling price to the grid at 100%. However, 8% reduction in the CoE has observed, when the energy-selling price to grid has increased from 100% to 200% at ToU of 100%. The results from this work are going to be useful for developing electrical tariff policies for promoting the PV based institutional micro-grid system under market energy pricing dynamics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management strategy; Market energy pricing dynamics; Smart micro-grid; Solar photovoltaic; Techno-economics","Battery storage; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Dynamics; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Annual energy savings; Battery energy storage; Energy management strategies; Operational performance; Resources utilizations; Solar photovoltaic system; Techno-economic evaluation; Time of use (TOU) tariffs; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083647384

Long-term indoor storage can sometimes cause the papers to adhere, which can result in the transfer of ink stamps or prints from paper to paper, subsequently, there emerges the need to remove these types of stains. Laser cleaning emerged as a promising technique for paper surface cleaning. This work presents the laser cleaning of a historical paper dated to the end of the 19th century using the Nd:YAG laser in a nanosecond pulsed regime, at two wavelengths, 532 and 1064 nm, a semiconductor laser in a continuous regime, at a 552 nm wavelength. The cleaned areas are observed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, spectrophotometry. The obtained results are discussed in terms of the laser cleaning efficiency characterized by several aspects. The results obtained by green and near-IR laser irradiation in pulsed and continuous regime are compared, showing favorable effects regardless of the laser wavelength. However, in some cases, laser cleaning at 1064 nm wavelength damaged the surface layer of the paper. Cleaning at 532 nm wavelength did not completely remove the ink, the ink traces were visible under the microscope or spectrometer. The proposed efficient cleaning method for stain, dust, stamp ink removal from historical papers includes a semiconductor laser at 552 nm, owing to the continuous action of its beam. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Infrared lasers; Neodymium lasers; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor lasers; Spectrometers; Surface cleaning; Ultrafast lasers; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Cleaning methods; Continuous actions; Future generations; Laser wavelength; ND : YAG lasers; Nd:YAG pulsed laser; Near-IR lasers; Non destructive; Pulsed lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094952143

Histological sections were stained with polychromic dye, whereas histochemical sections were stained for triglycerides and phospholipids (Sudan black) and for carbohydrates (Alcian blue). Spectrophotometric quantitation of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates was carried out in 5-35 mg dry weight (DW) samples. Larvae of Panopea globosa showed the typical linear shell growth rate (21 μm d-1) and allometric, power-type relationships between shell length and DW (exponent b = 2.73) or ash-free DW (b = 2.78). Early straight-hinged larvae exhibited a rudimentary digestive system. The crystalline style, intestine, and digestive gland were conspicuous when larvae reached the early umbonate stage, whereas the gills, foot, byssal gland, and adductor muscles were first observed in late umboned larvae. Triglycerides and carbohydrates were mainly stored as droplets in the digestive gland, and their size increased with increasing larval age. Acid mucopolysaccharides were also secreted by the byssal gland. Carbohydrate content was substantially higher than triglycerides in pediveliger larvae. These finding suggests that P. globosa larvae mainly rely on a carbohydrate-based metabolism, both as a biochemical component of the larval-postlarval byssus and as an endogenous energy source during metamorphosis. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

The upgrade of the CMS Muon Spectrometer foresees the installation of three new muon stations based on the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) technology, referred to as GE1/1, GE2/1 and ME0 detectors. While the installation and commissioning of the GE1/1 detectors is currently underway, the GE2/1 and ME0 detectors are expected to be installed between 2023 and 2027. The CMS Muon Collaboration has developed a novel construction design of large-area, trapezoidal-shaped GE1/1 triple-GEM detectors; in particular, a new self-stretching technique has been introduced to mechanically stretch the GEM-foils without using spacer grids or glue inside the gas volume in order to avoid dead regions (several percent) or possibly outgassing contaminants which could trigger premature aging processes. As it has been observed, the PCB boards, which define the gas enclosure of the detector, get deformed under the internal gas over-pressure, introducing irregularities in the planarity of the GE1/1 detector, which could potentially affect the uniformity of the detector performance. Therefore, the collaboration has established a set of tests and quality controls in order to quantify these irregularities and mitigate their impact on detector performance. Additionally, new solutions and design upgrades have been implemented to prevent such effects in future GE2/1 and ME0 upgrade projects. We will focus in particular on the novel design solutions based on the PCB distance holders (pillars), which the collaboration adopted for realization of the latter projects, and their impact on the performance of the detector, with a summary of the ongoing R&D activities. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Detector design and construction technologies and materials; Instrumentation for particle accelerators and storage rings-high energy (linear accelerators, synchrotrons); Micropattern gaseous detectors (MSGC, GEM, THGEM, RETHGEM, MHSP, MICROPIC, MICROMEGAS, InGrid, etc); Muon spectrometers","Charged particles; Particle accelerators; Detector performance; Gas electron multipliers; Large Hadron Collider; Mechanical design; Muon spectrometer; Novel construction; Premature aging; Stretching techniques; Electron multipliers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090879393

This study aims to identify optimal operation policies by maximizing the annual hydropower generation of a multi-reservoir system that consists of two reservoirs with different functions in flood risk management. These reservoirs, namely, Mosul and Badush, are located in the Tigris River, Northern Iraq. The Mosul Dam was constructed to protect the cities located downstream, and the Badush Dam is building to absorb flood waves in case the Mosul Dam collapses. The particle swarm optimization model for a single reservoir (PSOS) was formulated to determine optimal operation policies during real operation time to maximize annual hydroelectric generation. PSOS was approved during these operations and developed to specify ideal operation rules for a multi-reservoir system (PSOM), which consists of two reservoirs, through three modes of annual inflows. Results of PSOS indicated its superiority during real-time operation. The annual hydropower generation was achieved by the optimal operation rules of PSOM during the three styles of inflows. These optimal policies will provide good insights into the potential of this multi-reservoir system in supplying the national electricity network with hydropower energy, which is considered environmentally friendly, in addition to achieving the original goals of its construction. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Badush Reservoir; Hydropower generation; Iraq; Mosul Reservoir; Multi-reservoir system; Optimization model; Particle swarm; Tigris River","Flood control; Floods; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reservoir management; Risk management; Flood risk management; Hydro power production; Hydro-power generation; Hydroelectric generation; Multi-reservoir systems; Optimal operation policy; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Particle swarm optimization models; Reservoirs (water); algorithm; annual variation; electricity generation; flood control; hydroelectric power; optimization; water storage; Iraq; Mosul Reservoir; Ninawa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088044217

A stepped nanowire is proposed to pin DW and achieve high information storage capacity based on multibit per cell scheme. The DW speed is found to increase for thicker and narrower nanowires. For depinning DW from the stepped region, the current density Jdep is investigated with emphasis on device geometry and material intrinsic properties. The Jdep can be analytically determined as a function of the nanoconstriction dimension and the thickness of the nanowire. Furthermore, Jdep is found to exponential dependent on the anisotropy energy and saturation magnetization, offering thus more flexibility in adjusting the writing current for memory applications. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The 2D materials create extensive attention due to their novel electronic properties, large surface area, charging capacity, optical, biocompatible, unique physical and chemical properties. Many of these properties are an excellent requirement for an application of electrode for batteries and super-capacitors. The applications of 2D materials are not just confined to Opto and nano-electronics but a strong potential in gas, and biosensing technologies. The 2D materials are stackable through weak Van der Waals, therefore, used in alkali metal ion batteries as electrodes, this causes zero volume and area changes during the intercalation and deintercalation of alkali metal. Also, a large surface of 2D materials provides large storage capacity as compared to the bulk materials. The heterostructures based on 2D materials pay significant attention towards the optoelectronics, nanoelectronics and in alkali metal ion battery applications also. In this paper, we review the importance of heterostructure, stacking technique in interfacial synthesis, address their structural morphologies by the interface of 2D materials and its application for energy storage, gas, and biosensing applications.

In this study, carbonation efficiency for aqueous mineral carbonation (MC) was achieved through two steps, which include leaching of calcium from cement kiln dust (CKD) followed by the reaction of pure CO2 with the calcium hydroxide precipitates formed by the hydroxylation using NaOH. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the calcium leaching yield, while the carbonation efficiency from CKD was assessed using RSM with central composite design (CCD). Optimization of calcium leaching is highly important, as it is a rate-limiting reaction step in MC and also influences and enhances carbonation efficiency. Different parameters including acid concentration (HNO3), leaching temperature, leaching time, and dose of CKD sample were considered in order to optimize the maximum yield of Ca leaching from the CKD sample. In addition, different CO2 flow rates and temperatures were used as parameters for optimizing carbonation efficiency. Two quadratic regression models were developed for each process, i.e. calcium leaching and carbonation. For calcium leaching, a maximum of 98.55% calcium was extracted under the optimal set of acid concentration 4.13 M, 90 °C, 28 min leaching time, and 13.8 g of CKD sample. For carbonation, the maximum carbonation efficiency of 89.2% was achieved for a CO2 flow rate of 1163 cm3/min at 90 °C. Calcium leaching results indicate that the leaching yield was significantly affected by all the input parameters except leaching time. For carbonation, both factors affected the carbonation efficiency, with the effect temperature shown to be greater than that of the CO2 flow rate. Additionally, the predicted results agreed well with the experimental values for both calcium leaching and carbonation processes, with errors of less than 1% and 5%, respectively. © 2020, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc.","Box-Behnken design; Central composite design; Mineral carbonation; Modeling; Optimization; Response surface methodology","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Dust; Global warming; Hydrated lime; Kilns; Leaching; Lime; Minerals; Nitric acid; Regression analysis; Sodium hydroxide; Surface properties; Boxbehnken design (BBD); Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Central composite designs; Modeling and optimization; Quadratic regression; Rate-limiting reaction; Response surface methodology; Sustainable energy systems; Carbonation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086101530

It is often assumed automatically that the limitation of an energy budget or higher allocation to a single trait affect all life history traits. This assumption was inherently included in influential models of ontogenetic growth. We aim to challenge this perspective by focusing on growth in lizards. Summarizing the results of a series of long-term manipulative experiments in the Madagascar ground gecko (Paroedura picta), we show that although growth is generally assumed to be highly plastic in reptiles and other ectothermic vertebrates, it is at least in this species largely canalized and does not seem to be affected by energy limitations under several experimental conditions. Diet restriction, resulting in lower allocation to fat storage and reproduction, and the allocation to energetically demanding traits such as reproduction in both sexes and tail regeneration had little if any effect on structural growth. We document that sexual size dimorphism does not emerge in the ontogeny of the studied species directly due to differential allocation to structural growth in males and females. Instead, sex-specific growth trajectories are driven by a signaling of ovarian hormones as the key proximate mechanism shaping sex-specific allocation decisions during ontogeny. We suggest that the large degree of canalization of the structural growth can reflect hierarchy in energy allocation with the structural growth being prioritized to investment in other traits. The prioritized allocation to structural growth can reflect selective advantage of reaching a final, optimal size for a given sex as fast as possible. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy; Gonadal hormones; Growth; Reptiles; Sexual size dimorphism; Trade-offs","bioenergetics; energy budget; fitness; growth response; life history trait; lizard; natural selection; ontogeny; sexual dimorphism; signaling; Madagascar; Gekkonidae; Paroedura picta; Reptilia; Squamata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085501538

Despite this, vast amounts of renewable energy resources are geographically distributed across the region. SSA needs to establish proper planning mechanisms if it is to achieve universal access while mitigating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. This paper presents a scoping review of 30 integrated energy modeling studies that concern SSA. The review indicates that addressing the region's energy access challenges will require decentralized generation and grid extension to be employed in a synergistic way. Achieving high access levels while limiting GHG emissions will require energy decision makers to enact and implement climate, techno-economic, environmental, and efficiency policies. Additionally, technology learning and energy storage will improve the uptake of variable renewable resources. Operationalization of power trade will reduce the capital investment costs required to meet the current and future energy demand and tap into potential of the abundant renewable energy resources in SSA region. Energy planning using an integrated energy systems model will be key to achieving these aims at national as well as regional level. Accordingly, it is necessary that national governments and energy decision makers in the region work in tandem with energy stakeholders, local academic institutions, and international energy modeling experts to build local capacities. This will then enable a synchronized framework for the development of short-to medium-term national energy models, the results of which could then be integrated into a regional model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy planning; Energy systems modeling; GHG emission; Renewable energy; sub-Saharan Africa; Universal energy access","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Academic institutions; Capital investment; Decentralized generation; Energy decision makers; Integrated energy systems; National governments; Sub-saharan africa; Technology learning; Renewable energy resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085315621

Experiment 1 studied the effect of HMA stored barley at 29%, 35%, and 40% moisture and enzyme combination to define the optimum moisture level for the maximum nutrient solubility of barley. The ‘35% moisture’ was chosen for HMA storage of barley because this treatment (without or with enzymes) enhanced phytate degradation (31–73%) and the solubility of P (125–177%), nitrogen (N) (95–125%) and protein (56–68%) compared to dry storage (P < 0.05) and at the same time seemed to prevent a loss of energy and N (ammonia) by microbial fermentation. In Exp. 2, 6 female growing pigs (43 ± 2 kg) were used per diet (8 diets, 48 pigs) in a 12-d nutrient digestibility study to assess the effect of HMA stored barley at 35% moisture and enzyme combination on coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of P in barley fed alone or together with soybean meal (SBM). Also, HMA storage of barley at ‘35% moisture’ without and with enzyme combination enhanced phytate degradation (43–58%) and P solubility (2.5–3.3 fold) (P < 0.05). Thus, HMA stored barley (solely endogenous enzymes) enhanced CTTAD of P to almost the same extent as dry stored barley with enzyme combination (endogenous enzymes plus added enzymes) in the barley diet (45–49%) and the barley-SBM diet (15–25%) (P < 0.05). Adding the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley achieved the greatest increase of CTTAD of P in the barley diet (70%) and the barley-SBM diet (36%) (P < 0.05). The inclusion of the enzyme combination to HMA stored barley tended to enhance the calculated CTTAD of P of SBM (29%) compared with no enzyme combination (P = 0.06) due to the lower endogenous enzymes activity in HMA stored barley. It is necessary to add the enzyme combination to enhance P digestibility of SBM when fed together with HMA stored barley. Overall, HMA storage with enzyme combination is a potential method to enhance P digestibility of barley in pigs to reduce the dietary need for inorganic P addition and P excretion to the environment. © 2020 The Authors","Barley; Enzyme; High moisture airtight storage; Phosphorus digestibility; Phytate; Pig",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085301769

Male C57BL/6N mice were fed for 8 weeks a corn oil-based high-fat diet (cHF) alone or cHF-based diets containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (~3%; wt/wt), admixed either as a concentrate of re-esterified triacylglycerols (ω3TG) or Krill oil containing mainly phospholipids (ω3PL). Lean controls were fed a low-fat diet. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), parameters of glucose homeostasis, adipose tissue function, and plasma levels of N-acylethanolamines, monoacylglycerols and fatty acids were determined. Feeding cHF induced obesity and worsened (~4.3-fold) insulin sensitivity as determined by clamp. Insulin sensitivity was almost preserved in ω3PL but not ω3TG mice. Compared with cHF mice, endogenous glucose production was reduced to 47%, whereas whole-body and muscle glycogen synthesis increased ~3-fold in ω3PL mice that showed improved adipose tissue function and elevated plasma adiponectin levels. Besides eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids, principal component analysis of plasma fatty acids identified palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7) as the most discriminating analyte whose levels were increased in ω3PL mice and correlated negatively with the degree of cHF-induced glucose intolerance. While palmitoleic acid from Krill oil may help improve glucose homeostasis, our findings provide a general rationale for using omega-3 PUFA-containing phospholipids as nutritional supplements with potent insulin-sensitizing effects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","C57BL/6 mice; High-fat diet; Insulin resistance; Krill oil; Omega-3 PUFA; Palmitoleate","adiponectin; docosapentaenoic acid; edible oil; glucose; icosapentaenoic acid; insulin; monoacylglycerol; omega 3 fatty acid; palmitoleic acid; phospholipid; protein kinase B; triacylglycerol; glucose; monounsaturated fatty acid; palmitoleic acid; phospholipid; vegetable oil; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; body weight gain; cholesterol esterification; controlled study; diet supplementation; diet therapy; drug efficacy; energy balance; fatty acid blood level; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; glycogen synthesis; human; hypolipemia; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; krill; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; dietary supplement; homeostasis; insulin resistance; metabolism; mouse mutant; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Glucose; Homeostasis; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Phospholipids; Plant Oils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084365467

This emerging electricity generation elasticity could be used to optimize aggregator load profile by altering real-time demand of a power network, particularly in the premises of a massively EVs surrounded grid. In this paper, we have proposed a demand response algorithm to optimize vehicle to grid (V2G) aggregation, by enabling EVs scheduled charging/discharging, in quest to minimize the energy cost for the retailer, as well as satisfying the electricity market, i.e., day-ahead and instantaneous real-time markets. We have employed a decentralized approach in our proposed scheme, which is accessible, allows fast convergence, and assures consumers’ privacy. The simulation results show that our proposed technique significantly reduces the energy cost, explicitly for a retailer who tends to optimize the power network by penetrating an efficient algorithm. In addition, our algorithm shows more relevance when the grid leniently manages several intermittent energy generation resources. Practically the real-time load variations are uncertain, and are difficult to control, which increases the power and cost variations, and some time ends up as complete system failure. By using this algorithm the energy retailers can offer reliable service and suitable tariffs to consumers, to prove relevancy by restricting such constraints. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Demand response; Electric vehicles (EVs); Energy retailers; Power blackouts; Power generation; Smart grid; Vehicle to grid (V2G)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084142083

The allocation problem under investigation is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming, which is then decomposed, due to its complexity, and solved as two interdependent problems with the help of deterministic and metaheuristic techniques. We propose an allocation algorithm that jointly aims at optimizing the allocation of individualized green energy resources to simultaneously power the BSs with the grid as well as minimizing the overall system costs. Cost minimization is achieved by selecting the optimal types and sizes of the used photovoltaic (PV) panels and batteries in addition to optimally scheduling the charging and discharging of the selected batteries. This is done while limiting PV curtailment and any expected loss of cellular services at the times of power outage. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through the simulation of a sample case of a typical BS where Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to account for the uncertainty of the output of the PV panels and the grid failures. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Base stations; Battery energy storage; Cellular service provider; Outages; Photovoltaic","Energy policy; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Markov chains; Mobile telecommunication systems; Monte Carlo methods; Nonlinear programming; Outages; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Wireless networks; Allocation algorithm; Allocation problems; Cost minimization; Markov chain monte carlo simulation; Meta-heuristic techniques; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Optimal allocation; Photovoltaic panels; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084091347

The LUT Energy System Transition model, a high temporal - spatial resolution linear optimisation tool, is used to model an energy system transition from 2015 to 2050 for the case of Bangladesh. Four scenarios aimed at analysing different energy policies were created in order to replicate the present and alternative renewable energy based policies, with and without greenhouse gas emissions costs. The results show that emissions costs accelerate the transition towards a fully renewable energy system, however, removing these costs does not significantly affect the energy system, as renewables would still contribute 94% of the electricity generation by 2050. The Current Policy Scenario increases electricity and greenhouse gas emissions costs significantly especially, starting in 2025. The results indicate that countries like Bangladesh are prone to serious and complicated national risks that lead to several vulnerabilities like high electricity costs, increase in greenhouse gas emissions, energy insecurity and poor political trust, if present energy policies are pursued.

The boron substitution on Zeolite Templated Carbon vacancy is characterized by the formation of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Moreover, the boron substitution can be considered as a promising way for hydrogen storage, this way boron substitution is used on Zeolite Templated Carbon vacancy in order to create an active site for metallic decoration. Once that we develop a Boron substitution on Zeolite Templated Carbon vacancy, the decoration with Lithium, Sodium, and Calcium atoms is also carried out. The analysis reveals that the Na decoration has the best performance for hydrogen storage. The results show that boron substitution on Zeolite Templated Carbon vacancy decorated with 3 Sodium atoms can adsorb up to fifteen hydrogen molecules (5 hydrogen molecules per Sodium atom), this gives a gravimetric storage capacity of 6.55 % wt., which is enough for meeting DOE gravimetric targets. In addition, the average binding energies and adsorption energies are calculated in the range 0.2298–0.2144 eV/H2, which constitute desirable energies for hydrogen adsorption. Besides, the hydrogen adsorption process is carried out by electrostatic interaction between the Na cation and the induced H2 dipole. The calculation performed in this work reveals that the boron substitution on Zeolite Templated Carbon vacancy decorated with Na atoms is a good candidate as a medium for hydrogen storage. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Active site; Alkali metallic decoration; Boron substitution; Hydrogen adsorption; Zeolite templated carbon vacancy","Atoms; Binding energy; Boron; Carbon; Gas adsorption; Molecules; Sodium; Zeolites; Adsorption energies; Average binding energy; Calcium atom; DFT calculation; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen molecule; Storage capacity; Zeolite templated carbons; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085545277

The organic D-π-A interlayer primarily improves the perovskite's crystallinity and creates a smoother perovskite/HTM interface, while reducing the grain boundary defects and inducing an energy level alignment with the adjacent layers. Champion power conversion efficiencies (PCE) as high as 18.5% were obtained, clearly outperforming the reference devices. Interestingly, the D35-based solar cells present superior stability since they preserved 83% of their initial efficiency after 37 days of storage under dark and open circuit (OC) conditions. The obtained results consolidate the multifunctional role of organic D-π-A molecules as perovskite interface modifiers towards performance enhancement and scale-up fabrication of robust PSCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cell engineering; Chromophores; Crystallinity; Grain boundaries; Perovskite; Energy level alignment; Grain-boundary defects; Interface engineering; Interface modifiers; Organic chromophores; Performance enhancements; Photo-voltaic efficiency; Power conversion efficiencies; Perovskite solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088493151

TS women are also susceptible to a range of chronic disorders including arterial hypertension (AHT), osteoporosis, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and thyroid disease. The association between dysmorphism/body disproportion and chronic disease has never been studied in TS women. The effect of growth hormone treatment on body disproportion is also unclear. Objectives: to analyze dysmorphic features and body disproportion in TS women in relation to the presence of chronic disease and to document the effect of growth hormone therapy on body disproportion. Method: 76 adult TS women with a regular follow up at the TS clinic UZ Ghent were invited to participate. Detailed body measurements were performed in 44 volunteering TS women. Scoring systems for overall dysmorphism, craniofacial dysmorphism, thoracic and limb abnormalities and skeletal disproportion were developed. Results: TS women with a higher dysmorphism score were more at risk for AHT (p = 0.04) as well as those with a higher sitting height/standing height ratio (p < 0.05). Prevalence of AHT, osteoporosis and DM 2 was lower in TS women treated with GH during childhood (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Adult TS women with relatively short legs or with more physical dysmorphic stigmata were more at risk for AHT. GH therapy does not seem to increase the risk of chronic disease on the long term. © 2019, © 2019 Acta Clinica Belgica.","Body disproportion; chronic diseases; dysmorphism; GH; Ullrich-Turner syndrome","adult; anthropometric parameters; anthropometry; Article; auditory screening; Belgian; birth weight; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; bone density; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; chronic disease; clinical article; disease severity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; face dysmorphia; female; follow up; gene mutation; genotype; hip circumference; hormonal therapy; human; hypertension; karyotype; lipid storage; monosomy; neck circumference; osteoporosis; perception deafness; physical activity; prevalence; risk factor; scoring system; Turner syndrome; waist circumference; adolescent; body height; craniofacial malformation; flatfoot; funnel chest; growth disorder; hypertension; metacarpal bone; metatarsal bone; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteoporosis; pathophysiology; perception deafness; risk factor; severity of illness index; thyroid disease; Turner syndrome; young adult; human growth hormone; Adolescent; Adult; Body Height; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Flatfoot; Funnel Chest; Growth Disorders; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Hypertension; Metacarpal Bones; Metatarsal Bones; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Thyroid Diseases; Turner Syndrome; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065088753

Knowledge of the fluidic and thermal behavior of normal-conducting magnets for particle accelerators, as well as a correct design of their cooling system are very important for obtaining optimal parameters in the operation of these magnets. Therefore, in this paper an analysis of the fluidic and thermal behavior of normal-conducting magnets was performed. This analysis highlighted the steps to be followed and the main parameters to be considered in the design process of the normal-conducting magnets cooling system. Also, the analysis aimed to determine the cooling fluid flow required to evacuate the heat dissipated on the magnet excitation circuit. Starting from the performed analysis, the total pressure losses on the HESR sextupole magnet cooling circuit were determined by analytical calculation, by numerical simulations and by measurements.

In order to prepare the most appropriate development plan, each country relied mainly on the cost curve marginal (Marginal Abatement cost-MAC) with optimal economic techniques to make the investment policy. In this study, the cost of electricity in the Vietnam power system is optimized by implementing a technical-economic optimization model solved hourly with 81 nodes, supported by a validated whether-converter renewable power generation data set and electricity demand data set. Numerical results indicate that these flexibility components can lead to a reduction in RES, allow a higher solar photovoltaics (PV) share with a factor of two and help meet electricity demand.

Controlled formation of perovskite crystal during the preparation process is key to achieving better morphological features, thereby influencing the material’s properties. In this paper, we examined the impact of two synthesis techniques as well as new material composition on the properties of the perovskite materials. These perovskite materials were produced by one-and two-step solution processes and the kinetics of the composition of perovskite were characterized by the following techniques: UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermo gravimetric analysis. The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry using the two-electrode system. All samples exhibited an absorption onset around 850 nm which corresponded well with the energy gap (∼1.55 eV). The two-step process resulted in smooth XRD patterns, hence exhibiting improved crystallinity owing to sharper peaks than those from one-step process. The sample crystallite sizes ranged of 44–81 nm. We conclude that two synthesis techniques together with new materials composition showed better thermal stability compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltam-metry indicated that the perovskite electrodes exhibited stable electrochemical performance and easy charge transfer during the reaction. Our results suggest better electrochemical properties with possible capacitance which is beneficial for energy storage devices. © 2020 by American Scientific Publishers.

In the present work, the adsorptions of single and multiple CO molecules on pristine and transition metal (TM = Fe-, Ru-, and Os)-doped SWCNT were investigated in terms of geometric, energetic, and electronic properties using density functional theory calculation. Calculated results display that the adsorption of CO molecule on the SWCNTs is energetically favorable. The TM-doped SWCNT are more highly interactive to CO adsorption than that of pristine SWCNT. An Os-doped SWCNT displays the strongest interaction with single and multiple CO molecules comparing with the Fe- and Ru-doped SWCNT. The TM doping on SWCNT can induce the charge transfer between CO molecule and the SWCNT. The energy gap and density of state are clearly changed when CO molecule interacts with TM-doped SWCNT, resulting in dramatic changes of their electronic properties. Therefore, TM-doped SWCNT are possibly used as potential CO storages/absorbents or sensor material for CO detection in the environment.

The second phase consisted in the implementation of an energy management algorithm to manage the energy flows of the grid-connected photovoltaic-battery installation. Therefore, five operating scenarios were introduced in an attempt to maximize self-consumption, control the battery safety, and minimize the load consumption from the grid. Three home consumption profiles were implemented in this study (5 KVA,10 KVA, and 17 KVA). Optimal battery capacity value for each load was obtained using an optimization algorithm. Results of the energy management algorithm confirmed that the self-consumption improvement, the battery protection, and the continuity of load supply.

Up to now, standalone Photovoltaic Generator (PVG) installation connected to a storage bank is used extensively. However, climactic changes may cause supply disturbances for the installation. The present paper proposes an algorithm of loads operation planning, by means of a relay unit, of a PVG/Battery installation composed of three load types: light, water pump and cold room. The planning strategy was based on the PVG generation dynamic forecast using least squares approach. Starting at sunrise, the generated energy was forecasted based on the outcome of the last 15 days. Then, the energy prediction process was adjusted every 15 min depending on the amount of energy being really generated. The planning algorithm was meant first to guarantee the continuous supply of power for the cold room and second to insure the dispatching of the rest of the energy supply to support lighting (at night-time) or the water pump (during the daytime). Optimization criteria were considered in order to ensure battery protection and a maximum utilization of the generated energy. The obtained results proved the respect of the pre-fixed criteria during both perturbed and stable days, a battery safety with an SOC above 28%, and a cold room being constantly supplied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy optimization; Load supply planification; PVG generation dynamic forecast; PVG/battery installation","Electric equipment protection; Electric load management; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Dynamic forecasting; Least-squares approach; Operation planning; Optimization criteria; Photovoltaic installation; Planning algorithms; Planning strategies; Use of renewable energies; Installation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085236080

Such communities may not have access to electricity, cooling, and purified water, or may require diesel-powered generators for such requirements. Mini- or micro-hydroelectric plants can be the core of facilities to meet these needs where there are sufficiently large rivers and favourable terrain. Such systems have advantages over solar or wind power in having minimal short-term fluctuations that necessitate the use of storage or back-up systems. Part of the power can be drawn off for drinking water purification or ice production. However, during drought, these facilities can suffer from a drop in output, in which case decision support would be needed to determine the optimal abnormal operating state during the crisis. A fuzzy P-graph approach is developed to determine the optimal solution in consideration of multiple product demands. Membership functions of the product demands are used to calibrate the degree of tolerable shortage based on community needs. The methodology is illustrated with a case study of a system operating under drought conditions. Results show that having a twin turbine MHP reduces the need to use a diesel back-up system, except in cases of extreme drought. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abnormal operations; Fuzzy optimization; Microhydropower; Off-grid system; P-graph; Renewable energy","Decision support systems; Diesel engines; Drought; Potable water; Purification; Wind power; Abnormal operation; Diesel powered generator; Drinking water purification; Drought conditions; Hydroelectric plant; Multiple products; Off-grid renewable energy systems; Remote communities; Membership functions; alternative energy; drinking water; drought; electricity; fuzzy mathematics; methodology; operations technology; optimization; purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084226030

Previous studies have provided insights into specific subjects, yet integrated perspectives on the development of the two waterbodies are missing. To this end, we conducted a bibliometric analysis as a systematic data gathering to perform a large-scale overview and assess global trends of their scientific publications. Moreover, a second goal is to differentiate their research hotspots and current challenges given the different nature of their origin and functionality. 147,811 publications from 1955 to 2019 were retrieved from the database of the Science Citation Index Expanded, and then, divided into four research lines, (1) design and operation; (2) environment and ecology; (3) sanitation and human health; (4) socioeconomics. Bibliometric indicators showed that the number of publications sustained a rapid growth, from 100 during the 1950s to around 7800 publications per year during the past few years. The United States and EU 28 have long been world leaders in lake and reservoir research yet China has tremendously boosted its publications within the past 20 years, advancing this nation to the new world leader in both categories in 2019. Taking a closer look at research hotspots, design and operation have been the main topics for reservoir research while environment and ecology topics are the hotspots in lakes-related studies. This reflected the intensive human interventions in reservoirs, whose major purposes are to supply hydropower energy, irrigation, water storage, and aquaculture. Conversely, the impacts of eutrophication, heavy metals, and climate change have become more severe with the increase of species extinction and biodiversity loss, leading to urgent needs for lake restoration. Both freshwater bodies show comparable attention on their roles in socioeconomics while much higher concerns about sanitation and human health have been paid in reservoirs compared to its counterpart. Clear obtained distinctions in the hotspots and challenges of lake and reservoir research can contribute to better decision support systems of the two waterbodies. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Lakes; Research hotspots; Reservoirs; Scientometrics; Text mining",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084199182

Gain-cell embedded DRAM (GC-eDRAM) is an alternative to SRAM due to its high density, low power consumption, and two-ported functionality. However, GC-eDRAM requires periodic refresh cycles to maintain its data due to its dynamic storage mechanism. The refresh operation is typically handled at a memory controller level, resulting in an energy overhead and limited memory availability. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the realization of the refresh operation using an internal refresh mechanism, which supports an efficient row-wise refresh operation within a single clock cycle, providing 100% write access availability at a reduced refresh latency and power. An 8 kbit GC-eDRAM array with integrated internal refresh and replica bit-line was implemented, demonstrating up-to 30% reduced refresh latency and 65% reduced read energy at a low cost of 2.4% array area overhead, compared to a conventional GC-eDRAM array without internal refresh capabilities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Embedded DRAM; Gain cells; Internal refresh; SRAM","Dynamic random access storage; Dynamic storage; Embedded memory; Energy overheads; Low-power consumption; Memory controller; Refresh mechanism; Single-clock-cycle; Static random access memory; Static random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084077515

However, full ripening may not be achieved and storage of the moist beans by crimping and ensiling provides an economic alternative to drying, and is well suited for animal feeding. The objectives of the current experiment were to evaluate the effects of moisture content and various silage additives on the fermentation quality, aerobic stability and fate of bioactive compounds of ensiled crimped faba beans in a pilot scale ensiling experiment. Faba beans were combine harvested at moisture level of 443 g/kg and crimped prior to ensiling. The following additive treatments were applied using three replicates: 1) control (CON), 2) two commercial lactic acid bacteria inoculants as mixture (LABmix), 3) In-house LAB inoculant (LABLuke), 4) Formic acid based product (FA) and 5) Salt based product (Salt). Further, two of the additive treatments were prepared with additional moisture: 6) Control with tap water addition (CON + w) and 7) LABmix with tap water addition (LABmix + w). The beans ensiled without additive showed elevated pH, butyric acid and ethanol concentrations and proportion of ammonia N in total N. Addition of water further decreased the fermentation quality. The LAB inoculants improved the fermentation quality of the beans compared to CON. The fermentation was effectively restricted when FA was used. Both LAB and chemical additives improved aerobic stability compared to CON and Salt was especially effective in improving aerobic stability. Vicine disappeared totally during the ensiling period and also convicine was effectively degraded. It seems that promoting microbial activity in the silo either by LAB inoculation or increased moisture promoted the degradation of convicine, while chemical additives decreased the degradation of it. Total and particularly soluble proanthocyanidins were also degraded during the ensiling period.

The system uses a battery energy storage system (BESS) as an adjustable power source in order to obtain a better energy balance for frequency control purposes. The configuration of the electrical network in remote or electrically remote areas makes the MG more vulnerable to the intermittency of renewable energy sources and the dynamic of the loads. For this reason, frequency regulation must be reinforced by elements that can be dispatched by a control center. The function of the proposed DMS improves the operation of the distribution network by managing the charge and discharge times of the energy stored in the BESS, maintaining a limited control of the frequency and activating the remedial solutions for major energy imbalances. In this work, the performance of the DMS applied to an interconnected electrical system is presented. The results show the viability of the proposed DMS for MG under different operating conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Battery energy storage system; Distribution management system; Frequency control; Weak microgrid","Battery storage; Electric frequency control; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage systems; Charge and discharge; Different operating conditions; Distribution management systems; Electrical networks; Frequency regulations; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082700990

A more accurate numerical tool is essential for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic disease in arteries. In particular, in small vessels or vessels with stenosis and aneurysms, the elastic effects of blood should not be neglected. Since these are regions with high velocity gradients, the storage and release of elastic energy from red blood cells and the constant changes in shear rate have a demarked impact on the flow. Although the importance of the viscoelastic property is well emphasized in the literature, only a restrict set of authors have considered this property in their hemodynamic simulations. Thus, the aim of the present work is to go further and implement several viscoelastic models for blood in user-defined-functions of ANSYS software, in order to conclude which model is the most accurate for further applications. The Generalized Oldroyd-B (GOB) model, a quasi-linear model, and two non-linear models, the Multi-mode Giesekus and Simplified Phan-Thien/ Tanner (sPTT) models, were implemented. For right coronary arteries, velocity and wall shear stress were compared, considering a purely shear-thinning model, Carreau model, and the implemented viscoelastic models. An overall reduction of the velocity in regions of higher velocity gradients was observed, considering the non-linear viscoelastic multi-mode models (Giesekus and sPTT). Moreover, the difference in peak wall shear stress values considering these multi-mode viscoelastic models is close to half the magnitude (51%) of Carreau model solutions. Despite different arteries and hemodynamic conditions, the present results are in accordance with those found in the literature. The sPTT model should be the preferential option for further applications, since Giesekus model introduces the second normal stress difference, which so far has not been reported for blood. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blood rheology; Hemodynamics; Non-linear models; Numerical implementation; User-defined functions; Viscoelasticity","Application programs; Blood vessels; Diagnosis; Elasticity; Hemodynamics; Nonlinear systems; Shear flow; Shear stress; Shear thinning; Velocity; Viscoelasticity; Blood rheology; High velocity gradients; Non-linear model; Normal stress difference; Numerical implementation; Right coronary artery; User Defined Functions; Viscoelastic properties; Blood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082382270

Model-based simulation and optimization is one of the best ways to analyze system's performance under load fluctuations at the initial design stages. Therefore, in the current study, seasonal transient simulations of an Integrated Absorption Desiccant System are carried out using TRNSYS to handle sensible (10.94 kW peak) and latent (4.44 kW peak) cooling load separately. Radiant cooling with chilled water from an absorption chiller mainly handles sensible cooling load, while the latent load is achieved by a solid desiccant dehumidification system. Initially, key components of the system are modeled in TRNSYS including a flat plate solar collector system, desiccant wheel, heat recovery wheel, and absorption chiller. Afterwards, the integrated model is coupled with GenOpt to optimize the solar fraction and thermal coefficient of performance by varying collector area, flow rate in the collector loop, flow rate in load side loop, and volume of storage tank. The resulted optimized value of solar fraction is 57.50%, and COPth is 0.55 for standalone absorption system, whereas the solar fraction of 56.20%, COPth of 1.52 are achieved for IADS. In addition, the effects of load variation in terms of sensible to latent load ratio on regeneration heat required for both IADS and conventional desiccant system are also analyzed. A critical value of load ratio of 0.75 is also observed in terms of heat regeneration requirements to compare the both systems.

Photovoltaic (PV) systems are commonly used as a sustainable energy source to economize DG fuel. Due to the intermittent and fluctuating behavior of PV generators, energy storage systems (ESS) such as electrochemical battery are suggested. PV and ESS are usually connected using one inverter/charger called hybrid inverter. The power management is crucial to optimize the fuel consumption and operate efficiently ESS. Additionally, in an off-grid operation, the microgrid frequency becomes sensible due to the slow dynamic of DG which requires an additional control tool to improve the frequency regulation. This paper proposes a new power management based on Mamdani fuzzy logic. The proposed controller considers the targets mentioned above by only controlling the hybrid inverter. Simulation results prove that fuzzy-based controller reduces the DG fuel consumption by more than 12% compared to classical hysteresis management control. Moreover, the proposed controller performs efficiently regarding the conventional frequency regulation, which is widely used in microgrid control. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","DG; Diesel generator; Electrochemical battery; Mamdani fuzzy logic; Photovoltaic; Power management; PV","Computer circuits; Diesel engines; Electric inverters; Fuels; Fuzzy logic; Power management; Diesel generators; Electrochemical batteries; Energy storage systems; Frequency regulations; Mamdani; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic systems; Sustainable energy sources; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070975258

A key enabling factor is the effective synthesis of active materials, which, due to the global environmental circumstances and the growing demand, we must ensure are made sustainably. Thus, we unveil a rapid, sustainable, and scalable electrosynthesis route for a whole range of nanocrystalline materials with bright prospects for batteries, solar fuels and fuel cells, among others. For the proof of concept of the synthesis method, gas-diffusion electrocrystallization (GDEx), we synthesize manganese and cobalt oxides and hydroxides: Co-doped Na-birnessite, cubic/tetragonal spinels and layered double hydroxides (CoMn-LDH), owing to their current relevance. An oxygen depolarizing gas-diffusion electrode is used to fuel the oxidative synthesis at the electrochemical interface. Aside from the necessary metal precursors, all reagents are produced in situ with high efficiency. To elucidate the synthesis mechanism, a broad range of materials were produced under the same conditions. By changing the Co and Mn concentrations in the feed solution, the composition (Co/Mn stoichiometry), morphology (spinels vs. nanosheets), structure (tetragonal/cubic-spinel, birnessite, LDH), particle size (15-35 nm), crystallinity (polycrystalline particles vs. single-crystals), and phase purity were precisely tailored. A comprehensive library of nanostructures was built, wherein some materials exhibited outstanding catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction, illustrating the significance of our strategy. To showcase the versatility of the method, we also prove the feasibility for sodium intercalation capacity in the materials, applicable to batteries.

By probing the nature and morphology of solid products generated in function of reaction conditions we find that the crystalline Cu(NH4)MoS4 nanorod is first generated at ambient conditions. The nanorod is then converted into Cu2MoS4 nanotube under hydrothermal treatment due to the Kirkendall effect or a selective etching of the Cu2MoS4 core. Extending the hydrothermal treatment causes a collapse of nanotube generating Cu2MoS4 nanoplate. The catalytic activities of these sulfides are investigated. The Cu2MoS4 shows superior catalytic activity to that of Cu(NH4)MoS4. Catalytic performance of the former largely depends on its morphology. The nanoplate shows superior catalytic activity to the nanotube, thanks to its higher specific electrochemical surface area. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, recent computational studies by density functional theory (DFT) applied for simulations of MOF structure and complex architecture determination, prediction of properties, and computational characterization, including large-scale screening and geometrical properties of hypothetical MOFs, diffusion and adsorption processes in MOFs, are reviewed. DFT calculations have been applied in the MOF area to study chemical stability; mechanical, photophysical, optical, and magnetic properties; photoluminescence; porosity; and semiconductor or metallic character. The prediction of MOF analogs with open-metal sites, studies of chemical bonding and the prediction of energies by quantum mechanics allows reducing experimental efforts in the creation of MOF/polymer membranes, adsorbents for CO2 uptake, separation of C2H2/CH4, C2H2/CO2, and inert gases, radionuclides sequestration, and water adsorption, as well as other promising advances. For the MOF-derived carbons, a lack of profound DFT investigations is currently observed, being mainly restricted to the electrocatalysis area (nitrogen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction), resulting applications in batteries and other storage devices, CO2 sequestration, and absorbance of organic substances. © 2020 Materials Research Society.",,"Adsorption; Catalysis; Chemical bonds; Chemical stability; Computation theory; Electrocatalysis; Forecasting; Gas permeable membranes; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Hydrogen storage; Inert gases; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metals; Organometallics; Oxygen evolution reaction; Quantum theory; Virtual storage; Adsorption process; Complex architectures; Computational studies; Geometrical property; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nitrogen reduction; Organic substances; Structures and properties; Density functional theory",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087075555

There is growing interest in these systems, as they can offer solutions for electrification of remote areas, deployment of distributed renewable energy resources, and decarbonization of electricity supply. However, the potential benefits of microgrids in terms of climate change mitigation have not yet been thoroughly assessed. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment was performed to determine the climate change impact of integrating a solar microgrid system in western Sweden into the Swedish electricity grid. To determine whether replacement of grid electricity with electricity from the microgrid can lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, average and marginal GHG emission factors (EFs) for electricity use were estimated with explicit spatial and temporal resolution, using historical data on electricity generation and trade, and life cycle EFs for electricity generation technologies. The assessment, with both marginal and average EFs, showed that integration of the microgrid into the Swedish electricity grid did not provide GHG emissions abatements, as the electricity from the microgrid displaced grid electricity with lower carbon intensity. It was found that a microgrid without batteries would have lower climate change impact, but would still fail to lower overall GHG emissions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the methodological approach used for estimation of EFs and the definition of spatial boundaries could influence the obtained results. © 2020 The Author(s)","Average emission factors; Climate change; Life Cycle Assessment; Marginal emission factors; Solar microgrid","Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Microgrids; Renewable energy resources; Virtual storage; Climate change mitigation; Distributed electricity generation; Distributed renewable energy resources; Electricity generation; Electricity-generation technology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methodological approach; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; climate effect; electricity generation; electrification; energy resource; life cycle analysis; plant by life cycle; solar power; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083367565

Molecular modeling and simulations are invaluable tools, extensively used over the last two decades for the study of various properties of MOFs. In particular, Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been employed for the study of the gas uptake capacity of several MOFs at a wide range of different thermodynamic conditions. Despite the accurate predictions of molecular simulations, the accurate characterization and the high-throughput screening of the enormous number of MOFs that can be potentially synthesized by combining various structural building blocks is beyond present computer capabilities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the use of an alternative approach, namely one based on an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) architecture that is capable of training machine learning and statistical predictive models for MOFs’ chemical properties and estimate their predictive performance with confidence intervals. The architecture tries numerous combinations of different machine learning (ML) algorithms, tunes their hyper-parameters, and conservatively estimates performance of the final model. We demonstrate that it correctly estimates performance even with few samples (<100) and that it provides improved predictions over trying a single standard method, like Random Forests. The AutoML pipeline democratizes ML to non-expert material-science practitioners that may not know which algorithms to use on a given problem, how to tune them, and how to correctly estimate their predictive performance, dramatically improving productivity and avoiding common analysis pitfalls.

Efficiency parameters are pointed, and a parametric optimization method is adopted to design the system with maximum conceivable efficiency. In the first part, the selection of refrigerant for heat transportation in SWH loop is presented. A set of 15 working fluids are chosen, and their chemical properties are computed using NIST standard software (REFPROP). The selected working fluids are tested in the system under study and plots for energy gain and temperature are plotted using TRNSYS. Results showed that ammonia (NH3) having specific heat 4.6kJ/kg-K and fluid thermal conductivity 2.12 kJ/hr-m supplies peak energy gain of 7500 kJ/h in winter and 8900 kJ/h in summer season along 120 °C temperature rise. On the other hand, R-123 having specific heat 0.65kJ/kg-K and fluid thermal conductivity 0.0293kJ/hr-m showed inferior performance during the simulation.

In this work, it has been particularly shown that the direct growth of all-inorganic, metal halide microcrystals free of ligands, provides high-performance and stable electrodes for Li-air batteries. We describe a very simple and rapid method to synthesize well-crystalline and ultra-stable, at both ambient and aqueous conditions, CsPbBr3 microcubes, exhibiting prominent electrochemical performance. In particular, it is shown that during the successive scans in which the Li-ions intercalate and deintercalate, the microcubes-based anodes showed a high specific capacity of 549 mAh·g−1 and operation durability up to 1500 cycles. The large interfacial area between the perovskite electroactive material and the electrolyte along with the increase of the active sites on the exposed microcubes facets favor the Li-ions intercalation.

Anaerobic digestion technology (AD) for biogas production has an important role in achieving circular economy goals, as it may not only recover the energy contained in the biomass but also contribute to nutrient recovery and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The expansion of biogas production promotes the need for assessment of the technical potential of biomass, which is available for biogas production and is not in the competition with other purposes. This research work presents a Geographical Information System (GIS) based approach for the assessment of the spatial distribution of the biogas production potential by taking into consideration seasonal variation of biomass production, in order to assess the influence of biomass seasonality. The method developed in this research work is based on a combination of statistical and spatial explicit methods.

For this purpose, three scenarios (REF, AEDP2015 and AEDP2018), developed in this paper, represent penetration levels of electricity generated from renewable energy. The implications have been analyzed through the application of LEAP model for the period 2018–2037. The analyses revealed that high penetrations of renewable energy would have positive impacts on the Thai electricity generation from several perspectives including improving the diversification of electricity supply, decreasing fossil fuel imports for generating electricity, less dependency on fossil fuel, environmentally friendly power generation, utilizing agricultural wastes, and build-up of local capabilities in electricity generation. Moreover, the energy transition due to disruptive innovations would make renewable energy more attractive. However, the transition would raise several challenges for the Thai electricity system, for example, capital-intensive investment, centralized electricity system, traditional regulatory framework and a lack of social involvement. In order to address the transitional challenges, the Thai government has initiated a number of policies including the upgrade of the grid to smart grid, the development of energy storage and the revision of the regulations to support local energy business. In addition to the initiation of the government’s policies, this paper suggests that a structural change in the form of a separation between generation and transmission functions of the state electric utility, the development of new infrastructure and network regulation, and collaborations among stakeholders by increasing more participation and governance as well as aligning regulatory arrangement taking into account more on social objectives would provide a robust pathway to efficiently integrate renewable energy into the Thai electricity system. © 2020 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

In addition, the hydro generator is using the synchronous machine; while PV and battery systems are interfaced with the grid through power converters. The study aims to demonstrate the performance of islanding operation in a very light load condition, in which the total power generation from energy sources is extremely higher than the total demand. Three different control strategies are examined, which depending on technologies and functionalities of available energy sources in the system. The performance of each control strategy is simulated by using the transient simulation on DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The simulation results illustrate that, in the islanding mode, the cooperated controls among hydro generator, PV and battery can deal with the changes of frequency and voltage during the islanding condition effectively. Additionally, the active power curtailment of hydro generator and PV system is required for this solution to restrict the power production, especially in the light load condition.

This approach considers the state-of-charge (SOC) of the BSS and the production variation of the renewable generators, in particular of wind and photovoltaic technologies, and the variations in the power consumption and energy costs. The proposed EMS uses a master-slave strategy formed by a parallel implementation of the particle swarm optimizer (PPSO) and a multi-period power flow method based on successive approximations (SA), with the aim of achieving the optimal daily operation of the BSS. The objective function selected for the optimization was the reduction of the energy purchasing costs, also including the power balance, devices capabilities and voltage regulation. The effectiveness of the EMS is evaluated in a test system of 21 buses, comparing the solution quality and speed with three optimization techniques published in literature: a black hole optimizer, a continuous genetic algorithm with matrix structure, and a traditional Chu & Beasley genetic algorithm. In addition, two simulation scenarios were used to identify the optimal final SOC conditions for the BSS. Finally, the results show that the proposed EMS provides the best trade-off between quality solution and speed.

The developed fabrication scheme is fully compatible with low-ON-resistance vertical III-V nanowire MOSFET selectors, where operational compatibility with the initial high-field filament forming is established.

It stores the available energy in the form of electromagnetic fields. The features of SMES include relatively high-power density, fast response time, very quick full discharge time, high cycle efficiency, and long lifetime. SMES is suitable for short-term storage in power and energy system applications so that it can play an important role in the increased use of intermittent renewable energy. This paper presents modeling and design of a high-efficiency multi-stage SMES system supplied by either a photovoltaic (PV) source or Constant Voltage Source (CVS). The multi-staging process is a new concept for extending the SMES discharging time and improving their efficiency. The system is proposed as a standalone hybrid system that stores the PV energy in the form of an electromagnetic field. At power interruptions, the system can supply the connected loads for a specified period depending on the number of stages. The proposed model is simulated in Matlab/Simulink environment. The paper presents a comparative study between single and multi-stage SMES systems supplied by either PV or CVS source. The obtained results show that: increasing the number of stages leads to an increase in the system efficiency with a high increase in discharging time.

District heating networks are a promising sink as temperatures are relatively low. Usually only the end-use prices are public; but these include network infrastructure costs, maintenance costs etc. The value of a certain kWh fed in, i.e. the current marginal costs for the generation of heat, are not transparent. However, current marginal generation costs are decisive for the use of waste heat as the accumulated producer surplus determines the profitability of investment. To make marginal generation costs transparent, a “Heat Merit Order” is constructed. Based on conversion factors, fuel prices, network tariffs, etc. the maximum remuneration payed by the district heating operator at a certain point of time is made calculable. For a case study, the applicability to estimate maximum investment costs is proven. In conclusion, the Heat Merit Order makes local heat generation prices transparent and allows to calculate the profitability of integrating waste heat, other heat sources and storages; it enables companies to estimate the value of waste heat and if investments are profitable.

The new design aims at phasing out the diesel generators and replacing them with a hybrid energy system composed of photovoltaics and a battery storage system. Two optimization approaches are adopted, a heuristic genetic algorithm approach is used to achieve sub-optimal sizing of the hybrid system sources and a rules-based dynamic programming approach to ensure optimal power flow. In order to reduce the computation time, a novel combinational approach employing genetic algorithm, dynamic programming and rules-based algorithm is proposed. The intervention of the dynamic programming for optimal power flow is restricted to certain active hours within a given day, while the rules-based power flow algorithm runs only outside those hours. The study demonstrates that the application of the hybrid system yields minimal operational cost by almost entirely phasing out the diesel generators and significantly reducing the energy purchased from the grid during peak hours. The micro-grid of a university campus is used as a case study where energy and economic indicators are derived to prove the superiority of the proposed techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic programming; Energy economics; Energy management system; Genetic algorithm; Microgrid optimal design","Acoustic generators; Diesel engines; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Hybrid systems; Optical variables measurement; Battery storage system; Diesel generators; Economic indicators; Genetic algorithm approach; Hybrid energy system; Optimal power flows; Optimization approach; Power flow algorithm; Battery storage; algorithm; design; diesel engine; energy market; genetic algorithm; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; smart grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083111077

It is found that the global desalination demand by 2050 can be reduced as much as 30% and 60%, depending on the irrigation efficiency growth rate. India, China, USA, Pakistan and Iran account for between 56% and 62% of the global desalination demand. Decarbonising the desalination sector by 2050, will result in global average levelised cost of water decreasing from about 2.4 €/m3 in 2015, considering unsubsidised fossil fuel costs, to approximately 1.05 €/m3 by 2050, with most regions in the cost range of 0.32 €/m3 – 1.66 €/m3. Low-cost renewable electricity, in particular solar photovoltaics and battery storage, is found to form the backbone of a sustainable and clean global water supply, supported by measures to increase irrigation efficiency.

We investigated whether dapagliflozin with or without atorvastatin could improve lipid accumulation-induced kidney and liver injury in HFF-induced insulin resistant rats. Male Wistar rats were fed with HFF for 16 weeks and then received drug treatments for 4 weeks; vehicle, dapagliflozin, atorvastatin and dapagliflozin plus atorvastatin treatment groups. HFF rats demonstrated insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, liver injury and renal dysfunction associated with impaired renal lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation.

It is clear that views diverge on how different barriers should be investigated, and there are reasons to believe that energy efficiency measurements, with regards to both energy efficiency in buildings and energy efficiency in the operations, have weak points. The energy efficiency situation is a paradox that needs to be elaborated on. Scope and approach: The paper presents a systematic literature review of research on open (no doors) or closed refrigerated cabinets (with doors) energy efficiency, chilled groceries and the consumer behavior, followed by an analysis of the contemporary research. The paper draws on findings and collects peer-reviewed articles from databases in order to examine how research has reported on this issue. As a result, 31 articles were framed, with different variables, to form a body of this article. Key findings and conclusions: Empirical research is needed that uses actual data, such as perceptions, behavioral research with lab experiments, and field measurements. Consumers shopping situation, for chilled groceries, is an extensive and complex topic, and a single study cannot provide a complete overview of all its related aspects. The results focus on two objectives. Firstly to present the review and secondly to analyze and identify knowledge gaps within the energy efficiency and store installations in the grocery context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Barrier; Consumer behavior; Energy efficiency; Food temperature; Retail display cabinet; Systematic review","Consumer behavior; Food storage; Refrigeration; Barrier; Display cabinet; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficiency measurements; Food temperatures; Supermarket refrigeration; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082701352

The multilayer co-assembly evolves the lamellar arrangement to mimic a fascinating nacre’s structure in the solidified graphene/chitin composites. The core of our routine is the self-assembly of both GO LCs and chitin LCs into a flexible nacre-mimicking membrane structured by graphene-wrapped chitin layers. The intrinsic electron mobility of graphene nanosheets and mechanical toughness of chitin nanocrystals endow these reinforced membranes with functions in catalyst supports and electronics. The nacre-mimicking composite homogeneously incorporates with TiO2 nanoparticles by simultaneous LC co-assembly of GO, chitin and peroxotitanate to afford layered TiO2/graphene/chitin composites that can function as a photocatalytic membrane for the mineralization of organic compounds. The LC integration creates hierarchical assemblies to increase the permeability of the TiO2/graphene/chitin nanohybrid membranes, offering its potential use for developing photocatalysis and separation for water and air treatment. The work not only presents the implementation of the nacre-mimicking LC self-assembly but also presents the sustainable materials as promising precursors for further investigation in energy storage and conversion and gas sensing.

Since these fuels usually have rather low heating values, low bulk densities and are disadvantageous concerning their storage behavior, the torrefaction of such materials (low-temperature pyrolysis between 200°C and 320°C) represents an interesting procedure to improve their fuel properties. After the torrefaction of vine prunings for 30 min at 200°C and 220°C was performed in a pilot hearthtype reactor located in Ptolemais-Greece, the lower heating value (LHV) was increased by 3.7% and 10.5%, respectively, leading to important cost reductions during transport and storage. A comparative analysis of chemical properties between raw material and torrefied material is presented followed by calculating fuel-specific indices concerning corrosion risk, aerosol formation, and slagging tendency. Based on the NOx emission index, a lower conversion was predicted for the torrefied fuel than for the untreated fuel. High aerosol emissions are expected for raw fuel, even higher aerosol emissions for the torrefied fuel. According to the measured ash melting temperatures and calculation of the Rs index, raw fuel and torrefied fuel at 200°C present medium trend for deposit formulation, whereas there is a high trend for deposit formulation in the case of torrefied fuel at 220°C. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agricultural biomass; Chemical characterization; Torrefaction; Vine prunings","Aerosols; Agriculture; Calorific value; Chemical analysis; Corrosion; Cost reduction; Deposits; Fuels; Risk assessment; Temperature; Agricultural biomass; Chemical characterization; Comparative analysis; Fuel characteristics; Low-temperature pyrolysis; Lower heating value; Torrefaction; Vine prunings; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081789068

For this purpose, a dispatch model representing the electricity supply in five European countries is expanded by an additional household layer. This hard-coupled setup allows to assess the optimal operation of stationary household batteries with the objective of minimizing the national electricity supply cost. This is contrasted with the self-consumption maximization from the household's perspective under various tariffs. In all cases, the analysis focuses on changes in the cost of national power production due to storage operation, i.e. the household battery system value. Under the household perspective operation, this value can be negative, which means that prosumer storage increases the national power supply cost. This can be the case if wholesale price profiles are not sufficiently reflected in the electricity tariffs. The value increases if tariffs reflect the market conditions more closely. Enabling the option of battery grid-charging always reduces the cost of national power production. In most cases, storage value rises during future years. This is because of the naturally improved match of the household dispatch with the electricity market price profiles under higher national solar power shares. Major parts of the battery value stem from the replacement of less efficient pumped hydro storage. Consequently, battery storage value shows a strong sensitivity with respect to hydro power flexibility. Various other sensitivity analyses are presented. While the default case represents the household sector by 12 individual nodes, implications of smaller sample sizes as well as the aggregation of household nodes are discussed. While this does not affect battery value operated from the system's perspective, impacts on household perspective operation value are statistically significant. Further, we assess the impact of frozen fuel prices and power plant capacities, larger volumes of prosumer households, and lower time resolution of the household nodes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Behind-the-meter PV and storage; Community storage; Decentralized electricity assets; Electricity de-carbonization; Electricity market modeling; Prosumer battery operation","Carbonization; Cost benefit analysis; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Power markets; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Battery operation; Decentralized electricity; Electricity market model; Electricity supply; European Countries; National power systems; Power plant capacities; Storage operations; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081024389

The South African Government has announced plans to build two large dams within an area with a very high erosion rate, thus necessitating soil erosion mitigation efforts. These efforts should consider the mechanism of gully formation, as it determines which conservation measures could be used. With overland flow gullies the kinetic energy of flowing water needs to be curbed, while gullies form by piping in dispersive soils where free water could accumulate. This paper describes how a soil association map for the quarternary catchments T35DE was created with digital soil mapping methods, in order to indicate areas where piping could occur. Soil were described and classified at 600 locations determined with the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, within a 500 m buffer around the available road network. This soil database was then used with the multinomial logistic regression algorithm to create an initial soil association map with seven soil associations, based on their soil erosion properties. Additionally, a soil depth map was created using the cubist algorithm. The soil association map was then created again, but with the soil depth map added as an additional covariate. Including the soil depth map as a covariate improved the accuracy (68% vs 64%) and level of detail of the final soil association map, even though the soil depth map was a poor reflection of reality. The final soil association map was compared to the best current available spatial soil dataset, and found to contain 123 times more detail. Superimposing the gully extent of the soil association map confirmed that the planosols are the most susceptible to gully erosion and mitigation efforts should avoid increasing free water in the subsoil on the planosol area, and the as yet ungullied planosol should be prioritized as it could become a hotspot for gully formation if it degrades. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cubist; Gully erosion; Multinomial logistic regression; Planosols; Sediment","Catchments; E-learning; Erosion; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Landforms; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Mapping; Sediments; Soil surveys; Conservation measures; Cubist; Digital soil mappings; Gully erosion; Latin hypercube sampling methods; Multinomial logistic regression; Planosols; South African government; Soils; gully erosion; machine learning; mapping method; measurement method; regression analysis; sediment analysis; soil erosion; Eastern Cape; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080077675

The effects of 10, 40, 70, 100, 150 and 200 mg K l−1 fertigation on photosynthetic attributes, soluble carbohydrates, starch, metabolites, growth and yield were studied in a greenhouse. Storage root yield, number of storage roots, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis reached maximum at 150 mg K l−1. However, soluble carbohydrates and starch in the leaves significantly declined with an increasing concentration of K solution, similarly to the trend of glycerol in the leaves. Conversely, malic acid, citric acid and propionic acid gradually increased reaching maximum at 150, 150 and 70 mg K l−1 respectively. Combined, these results suggest that sugars were transported from the leaves to a stronger sink – the bulking storage roots. This and the increase of intermediate metabolites of tricarboxylic acid cycle provided the energy required for the bulking process and the development of the storage roots.

Therefore, the main contribution of this work is related to the developments in advanced control and management system applied to hybrid wind turbines (WT). The objective is to strengthen the extraction capacity of wind power in order to obtain an extended operational range “operating areas II and III.” In other terms, the multi-objective optimization on hybrid WT based on sophisticate control system and robust management reliable to hybrid WTs is performed to design a perfect control system. This system requires a very complicated adaptation between the second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC)-based speed control, a novel MPPT technique modified enhanced perturb and observe “MEPO,” system limitation and system energy storage. In addition, to improve the quality of the electrical energy introduced into the grid, a new efficient and robust strategy control based on direct power control-space vector modulation (DPC-SVM-SOSMC) implemented in the network side of the converter is proposed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control system and the new switching algorithm that coordinates the control (the multi-objective optimization) are validated under entire operating range (II and III).

With a computable general equilibrium model setup to analyse scenarios until 2050, we show that increasing PV shares initially lead to higher costs of electricity supply and thus retail prices. Until 2025, large storage investments will be required, leading to lower consumption possibilities presenting a critical barrier to initiate PV expansion. However, from 2025 onwards PV installation costs are expected to become competitive to wind power, leading to lower costs of electricity supply and electricity retail prices, with positive macroeconomic effects. Overall, we find positive long-term effects of PV expansion on GDP, welfare and employment from 2025 until mid-century. With stakeholders we then investigate system-level obstacles for PV expansion in the Netherlands. A key observation is that inconsistent policy mixes are an obstacle to successful PV implementation. © 2019","CGE; Electricity; Intermittent; Photovoltaics; Risks; Stakeholder engagement","computable general equilibrium analysis; economic conditions; electricity industry; electricity supply; photovoltaic system; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076518531

The incidence of these constraints has varied over time. We model these impacts within the competitive storage model using structural break regression analysis. Our analysis shows that the pass-through has varied over time in relation to the share of ethanol in total US corn use. Our analysis provides robust empirical evidence of an increase in the pass-through from crude oil to corn prices over the period from the start of the century to a high level over 2004–2008 when corn use in ethanol was growing very fast.

The policy is envisioned for the winter period, when the country’s large hydropower reservoirs tend to be nearly depleted. This study analyzes the impact of such a strategic energy reserve on security of supply, consumer costs, international trade, and sustainability. A hybrid simulation model is developed that combines agent-based modeling and system dynamics. The simulations show that the reserve can improve short-term security of supply but does not improve long-term security of supply as it does not impact domestic investments or reduce the import dependency in winter. The reserve leads to a slight increase in consumer costs, even when including the reduction in outage costs. A larger reserve is more effective at reducing the supply risk but is proportionally costly. Lastly, we find that the policy induces scarcity periods that would not have occurred otherwise, which means that the reserve should have a high strike price to ensure it is only called upon as a last resort. We conclude that there is no structural need for a strategic energy reserve, as it only increases short-term security of supply and does not contribute to solving the structural problem.

Different nutritional assessment tools are used to identify patients at risk. A composite and comprehensive malnutrition inflammation score (MIS) has been correlated with morbidity and mortality, and appears to be a robust and quantitative tool. Objectives: Determine malnutrition risk profile in a sample of portuguese HD patients; determine the association of clinical and laboratory factors with MIS, and the impact of each parameter on MIS. Methods and results: We performed, between September 15th of 2015 and January 31st of 2016, a cross sectional analysis of 2975 patients, representing 25% of portuguese HD patients. 59% were men (66.7 ± 14.8 years); 31% diabetic; 79% and 21% performed, respectively, high-flux HD and HDF. A MIS >5 was considered to indicate higher risk and was present in 1489 patients (50%). Amongst all parameters, comorbilities/dialysis vintage, transferrin, functional capacity, changes in body weight and decreased fat stores showed the higher impact, while albumin had one of the lowest impact on the nutritional risk. Multivariable analysis: Higher age (>75 years, OR 1.71, p < 0.001), diabetes (OR 1.25, p = 0.026), lower P levels (OR 1.57,p = 0.001), higher Ca levels (OR 1.51, p < 0.001), higher ERI (OR 1.05, p < 0.001), higher Kt/V (OR 2.14, p < 0.001) and higher CRP (OR 1.01, p < 0.001) were independently associated with a higher risk of MIS>5; higher nPNA (OR 0.29, p < 0.001) and higher Pcreat (OR 0.88, p < 0.001) were associated with a risk reduction of MIS>5 (95% CI). Conclusions: Routine clinical and analytic parameters were found to be associated with MIS range that might indicate higher risk, and may represent a simple alert sign for the need of further assessments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Hemodialysis; Inflammation; Malnutrition-inflammation score; Nutritional risk; Protein-energy wasting","albumin; C reactive protein; calcium; creatinine; transferrin; autacoid; biological marker; human serum albumin; age distribution; aged; albumin blood level; Article; body weight change; calcium blood level; comorbidity; controlled study; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; functional status; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; human; inflammation; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; malnutrition inflammation score; nutritional assessment; nutritional parameters; observational study; Portuguese (citizen); prediction; protein metabolism; protein nitrogen appearance; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; sex difference; transferrin blood level; adverse event; age; blood; body composition; body weight loss; clinical trial; inflammation; kidney disease; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; nutritional status; obesity; pathophysiology; Portugal; predictive value; protein calorie malnutrition; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adiposity; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Body Composition; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Kidney Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Portugal; Predictive Value of Tests; Protein-Energy Malnutrition; Renal Dialysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Serum Albumin, Human; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070558697

The evaluations show that the IGCC plant with CO2 capture leads to costs of electricity between 91 and 120 € · MWh−1, depending on the capture technology employed, compared to 65 € · MWh−1 for the power plant without capture. This results in CO2 avoidance costs ranging from 42 to 84 € · tCO2,avoided1, mainly linked to the losses in net power output. From both energy and cost points of view, the low-temperature and Rectisol based CO2 capture processes are the most efficient capture technologies. Furthermore, partial CO2 capture appears as a good mean to ensure early implementation due to the limited increase in CO2 avoidance cost when considering partial capture. To go beyond the two specific CO2-selective membranes considered, a cost/membrane property map for CO2-selective membranes was developed. This map emphasise the need to develop high performance membrane to compete with solvent technology. Finally, the cost of the whole CCS chain was estimated at 54 € · tCO2,avoided1 once pipeline transport and storage are taken into consideration.

Here, using a combination of static DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures, it is shown that wood cellulose has the ability to uptake H2 via a physisorption mechanism based on dispersion interactions of the van der Waals type involving the O-atoms of the D-glucose rings. The absorption causes little to no disturbances on the cellulose structure and H2 is highly mobile in the material.

The big barrier in realizing this green technology requires a highly efficient, earth-abundant, and low-cost electrocatalyst for HER. Various HER catalysts have been designed and reported, still, their performance is not up to the mark of Pt. Among them, cobalt-based, especially cobalt disulfide (CoS2) has shown significant HER activity and found suitable candidature for HER due to its low cost, simple to prepare, and exhibits good stability. Herein, we synthesized various nanostructured materials including pure CoS2, Co3O4 and their composites by wet chemical methods and found them active for HER. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has revealed a morphology of composite as a mixture of nanowires and round shape spherical nanoparticles with several microns in dimension. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the cubic phase of CoS2 and cubic phase of Co3O4 in the composite materials. The chemical deposition of CoS2 onto Co3O4 has tailored the HER activity of CoS2@Co3O4 composite material. Two CoS2@Co3O4 composite materials were produced with varying amounts of Co3O4 and labeled as samples 1 and 2. The Co3O4 reduced the adsorption energy for hydrogen, decreased the aggregation of CoS2 and uplifted the stability of CoS2@Co3O4 a composite material in alkaline media. Sample 1 requires an overpotential of 320 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and it exhibits a Tafel slope of 42 mVdec−1which is the key indicator for the fast HER kinetics on sample 1. The sample 1 is highly durable for 50 h and also it has excellent stability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed a small charge transfer resistance of 28.81 Ohms for the sample 1 with high capacitance double-layer value of 0.81 mF. EIS has supported polarization and Tafel slope results. Based on the partial physical characterization and the electrochemical results, the as-obtained sample 1 (CoS2@Co3O4 composite material) will find potential applications in an extended range of energy conversion and storage devices owing to its low cost, high abundance, and excellent efficiency. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Co3O4; CoS; CoS2@Co3O4 composite material; Hydrogen evolution reaction","Alkalinity; Charge transfer; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Composite materials; Costs; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Energy conversion; Hydrogen storage; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur compounds; Virtual storage; Adsorption energies; Chemical deposition; Co3O4; Energy conversion and storages; Environment friendly technology; Physical characterization; Spherical nanoparticles; Wet-chemical method; Hydrogen evolution reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082754998

Uncontrolled airflow transports unconditioned air into the building. Lowering the air exchange rate in unoccupied storage facilities is therefore essential to ensure acceptable climate conditions for the preservation of collections, while at the same time reducing the energy use for climate control. The concern is, however, that a restricted airflow can create uneven microclimates within a room, with thermal stratification as well as accumulation of indoor generated pollutants, which may accelerate the deterioration of the collections. This paper examines the air distribution within one storage building with a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and in two rooms in another storage with semi-passive climate control. A sensor grid was established in each room in order to map the distribution of temperature, relative humidity (RH) and volatile organic acids determined as the sum of acetic and formic acid concentration. This study demonstrated that both tested ventilation forms upheld an acceptable climate performance with appropriate temperature and moisture distributions and without air pockets producing problematic microclimates. However, organic acids accumulated in concentrations up to 134 μg m−3 in parts of one storage room with semi-passive climate control. Whether to install a HVAC system with gaseous air filtration to remove organic acids will ultimately depend on the threshold level that caretakers are willing to accept. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air distribution; Constant dosing tracer gas; Microclimate; Organic acids; Relative humidity; Semi-passive climate control; Temperature","Air conditioning; Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Deterioration; Humidity control; Organic acids; Temperature; Acid concentrations; Air distribution; Distribution of temperature; Microclimate; Moisture distribution; Storage facilities; Tracer gas; Volatile organic acid; HVAC; air quality; air temperature; concentration (composition); indoor air; microclimate; moisture; organic acid; relative humidity; spatial distribution; storage; tracer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082138804

This study proposes to partially store in available WWTP tank infrastructure the wastewater received during the day-time and schedule the purification of the stored wastewater at night-time. The intended operational approach aims to shift part of the WWTP electrical energy consumption from day-time into the night-time period when the energy has lower prices, also contributing to the balance of the electrical power generation system. This research presents the case study of a Romanian WWTP with Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2O) process configuration. A proposed control strategy was implemented and tested on the dynamic calibrated WWTP model, based on the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 and the secondary settler Takács model. Simulations of the proposed scheduling program for the storing and processing time-periods of the influent wastewater, associated to the designed control strategies, demonstrate the reduction of the operational costs and energy savings, while keeping the effluent quality within the requested regulation limits and improving the plant sustainability. In the most favorable case and considering the overall WWTP performance, the operational costs are reduced by 47% and the effluent quality is improved by 25%.

The achieved quality of the CO2-rich product stream greatly influences the energy effort for CO2 capture, resulting in widely scattering figures for CO2 capture effort in the literature. The present article specifically addresses the provision of concentrated CO2 (&gt;99 vol %) from diluted sources. A continuously operated temperature swing adsorption process (TSA) is chosen to illustrate the technical challenges. A detailed steady-state process model is used for the thermodynamic evaluation that had previously been developed for the commercially available solid sorbent Lewatit VP OC 1065. Three typical inlet concentrations of CO2 corresponding to atmospheric air (0.04 vol %db), gas turbine combined cycle exhaust gas (4 vol %db), and solid fuel combustion exhaust gas (10 vol %db) are investigated. Each case has been optimized in terms of stage configuration, sorbent circulation rate and stripping steam rate. For capture from air with a capture rate of 50%, two stages are used in the adsorber and 10 stages are used in the desorber, while for the capture from both exhaust gas mixtures, a capture rate of 90% and a 4 × 4 stage configuration are used. The specific total energy demand for capture and concentration turns out to be 10 times higher for capture from ambient air (25.76 MJ/kgCO2 heat @ 120 °C + 8.26 MJ/kgCO2 power) compared to capture from combustion exhaust gas with 4 vol %db (3.64 MJ/kgCO2 heat @ 120 °C + 0.09 MJ/kgCO2 power) and 10 vol %db (3.21 MJ/kgCO2 heat @ 120 °C + 0.04 MJ/kgCO2 power). A simple exergy analysis shows about three times higher irreversibilities in the case of capture from atmospheric air compared to capture from the two more concentrated source streams. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide process; Combustion; Concentration (process); Diesel and gas turbine combined power plants; Fuels; Gases; Transportation routes; Combustion exhausts; Continuous temperature; Gas turbine combined cycle; Solid fuel combustion; Steady state process; Technical challenges; Temperature-swing adsorption process; Thermodynamic evaluation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098799562

The proposed control scheme allows performing the voltage regulation by reactive power control of the PV inverters without communication systems. The PV inverter in the microgrid commits to supply the active power generated from the PV array first, and then the remaining capacity of the PV inverter represents the available reactive power that can contribute in the microgrid voltage regulation. The proposed control scheme allows the PV inverters to deliver or to absorb the reactive power depending on the measured voltage at the connection point of the PV inverter and the available reactive power of the PV inverter. The tested microgrid consists of two power inverters, one for interfacing energy storage batteries controlled by a droop control scheme in order to regulate the voltage and the frequency of the microgrid. The second inverter interfacing the PV array controlled by the proposed control scheme in order to support the microgrid by the active power generated from the PV array and the available reactive power.

One of the best methods to store surplus energy produced from environmentally friendly methods is as elemental hydrogen, using electrolysis in alkaline electrolyzers. Currently, this technology is hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits its overall efficiency and durability. One of the most popular directions is to develop cheap, durable, and active platinum-group-metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts. In this category, the benchmark catalyst is NiFeOOH. Here, synthetic, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods were used to design, synthesize, and investigate novel PGM-free catalysts with enhanced durability and activity. Using an easy and cheap one-step synthetic precipitation method, titanium atoms in various amounts were introduced in the NiFeOOH structure, forming NixFeyTizOOH. One of these compounds (Ni:Fe:Ti = 85.75:7.70:6.55) shows a very low overpotential on GC (400 mV, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2) and high current density (27.9 mA cm-2) at a potential of 1.8 V vs RHE. This is a higher activity toward the OER in comparison to the benchmark catalyst; in addition, the compound has higher stability at prolonged exposure to high potentials.

Although genetic engineering allows a quick introduction of desirable traits, simultaneously, it may deliver unintended side effects. Herein, we compared the protein composition in leaves of microclonally propagated fast-growing hybrid clone of Populus deltoides × Populus nigra (Populus × euroamericana), genetically modified with a reporter (GUS) and selective (NPTII) traits, and its non-transgenic parental genotype. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we revealed that 5.5% of 330 detected protein spots were differentially accumulated. The vast majority of them showed lower abundance in the transgenic line. These proteins were mainly involved in primary metabolism, energy production, and protein synthesis/homeostasis; notably, none of them was directly linked to neomycin phosphotransferase or β-glucuronidase activities. Some of the differentially accumulated proteins could be associated with stress response caused by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Furthermore, the lower abundance of two cytosolic glutamine synthase isoforms and accumulation of bark storage protein A in the transgenic line, plausibly indicated impaired nitrogen metabolism and storage. The insertion of a model genetic construct did not alter the neighboring genetic loci, and neither toxins nor allergens were differentially abundant. In essence, we detected no protein indicating considerable health or environmental hazard in the transgenic hybrid black poplar. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","Genetically modified plant; Populus; Risk assessment; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; Unintended effects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084124482

While gut microbes produce a huge range of metabolites, specific compounds such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can enter the portal circulation and reach the liver (Brandl K, Schnabl B. Curr Opin Gastroenterol 33: 128 -133, 2017), a central organ involved in glucose homeostasis and diabetes control. Propionate is a major SCFA involved in activation of intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), thereby regulating food intake, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and leading to metabolic homeostasis. Although microbiome-modulating strategies may target the increased microbial production of propionate, it is not clear whether such an effect spreads through to the hepatic cellular level. Here, we designed a propionate-producing consortium using a selection of commensal gut bacteria, and we investigated how their delivered metabolites impact an in vitro enterohepatic model of insulin resistance. Glycogen storage on hepatocyte-like cells and inflammatory markers associated with insulin resistance were evaluated to understand the role of gut metabolites on gut-liver cross talk in a simulated scenario of insulin resistance. The metabolites produced by our consortium increased glycogen synthesis by ~57% and decreased proinflammatory markers such as IL-8 by 12%, thus elucidating the positive effect of our consortium on metabolic function and low-grade inflammation. Our results suggest that microbiota-derived products can be a promising multipurpose strategy to modulate energy homeostasis, with the potential ability to assist in managing metabolic diseases due to their adaptability. © 2020 the American Physiological Society","Biotherapeutics; Glycogen; Gut-liver axis; Insulin resistance; Propionate","glycogen; interleukin 8; lipoprotein lipase; propionic acid; short chain fatty acid; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; cytokine; glycogen; propionic acid derivative; Akkermansia muciniphila; Article; Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; Bacteroides vulgatus; Caco-2 cell line; commensal; controlled study; Coprococcus; Coprococcus catus; energy balance; glycogen synthesis; gut liver axis; Hep-G2 cell line; HT-29-MTX cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; inflammation; insulin resistance; intestine; intestine flora; Lactobacillus plantarum; liver; liver cell; microbial consortium; nonhuman; priority journal; Ruminococcus; Ruminococcus obeum; transepithelial resistance; Veillonella parvula; gastrointestinal tract; insulin resistance; liver; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Glycogen; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Propionates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084105108

Since the power generation from renewable resources is difficult to anticipate, a real-time adjustment of generation schedules is necessary after more forecast information becomes available. Intra-hour, or ultra-short-term dispatch, allows microgrid operators to frequently update generators' outputs for providing power supplies efficiently in an uncertain operating condition. However, several technical challenges such as information availability, control architecture, and computational burden make it difficult to find an optimal generation schedule at runtime. This work addresses the intra-hour economic dispatch problem by designing a closed-loop distributed model predictive control (DMPC) that reduces potential variations in the determined generation schedules. At first, optimization problems regarding the behaviors of several participants in a microgrid are formulated. Then, the procedures for achieving the real-time power balance under ramp-rate constraints are detailed. Simulation results present the efficiency of the proposed DMPC for the optimal intra-hour economic dispatch when multiple types of generation resources are considered in a microgrid. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Average consensus; distributed optimization; energy storage systems; intra-hour economic dispatch; microgrid operation; model predictive control; renewable resources","Microgrids; Model predictive control; Scheduling; Distributed Model predictive Control; Economic dispatch problems; Forecast information; Information availability; Optimization problems; Output characteristics; Power generation from renewable; Ramp rate constraints; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083917109

This work presents a thermo-kinetic study carried out in a natural and forced convection solar dryer; the objective was to establish the optimal conditions for drying and storing Herniaria hirsuta by testing the impact of different aerothermal conditions (air temperature, air velocity) on water loss of fresh Herniaria hirsuta. The kinetics of drying is studied for three temperatures (50, 60 and 70 °C) in two-air velocities (0.09 and 0.18 m/s). The optimal water activity which is related to conservation is 0.28. The LESPAM model was found to be the most appropriate for describing the sorption curves. The air drying temperature is a principal factor influencing the drying kinetics; the drying rate decreases in low air drying temperature, the air velocity had a small impact on the drying kinetics of Herniaria hirsuta. The Midilli-Kuck model was found to be the best fitted drying curves in thin layers for Herniaria hirsuta. The effective diffusivity of moisture water values changed from 2.5312 10−9 to 18.0511 10−9 m2·s−1, and increased simultaneously with the increase of temperature. The average activation energy of the diffusion process is obtained to be 2938.46 kJ/kg; it expresses the temperature effect on the diffusion coefficient.

However, the hydrogen storage capacity of MIL-88A has to be improved to meet the practical level at the ambient conditions. In this research, we elucidated the effects of transition metal substitution on the hydrogen storage capability of MIL-88A. The trivalent transition metals including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Ni have been selected to substitute for Fe in MIL-88A. Using the van der Waals dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations, we explored the most favorable adsorption configurations of the hydrogen molecule in M-MIL-88A (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni). We found that the V-MIL-88A has the strongest binding energy of 17 kJ mol−1 with the hydrogen molecule in the side-on configuration on the metal site. Besides, the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations showed that the metal substitution greatly influences not only the favorable adsorption configuration and energy but also the hydrogen uptake due to the modification of the H2@MIL-88A interaction. Sc-MIL-88A was found to offer the highest gravimetric H2 uptake compared to the other M-MIL-88A. The value is 5.13 wt% at (cryogenic temperature 77 K, 50 bar) and 0.72 wt% at (room temperature 298 K, 100 bar) for the absolute; 4.63 wt% at (77 K, 10 bar) and 0.29 wt% at (298 K, 100 bar) for the excess capacity. Furthermore, Sc-MIL-88A also exhibited the highest volumetric uptake up to 52 g L−1 at 77 K and 7.1 g L−1 at 298 K for the absolute; 46 g L−1 at 77 K and 2.8 g L−1 at 298 K for the excess loading. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Density functional theory; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Hydrogen storage; Metal-organic framework; Transition metals","Binding energy; Density functional theory; Intelligent systems; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Molecules; Monte Carlo methods; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Transition metals; Van der Waals forces; Cryogenic temperatures; Dispersion-corrected density functional; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Hydrogen storage capacities; Metal substitution; Storage capability; Transition-metal substitution; Trivalent transition; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081893893

However, amorphous solids are thermodynamically unstable and tend to recrystallize with material-specific kinetics. Crystallization is not the prime phenomenon in the whole process, although it is the easiest to measure. The primary phenomenon prior to the crystallization of glass is phase separation, the detection of which is very rarely reported among small molecular compounds. In the present study, a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was used to detect very early stage amorphous-amorphous phase separation in co-amorphous drug mixtures. Miscibility was calculated for five studied mixtures based on the Flory-Huggins method and four immiscible pairs and one partial miscible pair were selected for the laboratory experiments. Co-amorphous samples (n = 3) were prepared by melt-quench method and stored at the elevated temperature to induce the separation of amorphous phases. Each sample was stored at the same relative percentage temperature between glass transition temperature Tg and melting temperature Tm. Immediately after the sample preparation, the full amorphousness was verified with polarizing light microscopy. Before SEM-EDS analysis, the samples were fractured into two pieces and measurements were done from cross-section (from the bulk sample). All five pairs phase separated during two days of storage at the elevated temperature. The study proved that SEM-EDS was able to detect a very small phase separated regions in the amorphous sample, as amorphous-amorphous phase separation was detected in four out of five pairs. However, the surface roughness could affect the analysis and give a false indication of phase separation. SEM-EDS also supported calculation results, since every studied pair showed phase separation during study, as was predicted on the grounds of Flory-Huggins miscibility calculation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amorphous; Calculation; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Flory-Huggins; Miscibility; Phase separation; Scanning electron microscope","cimetidine; indometacin; naproxen; paracetamol; terfenadine; drug; Article; controlled study; crystal structure; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; glass transition temperature; human; melting temperature; miscibility; particle size; phase separation; polarization microscopy; thermodynamics; chemical model; chemistry; scanning electron microscopy; solubility; spectroscopy; transition temperature; vitrification; Crystallization; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Chemical; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Solubility; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Transition Temperature; Vitrification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081572093

We study the decline of coal-fired power generation in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2017 by analyzing the discourse in The Guardian. We find scientists and environmental NGOs criticizing coal for climate and health reasons. Government and incumbent businesses tried to re-legitimate coal but eventually, their resistance collapsed and coal was almost completely abandoned in just a few years. Particularly devastating for coal were failed promises around carbon capture and storage, rapid diffusion of wind energy, and pressure from various policies.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prospects of implementing hydrogen technologies in the electricity network as an electricity production unit or/and utilise the produced hydrogen as transportation fuel. Three main scenarios were identified to be the most appropriate for this: (1) Support of the electrical grid via a fuel cell; (2) participation of a hydrogen production and fuel cell system in the electricity and transportation markets; and (3) participation in the transportation market. The results indicated that a fuel cell generator providing ancillary services is not economically viable in the investigated case study, while implementing a hydrogen production unit with a hydrogen fuel selling price between 4 and 114 €/kgH2, depending on the electrolyser's power input, will yield positive results. For the third scenario, the hydrogen fuel price ranged between 3.6 and 15.0 €/kgH2. This research shows that hydrogen technologies can be used in the electricity and transportation markets from a technical point of view. However, from an economic point of view, a hydrogen system used only for a single application does not seem to be financially appealing. This suggests that reducing the investment cost and/or limiting operating costs is mandatory to support this type of investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity markets; Fuel cell; Hydrogen price; Hydrogen transportation; Water electrolysis","Commerce; Electric network parameters; Fuel cells; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Operating costs; Power markets; Solar energy; Electricity networks; Electricity production; Fuel cell generators; Hydrogen technologies; Innovative technology; Renewable energy source; Transportation markets; Water electrolysis; Hydrogen production; alternative energy; electricity; electricity industry; energy market; hydrogen; installation; optimization; transportation mode; wind power; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081271361

Therefore, the focus of this study is to investigate the effect of dust on PV performance and propose a novel cleaning system for the removal of dust from the PV modules. The outdoor experiment is conducted on the monocrystalline (mono-PV) and polycrystalline (poly-PV) PV modules. Each experimental set contains two PV modules (mono-PV and poly-PV), one set is cleaned every day and the other set left uncleaned throughout the experiment. The cleaning of the PV module is performed using pressurized water, sprayed through a flat-fan nozzle to clean the front surface. The wastewater is collected, filtered and directed back to the storage tank. The cleaning system has a water recovering capacity of 55% and a water requirement of 1.8 L per m2 of PV area. It has been analyzed and observed that the output power of the mono-PV module and poly-PV module has decreased by 16.16% and 11.54%, respectively after one month with the dust deposition density of 4.6 g/m2. The cleaning process improves the efficiency of the PV modules to 98% of it's original value in 35 s of operation. It has been evaluated that the proposed cleaning system is cost-effective for commercial sized PV modules. Furthermore, the mono-PV module (400-watts) and poly-PV module (355-watts) should be cleaned within 85 days of dust accumulation for optimum energy usage. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","Dust accumulation; Dust characterization; Economic analysis; Effect of dust; PV module; PV module cleaning system","Cost effectiveness; Dust; Economic analysis; Photovoltaic cells; Cleaning solution; Cleaning system; Dust accumulation; Experimental investigations; Outdoor experiment; Photovoltaic modules; PV modules; Water requirements; Cleaning; economic activity; energy efficiency; energy planning; eolian deposit; experimental study; photovoltaic system; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081228456

The results revealed that 1,6-hexanediol diglycidylether (HDDGE) and (3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methanol (EOM) were most effective reactive diluents regarding viscosity and reactivity.

It was possible to show that high filler contents of up to e.g. 74 vol% glass microspheres and 40 vol% short carbon fibres were able to be processed. In comparison with thermal curing techniques, the epoxy-based fibre reinforced polymer composites prepared by RICFP showed similar values in tensile measurement, but the manufacturing process was facilitated significantly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","A.

The as-deposited samples were annealed isothermally under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 673 to 1273 K. The structural changes due to thermal annealing were monitored by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). RUMP software was used to simulate the RBS spectra. The thickness of W thin films deposited, atomic composition of deposited layer and the intermixed layer growth were deduced from the RUMP simulation results. The GIXRD analysis showed that carbide formation was first observed at annealing temperature of 1173 K. The kinetics of the solid-state interaction was found to be diffusion controlled at the interface between W and C. The activation energy for the diffusion of C in W was estimated as 2.23 eV. The XRD results showed that the average crystallite size of the as-deposited W film was 9.77 nm. It increased with annealing temperature up to 18.05 nm at 1173 K. The first carbide phase observed was W2C in the sample annealed at 1173 K, while WC was the dominant carbide phase at 1273 K. The stability of W/C system under heat treatments below 1073 K suggests that this system has a promising application for long-term structural integrity of dry cask storage devices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Annealing; Carbide; Glassy carbon; RBS; Tungsten; XRD","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Annealing; Carbides; Carbon; Carbon films; Crystallite size; Diffusion; Glass; Glassy carbon; Interface states; Rubidium; Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Tungsten; Virtual storage; X ray diffraction; Annealing temperatures; Atomic compositions; Diffusion parameters; Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction; Magnetron sputtering systems; Rutherford backscattering spectrometry; Solid-state interactions; Thermal-annealing; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079317445

Thermal stratification was included using a simple one-dimensional multi-node model. A time-step dependency analysis showed that a time step of 0.05h is a good compromise between accuracy and computation speed. The solar fraction increases with collector flow rate when the flow rate is low. In fully-mixed storage, the solar fraction keeps increasing with flow rate, although with a decreasing rate of increase. However, in stratified storage, the solar fraction reaches a maximum at an optimum flow rate, before it starts decreasing with flow rate. When the number of tank nodes increases from 1 to 4, the maximum solar fraction increases 5–28%; this increase is superior for less efficient collectors and lower collector areas. In low-stratified systems, the optimum flow rate is the maximum allowed by the system. However, in stratified systems, the optimum flow rate is reduced to values of 0.006–0.016m3h−1 per square meter of collector area.

Thus, feasible oxygen carriers for continuous operation on the industry scale are essential. A combination of Mn and Si, which is not only economic but also has few adverse effects on the environment, has been tested and found to provide satisfactory CLOU behavior. But the results are relevant for several oxygen carrier applications. However, the mechanical properties of these Mn-Si oxygen carriers require further improvement. Thus, two kinds of support materials are chosen in this study, CaO and Al2O3, to enhance the physical strength of the Mn-Si oxides. Twelve samples with a CaO content ranging from 2 wt% to 41 wt% and twelve samples with an Al2O3 content, ranging from 2 wt% and to 36 wt%, were produced using spray-drying at three sintering temperatures, 1100 °C, 1150 °C, and 1200 °C. The aim is to identify oxygen carriers, which exhibit high reactivity and strong mechanical properties. The oxygen release ability and gas-fuel conversion of these oxygen carriers are examined. In general, the particles with a lower content of support materials (≤5 wt%) calcined from lower temperatures (≤1150 °C) show better CLOU behavior and higher reactivity, regardless of the support material. Attrition resistance was assessed with surprisingly good results for an oxygen carrier with a low content of support materials (≤5 wt%). The material with 74% Mn 24% Si and 2% Al was further tested in a continuous 300 W. This was done to test the oxygen carrier capability under more conditions closer to a real circulating CLOU unit. In the 300 W unit the material release oxygen in inert atmosphere and converted up to 99.98%, of the syngas and 70% of the methane. However, under certain conditions with syngas as fuel the physical structure of the oxygen carriers were destroyed as the particles degraded to fines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical-looping combustion (CLC); Chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU); Manganese-silicon oxides; Oxygen carriers; Support material","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon capture; Combustion; Mechanical properties; Methane; Oxygen; Silicon oxides; Sintering; Synthesis gas; Attrition resistances; Carbon capture storage; Chemical looping; Chemical-looping combustion; Environmental problems; Oxygen Carrier; Sintering temperatures; Support materials; Chemical oxygen demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077333695

The pH of the initial solutions had the major influence on the formation of PEO/Au nanocomposite hydrogels vs. suspensions. The pH and Au3+ initial concentration determined the AuNPs size and suspension stability, as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The neutral pH favored the formation of stable suspensions with the smallest gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), whereas unstable suspensions and bigger nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained at acidic pH and by increasing Au3+ initial concentration. On irradiation at alkaline conditions PEO/AuNPs hydrogels were produced in one-pot synthesis method - by simultaneous crosslinking of PEO chains and reduction/synthesis of Au nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy of nanocomposite gels revealed the gold nanoparticles embedded in PEO matrix with homogenous distribution. The thermal and viscoelastic properties of PEO/AuNPs gels depended on the initial Au3+ concentration, that is on amount of AuNPs synthesized inside gels. Lower particle content resulted in gels with generally higher melting and crystallization temperatures as well as higher storage moduli, yield points and flow points than pure PEO gel. The optimal amount were up to 1 wt% Au for obtaining stronger gels, whereas higher amount of NPs, because of NPs agglomeration, lead to deterioration of gel properties and significant weakening of gel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gamma-irradiation; Gold nanoparticles; One step synthesis; PEO/gold nanocomposite hydrogels; Rheological properties; Thermal properties","Alkalinity; Deterioration; Ethylene; Fiber optic sensors; Gamma rays; Gels; Hydrogels; Irradiation; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Polyethylene oxides; Scanning electron microscopy; Suspensions (fluids); Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamic properties; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Viscoelasticity; Gamma irradiation; Initial concentration; Melting and crystallization temperatures; Nanocomposite hydrogels; One step synthesis; Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO); Rheological property; Viscoelastic properties; Gold nanoparticles; gold nanoparticle; macrogol; Article; controlled study; cross linking; differential scanning calorimetry; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; enthalpy; gamma irradiation; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrogel; one step synthesis; particle size; pH; scanning electron microscopy; suspension; synthesis; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076684757

The Mg-12M−160 composite had a hydrogen storage capacity of 0.63 wt% at −196 °C and 8.3 bar, although further hydrogen adsorption at higher pressures is expected. Structural defects play a significant role in the adsorption capacity.

Producing biogas by using chicken manure as raw materials would provide solutions to environmental pollution because it was able to reduce the smell of ammonia gas. These problems can be overcome simultaneously by making it into biogas that can be used by the communities, especially those who live in rural areas. The economic value and effectiveness of biogas were tested in this study by analyzing the price of raw materials, time last of biogas, and the price of 3 kg Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), and the duration of use. The biogas process used simple technology (Digester) containing 6 main components in the form of a mixing bath, the main storage tank, a biogas storage tank, a bio-slurry storage tank (unused biogas waste), pipes of various sizes, opening valves or gas pressure cover and gauge. Additional components include a gas stove, gas tap, gas hose, and pipe glue. The raw material (chicken manure) that has been prepared was mixed with water with a comparison (1:1), stirred evenly then put into the main tub. This process was left for some time (7-10 hours). The analysis results showed that biogas, which was made with basic ingredients of chicken manure was still effective, compared to using gas from a 3 kg tube with a market price of IDR 35,000. The effectiveness of biogas can be seen from the price of basic ingredients, which was only IDR 10,000 per 20 kg. If it was processed to be biogas, it could produce biogas with an average usage time of 1.6 hours, while the average usage time was 3.8 hours for 3 kg LPG tubes. For four treatments (20, 40, 60, and 80 kg), the overall price was IDR 100,000, with the usage time was 12.5 hours, while the gas tube was 3 kg (3x4 treatments), resulting in the price of IDR 140,000 for the same usage time. Based on the data above showed that the use of chicken manure as a raw material for biogas can still be relatively more effective compared to 3 kg LPG. © 2020 SERSC.","Alternative energy; Biogas; Chicken manure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084089602

However, the effect of plant origin and the duration of the artificial chilling period on plant productivity are not yet fully understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of cold storage duration in the production and development of ‘Kwanza’ raspberry in Odemira, Portugal (37°35’05”N; 8°40’36”W). Plants of Portuguese and Dutch origin were stored at 1°C for 11 and 15 weeks (short-term), later referred as treatments “STPt” and “STHol”, respectively, or for 42 and 46 weeks at -1°C (long-term), later referred as treatments “LTPt” and “LTHol”, respectively. These plants were grown in pots with coconut fiber substrate with varying long-cane density per pot, but with the same density m-1 at planting. Short-term plants from Portugal and Holland produced 3919 and 4409 g of commercial quality fruit m-1, respectively and the production of long-term plants from Portugal and Holland was 744 and 806 g of fruit m-1, respectively. Short-term plants were planted later (February) than long-term plants (November) and benefited from longer photoperiod and higher temperatures than long-term stored plants. This increased availability of light and temperature had a pivotal role to achieve not only higher yield, but also higher fruit quality since fruits from plants of short-term storage were larger and less misshapen. Overall, plants that stayed in the cold for a shorter period were more vigorous, less susceptible to diseases, and had a greater number of fruiting laterals. Moreover, starch root percentage was different (P&lt;0.05) between treatments. STPt and STHol had 3 and 5 mg of starch 100 mg-1 of root dry weight, respectively whereas STPt and STHol had 0.7 and 0.8 mg of starch 100 mg-1 of root dry weight, respectively. These data demonstrate that long duration storage leads to a greater consumption of root carbohydrate storage resulting in lower productivity. Strategies to increase energy storage in the root should be developed and implemented. Currently, farmers need to evaluate whether out-of-season production using long-term stored plants is economically viable despite lower productivity. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

To unburden the transmission system operators from this strain, the dispensable wind energy can locally be stored in an energy carrier, e.g. ammonia (NH3). Existing work considers fixed operational parameters during design optimization to represent real-life conditions of the Power-to-NH3 system. However, uncertainties significantly affect real-life performances, which can lead to suboptimal plants. To provide a robust design—least sensitive to uncertainties—we considered the main operational uncertainties during design optimization and illustrated the contribution of each uncertainty on the systems NH3 production. This work presents the optimization under uncertainty of the Power-to-NH3 process and a global sensitivity analysis on the optimized designs. The results revealed a design trade-off, where a productive design produces 3.2 times more NH3 on average, but is 2.6 times less robust (higher standard deviation) than the robust design. A global sensitivity analysis on the most robust design showed that the temperature fluctuation of the NH3 reactor dominates the average NH3 production by 99.7%. The same sensitivity analysis on the most productive design showed that the wind speed measurement error and the temperature variation are both influencing the ammonia production by respectively 75.4% and 22.5%. Accordingly, an accurate anemometer and improving the temperature control over the NH3 reactor are the most effective actions to make the most productive design more robust. However, a robust plant can be obtained by decreasing the load size of the plant. It suffices to improve the temperature control over the NH3 reactor to make this design (adopted from the trade-off) less sensitive to the noise. Future investigations involve analyzing the dynamic operations of the robust Power-to-NH3 pathway and analyze the impact of uncertainties on its levelized cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage system; Haber-Bosch synthesis; Power-to-ammonia; Robust design optimization; Seasonal hydrogen storage","Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission; Hydrogen storage; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature control; Temperature distribution; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Global sensitivity analysis; Operational parameters; Optimization under uncertainty; Robust design optimization; Temperature fluctuation; Transmission system operators; Wind speed measurement; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077996289

A challenge arises from the capacitance value selection based on DC-link stability due to the influence of multiple hardware parameters, control parameters, operating conditions and cross-coupling effects among them. This paper discusses an impedance-based methodology to determine the minimum required DC-link capacitance value that can enable stable operation of the system in this multi-dimensional variable space. A broad landscape of the minimum capacitance values is also presented to provide insights on the sensitivity of system stability to operating conditions. The target example considered is an HEV e-Drive power electronic system consisting of one bidirectional dc/dc converter and two three-phase electric machine drive inverters, sharing a common dc-link. Since PWM power converters are nonlinear, the system stability is analyzed using operating point dependent, small-signal models.

However, clear distinctions between particular mechanisms occurring in-plasma and post-plasma treatment performed at medium pressure are up-to-the-minute missing and are therefore constituting the study aim. Polyethylene films were subjected to N2 and Ar plasma using a dielectric barrier discharge operating at 5.0 kPa with a minimally oxygen-contaminated chamber. A distinctive combination of optical emission spectroscopy and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize in-plasma species/surface interactions. Post-plasma oxidation was unraveled by exposing plasma-treated samples to ambient air and performing ex-situ XPS. In-situ XPS showed remarkably high nitrogen (20.6%) with negligible oxygen incorporation (2.8%) thus exceptionally enhancing N-selectivity when comparing to the state-of-the-art. More oxygen (5.9%) was however detected after Ar activation due to high energy metastables dissociating O2 impurities. Upon exposure to ambient air, post-plasma oxidation occurred producing more oxygen mainly in the form of O-C=O and N-C=O groups on N2-activated surfaces and C-O groups on Ar-activated surfaces. Above a certain storage time, physical processes of polymeric chain reorientation prevailed over chemical processes.

However, postharvest losses in sub-Saharan African countries range from 20 to 80%. To reduce postharvest vegetables loss, there is a need for affordable and locally available technologies. The aims of this study were a) to compare the efficiency of different zero energy cooling chambers (ZECCs) at reducing temperature, maintaining humidity and prolonging shelf-life of stored vegetables, and b) to assess with farming communities in rural Mali, the efficacy and potential for adoption of different clay pot cooling systems. Different ZECC types (bricks, sacks and straw) as well as clay pots (pot-in-pot, cylinder-pot-in-dish and round-pot-in-dish) were constructed and installed. Temperature and humidity were monitored regularly. Different vegetables were placed in ZECCs and pots in order to assess the effect on shelf-life. The control mimicked the traditional storage practice and similar vegetables were stored using baskets. The results indicated that the ZECC made from bricks significantly reduced temperature and increased humidity up to 90%. The straw and sack ZECCs held less water and thus needed the water replenishing more frequently than the brick ZECCs. The zeer pot, the pot-in-pot system provided reduced temperature and an increased humidity. As a result, the shelf life of the vegetables was longer in the brick ZECCs and pots-in-pots followed by the grass. Overall, these results indicated that ZECCs and clay pot evaporative cooling chambers could play significant role in poor, rural communities to improve incomes and income stability by reducing post-harvest losses through extending vegetable shelf-life. Hence, policy makers should promote and enable implementation of these simple technologies in major vegetable producing and small market locations. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

However, the conductivity (∼103 S m-1) obtained by this method needs to be improved to compete with ink-jet printing of carbon-based materials. The reason behind the low conductivity achieved by the DLW process is due to the crystallinity and hybridization of bonding in carbonaceous structures. In this work, the DLW process has been implemented in two steps: the first step called carbonization was performed by writing pulsed CO2 laser on PI to form tracks which consist of amorphous tetrahedral carbon (a mixture of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon) having intrinsically low conductivity. The second step called graphitization is overwriting of the laser on the pre-carbonized tracks to convert sp3 hybridized bonds to sp2 hybridized bonds by the process called laser graphitization. The conductivity of tracks carbonized at (0.21 ± 0.02) W and fluence (3.31 ± 0.32) × 103 mJ cm-2 at a repetition rate of 0.1 kHz was 56.1 ± 3.1 S m-1 which increased to 146.7 ± 5.1 S m-1 upon overwriting with the laser at (0.50 ± 0.03) W and fluence (7.88 ± 0.47) × 103 mJ cm-2 at the same repetition rate. The photothermal process of carbonization and graphitization is modeled for the DLW process and the threshold power of both the processes is calculated and validated by Raman spectroscopy. Improved conductivity achieved by detailed understanding of the laser and material parameters involved in this transformation enables process optimization leading to future applications in scalable manufacturing of flexible bio-sensors and electrochemical energy storage devices. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide lasers; Carbonization; Cost effectiveness; Crystallinity; Graphite; Graphitization; Ink jet printing; Optimization; Polyimides; Pulsed lasers; Carbon based materials; Carbonaceous structure; Direct laser writing; Electrochemical energy storage devices; Future applications; Material parameter; Photothermal process; Tetrahedral carbon; Laser materials processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083106666

A thorough techno-economic analysis is conducted for the integrated system to evaluate system-wide environmental impacts and economic costs.

Based on the heat of formation, desoprtion temperature, activation energies computed from DFT calculations and KMC simulations, we show that the MgNiH3 involves a fast kinetic while it is thermodynamically unstable (−9.96 kJ/mol.H2; 76.61 K) whereas MgCoH3 has a high thermodynamic stability (−73.32 kJ/mol.H2; 560.97 K) which prevents their application for mobile hydrogen storage. On the other hand, the electronic structures show that the Ni weakens the strong Co[sbnd]H bonding of the mixture MgCo0.5Ni0.5H3, which enhances significantly its stability and its desorption temperature (−45.92 kJ/mol.H2 and 351.33 K) without reducing its high volumetric capacity 133.73 g.H2/l. Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations show that MgCo0.5Ni0.5H3 exhibits a fast charging time (only 4.6 min at 400 K and 10 bar).

An enhanced maximum power point tracking technique (MPPTT) used for WPGS is presented first. Then, operation of the battery is moderated using a battery control unit which supervises the different modes of operation and ensures a constant dc-bus voltage under different circumstances such as variable wind speed and loading events. Thirdly, a variable modulation index technique is suggested for load voltage regulation in terms of both rms and frequency. Finally, a control strategy for managing the power flow is suggested with an examination based on both generated and consumed powers and the BSS state-of-charge (SOC). An experimental setup has been established to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach during several circumstances.

We focus on the progress made in the integration of the geothermal water as energy input for thermal desalination processes. In the second part, we inventory the Tunisian desalination status by exploring the conventional desalination plants and those driven by geothermal energy. Thermal waters having temperatures between 30 and 80°C characterize the geothermal potential of the southern Tunisia. The technical properties of the local existing wells promote the feasibility of geothermal brackish water desalination based on multi-effect distillation process. Using the SWOT analysis tool, we prove that geothermal energy is appropriate to supply remote communities of the southern Tunisia in fresh water.

Also, La0.7 Sr0.27 Ca0.03 MnO3 (LSCMO) nanoparticles have been synthesized through solution combustion using urea as fuel. In this paper, the combustion process was carried out with a fuel to oxidant ratio giving fuel deficient conditions ( \phi &lt; {1} ). The thermal analysis (TGA) indicate that the organic residues from the urea-nitrates gel mixture are eliminated above 600 °C and the post-synthesis heat treatment yields the formation of the desired phase without impurities. The obtained phases were analyzed using X-ray diffraction. The infrared analysis confirms the purity of the samples obtained using urea. However, the sample obtained using glycine confirms the formation of SrCO3. The morphology was analyzed using a FE-SEM microscope, and it was found that the particles present a spherical shape with a mean size of around 45 nm in the selected samples.

Therefore, this study presents five potential energy carriers for overseas energy transport; liquifed natural gas (LNG), dimethyl ether (DME), liquid ammonia, methanol and liquid hydrogen which are used to carry the energy of natural gas in liquefied form from a supplied region to a demanded region. During the supply chain of the energy carriers, the amount of boil-off gas (BOG) for each energy carrier is calculated. A sensitivity analysis affecting BOG rates is implemented under variety of parameters, namely; ambient temperature, storage pressure, land storage time, ocean transportation time, heel percentage and pumping time. This study shows that the daily BOG rates for LNG, DME, ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen are calculated as 0.471%, 0.159%, 0.129%, 0.049%, and 3.438%, respectively. Methanol delivers the greatest mass, DME delivers the greatest energy and hydrogen loses the greatest mass as BOG during the supply chain. The highest BOG generation mainly occurs during ocean transportation phase, implying that ocean transportation time is the most critical parameter among the studied parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia; Boil-off gas; DME; LNG; Methanol; Sensitivity analysis","Ammonia; Methanol; Natural gas transportation; Potential energy; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Wetlands; Boil off gas; Dimethyl ethers; Energy transport; Liquid hydrogens; Storage pressures; Sustainable solution; Technological barriers; Transportation time; Liquefied natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081254357

The as-prepared coatings of variable thickness (100–175 nm) were found to have low refractive index (1.250–1.275), high porosity (36%–42%), and maximum light transmittance up to 99.8%. Water-repellence of the surface was due to high water contact angle (90°) and low contact angle hysteresis (1–2°). Ellipsometric porosimetry and transmission electron microscopy measurements confirmed the microporous structure of the coatings. A systematic investigation for studying the durability and the deterioration of optical and surface properties was studied during aqueous soaking tests at different pH. During these experiments atomic force microscopy showed that the morphology of the surface did not change. The changes in the wetting properties were also confirmed by surface free energy measurements and an increase of the polar component was observed. The optical properties could be regenerated completely or partially after the soaking via heat treatment at 400 °C. The light transmittance of the samples remained high after the soaking, most likely due to the swelling of the solid matrix. The light transmittance and the water-repellent properties of the coatings showed long-term stability up to a year of storage. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antireflection; Hybrid silica; Sol-gel coating; Water imbibition; Water-repellence","Coatings; Contact angle; Deterioration; Durability; Free energy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microporosity; Morphology; Refractive index; Silica; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Anti-reflection; Hybrid silica; Sol-gel coatings; Water imbibition; Water repellence; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081012397

Our calculation results revealed that the bond length between M–O (M= Ti, V, Zr and Hf) of the metal-oxide cluster is proportional to the atomic radius of M in metal-oxide cluster. The increasing of the M–O distance results in enhancement of electric dipole moment of the M-MOF-525. Moreover, it was found that the averaged M-O distances are 2.10, 2.05, 2.24 and 2.25 Å for Ti-, V-, Zr- and Hf-MOF-525, respectively. To investigate the hydrogen adsorption property, all possible hydrogen adsorption sites in the M-MOF-525 must be firstly searched. According to our calculation results, five stable hydrogen adsorption sites were found. For each adsorption site, two orientations of the H[sbnd]H bonding, namely parallel and perpendicular directions, were considered. Based on our calculation results, it was found that the Ti- and V-MOF-525 are unable to bind a hydrogen molecule on their surfaces, whereas a hydrogen molecule can trap on the surface of the Zr- and Hf-MOF-525. This is owing to stronger electric dipole moments of Zr- and Hf-MOF-525 in comparison to Ti- and V-MOF-525. For the Zr-MOF-525, the hydrogen molecule can trap on this structure with hydrogen adsorption energy ranging from 0.04–0.15 eV/H2. Additionally, the hydrogen binding energies of the Hf-MOF-525 range from 0.06 to 0.16 eV/H2. According to our computational results, it was obviously seen that hydrogen adsorption energy of the site near metal oxide cluster is always larger than that of the TpCPP linker. Lastly, we also found that the interaction between the hydrogen molecule and the M-MOF-525 host is mainly governed by a weak dispersive interaction. © 2020 The Physical Society of the Republic of China (Taiwan)","Electric dipole moment; Hydrogen binding energy; Hydrogen storage; Metal–Organic Framework-525; Van der Waals density functional",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080968900

Calcination of milled powders at 1200 °C for 6 h and 12 h results in mixed hexagonal and Perovskite BaTiO3 phases. Perovskite phase pure structure is obtained after calcination of 24 h. Further, this phase pure structure is observed to be stable for longer periods of calcination time, i.e., up to 72 h with grain size of ~ 150 nm. Colossal dielectric constant of 1.38 × 106 at log f = 1.3 is observed after calcination for 24 h. Slight increase in dielectric constant, i.e., 2.13 × 106, is observed after calcination for 72 h.

We use the Korringa – Kohn - Rostoker (KKR) calculation combined with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) in this work. In particular, we find that the formation energy increases with the increasing VMg concentration and, vice versa, for the desorption temperature in MgH2. We also find that the magnesium vacancy defects have an effect on the gravimetric hydrogen capacity by making the magnesium hydride more lightweight. Moreover, the densities of states (DOS) indicate that the stability of MgH2 decreases with the increasing VMg concentration by shifting the Mg and H states to the conduction band (CB). In particular, we observe that it is difficult, after ∼4.8%, to storage the hydrogen into the system without cooling, because the desorption temperature becomes less than 0 °C. We also find that the optimal VMg concentration for the hydrogen vehicles is about 3.7% because its desorption temperature is close to the operating temperature of most modern vehicle engines. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Ab initio calculations; Desorption temperature; Formation energy; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; Vacancy defects","Binary alloys; Calculations; Defects; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Ab initio calculations; Desorption temperatures; Formation energies; Magnesium hydride; Vacancy Defects; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080046469

As a key contribution, we investigate the market equilibrium point when only one firm acts as an EV aggregator taking advantage of the management of the storage assets. To do so, a Stackelberg game is stated as a bi-level optimization problem where the maximization of the EV aggregator profit is regarded as the leader's optimization problem, and the set of hourly economic dispatches and the corresponding locational marginal prices (LMPs) are determined by a benevolent system operator (the follower's optimization problem). The model was applied in the IEEE RTS test system and the Colombian electricity market. The best solution for the EV aggregator does not require a significant share of the existing storage capacity. However, despite the loss of efficiency observed in the short-term energy market, the oligopolistic solution leads to flattening load curves and, therefore, a better use of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Electric vehicle; Energy market; EV Aggregator; Policy; Prosumer; Vehicle to grid","Costs; Electric industry; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Optimization; Public policy; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Energy markets; EV Aggregator; Locational marginal prices; Prosumer; Short term energy markets; Transmission and distribution; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079676394

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which are one solution to combat the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, also require private investment for widespread deployment. This paper develops a methodology for applying Real Options Analysis to a BESS project from the perspective of private investors to determine the optimal investment time and BESS capacity size (MWh). Two models with different timescales are utilized: the operational model which is hourly, and the planning model which is yearly. The operational model is solved using a reinforcement learning algorithm called Deterministic Policy Gradient, while the planning model is solved using a MATLAB inbuilt nonlinear global optimiser called patternsearch. The methodology is demonstrated for a 100 MW BESS connected to the Irish grid and trading exclusively in the day-ahead market. Three different BESS CAPEX future realisations are analysed along with three different BESS manufacturers’ degradation warranties for C-Rates under 0.37C. The results show that BESS CAPEX has minimal influence on investment timing but has a significant effect on BESS size. Furthermore, extrapolating degradation warranty for C-Rates greater than 0.37C does not influence optimal investment timing or sizing, while a change in BESS energy retention limit at year 10 can have a significant influence on the viability of a BESS project. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm; Net Present Value; Real Option Analysis; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic optimization","Battery storage; Commerce; Deregulation; Electric batteries; Global optimization; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Privatization; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Timing circuits; Battery degradation; Battery energy storage systems; Net present value; Policy gradient; Real option analysis; Stochastic optimizations; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079628840

A comparative experiment was conducted in order to find the suitable process parameters for convective drying that may be considered as the alternatives to freeze-drying, which is a widely used preservation method for raspberry even though it is a costly and energy-consuming method. Twelve convective drying regimens were applied with a combination of three influencing factors: air temperature (60°C, 70°C, and 80°C), air rate (0.5 and 1.5 m·s−1), and stage of raspberry (fresh and frozen). The final product, a dried raspberry, was assessed for chemical, physical, and mechanical properties and rehydration capacity. Deep ranking analysis by power eigenvectors (DRAPE) and sum of ranking differences (SRD) were used to uncover the differences and similarities between the applied drying methods. SRD showed that convective drying of fresh raspberries proved to be more similar to freeze-dried raspberries than convective drying of frozen ones. Fresh samples dried at 60 °C air temperature and 1.5 m·s−1 air flow proved to be the most similar to the reference freeze-drying method. This convective regimen gives samples with the lowest color change, shrinkage, and shape deformation. With the mechanical and chemical properties of these samples being observed, statistical Duncan's test show that there is no significant difference (P &lt;.05) in terms of hardness, shear force resistance, total phenolic, and total flavonoid preservation, compared with freeze-dried samples. DRAPE gave similar results, but it added the variable importance in ranking as well, and total phenol reduction was defined as the most important variable. These results can help practitioners to develop cheaper and simpler drying methods that would replace the freeze-drying but keep the same quality of the dried products. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bioactive compounds; deep ranking analysis by power eigenvectors; freeze-drying; physico-mechanical properties; sum of ranking differences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079037111

This feature was exploited in the surface modification of κ-carrageenan gel beads for successful protease immobilization. The optimum PAMAM pH was at 2.1 and 9.3. However, treatment of κ-carrageenan gel beads at the higher pH showed re-usability for more than seven successive times. As a result of central composite design optimization, the maximum immobilization yield was obtained by soaking 8 U for 24 h. The comparative thermodynamics studies showed an enhancement in the thermal stability at high temperature for the immobilized protease as well as increased half-life time from 24.06 min to 79.95 min. Also, the D-values increased from 165.03 min to 548.23 min for free and immobilized enzyme, respectively. Moreover, the enzyme stability enhancement for the immobilized protease catalyst was accompanied with a remarkable increase in the enthalpy and in the free energy. Immobilized protease onto Carr-PAMAM gel beads can retain 89% of its initial activity and lost only 11% after 8 weeks of storage at 4 °C.

Green precipitates were obtained post-drying which were thermally oxidised to pure single phase monoclinic CuO at 500 °C as per the XRD analysis. Further characterization of un-annealed and annealed samples was carried out using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Optical Microscope (OPM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Zeta potential, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Diffuse Reflectance (DR), UV–Vis and Photoluminescence measurements (PL). Electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SEM and OPM analysis on un-annealed and annealed samples reveal elongate and dense cubic agglomerate nanoparticles respectively. EDS spectra confirmed high purity phase composition of CuO. HRTEM analysis of annealed samples revealed a densed cubic nanoparticles, while selected electron area diffraction (SAED) and XRD patterns shows well-crystalline nanoparticles. FTIR/ATR spectra display peaks at 480 and 525 cm−1, which are characteristic peaks of CuO. Zeta potential measurement of annealed samples recorded a value of −6.58 mV. TGA analysis indicated the thermal stability of CuO while XPS analysis confirmed synthesis of pure single phase CuO. Value of energy band gap obtained from diffuse reflectance spectrum was 1.3 eV. From electrochemical study, maximum areal capacitance achieved was 39.45 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 20 mV/s.

The MnO2 was deposited onto platinum substrate using electrodeposition technique and collected as powder cathode in the new battery. The influences of temperature and precursor pH on the MnO2 film properties were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the MnO2 deposit. The XRD and TEM demonstrate that the MnO2 was deposited in its γ-MnO2 phase with a particle size less than 15 nm. In addition, the pH solution plays a key role in the electrochemical performance of the MnO2 as a cathode. Indeed, the γ-MnO2 deposited at pH = 2 provides a high discharge performance in KOH and NH4Cl aqueous electrolytes. This led to a new Mn/MnO2 cell with better performance compared to the classical Zn/MnO2 cell in terms of discharge in NH4Cl electrolyte. During the discharge process, co-insertion of Mn2+ and H+ promotes the transformation of MnO2 into MnxMnO4, MnOOH, and Mn2O3. In addition, the Mn/MnO2 cells exhibits a high output voltage &gt;2 V in NH4Cl. It reach a high voltage at around 1.89 V after 3 h of continuous discharge. The cells can achieve a discharge capacity of 1000 mA h.g−1 at a current density of 330 mA g−1 with the highest specific energy of 1890 mWh.g−1. Moreover, Mn/MnO2 cells are more stable in NH4Cl electrolyte which exhibits a voltage drop of 6% after 3 h of continuous discharge.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of 4 weeks high-sucrose diet (HSD) feeding in C57BL6/J mice, with specific focus on adipocyte function. Mice fed HSD had slightly increased adipose tissue mass but displayed similar hepatic triglycerides, glucose and insulin levels, and glucose clearance capacity as chow-fed mice. Interestingly, we found adipose depot-specific differences, where both the non- and insulin-stimulated glucose transports were markedly impaired in primary adipocytes isolated from the inguinal fat depot from HSD-fed mice. This was accompanied by decreased protein levels of both GLUT4 and AS160. A similar but much less pronounced trend was observed in the retroperitoneal depot. In contrast, both GLUT4 expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were preserved in adipocytes isolated from epididymal adipose tissue with HSD. Further, we found a slight shift in cell size distribution towards larger cells with HSD and a significant decrease of ACC and PGC-1α expression in the inguinal adipose tissue depot. Moreover, fructose alone was sufficient to decrease GLUT4 expression in cultured, mature adipocytes. Altogether, we demonstrate that short-term HSD feeding has deleterious impact on insulin response and glucose transport in the inguinal adipose tissue depot, specifically. These changes occur before the onset of systemic glucose dysmetabolism and therefore could provide a mechanistic link to overall impaired energy metabolism reported after prolonged HSD feeding, alone or in combination with HFD. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Fructose; Glucose transport; GLUT4; High-sucrose diet","fructose; glucose; glucose transporter 4; insulin; sucrose; triacylglycerol; ACC1 protein, mouse; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; glucose; glucose transporter 4; guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; Ppargc1a protein, mouse; Slc2a4 protein, mouse; sucrose; Tbc1d4 protein, mouse; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell isolation; cell size; controlled study; epididymis fat; glucose level; glucose transport; high-sucrose diet; inguinal fat; insulin level; lipid storage; male; mass; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal; body weight; C57BL mouse; cell differentiation; cytology; glucose blood level; inguinal canal; insulin resistance; metabolism; obesity; pathology; transport at the cellular level; 3T3-L1 Cells; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Adipocytes; Animals; Biological Transport; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Cell Differentiation; Fructose; Glucose; Glucose Transporter Type 4; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Inguinal Canal; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Sucrose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078284051

Climate change urgently needs to be addressed from an ecological and social perspective. Implementing new indoor urban vertical farming (IUVF) operations is one way to combat the above-mentioned issues as well as foodborne illnesses, scarcity of drinking water, and more crop failure due to infection from plant pathogens and insect pests. A promising production mode is plant factories (PFs), which are indoor plant production systems completely isolated from outside environment. This paper mainly focuses on the comprehensive review of scientific papers in order to analyse the different applications of urban farming (UF) based on three different dimensions: a) the manufacturing techniques and equipment used; b) the energy that these systems require, the distribution of energy, and ways to minimize the energy-related cost; and c) the technological innovations applied in order to optimize the cultivation possibilities of IUVF. © 2020, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Energy demand; Plant factories; Urban farming; Water-food-energy Nexus","arable land; bibliography; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; drinking water; innovation; manufacturing; optimization; pathogen; urban agriculture; Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077849367

In this work a novel cTnT-molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based electrochemical sensor using a screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was developed. The MIP sensor employed an electrodeposited polymethylene blue (PMB) redox probe on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified SPCE, with the electropolymerized polyaniline around the immobilized cTnT templates. The sensor response was performed using differential pulse voltammetry, wherein the decrease in the PMB current correlated with an increase in the concentration of cTnT. Linearity was obtained in the range of 0.10–8.0 pg mL−1 with a detection limit of 0.040 pg mL−1. The MIP sensor exhibited an excellent binding affinity (KD = 2.8 × 10-13 mol L−1), high selectivity and good stability, whilst retaining more than 90 % of the sensitivity after 6 weeks of storage at room temperature. The determination of cTnT in human plasma using the developed sensor compared well with the gold standard electrochemiluminescense method (P &gt; 0.05).

One promising carbon capture technology is chemical-looping combustion (CLC). In CLC the reactors are filled with metal oxide bed material called oxygen carriers. The interaction between oxygen carriers and biomass ashes is a poorly explored field. To make CLC a viable process, and thereby creating carbon emission reductions, more knowledge about the interactions between biomass ashes and oxygen carriers is needed. This study investigated solid-state reactions of three promising oxygen carriers, hematite, hausmannite and synthesised ilmenite with different biomass ash components. Oxygen carriers were exposed with the ash components: calcium carbonate, silica and potassium carbonate at 900 °C and at different reducing potentials. Crystalline phases of the exposed samples were determined using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the oxygen carriers hausmannite and hematite interact to a higher extent compared to synthesised ilmenite regarding both physical characteristics and detectable phases. Synthesised ilmenite formed new phases only in systems including potassium. Thermodynamic calculations were performed on the multicomponent system and compared with experimental results. The results suggest that optimisation of systems involving manganese and potassium should be performed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass ash; Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC); Ilmenite; Oxygen carrier","Biomass; Calcium carbonate; Combustion; Emission control; Hematite; Ilmenite; Metals; Oxygen; Potash; Silica; Solid state reactions; Biomass ashes; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon emission reductions; Chemical-looping combustion; Oxygen Carrier; Powder X ray diffraction; Renewable energy systems; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076281926

Changes in biomass partitioning between above- and belowground components of plant community biomass as a consequence of nutrient enrichment can impact those services profoundly. However, the evidence for such impacts is largely confined to North America, leaving a gap in global understanding of coastal ecosystem resilience. Using field surveys across 15 saltmarshes along the south and east coasts of Ireland, we tested whether aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) plant biomass allocation across all plant assemblages combined and within individual plant assemblages is related to soil nutrients. AG biomass and AG/BG biomass ratio were positively related, and BG biomass was negatively related to NOx −, both across all assemblages combined and within individual assemblages. AG biomass and AG/BG ratio were also positively related to NH4 + within individual assemblages, but not across all of them combined. The relationships between biomass and labile P were weaker, and their direction varied across the whole P gradient and among individual assemblages. These findings demonstrate broad, community-wide links between biomass allocation and soil nutrients in saltmarshes. The up to 6.6-fold increase in AG/BG biomass ratio along the N gradient, coupled with differential responses among functionally contrasting plants, could have significant implications for multiple saltmarsh functions such as energy fixation for consumers, wave attenuation, sediment binding and carbon storage. Improved understanding of the underlying causalities would help promoting saltmarsh resilience. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","biomass partitioning; coastal resilience; ecosystem services; functional group; nutrient enrichment; oxidised nitrogen; primary production; saltmarsh functioning","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; nutrient dynamics; saltmarsh; soil nitrogen; temperate environment; Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070286880

The aim of this study was to develop and optimize a method for the synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) from ethanolic extracts of fruits of Annona muricata as well as to characterize the green synthesized AgNPs. AgNPs were synthesized via AgNO3 solution. The AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. The formed AgNPs had an absorption maximum of 427 nm and were stable under different temperature, pH and storage conditions. Fourier Transform Infrared Resorption spectroscopy revealed the functional groups responsible for the synthesis and stabilization of the AgNPs. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis revealed a spherical nature of the AgNPs. Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy showed presence of Ag, Cl, Ca, and Si with Ag having the highest composition at 80%. X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering revealed a crystalline nature of AgNPs with an average size of 60.12 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.1235 respectively. Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis further confirmed the crystalline and spherical nature of the AgNPs. In this article, an efficient, eco-friendly and low-cost method for the synthesis and recovery of stable AgNPs using ethanolic extracts of Annona muricata fruits as both reducing and capping agents has been reported.

Conventional synthesis of hydrogels was carried out at a temperature of 60 °C for 90 min, while microwave synthesis lasted only 2 min, providing energy, time and reaction components saving. The effect of formulation synthesis parameters such as feed composition (monomers ratio and crosslinking agent content) and initiator types on the hydrogels properties was investigated. Molecular structure of obtained hydrogels was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results of hydrogel swelling measurements indicated the differences between synthesis methods, monomers ratio, amount of crosslinking agent and type of applied initiator. Dynamic rheological measurements have shown that the mechanical strength of hydrogels increases with increase in the acrylic acid amount in hydrogels structure, which was manifested in increased storage modulus values. Also, frequency sweep tests have shown that conventionally synthesized hydrogels have higher storage modulus values than corresponding hydrogels synthesized by microwave method, which implies their higher mechanical strength. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements have shown that microwave synthesized hydrogels have higher glass transition temperature values which implied their higher degree of crosslinking. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns have demonstrated the amorphous nature of hydrogels, which is consistent with the results of swelling and DSC measurements. Conducted investigation emphasizes the possibility of wider application of microwave irradiation in the synthesis of acrylate-based hydrogels with applicable properties. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Glass transition temperature; Microwave synthesis; Poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels; Swelling ratio","Acrylic monomers; Amides; Carboxylic acids; Differential scanning calorimetry; Elastic moduli; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free radical polymerization; Free radicals; Glass; Glass transition; Microwave heating; Microwave irradiation; Temperature; Conventional synthesis; Cross linking agents; Degree of cross-linking; Dynamic rheological measurements; Microwave synthesis; Poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels; Swelling ratio; Synthesis parameters; Hydrogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068135511

Actually, an efficient transport protocol for these applications must take into account not only reliability and energy consumption factors but also memory occupancy and data delivery delay. Recently, many research works have been conducted in this area, however the proposed protocols treat some of these aspects and neglect others. Contrarily, in this paper we present a novel transport solution designed to provide 100% reliability without making light of other factors. Through different mechanisms, we attempt to reach this objective with congestion avoidance and good performances in terms of energy consumption, delivery delay, and memory storage. The proposed protocol, called congestion avoidance with reliable transmission and energy efficiency (CARTEE), attains these goals through several mechanisms, namely: fixed sliding window transmission, alternative implicit/explicit acknowledgement, a new congestion detection technique, and distributed transmission rate adjustment. To evaluate the proposed protocol, we have conducted simulations using ns-3. The obtained results confirm the efficiency and scalability of CARTEE and demonstrate that it outperforms the recent proposed transport protocols in terms of reliability, congestion avoidance, data cache occupancy, and latency. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Congestion avoidance; Data streaming application; Implicit/explicit acknowledgement; Reliable transport; Sliding window; Transmission rate adaptation; Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cache memory; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Reliability; Congestion avoidance; Data streaming; Implicit/explicit acknowledgement; Reliable transport; Sliding Window; Transmission rate adaptation; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056742340

In this study, a new ICS with Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC) for domestic uses was designed, constructed, tested and numerically studied. The novelty in the designed ICS system is the use of transparent vacuum insulation in the annulus between double half-cylindrical plexiglass, the use of automated insulation system which suppresses heat loss during night. Experimental results showed that the loss coefficient of the ICS decreased from 5.41 W/K.m2 to 3.34 W/K.m2 when we created the vacuum and used the night insulation system. Numerical study was also accomplished by using FORTRAN simulation program solving energy balance equations of the ICS. The program was used to study the effect of pertinent parameters namely night insulation, CPC reflectivity and vacuum on the thermal performance of the system. The analysis results of the water storage tank, the absorber and the plexiglass temperatures showed the validity of the developed model. The parametric study clearly showed that an increase of the concentrator reflectivity yields to an increase of the system efficiency. Numerical study also showed that if we succeed in making perfect night insulation and vacuum, the daily efficiency reaches 58.62% and the loss coefficient decreases significantly to1.68 W/K.m2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrator reflectivity; CPC; ICS; Night insulation; Vacuum creation","Concentration (process); Glazes; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Integrated circuits; Reflection; Compound parabolic concentrator; Energy balance equations; Insulation system; Integrated collector storage; Simulation program; Thermal Performance; Vacuum Insulation; Water storage tanks; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078164872

Due to high cost of tomato seeds, farmers cannot afford economic losses by placing more seeds per planting site in the field. Imported pelleted tomato seeds are also not within their economic limits, resulting in severe competition among tomato plants and ultimately reduction in final yield. An experiment was conducted to improve the plantability and emergence potential of tomato seeds (Roma VF) through optimizing different local low-cost pelleting materials. For this purpose, seeds were pelleted with different combinations of bentonite, China powder, rhizobia, calcium oxide (CaO) and talcum. The results indicate that pelleting had significantly improved emergence potential in terms of final emergence percentage, emergence index and germination energy of tomato seeds, however, the highest value for final emergence (23% more as compared to control) was achieved with combinations of talcum:CaO:talcum:bentonite. Furthermore, seedling length was also improved in pelleted seeds with high vigour, as compared to non-pelleted seeds. The highest values for seedling length was achieved with talcum:CaO:talcum:bentonite. This treatment proved to be the most effective pelleting combination for tomato seeds, requiring less time for imbibition. Storage of pelleted tomato seeds for five months under laboratory conditions also provides better protection against environmental stresses as compared to non-pelleted seeds by providing mechanical support, hence improving storability of tomato seeds. The improved performance of pelleted tomato seeds was associated with improved activity of pelleting material and decreased permeability of cell membrane, hence less leakage of cellular contents during storage. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Changes in energy production and energy metabolism-related enzyme activities contribute to senescence in plants. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) in reducing pericarp browning related to energy metabolism. Fresh longan fruit were fumigated with 0 (control) and 10 mg L−1 ClO2 for 10 min and then stored in a cardboard box at 25 ± 1 °C with 82 % relative humidity for 7 d. It was shown that the activities of energy metabolism-related enzymes, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinyl-CoA synthetase and ATPase (H+-adenosine triphosphatase, Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase and Mg2+-adenosine triphosphatase) decreased during storage. The decreases in the enzyme activities coincided with the decreases in adenosine triphosphate content and energy charge, as well as an increase in pericarp browning of longan. ClO2 treatment increased the energy status significantly and the activities of energy metabolism-related enzymes during the first 2–5 d of storage. Furthermore, ClO2 increased succinyl-CoA and succinate contents as well as respiration rate in the first day of storage. The increases in cellular energy and the activities of energy metabolism-related enzymes by ClO2 were closely associated with the reduction in pericarp browning. It can be concluded that the decline in cellular energy and the activities of enzymes related to energy metabolism involved in browning development of longan fruit and ClO2 could promote and maintain energy production by enhancing the energy metabolism-related enzyme activities, leading to the reduction in pericarp browning of longan fruit during storage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorine dioxide; Dimocarpus longan; Energy metabolism; Respiratory enzymes","chlorine; cytochrome; enzyme activity; food storage; metabolism; relative humidity; respiration; Dimocarpus longan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076273928

Initially, the complex metabolic changes occur in seeds followed by rehydration. The storage lipids and protein act as a source of energy during germination process and following energy requirement is fulfilled from photosynthesis. The cotton crop enters a reproductive growth following a 4-5 weeks of germination. The flavonoids are responsible for appearance of flower's colour. The nutrient uptake increases from flowering to fruiting and declines at maturity. Depending upon the mobility, the nutrients accumulated in leaves are translocated to developing bolls. The developing seeds start accumulation of oil and protein. Among three boll components, the fibres and seed coat are rich in cellulose and starch, respectively. Oil and protein are accumulated in the developing embryos. The oil contents increase with boll age and starch initially increases and then drops down. However, protein contents are initially high and drop down during second week of anthesis and then followed by steady increase. The auxin and ethylene production in developing bolls decreases with age. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Among the numerous desalination processes driven by renewable energies, the seawater greenhouse received much atten-tion for decentralized production of fresh water. The paper deals with an innovative hybrid approach of seawater desalination that has been explored. It combines a seawater greenhouse (SWGH) with a solar pond to produce more fresh water. Furthermore, it enables a better management of brine, which represents a major issue for all desalination processes. Indeed, the rejected brine of the SWGH will be recycled, by using it in a solar pond as a heat storage plant and a heat source to warm the air to more or less than 70°C at the inlet of the second evaporator of the SWGH. The process scheme and the mathematical and software models of both the classical SWGH and of its hybridization with a solar pond are presented. The calculations show that the fresh water production rate of the new SWGH concept is more than five times higher than of the classical SWGH one. Simulations on different Moroccan sites were realized as a case study, to estimate the added value of the new SWGH model and, at the same time, to compare its profitability in these implantation locations. © 2020 Desalination Publications.

In order to reduce their oxidation process and improve their stability in aqueous medium, protein-based nanoemulsions were produced and characterized. Lactoferrin (Lf) was used as an emulsifier at different concentrations (0.2% to 4% w/w). High energy methods (Ultra-Turrax and high-pressure homogenizer) were applied to produce Lf-based nanoemulsions with ω-3 PUFAs encapsulated. The nanoemulsions were characterized in terms of physical and chemical stability at 4 and 25 °C. The results obtained revealed that the Lf concentration influences the nanoemulsion size in a manner that higher Lf concentrations decrease the nanoemulsion size. It was also observed that the nanoemulsions are physically stable when stored at 4 °C for 69 days while at 25 °C they showed instability. The radical scavenging capacity of the nanoemulsions did not show significant changes over storage at 4 and 25 °C while a significant increase in oxidation was observed. The release profile at 37 °C showed that ω-3 PUFAs were slowly released at pH 2 but was rapidly released at pH 7.4 from Lf nanoemulsions. Moreover, MTT assay revealed that 2% (w/w) Lf nanoemulsions with 12.5 μg mL-1 ω-3 PUFAs were not cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. Nanoemulsions with high physical and chemical stability were selected and dried by two different methodologies: freeze-drying and nano spray-drying. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and Circular Dichroism (CD) showed Lf structural changes after the drying processes.

Even though this active volcanic system is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the region, with more than twenty modest (VEI < 4) Holocene eruptions, knowledge of its subsurface structures, internal processes, dynamics, and their relation, is still limited. Seismic interferometry (SI) is a high-resolution technique based on analyses of the interference of the propagation seismic energy at one or many stations. SI can be used to characterize the subsurface properties of a target area. In particular, previous SI studies performed in the area of the PPVC describe specific ranges of depth; therefore, more information is required for a thorough description of the subsurface features in the area and for a better understanding of the PPVC dynamics. We apply SI based on autocorrelations of selected regional and teleseismic events to image the subsurface structures below stations located in Argentina and Chile during 2012. The selection of the events is performed according to their location, magnitude, angle of incidence of P-wave seismic energy, and signal-to-noise ratio in the records. For each station, we extract time windows and we process them using two ranges of frequency, which are sensitive to different depth ranges. This work describes depths and zones previously not analyzed in the area using SI methods. The results not only complement the available geological, geochemical, and geophysical information, but present new information for depths between 10 and ~750 km depth, increasing the general knowledge of the subsurface features in the PPVC. Finally, we also propose a model for the subsurface down to the Moho, which indicates the crustal structure and the likely distribution of magma bodies in depth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Magma storage in depth; Planchón-Peteroa Volcanic Complex; Regional and teleseismic events; Seismic Interferometry","Interferometry; Seismic waves; Seismology; Signal to noise ratio; Geophysical information; High-resolution techniques; Magma storage; Seismic interferometries; Subsurface properties; Subsurface structures; Teleseismic events; Volcanic complex; Volcanoes; crustal structure; depth determination; interferometry; magma; Moho; P-wave; seismic method; signal-to-noise ratio; teleseismic wave; Peteroa Volcano; Planchon Volcano",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079283958

This paper deals with the less popular application of these wastes without the addition of a more competent precursor. Several pastes based on MSW-FA, MSW-BA or MSW-FA+MSW-BA were prepared, using sodium silicate or sodium hydroxide. Their overall performance was then assessed through mechanical (uniaxial compressive strength - UCS and seismic wave velocity), environmental (leaching) and durability tests (freeze-thaw and wetting-drying). Cement stabilised MSW-BA pastes were also tested, for reference. Results showed that a preliminary mechanical activation, achieved by milling, is fundamental; the activation with silicate is more effective than with hydroxide, especially in the case of the MSW-BA pastes, when the UCS values are more than triplicated (3–10 MPa); the MSW-BA is a more competent precursor than the MSW-FA and the durability and leachability of the alkali activated pastes is similar to that obtained with cement. The most performing paste, in terms of UCS, was obtained with BA activated exclusively with sodium silicate, with an activator/precursor weight ratio of 0.5. In general, the low-cost solidification/stabilisation proposed in this study showed competitive with the alternative use of up to 30% cement and should be regarded as a valid alternative for simple storage or low-range applications, in substitution of Portland cement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali activation; Durability; Incineration waste; Leaching; Mechanical performance; Municipal solid waste","Ash handling; Chemical activation; Compressive strength; Durability; Fly ash; Industrial research; Leaching; Portland cement; Silicates; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Waste incineration; Wave propagation; Alkali activated; Alkali activation; Alkaline cements; Mechanical activation; Mechanical performance; Seismic wave velocity; Technical performance; Uniaxial compressive strength; Municipal solid waste; cement; hydroxide; silicate; sodium derivative; sodium hydroxide; sodium silicate; unclassified drug; durability; fly ash; incineration; leaching; mechanical property; municipal solid waste; recycling; slag; alkalinity; Article; compressive strength; controlled study; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental parameters; fly ash; freeze thawing; incineration; leaching; mechanics; municipal solid waste; physical parameters; priority journal; recycling; scanning electron microscopy; seismic wave velocity; slag; solid waste management; wetting drying; X ray diffraction; building material; recycling; solid waste; Coal Ash; Construction Materials; Incineration; Recycling; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077942848

This work presents a generic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the optimal clearing of a wholesale power market including market products widely used in power exchanges such as block and hourly orders. Based on the market clearing results, it then calculates the economic balance of vertically integrated utilities participating in retail markets, covering the whole value chain in the power sector. By considering a wide range of technology options in the wholesale market, including fossil fuel-based thermal units with or without carbon capture and sequestration capability (CCS), nuclear power, renewable energy, electricity trading and storage options, as well as different types of consumers in the retail market (low, medium and high voltage), the model determines the optimal electricity generation mix, the system's marginal price and its environmental performance, as well as the net economic position of each power utility in both wholesale and retail markets. A series of sensitivity analyses on the CO2 emission pricing, the renewables’ penetration, and the applied environmental policy has been conducted to investigate the influence of several economic, technical and policy parameters on the operational scheduling and financial planning of each utility. The model applicability has been assessed in an illustrative case study of a medium-sized power system considering also its interconnections with neighboring power systems. The model results quantify the risk facing electric utilities participating in both wholesale and retail markets under several market conditions and with different schemes on the generation side, as well as with different representation shares on the demand side. The proposed optimization framework can provide useful insights on the determination of the optimal integrated generation and retail portfolios that address the new market operating challenges of contemporary power systems, subject to several technical and economic constraints, enabling also the design of medium-term operational strategies for vertically integrated power utilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Block orders; Energy scheduling; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimization; Power exchanges; Wholesale and retail markets","Carbon capture; Commerce; Electric utilities; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Integer programming; Investments; Nuclear fuels; Optimization; Power markets; Risk management; Sales; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Block orders; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Environmental performance; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimal portfolio management; Power exchange; Retail market; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075903186

To assist these developments, it is necessary to establish simple criteria and relationships between electric double-layer (EDL) capacitance and the nature of porous carbon used as an electrode material. Under special attention is carbide-derived carbon (CDC) due to high content of micropores and well tunable pore size distribution. In the current study, experimentally determined structure descriptors were compiled for 110 CDC materials, and the Quantitative nano-Structure-Property Relationship (QnSPR) approach was used for the statistical analysis and modelling of the EDL capacitance. Experimentally determined structure descriptors – the variable numeric porosity characteristics of CDC materials, were determined from N2 and CO2 adsorption measurements. Electrochemical characterization of CDC based electrodes was performed in 3-electrode test-cells using carbon reference electrode and 1.5 M spiro-(1,1′)-bipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate (SBP–BF4) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. It was shown that combining experimentally derived molecular descriptors of porosity, like specific surface area and volume-fractions of pore size distribution, calculated by density functional theory, allows accurate prediction of EDL capacitance.

This study was conducted to estimate the carbon stock and its contribution to climate change disaster reduction in Zeghie peninsula, Ethiopia. Sample plots were laid along line transects based on altitudinal and slope variation of the study area. A total of 45 plots (40 m × 40 m each) were selected using random sampling techniques. The data obtained from each sample were analyzed by using allometric equations. The results revealed that the mean total carbon stock was 381.41 t/ha, of which 191.58 t/ha, 45.98 t/ha, 0.03 t/ha, 139.04 t/ha and 4.77 t/ha, which were observed in the aboveground carbon, belowground carbon, litter carbon, soil organic carbon in (30 cm depth) and deadwood carbon, respectively. The mean total CO2 equivalent of the study area was also 1399.78 t/ha. In relation to altitudinal gradients and slopes, the result showed that the stock of carbon was variable along the altitudinal variation with a mean value of 420.71t/ha, 458.78t/ha and 516.77t/ha in upper, middle and lower elevations, respectively. While a mean value of carbon along the slope gradient was 401.82t/ha, 439.26t/ha and 516.9t/ha in upper, medium and lower slope classes, respectively. Generally, the carbon stocks in aboveground, belowground, litter and soil organic carbon were exhibited less distinct patterns along altitudinal gradients. The aboveground, belowground, litter and soil organic carbon stocks showed decreasing trend with increasing altitude and slope while dead wood carbon stock showed increasing trend along altitudinal gradients. The total CO2 stored in Zeghie peninsula forestland was approximately 62,990.4 tons annually, but emission was estimated to be 8274.97 tons. Therefore, better management strategies should be designed for the sustainable use of forest resources in the study area which are contributing a significant role to mitigate the current climate change. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass; Blue Nile basin; Climate change; Disaster; Forest carbon stock; Litter; Mitigation; Natural forests; Soil organic carbon; Zeghie","carbon emission; carbon storage; climate change; land cover; land use change; soil carbon; soil organic matter; sustainable development; Blue Nile Basin; Nile Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075331609

This study aimed to determine the effect of land-use changes on plant diversity and soil characteristics of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The conversion of secondary forests to critically degraded land, acacia forest, agroforestry land, rubber gardens, and palm oil plantations by clear-cutting and fire converted organic materials to available nutrients and increased soil pH at the soil surface. However, the nutrients are easily leached by high rainfall intensity thus resulted in a more degraded land at long-term periods. Land-use change resulted in high humic acid levels, aromatic area, hydrophobic surface area, but low water storage capability. This condition made it easily burn during the dry season and is prone to flooding during the rainy season. The Shannon indexes for all tropical peatland land uses at all levels of plant growth categorized plant diversity and number of individuals as low to moderate due to waterlogging, low pH, low soil fertility, high metal toxicity, and fire. Land with oil-, sap- and litter-producing plants, which resist decomposition, and monoculture plantations tended to contain higher amounts of humic acid, hydrophilic areas, aromatic areas, and bulk density than naturally regenerated forests, although these land uses had lower organic C, available N, and water-holding capacity. Closed cycles of organic matter, carbon, water, nutrient, energy, production, and crops should be maintained for rehabilitation of peatland. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Carbon; Forest fire; Land degradation; Productivity; Tropical ecosystem","Aromatic compounds; Carbon; Deforestation; Hydrophobicity; Nutrients; Organic acids; Organic carbon; Palm oil; Productivity; Reforestation; Rubber plantations; Soils; Surface chemistry; Tropics; Wetlands; Available nutrients; Forest fires; Hydrophobic surfaces; Land degradation; Monoculture plantations; Soil characteristics; Tropical ecosystems; Water holding capacity; Land use; agroforestry; bulk density; dry season; flooding; growth; humic acid; land use; land use change; monoculture; peatland; precipitation intensity; rainfall; soil property; species diversity; water storage; Central Kalimantan; Indonesia; Acacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075177003

The Hellisheidi geothermal CHP plant located in SW Iceland, producing 303 MWe and 133–267 MWth in a double flash cycle, is used as a case study for the LCA. The CML-IA baseline and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) methods are used to perform the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), providing results for common environmental impact categories investigated in most LCA studies. The impacts associated with joint production processes for electricity and heat are allocated to the two products by energy allocation. The result show that the construction phase of the plant, mainly drilling and casing of geothermal wells along with construction of collection system for geothermal fluid, is largely responsible for most of the impact category results. However, the global warming potential (GWP100), acidification (AP) and the renewable cumulative energy demand from wind, solar and geothermal energy (CEDR,w,s,g) are mainly affected by the operational phase of the plant, due to direct emissions of gases (mainly CO2 and H2S) and the extraction of geothermal fluid from ground. To explore the effects of currently installed mitigation methods and operational improvements at the Hellisheidi plant, two operation scenarios are investigated within the study; the first based on a previously published dataset for operating conditions at year 2012 and the second, an updated dataset based on inclusion of implemented mitigation methods until the operating year 2017. Due to carbon capture and storage (CCS) by reinjection of CO2 using the CarbFix method developed at Hellisheidi, the GWP100 reduced from 15.9 g CO2eq/kWh to 11.4 g CO2eq/kWh for electricity and 15.8 g CO2eq/kWh to 11.2 CO2eq/kWh for heat over the 30-year operational time under investigation. Similarly, the SulFix method used for reinjection of H2S at Hellisheidi resulted in decreased AP from 9.7 g SO2eq/kWh to 3.6 and 3.5 g SO2eq/kWh and human toxicity (HTP) from 5.8 and 5.5 g 1,4-DB eq/kWh to 5.1 and 4.8 1,4-DB eq/kWh for electricity and heat respectively. The overall CED resulted in 5.2 kW h (18.7 MJ) of energy demand to produce 1 kW h of either electricity or heat, dominated by the use of geothermal energy as mentioned earlier. Non-renewable energy demand (CEDNR) decreased from 6.8 × 10−3 and 5.9 × 10−3 kWh (0.024 and 0.021 MJ) to 5.8 × 10−3 and 5.0 × 10−3 kWh (0.021 and 0.018 MJ), for electricity and heat respectively, by using electrical drills instead of diesel fueled drills for additional wells during the operational time of the power plant. In conclusion, these results indicate a very high environmental performance of the Hellisheidi plant compared to other energy conversion technologies and emphasizes the potential of geothermal energy as a clean energy source for producing electricity and heat. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Combined heat and power plant (CHP); Geothermal energy; Global warming potential (GWP100); Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Drills; Electric power generation; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal wells; Global warming; Infill drilling; Life cycle; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Cumulative energy demands; Energy conversion technologies; Environmental performance; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Operational improvements; Geothermal energy; carbon sequestration; data set; environmental impact; geothermal energy; geothermal system; heat production; high temperature; life cycle analysis; power plant; Iceland; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074751840

This study is part of a broader investigation of the environmental conditions that facilitated and/or triggered the development of a mixed herding and hunting economic strategy during the late Holocene. The results suggest ongoing local moisture availability for most of the late Holocene; between 2400 and 1500 BP there was a stable, low energy environment that supported a vegetated floodplain, resulting in high availability of pasture and water. However, throughout most of the studied period, there were punctual arid episodes and erosion of the river catchment. High environmental variability post-3000 cal BP could have put a premium on strategies to reduce the risk associated with resource unpredictability, such as economic specialization and intensification and storage practices designed to control and mitigate resource variability.

All the proposed scenarios were found to be economically feasible. The cumulative discount production costs, over the coming thirty five years under different fuel prices assumption, is less than 80 billion dollars (2010 dollar) for all proposed scenario. In the 100% renewable electricity scenario, the country needs around 10.6 GW of concentrated solar power, 4.5 GW of wind, and 25 GW of photovoltaic to meet the demand in the year 2050 which are achievable in terms of energy resources. The dispatchability problem of the renewable scenario was solved by proposing a 90 GWh storage system (43 CSP plants, 250 MW each, 8 h storage).

For non-aqueous RFBs, low-cost redox pairs with good reversibility and high solubility in the organic solvents are exploited to improve battery performance. In this work, two metal complexes, containing cheap and abundant cerium, were proposed with a very good electrochemical reversibility (Ce4+/Ce3+) in acetonitrile. As proof-of-principle, two cerium-based RFBs were designed: a Zn–Ce and a V–Ce RFB. For the Zn–Ce RFB, the Ce4+/Ce3+ and Zn2+/Zn redox pairs yielded an open cell potential of 1.86 V. In a RFB single cell, a coulombic efficiency of 94%, a voltage efficiency of 68% and an energy efficiency of 64% were achieved at 2 mA cm−2. Most importantly, the RFB is non-sensitive to moisture and oxygen, thus significantly decreasing the costs for practical applications. For the V–Ce RFB, a cell potential of 2.34 V was obtained. This high cell potential and the high solubility (more than 2.5 M) of [Ce(Py-O)8][Tf2N]3 in acetonitrile indicates that this type of battery is promising for high-energy density RFB applications. Hence, the cerium-containing complexes are very promising for developing RFB systems with low-cost and high-energy density. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cerium; Lanthanides; Low-cost; Non-aqueous RFBs","Acetonitrile; Cerium; Costs; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Metal complexes; Rare earth elements; Solubility; Coulombic efficiency; Electrochemical reversibility; High energy densities; Low costs; Non-aqueous; Open cell potentials; Proof of principles; Voltage efficiencies; Cerium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077446254

Steam-based high-temperature heat and power storage is one of the very recent mechanical energy storage technologies introduced. This system stores electricity as heat in a packed bed of rocks and then, co-generates heat and electricity through a conventional Rankine cycle when discharging. This system presents an electricity and heat efficiencies of about 33–35% and 60–65%, meaning an overall efficiency in the range of 93–98%. As the major production of the system is heat, it is only appropriate for countries with district heating systems. As not all countries have heat networks, and according to the fact that, electricity is getting much pricier than heat everywhere, a modification of this technology in order for offering a better electricity efficiency could be highly advantageous. This study proposes the hybridization of a steam-based high-temperature heat and power storage with a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (with three different working fluids) to improve its electricity efficiency. The hybrid system is comprehensively analyzed and compared to its conventional design. The results prove the electricity efficiency of 42.6–46.3% is obtained for the hybrid systems which are 24–35% higher than that of the conventional design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-generation; District heating; Electricity storage; High-temperature heat and power storage; Organic Rankine cycle","District heating; Energy efficiency; Hybrid systems; Packed beds; Rankine cycle; Co-generation; District heating system; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity storages; Heat and electricity; Heat and power; Mechanical energy storages; Organic Rankine cycles; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075529670

B. vulgaris was the most efficient at aboveground biomass accumulation. The AGB stored in the bamboo was 61% higher in B. vulgaris (115 t ha−1) than in B. vulgaris var. vitata (71 t ha−1) and was 27-fold that of O. abbyssinica. B. vulgaris would take a relatively shorter time (about 14, 9 and 2.4 years, respectively) to attain the stocking of carbon of the intact swamp forests, degraded forests and deforested areas in Ghana. Enriching degraded forests and deforested areas with such a bamboo species could be an effective means of increasing the carbon sequestration potential of such ecosystems. Carbonized bamboos were 27–57% higher in energy intensity than the raw bamboos.

This study applied multi-objective optimization to obtain a daily charge and discharge schedule of a battery bank, which was used to both store electricity from the microgrid and smart grid and could also provide electricity to the building and the smart grid. Multi-objective optimization was employed due to the independent objectives of minimizing building operating cost and maximizing the facilitation of wind energy from the smart grid. The trade-offs between the two objectives were simulated, evaluated and analyzed. A priority weighting factor (α) was applied to each objective. The purpose of α was to vary the importance of each objective relative to the other in an inversely proportional manner. This enabled the algorithm to optimize the battery operating schedule for the economic performance of the microgrid, the facilitation of wind generation on the smart grid or for trade-offs in between. The results present a comprehensive evaluation of 96 scenarios with varying daily weather conditions, building electricity demand, electricity pricing, microgrid output and wind penetration from the smart grid. A multi-objective optimization approach was then applied for each of the 96 scenarios with 11 α values to determine optimal trade-offs in these scenarios. Generally for the 96 scenarios analyzed, when the α value was 20% or higher, the amount of extra wind generation facilitation obtained was negligible while microgrid operating costs continued to increase. The results showed that when changing from an α value of 0% to an α value of 20%, there was a large increase in wind generation facilitation compared to the corresponding increase in cost, with wind generation facilitation increasing from its minimum value to within 89% of its maximum value (10.7% to 14.3% of facilitated wind generation). The corresponding building cost increased from its minimum value to within 13% of its maximum value (€1.14/day to €1.37/day). This produced a cost of approximately €0.06 for every 1% increase in wind generation facilitation. In comparison to this, changing from an α value of 20% to an α value of 100% implied a cost of approximately €3.64 for every 1% increase in wind generation facilitation. These results indicated that smart grids with large percentages of wind penetration may be substantially aided by utilizing the storage capacity of building integrated microgrids for a relatively low monetary cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Energy management; Microgrid; Multi-objective optimization; Trade-off analysis; Wind penetration","Buildings; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Microgrids; Multiobjective optimization; Operating costs; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Wind power; Battery; Building integrated; Charge and discharge; Comprehensive evaluation; Economic performance; Micro grid; Trade-off analysis; Wind penetration; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079147842

AUVs that also can follow a planned trajectory with a chosen depth profile are used for geophysical surveys, subsea pipeline inspection, marine archaeology, and more. Most AUVs are followed by a mother ship that adds significantly to the cost of an AUV mission. One pathway to reduce this need is to develop long-endurance AUVs by improving navigation, autonomy and energy storage. Long-endurance AUVs can open up for more challenging mission types than what is possible today. Fuel cell systems are a key technology for increasing the endurance of AUVs beyond the capability of batteries. However, several challenges exist for underwater operation of fuel cell systems. These are related to storage or generation of hydrogen and oxygen, buoyancy and trim, and the demanding environment of the ambient seawater. Protecting the fuel cell inside a sealed container brings along more challenges related to condensation, cooling and accumulation of inert gases or reactants. This paper elaborates on these technical challenges and describes the solutions that the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has chosen in its development of a fuel cell system for long-endurance AUVs. The reported solutions enabled a 24 h demonstration of FFI's fuel cell system under water.

Aims: The cardio-protective effect of B. saligna was investigated in ferric-induced oxidative cardiopathy. Methods: Hearts harvested from healthy male SD rats were incubated with 0.1 mM FeSO4 to induce oxidative damage and co-incubated with B. saligna extract. Reaction mixtures without the extract served as negative control, while tissues without the extract or standard antioxidant (gallic acid) and pro-oxidant served as the normal control. The tissues were analyzed for levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide as well as cholinergic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lipase, and purinergic enzymes activities, lipid profiles, fatty acid metabolic pathways and metabolites. Results: Induction of oxidative damage significantly (p &lt; 0.05) depleted the levels of GSH, SOD, catalase, and ENTPDase activities, while concomitantly elevating the levels of MDA, NO, ACE, acetylcholinesterase, lipase and ATPase activities. These levels and activities were significantly reversed on treatment with B. saligna. Treatment with B. saligna also led to depletion of cardiac cholesterol and LDL-c levels, while elevating triglyceride and HDL-c level. It also depleted oxidative-induced lipid metabolites with concomitant generation of thirteen other metabolites. B. saligna also inactivated oxidative-induced pathways for beta oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, glycerolipid metabolism, and fatty acid elongation in mitochondria. Conclusion: These results suggest that B. saligna protects against ferric-induced oxidative cardiopathy by mitigating oxidative stress, while concomitantly inhibiting ACE, acetylcholinesterase and lipase activities, and modulating lipid spectrum and dysregulated metabolic pathways. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antihypertension; Buddleja saligna; Cardio-protection; Lipid metabolism; Purinergic activity","2 dodecenoic acid; 9 octadecenoic acid; antihypertensive agent; antioxidant; buddleja saligna extract; catalase; cholesterol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; eicosane; gallic acid; glutathione; hemoglobin A1c; lignoceric acid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; n heptadecanol 1; n tetracosanol1; nitric oxide; nonahexacontanoic acid; pentadecanoic acid; pentadecanol; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; renin; squalene; superoxide dismutase; tetradecane; triacylglycerol lipase; trimethyldecane; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; acetylcholinesterase; Ache protein, rat; antioxidant; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; plant extract; triacylglycerol lipase; antioxidant activity; Article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; fatty acid oxidation; flow rate; heart disease; heart protection; heart tissue; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrolysis; hypertension; lipid metabolism; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; Loganiaceae; male; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; metabolite; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particle size; phytochemistry; animal; Buddleja; cardiac muscle cell; chemistry; drug effect; energy metabolism; enzymology; isolation and purification; lipid metabolism; metabolism; pathology; Sprague Dawley rat; Acetylcholinesterase; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Antioxidants; Buddleja; Energy Metabolism; GPI-Linked Proteins; Lipase; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Myocytes, Cardiac; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074142753

While total concentrations of PAHs were rather stable during storage for 561 days at 4 °C, PAH accessibility declined by 95% due to atmospheric carbonation. The formation of carbonates was evidenced by an increase of inorganic soil carbon and by carbonate coatings on black soil particles (SEM-EDX) that could be dissolved by providing neutral to acidic soil conditions. Subjecting soil (252 days of storage) to biodegradation at pH 7 resulted in a degraded fraction of PAHs equivalent to the accessible PAH fraction of soil as received (PAHs with log Kow &lt;5).

The use of textiles in wearable antennas requires the characterization of their properties. Specific electrical conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates. The accurate characterization of conventional textile materials to use as dielectric substrates in wearable systems is thus fundamental. However, little information can be found on this. Woven, knits, and nonwovens are inhomogeneous, highly porous, compressible, and easily influenced by the environmental hygrometric conditions, making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there is no standard method, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric characterization of textiles. This chapter gives an overview of the resonant and nonresonant methods to characterize the textile materials and leather, to be used as dielectric substrate on wearable antennas. This study summarizes the characterization of textile materials made through these methods and which were validated by testing antennas which perform well.

Next, we discuss ALD perovskite piezoelectric-based device design of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). There is a renewed interest in barium-based ternary compounds which have piezoelectric coefficients up to 500 pC/ N. We further explore ALD perovskite-based solar photovoltaics (PVs), where conformal and uniform layers of lead sulfide (PbS) absorbing layers allow deposition on large surfaces, facilitating perovskite architectures with conversion efficiency reaching 20%. Finally, we learn how lanthanum-based perovskites can replace cerium oxide, which is currently utilized for thermo-chemical processes for solar to energy conversion.

It is designed to satisfy the total power demand of the hydraulic pump using solar PV modules. The system components are solar PV module, charge controller, battery and inverter. The system is configuration made to supply 15 m3 water which is the maximum daily household water demand for the ten households from the 13 m deep underground water well. The hydraulic power of the pump calculated considering pipe friction and pump-set efficiency is 195.918 watts.

Similar to the huge uncertainties involved in long-term energy price prediction, CO2 market price is volatile. In this paper, indicators for key CO2 price changes are detected by moving average analysis. To prove the validity of the methods, geometric Brownian motion (GBM) simulations were performed for different drift and volatility values. Drift, the standard deviation of CO2 price changes and CO2 volatility were used on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for short term simulations and on a weekly basis for long term simulations. GBM simulation can help determine the probability of a European emission allowances (EUA) price, which is featured by great variations, depending on the period. Signals for periods were determined by momentum strategy, with 60 days for short and 365 days for the long moving average. They show correlation with natural gas prices, that is, EUA signals appear 13–17 months after the signal in natural gas price. Among the vast number of proposed hybrid prediction models, this correlation allows the prediction of a long-term price trend. It seems that back-loading measures obstructed risk estimates because they resulted in extreme price drift in some periods, as the consequence of rebalancing in supply and demand. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CCS; CO2 price volatility; energy price; EUA market; geometric Brownian motion; momentum strategy","Brownian movement; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forecasting; International law; Momentum; Natural gas; Risk assessment; CO2 emission reduction; Energy prices; European union emission trading schemes; Geometric Brownian motion; Hybrid prediction models; Momentum strategies; Moving average analysis; Price volatility; Costs; Brownian motion; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; European Union; forecasting method; geometry; natural gas; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078666157

The average crystallite size was found to be 76.6 nm by crystallographic study of X-ray analysis (XRD) which also showed single-phase formation with spinel cubic structure. The formation of the sample was assured by measuring the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and the elemental study using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the atomic force microscopy (AFM) were studied which showed a spherical interlinked behavior with aggregations of the grains. The M–H curve showed an exchange bias which gave a slight horizontal shift in the curve. The obtained data extracted from the magnetic properties recommended the suitability of Ag2Cr2O4 nanoparticles to be applied in information storage devices, MRAM, and sensor devices. Moreover, this is the first study to synthesize and analyze the characterization and antimicrobial properties of Ag2Cr2O4 nanoparticles at 400 °C.

Considering the great potentials to disseminate this smart-grid technology, the EV uptake remains low. This tension between the recent years high anticipation of the peak-shaving and storage potential of EVs and the associated persistent minor adoption rate is discussed through an in-depth case study of a Danish mobility operator's attempt to test EVs across a variety of Danish households. Considering the operator's ambitious and strategic promotion of EVs lower cost of operation, sustainable aspects and ability to meet driving needs, almost none of the participants wanted to adopt an EV after the trial ended. Corresponding with dominant approaches, the operator reproduced conventional problem framings' focus on technology, economic rationality, and information. However, through an alternative practice-based analysis, this paper critically recommends urgent sustainable mobility interventions to identify the crucial intervention points in the complexes of interlinked social practices to help explain the persistent low EV-uptake. The paper essentially acknowledges the need for policy makers and designers to scale down the focus on technology fix and innovation, and strategical intervene in the current concepts of practice configurations. In particularly, governance of mobility is recommended to involve multiple change agents to design practice-based interventions that target to reframe and reconceptualise the norms enmeshed in current mobility demand. © 2020","Electric vehicle adoption; Practice-based policy framings; Redefinition of mobility norms; Sustainable mobility interventions","alternative energy; critical analysis; electric vehicle; innovation; mobility; policy development; policy making; smart grid; sustainability; transportation policy; travel demand; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077933285

In this regard, as a solution to the problem, a new multigeneration system is proposed to address some of the most common and vital needs of such communities. The system developed is based on principles of sustainability and decentralisation and is driven by renewable energy sources including sun and biomass. It provides electricity, fresh water, hot water for domestic use, HVAC for space air-conditioning and food storage, in addition to hot air for food drying. In the proposed hybrid system, biomass energy is integrated with solar energy in a complimentary manner as a means to maximise outputs and enhance system resilience against weather conditions and day/night cycles. Designing for resilience enables a type of operation that fulfils parallel demands in a continuous stable and flexible operation which can be optimised depending on the requirements. The main sub-systems used in the proposed multigeneration system consist of a Biomass combustor, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), a Rankine Cycle, a desalination unit and an Absorption Cooling System (ACS). A comprehensive integrated thermodynamic model of the entire system is developed by application of energy, mass, entropy and exergy balance equations. Moreover, effects of various inputs and environmental variables on the outputs and performance has also been studied. Results reveal that the proposed system is capable of fulfilling some of the coastal community's essential requirements in an efficient and ecologically benign manner.

Numerical simulations of the processes occurring in lithium-sulfur batteries might bring a better understanding of the governing mechanisms, which will allow the necessary development of the applicable cells. This paper presents a custom electrochemical model of a lithium-sulfur cell implemented into Ansys Fluent. The model describes a multi-component transport of species through Nernst-Plank equations in a dilute solution. The redox mechanism was described through a multi-step mechanism, with kinetics being defined through the Butler-Volmer equation. The model was used to model cyclic voltammetry at a planar electrode and at single porous particles. The results indicate that the cyclic voltammetry response of the whole porous sulfur cathode could be solved as a response of a single particle, which might lead to a simplification of numerical simulations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ansys Fluent; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemistry; Lithium-sulfur cell; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric discharges; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Lithium batteries; Numerical models; Porous materials; Ansys Fluent; Butler-Volmer equation; Electrochemical modeling; Energy storage systems; Lithium-sulfur cells; Nernst-Plank equations; Numerical investigations; Theoretical capacity; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076928234

How CWCs respond physiologically to this strong seasonal forcing remains unclear, due to the remoteness of their deep-sea habitats. In an in situ transplantation study at Nakken reef, Norway, we investigated a full seasonal cycle of (1) temperature and food availability, (2) diet, (3) biomass and tissue reserves, (4) oxygen consumption and (5) linear growth of the reef-building coral Lophelia pertusa. All investigated variables showed a distinct seasonality. An increase in the organic carbon and amino acid content, linear extension and budding rate from February to late May, at a simultaneous increase in phytoplankton and zooplankton fatty acid trophic markers (FATMs), and δ15N-derived trophic level, indicates an efficient exploitation of the spring phytoplankton and the subsequent zooplankton bloom. A pool of neutral-lipid-derived fatty acids, indicative of energy storage and gametogenesis, was formed from May to October, accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, i.e. metabolic activity. In late autumn and early winter (October–December), tissue reserves were maintained, in spite of low sPOM and zooplankton food availability, and the lower tissue δ13C and higher contribution of bacterial FATMs suggest increased reliance on more degraded material. The concurrent reduction in linear growth further suggests a lower energy availability at this time of the year. A large (&gt; 50%) drop of all tissue pools between December and February coincided with the spawning season of L. pertusa and demonstrates a high energetic cost of reproduction. Our results show for the first time a strong seasonal control of critical life history traits such as growth patterns and timing of reproduction in this prominent deep-sea species. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Amino acid; Compound-specific; Deep sea; Fatty acid; Food supply; Stable isotopes","amino acid; cold water; deep sea; dietary intake; food supply; growth response; life history trait; metabolism; organic carbon; seasonality; spawning population; stable isotope; Norway; Anthozoa; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lophelia pertusa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076610569

A GEP problem commonly determines optimal investment decisions in new power generation plants by minimizing total cost over a mid towards long planning horizon subjected by a set of constraints. The model aims to capture operational challenges arising when a transition towards higher shares of intermittent renewable generation is considered. It embeds a computationally expensive Operational Cost Simulation Model (OCSM), which may exhibit a high level of temporal and technical representation of the short-term operation of a power system to model the unit commitment. The emerging computationally expensive integer non-linear programming constrained optimization model is solved by a problem-customized Meta-model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (MAEA). The MAEA employs, off-line trained and on-line refined, approximation models to estimate the output of an OCSM to attain a near-optimal solution by utilizing a limited number of computationally expensive OCSM simulations. The approach is applied on an illustrative test case for a 15 year planning period considering the short-term operation of thermal, hydroelectric and storage units and generation from renewable energy sources. Moreover, the impact of technical resolution is examined through a simple comparative study. The results reveal the efficiency of the proposed problem-customized MAEA. Moreover, the trained approximation models exhibit a low relative error indicating that they may adequately approximate the true output of the OCSM. It is demonstrated that neglecting technical limitations of thermal units may underestimate the utilization of flexible units, i.e. thermal and non-thermal units, affecting the attained investment decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Differential evolution; Generation Expansion Planning; Meta-model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm; Operational flexibility; Renewable energy technologies; Unit commitment","Constrained optimization; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Expansion; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Renewable energy resources; Differential Evolution; Generation expansion planning; Meta model; Operational flexibility; Renewable energy technologies; Unit-commitment; Investments; algorithm; alternative energy; energy planning; investment; numerical model; operations technology; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076513111

They consist of a neutral lipid core containing mostly triglycerides and sterol esters and covered by a monolayer of phospholipids, wherein numerous proteins are embedded. In the cell, lipid droplets have a dynamic life cycle, rapidly altering their size, location, lipid and protein composition in response to environmental stimuli and cell state. Lipid droplets are primarily involved in the coordination of lipid metabolism with cellular requirements for energy production, membrane homeostasis and cell growth. However, they are also directly or indirectly engaged in signalling pathways. On the one hand, lipid droplets sequester lipids and proteins thereby limiting their availability for participation in signalling pathways. On the other hand, the lipolytic machinery provides a highly regulated, on-demand source of signalling lipids: lipids derived from their neutral lipid core, or the phospholipid monolayer, directly act as signalling mediators or are converted into ones. In fact, emerging studies suggest that these organelles are essential for various cellular stress response mechanisms, including inflammation and immunity, acting as hubs that integrate metabolic and inflammatory processes. Here, we discuss the ways in which lipid droplets regulate the availability of fatty acids for the activation of signalling pathways and for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipid mediators. We focus in particular on recent discoveries in immune cells and adipose tissue that have revealed an intricate relationship between lipid droplets and inflammatory signalling and may also be relevant for other tissues and various human diseases. © 2019 The Author(s)","Eicosanoids; Inflammation; Lipase; Lipid droplets; Phospholipase; Resolvins","arachidonic acid; fat droplet; glycerophospholipid; icosanoid; inflammatory lipid mediator; lipid; phospholipase A2; polyunsaturated fatty acid; unclassified drug; docosahexaenoic acid; fat droplet; icosanoid; phospholipase; phospholipid; PNPLA2 protein, human; toll like receptor; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adipose tissue; aerobic metabolism; human; immunity; immunocompetent cell; inflammation; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; lipolysis; neutrophil; regulatory mechanism; Review; signal transduction; transcription regulation; animal; gene expression regulation; genetics; homeostasis; immunology; metabolism; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Eicosanoids; Gene Expression Regulation; Homeostasis; Humans; Inflammation; Lipase; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Phospholipases; Phospholipids; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptors; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076480795

The objective of the present study was thus to establish the ultrastructural characteristics of the mature bovine oocyte in full detail. Oocytes from Bos taurus (Holstein-Friesian) cows were aspirated from ovaries collected after being slaughtered at a local abattoir. After in vitro culture for 24 h, some of them were processed for electron microscopy. We described the ultrastructure of the zona pellucida, which presented three different regions, and novel cytoplasmic findings. There were two types of electron-lucent vesicles (heterogeneous and striated), which were suggested to give rise to lipid droplets, and presence of receptor-mediated endocytosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that although the mature bovine oocyte is devoid of evident yolk, it might be filled with an extensive lipid factory. In addition, even before fertilization, the mature oocyte seemed to absorb nutrients through receptor-mediated endocytosis, indicating active energy use or storage. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bos taurus; Bovine mature oocytes; In vitro maturation; Ultrastructure","animal; bovine; cytoplasm; female; in vitro oocyte maturation; oocyte; physiology; ultrastructure; veterinary medicine; zona pellucida; Animals; Cattle; Cytoplasm; Female; In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques; Oocytes; Zona Pellucida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076409885

A key challenge of such transitions is integrating and absorbing increased shares of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, without jeopardizing the security and the reliability of the electricity system. To this end, key solutions include the introduction of demand-side management. However, so far, demand-side management modeling at the building sector has been proven challenging, as existing models are not flexible enough to incorporate a wide set of modeling features and guiding principles, while including all important aspects of end-use. This paper presents a new dynamic high-resolution demand-side management model which brings together all the key features and guiding principles of demand-side management modeling. The novelty of the model lies mainly in its modularity, as the main modeling framework is decomposed into individual modules, hierarchically dependent on components embodying standards and design rules, allowing for multiple configurations and computational efficiency. To demonstrate its applicability the model was used to explore benefits of demand-flexibility for consumers in the residential sector in Greece. Simulation results showed that the flexibility to increase self-consumption can be brought to the Greek electricity sector without a need for significant changes in the current market design, and for consumers to sacrifice thermal comfort and energy services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage; Demand-Response; Demand-Side Management; Maintenance and control; RES generation; Smart home","Automation; Battery storage; Computational efficiency; Electric utilities; Housing; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Service industry; Demand response; Electricity sector; Electricity system; Energy transitions; Multiple configurations; Renewable energy source; Residential sectors; Smart homes; Demand side management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076312060

The INTERCEPT pathogen inactivation system reduces the risk of pathogen transmission by inhibiting nucleic acid replication using a combination of a photo-reactive compound and UVA illumination. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects the INTERCEPT system has on the PLT metabolome and metabolic activity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Paired units of buffy coat-derived PCs were generated using a pool and split strategy (n = 8). The paired PCs were either treated with the INTERCEPT system or left untreated. Samples were collected on Days 1, 2, 4, and 7 of storage. Ultra-performance chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze the extra- and intracellular metabolomes. Constraint-based metabolic modeling was then used to predict the metabolic activity of the stored PLTs. RESULTS: A relatively large number of metabolites in the extracellular environment were depleted during the processing steps of the INTERCEPT system, in particular, metabolites with hydrophobic functional groups, including acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines. In the intracellular environment, alterations in glucose and glycerophospholipid metabolism and decreased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate were observed following the INTERCEPT treatment. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed residual amotosalen dimers present in the treated PCs. Systems-level analysis of PLT metabolism indicated that the INTERCEPT system does not have a significant impact on the PLT energy metabolism and nutrient utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The INTERCEPT system significantly alters the metabolome of the stored PCs without significantly influencing PLT energy metabolism. © 2019 AABB",,"2 hydroxyglutaric acid; acylcarnitine; amotosalen; glycerophospholipid; lysophosphatidylcholine; nonoxinol 9; thrombocyte concentrate; amotosalen; furocoumarin derivative; Article; blood buffy coat; blood storage; controlled study; energy metabolism; glucose metabolism; health care utilization; human; hydrophobicity; metabolite; metabolomics; molecular model; normal human; nutrient; phospholipid metabolism; photochemistry; secretion rate; time of flight mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; ultraviolet A radiation; metabolomics; procedures; ultraviolet radiation; Blood Preservation; Energy Metabolism; Furocoumarins; Metabolomics; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076101248

A decrease in the lattice constants of these compounds is observed when going from CaMn3V4O12 to CaCu3V4O12 due to the increase in the number of electrons in the trending of the metals. Electron charge densities in different crystallographic planes show that the bonds between Ca–O, A/V–O and A–V are ionic, covalent and metallic, respectively. The electronic band structures show the metallic behavior of these compounds except that CaMn3V4O12 and CaFe3V4O12 are half-metals. The elastic moduli of these compounds indicate the hardness and increases in a sequence going from CaMn3V4O12 to CaCu3V4O12, and also reveal their ductile nature. The optimized energies in different magnetic phases and the post-DFT calculations confirm that CaMn3V4O12 and CaCo3V4O12 are anti-ferromagnetic, and CaFe3V4O12 and CaNi3V4O12 are ferromagnetic, whereas CaCu3V4O12 is a paramagnetic material.

The challenge for the engine is the high reactive combustion properties making dilution necessary to mitigate NOx emissions at the expense of a significant energy cost. In the concept analysed in this study, high Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rate is applied to the gas turbine to generate oxygen depleted air. As a result combustion temperature is inherently limited, keeping NOx emissions low without the need for dilution or unsafe premixing. The concept is analysed by process simulation based on a reference IGCC plant with CO2 Capture. Results with dry and wet EGR options are presented as a function EGR rate. Efficiency performance is assessed against the reference power cycle with nitrogen dilution. All EGR options are shown to represent an efficiency improvement. Nitrogen dilution is found to have a 1.3% efficiency cost. Although all EGR options investigated offer an improvement, dry EGR is considered as the preferred option despite the need for higher EGR rate as compared with the wet EGR.

The extent to which this may happen is poorly understood. We therefore studied the catchment of the Cañete River in the western Peruvian Coastal Range as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region. It houses the 220 MW El Platanal hydroelectric plant and the Capillucas reservoir that provide the surrounding areas with water and energy. We used a hydrological model (HEC-HMS) coupled with a sediment transport model (HEC-RAS) to simulate future changes in river discharge and sediment load. This information was then used to calculate the siltation of the Capillucas storage reservoir. Ten scenarios were developed, a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation rates. The precipitation patterns differed in the distribution of the precipitation change during the rainfall season, and the precipitation rates differed in the extent of change in precipitation amounts. The average sediment load of the Cañete River was estimated at 981 kTon/yr upstream of the Capillucas reservoir and showed that the calculated life span of the Capillucas reservoir is about 17 years. The most pessimistic scenario suggested a reduction in the life span of the reservoir to 7 years and the most optimistic scenario to 31 years. Even under the most optimistic scenario, the life span of the reservoir is shorter than its officially expected functionality of 50 years. As such, our results demonstrated the vulnerability of Andean hydroelectric reservoirs against future climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Andes; Climate change; Extreme Events; Hydroelectric projects; Sediment transport; Soil Erosion; Storage dams","Catchments; Hydroelectric power plants; Precipitation (meteorology); Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Andes; Extreme events; Hydroelectric project; Soil erosion; Storage dams; Climate change; catchment; climate change; extreme event; global climate; hydrological modeling; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation (climatology); reservoir; river discharge; sediment budget; sediment transport; silt; siltation; soil erosion; vulnerability; Andes; Canete Basin; Coastal Range [Taiwan]; Lima [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076025752

It is particularly well suited for supplying district heat networks (DHN), thereby enabling the capture and distribution of excess energy from industries and incineration plants. However, as heat cannot be readily transported over long distances, there is a need to analyse the balance of supply and demand over time taking into account the geospatial constraints placed on the linking of IEH supplies and DHN demands. This work presents an analysis of the potential for the supply of DHN systems using high and low network temperatures by IEH in Switzerland. A spatial clustering method is used to link potential supplies and demands, and monthly supply and demand curves are used to calculate the potential for IEH supply subject to spatiotemporal constraints. A further analysis deals with the technical potential for seasonal storage to shift surplus IEH energy from summer to winter. A total resource of 12TWh/y of IEH was found, but spatial and temporal constraints limited its utilisation to between 7.7TWh/y and 10.5TWh/y depending the scenario considered. 17.4% of total heat demand could be supplied by IEH using low temperature DHN and seasonal storage. © 2019","Clustering; District heating; Industrial excess heat; Mapping; Spatiotemporal","District heating; Incineration; Mapping; Temperature; Clustering; Excess heats; Incineration plant; Spatio-temporal constraints; Spatiotemporal; Spatiotemporal analysis; Technical potential; Temporal constraints; Economics; electricity supply; heating; low temperature; mapping method; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075990628

The composite material is composed of paraffin wax incorporated in metal foams. Five samples with dimension of (80 × 50 × 5) mm3 are tested: pure paraffin, paraffin/nickel foam composite with a porosity of 97.2%, and a pore density of 20 PPI and paraffin/copper foam composites with a porosity of 96.1% and pore densities of 10 PPI, 20 PPI, and 40PPI. The main results give the effects of the porous matrix morphology on the thermal performance of the heat exchanger, as the storage capacity and the accumulated power. Therefore, the obtained results show that the metal foam insert improves the heat diffusion 4 times compared to the pure PCM. In contrast, the storage capacity of the heat exchanger (SCHE) decreases to 13%. This decrease is inversely proportional to the pore density. A numerical analysis is used to deduce the effective thermal conductivity of the samples. Based on the finite element method (FEM) and the two energy equations, the numerical study is carried out with the COMSOL Multiphysics software.

Expanding substations is a technical concern considering various binding conditions. Emerging Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) have the potential to defer substation expansion needs effectively. Although various applications of the BESSs are considered in the literature previously, application of the BESSs to defer substation expansion plans is not addressed adequately. In this context, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MOMILP) for BESS operation in distribution networks to simultaneously substation expansion deferral and cost reduction. The proposed model is highly flexible with respect to the planner preferences, without convergence problems, and easily solvable using commercial solvers. The model determines charging and discharging scheduling of the active and reactive power of the BESSs optimally to achieve maximum substation expansion deferral without increasing operation costs. Higher degrees of the expansion deferral can be achieved at the expanse of the negligible cost increase. Furthermore, details of the whole BESS system including various parts and active/reactive power relations and limits are modeled accurately to better demonstrate real-life situations. Results of the simulations demonstrate accuracy and also functionality of the proposed method. © 2019","Battery energy storage system; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi-objective optimization; Optimal operation; Substation expansion deferral","Cost reduction; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Active and Reactive Power; Battery energy storage systems; Commercial solvers; Convergence problems; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimal operation; Storage scheduling; Substation expansion deferral; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075759907

Specifically, aim of the paper is to propose an integrated control strategy (ICS) based on genetic algorithms that can provide an optimal balance between the objectives of energy saving, comfort of the building residents and maximum exploitation of the generated electric energy by the renewable energy sources through the proper utilization of a battery storage system (BSS). The above can be attained by optimizing a comprehensive cost function that considers the most important factors that may affect the performance of an nZEB, i.e., real-time electricity price, generated/consumed electric energy by each device, user preferences, state-of-charge, and energy price of the BSS, weather forecast and the nZEB's construction characteristics.

In addition, 3-HFAs were obtained by depolymerization of a bacterial biopolymeric material, polyhydroxyalkanoate. Thermal properties of 3-hydoxyoctanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acids are reported for the first time. These materials showed the potential to be applied as PCM in temperature range from 33°C to 66°C. In order to expand the temperature range for application of 3-HFAs as PCM, eutectic mass ratios of three kinds of binary mixtures of 3-HFAs were calculated, and their properties were predicted using the Schröder-van Laar equation. Thermal properties of these mixtures were validated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. These results showed that eutectics considerably expanded the scope of applications of 3-HFAs as PCMs. 3-HFAs originating from biotechnologically obtained polyhydroxyalkanoates also showed potential to be applied in development of PCMs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3-hydroxy fatty acids; biopolymer; eutectic mixtures; phase change materials; thermophysical properties","Binary mixtures; Biopolymers; Differential scanning calorimetry; Eutectics; Fatty acids; Thermodynamic properties; 3-Hydroxy fatty acids; Biopolymeric materials; Eutectic mixture; Phase change energy storage; Poly-hydroxyalkanoate; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Scope of application; Temperature range; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075197383

Therefore, in this work, the conditions for solvent extraction of anthocyanins from that peel were studied according to the following variables: temperature, pH, solvent: raw material ratio and time, using the response surface methodology. Additionally, the antioxidant capacity of the extract was characterized, and its respective anthocyanin degradation kinetics were performed at three storage temperatures. The best conditions were pH 2.0, 52.03 °C, 29.79 g of solvent per g of raw material and 180 min, which gave an anthocyanins extraction yield of 577.59 mg of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside per 100 g of dry raw material. The extract also showed 490.12 ± 2.57 and 528.85 ± 27.17 µmol Trolox per 100 g of antioxidant capacity by DPPH and FRAP essays respectively, a low content of vitamin C, as well as activation energy of 41.4 kJ per mole. Consequently, this study shows PPFP as a potential raw material in anthocyanins and antioxidants extracts, which have a great value in the food industry with their stability under refrigeration.

Metabolic activation of WAT may ascribe to this tissue characteristics of BAT, namely non-shivering thermogenesis and ATP production. Recent data indicate that apolipoproteins E (APOE) and A1 (APOA1) regulate WAT mitochondrial metabolic activation. Here, we investigated the functional cross-talk between natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms with APOA1 in this process, using Apoe2knock-in and Apoe4knock-in mice. At baseline when Apoe2knock-in and Apoe4knock-in mice express both APOE and Apoa1, the Apoe2knock-in strain appears to have higher mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation levels and non-shivering thermogenesis in WAT compared to Apoe4knock-in mice. When mice were switched to a high-fat diet for 18 weeks, circulating levels of endogenous Apoa1 in Apoe2knock-in mice became barely detectable though significant levels of APOE2 were still present. This change was accompanied by a significant reduction in WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression while BAT Ucp1 was unaffected. Ectopic APOA1 expression in Apoe2knock-in animals potently stimulated WAT but not BAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression providing further evidence that APOA1 potently stimulates WAT non-shivering thermogenesis in the presence of APOE2. Ectopic expression of APOA1 in Apoe4knock-in mice stimulated BAT but no WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 levels, suggesting that in the presence of APOE4, APOA1 is a trigger of BAT non-shivering thermogenesis. Overall, our data identified a tissue-specific role of the natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms in WAT- and BAT-metabolic activation respectively, that appears dependent on circulating APOA1 levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apolipoprotein A1; Apolipoprotein E; Apolipoprotein E2; Apolipoprotein E4; Brown adipose tissue; Mitochondrial metabolic activity; Obesity; White adipose tissue","apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein E; high density lipoprotein; intermediate density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; uncoupling protein 1; very low density lipoprotein; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein E2; apolipoprotein E4; isoprotein; recombinant protein; Ucp1 protein, mouse; uncoupling protein 1; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; body weight; body weight gain; brown adipose tissue; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol intake; controlled study; density gradient centrifugation; ectopic expression; energy yield; food intake; gene expression; gene transfer; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; male; metabolic activation; mouse; nonhuman; nonshivering thermogenesis; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; triacylglycerol blood level; triacylglycerol level; Western blotting; white adipose tissue; adverse event; animal; animal model; blood; gene knock-in; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; physiology; thermogenesis; transgenic mouse; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoprotein E2; Apolipoprotein E4; Diet, High-Fat; Gene Knock-In Techniques; Gene Transfer Techniques; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Models, Animal; Protein Isoforms; Recombinant Proteins; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling Protein 1; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074224650

The reversible catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of LOHCs has made them highly favored for safe storage of hydrogen. In this study, the catalytic dehydrogenation onset was estimated using the reaction energy needed for the dehydrogenation of the first cyclohexane ring of H18-DBT. Using density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections, we have calculated the adsorption energies for H18-DBT with and without abstracted H atoms on pristine Pt (1 1 0) and Pd (1 1 0) surfaces and their respective subsurface configurations. The surface slabs consisted of three layers with the two bottom layers forming the subsurface configurations. Adsorption of H18-DBT with and without abstracted H atoms was found to be energetically stable. Based on the calculated reaction energies, catalytic activity towards dehydrogenation highly favored instances where Pt formed the top surface layer than when Pd formed the top surface layer with Pt-Pd-Pd and Pt-Pd-Pt subsurface configurations yielding relatively similar catalytic activity as pristine Pt surface slab. This indicates that with alloying, it is possible to achieve similar catalytic properties as pristine Pt for the catalytic dehydrogenation of H18-DBT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alloy catalysts; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Liquid organic hydrogen carrier","Abstracting; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Liquids; Palladium; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Ternary alloys; Van der Waals forces; Adsorption energies; Alloy catalyst; Catalytic dehydrogenation; Catalytic hydrogenation; Catalytic properties; Cyclohexane ring; Hydrogen carriers; Van der Waals correction; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074157553

E. Purkinje University, Ústí n. Lab., Czech Republic","Shale gas has become an important unconventional energy resource and is extracted by hydraulic fracturing of shale rocks. In shale rocks, kerogen and clays are present, the former providing storage for hydrocarbons, the latter preventing hydrocarbon transport. Clays are hydrophilic and have a layered structure. They can adsorb aqueous salt solutions in the interlayer space, and the interlayer ions contribute to a very high salinity of the flow-back water. We used montmorillonite (MMT) as a proxy of clays and study the interplay between the interlayer structure and the molecular diffusion of the aqueous salt solutions confined in the clay nanopores. We considered water with monovalent Na and divalent Ca ions in the MMT slit pores under a typical shale gas reservoir condition of a temperature of 365 K and a pressure of 275 bar. The confined systems were electrostatically balanced by Cl ions. We varied the amount of water to cover one-, two-, three-, and four-layer hydrate states. We quantified the solution structure in terms of the interlayer atomic density profiles, complemented by the charge density and water orientation profiles. We further evaluated the in-plane self-diffusivity of water and ions to provide insight into the diffusion behaviour of the concentrated water-NaCl and water-CaCl2 solutions in the interlayer galleries of the Na- and Ca-MMT pores. We found that the interlayer water structure displays an attraction of water hydrogens to the clay surfaces as a result of the strong H-bond interactions of water molecules with the surface oxygens and formation of a diffusive layer inside wide clay pores. The presence of divalent Ca ions has more pronounced effects on the interlayer water structures than the monovalent Na ions. Divalent Ca ions exhibit a preference for inner-sphere complexes over outer-sphere complexes due to the strong adsorption on the clay surfaces while Na ions show the opposite trend. The diffusion of water and ions in the clay pores is reduced in comparison with the diffusion in the bulk, especially for the one-layer hydrate states. The presence of the salts in the clay pores further decreases the water diffusion, with a stronger decrease for the divalent CaCl2 than the monovalent NaCl. The diffusion of small Na+ and Ca2+ is lower than large Cl− due to the low mobility of the adsorbed cations and the distribution of Cl ions inside the pores where they can diffuse faster. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Confined Stokes-Einstein relation; Hydrate state; Inner-sphere complex; Montmorillonite; Outer-sphere complex","Calcium; Chlorine; Clay minerals; Diffusion in liquids; Diffusion in solids; Energy resources; Fracture; Hydration; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrocarbons; Ions; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Petroleum reservoirs; Shale gas; Sodium; Sodium chloride; Spheres; Aqueous salt solution; Inner sphere complexes; Interlayer structure; Montmorillonite (MMT); Outer-sphere complexes; Shale gas reservoirs; Stokes-Einstein relation; Thermodynamic conditions; Nanopores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073626197

Since the loads are far from the grid and providing the connection by extending from the main grid requires a high investment associated with long and costly transmission and distribution lines, addressing the problem requires innovative solutions. Therefore, off-grid microgrid systems, using solar photovoltaic and storage systems, integrated with very high-efficiency lighting appliances, are a promising solution to supply energy for rural and remote location in areas which lack access to the electric grid. This paper presents an overview on the existing solar photovoltaic technologies for off-grid systems including the most recent plug and play solutions. A characterization of the most common strategies used for control, communication and metering of microgrids is presented, as well as the recent evolution of the associated component technologies. The security and protection systems used to protect the system against theft or robbery of the systems itself or energy theft in remote areas are also addressed. Additionally, a resumed characterization of the sociologic profile and motivation of people to damage off-grid systems is presented. An overview on the main off-grid appliance market evolution and efficiency trends, in terms of energy efficiency, is also addressed in this paper.

However, understanding these processes needs more efforts to get a more elaborated picture at the atomic level. Here, we conducted a computational study to get insights into the adsorption of H2, ethylene, and benzene on Fe, Ni, and Cu metallic surfaces at different confinement spaces. For a given molecule-metal system, we obtained the adsorption energy and electron properties. The adsorption energy values varied as a function of the confinement space and were fitted to Lennard-Jones and Morse potential functions. Their fitting parameters followed the trend Fe &gt; Ni &gt; Cu, which reflects the periodicity of the metal atoms. Electronic structure of the molecule-metal pair also changed as a function of the extent of confinement. We rationalized the responses observed as a form of Le Chatelier’s principle.

In this study, we investigate one major source of isotopic heterogeneity in snowpacks: the influence of canopy cover. We measured amounts and isotopic compositions of bulk snowpack, throughfall, and open precipitation during seven campaigns in mid-winter 2018 along forest-grassland transects at three different elevations (1196, 1297, and 1434 m above sea level) in a pre-Alpine catchment in Switzerland. Snowpack storages under forest canopies were 67 to 93% less than in adjacent open grasslands. On average, the water isotope ratios were higher in the snowpacks under forest canopy than in open grasslands (by 13.4 ‰ in δ2H and 2.3 ‰ in δ18O). This isotopic difference mirrored the higher isotope values in throughfall compared with open snowfall (by 13.5 ‰ in δ2H and 2.2 ‰ in δ18O). Although this may suggest that most of the isotopic differences in snowpacks under forests versus in open grasslands were attributable to canopy interception effects, the temporal evolution of snowpack isotope ratios indicated preferential effluxes of lighter isotopes as energy inputs increased and the snowpack ripened and melted. Understanding these effects of forest canopy on bulk snowpack snow water equivalent and isotopic composition are useful when using isotopes to infer snowmelt processes in landscapes with varying forest cover. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","catchment; forest; grassland; interception; precipitation; Snowpack; stable water isotopes; throughfall","Aquifers; Catchments; Forestry; Hydrogeology; Precipitation (chemical); Runoff; Satellite interception; Sea level; Snow; Snow melting systems; forest; grassland; Snowpack; Stable water isotopes; Throughfall; Isotopes; catchment; forest canopy; grassland; interception; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; precipitation (chemistry); snowmelt; snowpack; stable isotope; throughfall; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074792583

However, due to huge concentration of light energy, high heat flux dissipation from a confined space is a challenge. The proposed system here is first of its type to apply and thermodynamically analyze the Nucleate Pool Boiling Heat Transfer (NBHT) for thermal management of CPV. In order to increase overall efficiency of CPV system, a multigeneration system using concentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPV/T) and hydrogen storage is designed and thermodynamically analyzed to fulfill electricity, hot and cold water, heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) requirement of a residential community with continuous operation. A part of the generated electricity from CPV is used to power the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The produced gases are stored, and reused by proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to fulfill the system's electrical energy requirement during night time and unfavourable energy conditions in day time. The resultant thermal energy from CPV/T is used for the heating, hot water and cooling requirement of the buildings by employing lithium bromide absorption chiller (AbC). A humidity harvesting system is connected, at the outlet of the absorption chiller, to convert humid air into water and ventilation air requirement of the building. The designed system performs at 67.52% overall energy efficiency, 34.89% of overall exergy efficiency and up to 1862 times concentration ratio at designed steady-state conditions. The results show that with an increase in boiling temperature of NBHT from 353 K to 373 K, the maximum concentration ratio ability increases significantly from 1392 to 2400 times due to increase in critical heat flux, while the electrical efficiency of the CPV system decreases from 28.65% to 27.09% because of increase in cell temperature. To verify the performance of the designed system for different locations, operating conditions and capacities, the effects of Direct Normal Irradiance (IDNI), ambient temperature, relative humidity ratio and the installed capacity are also analyzed by the parametric studies. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Concentrated photovoltaics; Electrolyzer and fuel cell; Exergy; Hydrogen storage; Multigeneration system; Solar photovoltaics/thermal system","Absorption cooling; Cooling systems; Electrolytic cells; Energy efficiency; Exergy; Heat flux; Hydrogen storage; Lithium bromide; Multi-junction solar cells; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Refrigerators; Water absorption; Concentrating photovoltaic; Direct normal irradiances; Electrolyzers; Multi generations; Nucleate pool boiling heat transfers; Overall energy efficiency; Photovoltaics; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059119170

As there is a huge potential for solar energy production, photovoltaics are established to supply electricity for operating critical infrastructures with battery systems and diesel generators installed for redundancy. These systems have the potential for further utilization. As a first step, overproduction of solar energy is offered to households due to simple control rules observing battery levels. This paper proposes an optimization method for energy allocation by process graphs or P-graphs. The method provides preliminary estimations on optimal periodical energy balances between energy producers, storage, and consumers of different priorities. These preliminary estimations serve as reconciliation parameters for advanced real-time control of energy distribution. Each step of transforming the practical problem of multiperiod energy distribution to the language of process network synthesis and then optionally to mathematical programming is detailed. To represent the problem adequately, the original formulation of process network synthesis is extended to take into account potential targets and intermediate entities that cannot be accumulated. The work aims to provide better utilization of renewable energy sources and storage.

However, with recent developments in new technologies (such as decentralized energy systems, urban energy systems, energy storage systems, etc.) many different options and combination of measures exist to decarbonize the building stock, which requires an update of current versions of technical energy regulations. The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future. A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions. Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas. © 2019",,"Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Energy policy; Multiobjective optimization; Clustering methods; CO2 emission reduction; Decentralized energy system; Energy regulation; Energy storage systems; Optimal transformation; Simulation approach; Urban energy systems; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076847434

It explores why, and in what ways, the energy industries have exploited the area and its landscape. Key factors include its accessibility for ocean-going shipping; the proximity to energy consumers in London and south-east England; the availability of large areas of land; and water resources. The energy industries included oil storage and refining; petrochemicals; gas manufacture and handling; and electricity generation and distribution. The article argues that the development of energy infrastructure in the Thames/ Medway landscape reflects the shifting patterns of energy use in the UK. For example, the recent demolition of Grain and Kingsnorth power stations — prominent north Kent landmarks since the 1970s — exemplifies the decline of coal and oil as primary fuels for electricity generation. Similarly, the seascape of the outer Thames estuary has been transformed by the advent of renewable energy and the construction of four major offshore wind farms. The article demonstrates how patterns of energy use are a mosaic of social needs, technological capabilities, environmental concerns, political expediency, and economic forces. The Thames/ Medway energyscape has developed, evolved and been adapted to these influences, and continues to support the energy needs of the UK economy. © 2020, © 2020 Society for Landscape Studies.","electricity; energy industry; Energyscape; Medway; natural gas; oil refining; Thames",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084368142

A widespread solution in case transport applications is to capture the mechanical energy during braking modes, followed by its storage and consequent release during acceleration and cruising modes. Mechanical recuperation systems based on kinetic energy storages (KES) are considered a promising alternative due to the lack of necessity for energy transformation. The simplest design of such systems suitable for retrofits is considered in the present work, which incorporates a friction clutch between (KES) and drive wheels. An analytical solution in closed form for the necessary clutch kinematic transfer function is obtained based on equation of motion in case of inertial energy source and load and a numerical example for short-term recuperation system with (KES) is presented. A corresponding clutch pressure control is proposed and methods for increasing the clutch transmission working ranges are also discussed. © 2020 Academic Publishing House.

The kinetics of the shredded fruits in the dryer proves the prospects for using convective drying, which is performed for 295 minutes. The kinetic coefficients of drying and critical moisture content in the crushed fruits of tomato were determined. The kinetic coefficients were determined by the graphical-analytical method: a = 0.839, ln(α) = 1.3 and α (1 s–1) = 0.262. It was determined that the critical maximum moisture content for drying the shredded fruits of tomatoes is 1.503% mm–1, after what the process of combustion of vegetable tissue begins. The application of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method allowed the fuller study of the mechanism of drying the fruits of tomato in different condition: fresh, sun-dried and dried. It was determined that the greatest amount of energy is consumed to remove free moisture (1 993 J g–1) from the fresh tomatoes. At the same time, when being cooled, crystallization in plant tissue occurs with the release of energy in the amount of 0.03922 J g–1. When drying the previously sun-dried tomatoes the process of moisture removal and the partial decomposition of the compounds that are unstable to temperature is completed. At the same time, at the 129.61 °C temperature in the powder obtained from the fruits of tomatoes, melting of carbohydrates and other compounds occurred. Thus, this confirms the need to observe the normalized value of the mass fraction of moisture in the powders in the process of their packaging, storage and use.

Due to the penetration of internet of things (IoT), the online energy trading (OET) methods in Smart Grids (SG) have significantly enhanced the power generation from multiple renewable resources and enabled the bidirectional flow of power between distributed generators (DGs). Previous research works on OET mainly focus on the optimization of central grid or enhancing the decisional capabilities of central OET operators. However, few of them developed the optimal decision taking methods for a single consumer in the OET structure, but these methods could not be implemented practically. In this paper we have proposed a mixed-integer-linear programming’ (MILP’) method for a consumer who have domestically installed renewable power plant, owns electric vehicle (EV), battery storage (BS) system, and uses OET based energy purchasing and sealing structure to minimize energy loss. In this method we have considered an actual power network for optimizing the EV and BS charging as well as managing different power utility facilities on the consumer end by OET, which enable a consumer to buy and sale electricity through OET network. In this method the energy cost is pre-set by the power suppliers for all OET platforms. Practically, the MILP’ is NP’ complete therefore, the proposed method is comprised of several problems and variables. To cope this issue, in this paper we have proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) this GA consists of a novel repairing framework to tackle the optimal solution infeasibilities for all contingencies. The simulation results show the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce power loss on the consumer end. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","battery storage; electric vehicles; online energy trading; real time pricing","Electric losses; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Internet of things; Power markets; Smart city; Actual power networks; Bi-directional flows; Distributed generator (DGs); Internet of Things (IOT); Mixed integer linear programming; Power generation efficiency; Renewable resource; Sealing structures; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099565387

This is so because of the wide variety of applications that can benefit from this technology. When perfected, waste heat from industrial plants and the sun can be stored for reuse at a later point in time, thus improving the energy efficiency of the system. Heat loss is a significant challenge that affects the efficiency of a thermal storage system especially at the high temperature range. In minimizing heat loss rate of thermal insulation layer, this work aims to use simulation models to determine and minimize rate of heat loss of a simulated cylindrical kaolin thermal insulator within the working temperature range of 800 - 1000 oC. Two direction were used which are radial and axial. They were simulated and analyzed one after the other. Two simulation software were employed to validate the results from each of them. Length of thermal insulation, temperature of inner surface and ambient temperature were the independent variables accounted for this work while the rate of heat loss at the outer surface was the dependent variable. In the axial direction, the dependent variable was more sensitive to changes in the independent variables compared to the radial direction. The change in the length of the thermal insulation layer had the highest impact on the dependent variable followed by the temperature of the internal surface and then lastly by the combined effect of these two factors. The effect of ambient temperature was insignificant. From the results of the work, suggestion was made from the simulation results, that the length of 0.22 m will be used to construct a portable thermal storage unit within the operating temperature range of 700 - 900 oC. In conclusion, results will also serve as framework for the simulation at higher working temperatures. © International Research Publication House.","Heat loss; High temperature; Kaolin; Simulation; Thermal Insulator; Thermal storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099515486

Firstly, a detailed description of the losses-related phenomena along with the method of calculating each type of loss are addressed. Secondly, an energy analysis of the engine is carried out in order to specify the impact of each type of losses on the performance. Finally, the design effectiveness of each component of the engine is investigated using an exergy analysis. The results reveal that the hysteresis loss occurs mainly within the working spaces due to the flow jetting during the first part of the expansion strokes. Additionally, the pressure difference between the working spaces is the main driver for the flow leakage through the appendix gap. The exposure of the displacer top wall to the jet of hot gas flowing into the expansion space during expansion stroke essentially increases the shuttle heat loss. A new definition for the regenerator effectiveness is presented to assess the quality of the heat storage and recovery processes. The energy analysis shows that regenerator thermal loss and pumping power represent the largest part of the engine losses by about 9.2% and 7.5% of the heat input, respectively.

The completion of electron storage and transportation requires the process of cellular respiration with the aid of electron transport chains. Therefore, the work of deciphering electron transport proteins is inevitably needed. The identification of these proteins with high performance has a prompt dependence on the choice of methods for feature extraction and machine learning algorithm. In this study, protein sequences served as natural language sentences comprising words. The nominated word embedding-based feature sets, hinged on the word embedding modulation and protein motif frequencies, were useful for feature choosing. Five word embedding types and a variety of conjoint features were examined for such feature selection. The support vector machine algorithm consequentially was employed to perform classification. The performance statistics within the 5-fold cross-validation including average accuracy, specificity, sensitivity as well as MCC rates surpass 0.95. Such metrics in the independent test are 96.82%, 97.16%, 95.76%, and 0.9, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art predictors, the proposed method can generate more preferable performance above all metrics indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method in determining electron transport proteins. Furthermore, this study reveals insights about the applicability of various word embeddings for understanding surveyed sequences.

To overcome this issue, a Hamiltonian energy control scheme is proposed, which is based on passivity control theory and port-controlled Hamiltonian framework. A complementary PI adjustment term is also included in the control algorithm to eliminate the steady-state output voltage error caused by the parameter uncertainty. The proposed control approach is applied to three different cascade structures. Firstly, the cascade structure between dc-dc converters is considered and detailed controller design is given. Secondly, the cascade connection of a single converter and its LC filter is studied. By placing the LC filter into the Hamiltonian model of the controlled converter system, the dynamic and potential instability caused by the filter can be adjusted. Finally, the cascade structure between subsystems including filters and converters, which are common in microgrids, is studied. By using the Hamiltonian function (storage function) as the Lyapunov function candidate, the large-signal stability of each controlled converter system is proved. When the cascade structure contains multiple controlled converter systems, the stability of the entire cascaded system is guaranteed by the superposition of multiple Lyapunov functions. A 3.5 kW 220&#x2014;270&#x2014;350 V test bench is built in the laboratory to demonstrate the application of the proposed control approach to these three cascade structures.

To improve the accuracy of the model, an analysis of the transfer functions was performed at different normalization intervals to choose the best model capable of estimating the PTC outlet temperature. A first model was developed that was used as a base model from 1,155 concordant experimental data. The variables were input temperature of the fluid, ambient temperature, irradiance, hour, day, configuration, volumetric flow, feeding temperature, and storage temperature. To validate the accuracy and the adaptability of the model proposed, statistical tests (coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE), significance test (F-Fisher and t-student), and linearity test (slope-intercept)) were performed. The base model was validated, having an R2 = 0.9961, RMSE = 0.14706, MAPE = 0.00795, also approved significance and linearity tests. Consequently, ten models were developed for the analysis of the proposed normalization intervals using the same architecture as the base model at five areas of interest with a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (TANSIG) and log-sigmoid (LOGISIG) functions. The results show that a model has higher accuracy; this model was the TANSIG of [0.1,0.9] with R2 = 0.9974, RMSE = 0.12123, MAPE = 5.93 × 10–5, and approved significance and linearity. © 2020 Desalination Publications.

The processing of fruits and vegetables can take place in one or two of the tech-nical floors of the skyscraper structure. In the lower floors of the skyscraper there are also larger fruit storages for storing the excess products intended for transportation to the local markets. It is especially important for the occupants to provide spaces for premises that will be used for a second purpose for medical purposes-for example for forced quarantine isolation in epidemics and pandemics (such as Corona virus), threatening the health and lives of the occupants. In this regard, the skyscraper was designed in Kun Ming, China.

PCMs are isothermal in nature, and thus offer higher density energy storage and the ability to operate in a variable range of temperature conditions. In this paper, experimental study has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the solar thermal storage system based on the energy and exergy analysis. Barium Hydroxide Octahydrate (BHO) and Sodium Acetate Trihydrate (SAT) were used as PCMs inside multi-capsule system arranged in series based on their melting temperatures. These two salts never being used together in a multi capsule solar storage system before. The capsules were charged by three water flow rates of 0.5 LPM, 1 LPM and 1.5 LPM that comes from a parabolic trough collector. The experimental results showed that the maximum energy and exergy storage of 139.38 kJ and 17.15 kJ, respectively were obtained from 1 LPM.

This research was carried out with the aim of obtaining a body condition index in Ctenosaura pectinata. We used 40 adult females distributed between two groups. The iguanas were fed with four types of commercial food. They were also weighed in grams, their body lengths were measured in centimeters (total, snout-vent and head), body diameters were measured in centimeters (tail base, hip, leg, and pelvis) and body volume was measured in milliliters. Descriptive statistics were performed and variables were checked for normality. A Pearson correlation analysis was carried out to identify any related variables. A body condition index classification was obtained from the mean value and standard deviation (I: 2S-μ, II: S-μ, III: μ+S and IV: μ+2S) and a prediction equation for volume was obtained by Stepwise analysis. The body condition index turned to be highly accurate (r=0.98, p˂0.0001). A body condition index classification in black iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata) was established, which will be useful for monitoring the body reserves of the species. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.

The equilibrium was reached within 8 to 10 days for desorption and adsorption, respectively over a stepwise increase of relative humidity ranging from 5% to 90%. Experimental data of fig sorption were fitted to three of most used models: GAB, Enderby and Peleg. High-accuracy prediction of the sorption isotherms for “Sarilop” and “Kadota” was obtained with Enderby and Peleg, respectively, since they presented the best adjustment (generally, R² ≥ 0.997 and SE ≤ 1.85). Thermodynamic proprieties revealed a remarkable varietal effect regarding the net isosteric heat, the differential entropy. These differences were probably attributed to chemical composition, structure of the tissues and the intermolecular forces between the sorption sites, water vapor, chemical composition, structure of the tissues and the intermolecular forces. The net isosteric heat of fig samples sorption decreases as the moisture content increased, and was found to be a polynomial function of moisture content for adsorption and desorption. The hysteresis loop was observed among all experiments and its magnitude was remarkable in water activity range of 0.4–0.8. The applied enthalpy-entropy compensation theory to sorption isotherms and plots net isosteric of sorption versus differential entropy provided the isokinetic temperatures, which suggested an enthalpy-controlled sorption process. As a first study of fig thermodynamic proprieties in Morocco, this work aimed to contribute to the fig drying and packaging design and optimization. It also intends to predict moisture changes that might occur during heating process and determine energy requirement for fig drying and shelf life stability. © 2020 SAAB","Equilibrium moisture; Ficus carica L; Isosteric heat of sorption; Sorption isotherms; Thermodynamics",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097780517

CAPEL is dedicated to producing and distributing several beverages such as sparkling wines, beers, energy drinks, rum, and pisco. This work aims to support the grinding-related transport stage through a linear programming based DSS, in order to find the optimal use of the transport demand in a network based on source and destination plants during the harvest season. To achieve this aim, an operational research (OR) model that feeds the DSS is developed, whose objective function seeks to minimize the total transport cost. The decision variables define the grape cargo to be transported from a source plant to a destination plant. The OR model uses constraints such as transportation demand, grinding capacity, maximum storage, and available grape in plants. The model succeeded in reducing the total transport costs by 14% for the 2017 season of the pisco-making process, meaning approximately savings of 59 million Chilean pesos. © 2020 The Authors.

Among all, carbon emission has a significant contribution to the problem of global warming thus, it is required to convert it into sustainable energy. This opportunity can be targeted with a green chemistry route and incorporating unique compounds like Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through phototechnology. MOFs are used in many fields like energy storage, heterogeneous catalysis, gas sensing, and gas storage, thus found to be very promising. MOFs can be used as both CO2 capture materials and as an effective photocatalyst to yield value-added products. The photocatalytic CO2 conversion through MOFs can be conducted either by using pure MOFs as a catalyst or by structural modification through linkers and metal nodes or constructing hybrid systems. Several value-added products like methane, formaldehyde, ethane, and carbon monoxide can be produced during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. In this review, synthesis of MOF, performance parameters, recent technologies, significant developments, and MOF based photocatalyst for carbon dioxide conversion to methanol has been discussed. This helps to evaluate the progress, application, and opportunities to explore the possibility of modified forms of metal-organic framework-based photocatalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. Finally, the conclusions and future perspectives of MOF-based photocatalytic CO2 reduction system also been deliberated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emission; Metal-organic frameworks (MOF); Methanol production; Photocatalysis; Structural modification","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Crystalline materials; Energy conservation; Hybrid systems; Metals; Methanol; Organometallics; Photocatalysis; Pollution control; Structural modification; Global warming",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097626509

Since a potter requires the involvement of both hands into the axisymmetric task of shaping clay as it rotated, the intermittent jolts by the potter foot meant that the energy supply would have short-term peaks when a pulse of energy is supplied, then it will trail off during the time it takes the potter foot to reach the wheel again. The friction from the bearings of the setup and the applied torque from the potter hands will rapidly consume the energy supplied by the initial kick. The addition of a flywheel is expected to assist in the stabilization of the operation of the device. The flywheel in fact is simply just an extra mass that will keep the kinetic energy of the system, defined as (Formula Presented), as steady as possible by normalizing the discrepancy of energy charge/discharge levels. In this particular case, this is achieved through increasing the physical inertia of the system (the resistance of the system to any change of its motion). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097523662

CSC is also known to be energy intensive with a significant emission footprint. As a result, CSC requires strict monitoring and control management system during storage and transportation to improve safety and reduce profit losses. In this research, a systematic review of recent literature related to the distribution of food CSC products is presented and possible areas to extend research in modeling and decision-making are identified. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes the content of 65 recent articles related to CSC and perishable foods. Several relevant keywords were used in the initial search, which generated a list of 214 articles. The articles were screened based on content relevance in terms of food vehicle routing modeling and quality. Selected articles were categorized and analyzed based on cost elements, modeling framework and solution approach. Finally, recommendations for future research are suggested. Findings: The review identified several research gaps in CSC logistics literature, where more focused research is warranted. First, the review suggests that dynamic vehicle modeling and routing while considering products quality and environmental impacts is still an open area for research. Second, there is no consensus among researchers in terms of quality degradation models used to assess the freshness of transported cold food. As a result, an investigation of critical parameters and quality modeling is warranted. Third, and due to the problem complexity, there is a need for developing heuristics and metaheuristics to solve such models. Finally, there is a need for extending the single product single compartment CSC to multi-compartment multi-temperature routing modeling. Originality/value: The article identified possible areas to extend research in CSC distribution modeling and decision-making. Modified models that reflect real applications will help practitioners, food authorities and researchers make timely and more accurate decisions that will reduce food waste and improve the freshness of transported food. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cold supply chain; Food distribution; Vehicle routing problem",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097231110

It allows utility, indirect control over the users energy consumption. This article proposes a new pricing structure, named as a real-time variable peak pricing scheme with a self-inbuilt feature to capture the benefit of both the existing pricing scheme, real-time pricing (RTP), and time of use (TOU), by switching its behavior between RTP and TOU as per the requirements. A home energy management model with comprehensive modeling of home appliances together with distributed storage and dispatchable generation is considered for testing the impact of the proposed pricing scheme and compared to existing RTP and TOU. The privacy and comfort of users are taken care of in the system modeling. An aggregative game approach is used to capture the interaction between users and utility. The conditions for the existence of Nash equilibrium and convergence of the proposed algorithm is investigated for all three pricing schemes considering residential users. The analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme compare to the existing pricing schemes in terms of consumers energy bill and system peak reduction, complexity, and incentive to active consumers to participate in demand-side management programs.

The arrangement of PE may different along the feeder either for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, fuel cells, wave energy system and battery storage unit, respectively. This is due to the electric voltage that might need to be converted from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and vice versa.

Different applications might require thermal energy for heating or cooling purposes; hence, a suitable energy storage material must be selected to efficiently meet the application's demand. This paper focuses on innovative ways of storing solar thermal energy that can be used in to improve the drying processes of conventional solar dryer systems used for food drying. It aims at identifying the most suitable and economical materials that can be used for the design of an optimal thermal energy storage system/unit to store energy from the sun during sunshine hours and release it during non-sunshine hours. The energy stored is aimed at prolonging the drying process and improving thermal efficiency of the solar dryer systems. The research conducted has identified two conceptual designs that are economically viable for the design and construction of a thermal energy storage system.

Agricultural practices include animal husbandry, food processing activities, and irrigation, harvesting, transfer, and storage of field crops. These actions result in the generation of million tonnes of organic and inorganic wastes per year including crop residues, livestock manure, and chemical and biological fertilizers. Agricultural wastes should be appropriately managed to avoid serious environmental concerns such as eutrophication of surface water, groundwater contamination, odor emissions, and deterioration of soil, water, and air. Hence, this chapter demonstrates the strategies of agricultural waste management in the MENA region regarding the available land, water, and energy resources. The threefold solutions of agricultural wastes are (a) reduction via improving irrigation efficiency, developing cultivation strategies, minimizing chemical fertilizers, applying control and process monitoring schemes, investing in agricultural sectors, and increasing environmental awareness and education, (b) reuse in irrigation, fertilization, bio-energy production, pyrolysis, direct combustion, animal feed, and pollutant adsorption, and (c) recycling through civil construction and composting approaches. These strategies are presented regarding case studies reported in the literature for stimulating agricultural waste management in the MENA region. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agro-waste management; Agro-waste quantity and quality; Biomass and bioresource; MENA agricultural activities; Three R’s agro-waste",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095717168

It is a proven, mature, predictable, and price-competitive technology. Hydropower has among the best conversion efficiencies of all known energy sources (about 90% efficiency, water to wire). It requires relatively high initial investment, but has a long life span with very low operation and maintenance costs. The existing hydropower system has an annual generation capacity of 4100 TWh a-1 and contributes to almost 17% of the annual electricity generation, worldwide. There is still a large potential for further development, as the total technical potential has been estimated to be roughly 16, 000 TWh. Out of this, about 9600 TWh has been classified as economical potential. In Europe, close to 50% of technical potential has already been developed, while in Asia 24% and in Africa only 6%. Significant potential can also be found in existing infrastructure that currently lacks generating units (e.g., existing barrages, weirs, dams, canal fall structures, water supply schemes) by adding new hydropower facilities. Only 25% of the existing 45, 000 large dams in the world are currently used for hydropower, and the other 75% are used exclusively for other purposes (e.g., irrigation, flood control, navigation, and urban water supply schemes). Hydropower offers significant potential for carbon emissions reductions, as greenhouse gas emissions are generally very low, typically less than 1% of that from coal power plants. Hydropower is cost competitive, with LCOE typically in the range of 2-10 US c.(kWh)-1, which is comparable with the cost of energy from thermal power plants. Hydropower has an energy payback ratio of 200-300, highest of all types of renewable energies. Hydropower can provide both energy and water management services and also help to support other variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, by providing storage and load balancing services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidation aging of the lubricant sample containing rapeseed oil additive was proposed. Its higher thermal sensitivity was simultaneously confirmed by frequency dependent complex shear modulus of elasticity measurements as well as by rheological testing. Rapeseed oil modified lubricant showed a higher decrease in both storage and moduli losses due to a temperature increase from 16 to 26 ° C compared to the rapeseed oil free sample. Simultaneously, the flow curves were shifted to the higher shear stresses (for plastic lubricant without rapeseed oil additive) typical for rheopectic fluids. For the rapeseed oil modified lubricant, the flow curves were shifted to the lower shear stresses, indicating its thixotropic fluid behaviour. The synthetic lubricant without rapeseed oil additive exhibited higher dissipative rheological behaviour as reflected by decreasing first resonance frequency peak position compared to the rapeseed oil modified lubricant as obtained from vibration damping measurements. It was found that the synthetic lubricant exhibited better vibration damping properties and mechanical energy dissipation into heat due to its higher viscous friction than the rapeseed oil modified lubricant under experimental conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Mechanical testing; Plastic lubricants; Rheology; Thermal analysis; Viscous friction","Additives; Damping; Elastic moduli; Energy dissipation; Oilseeds; Petroleum additives; Shear flow; Shear stress; Synthetic lubricants; Textures; Thermoanalysis; Vegetable oils; Vibration analysis; Well testing; Experimental conditions; Frequency dependent; Mechanical and thermal properties; Mechanical energy dissipation; Resonance frequencies; Rheological behaviour; Rheological measurements; Temperature increase; Lubricating oils",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093944253

Various ANN structures and configurations are employed and discussed. However, the solutions are generally developed as case by case studies. The advised network for each specific problem is commonly selected through empirical or enumerative approaches. In this article, an evolutionary ensemble approach is proposed to pool ANNs with various structures and configurations to forecast domestic energy consumption efficiently. The approach utilizes an evolutionary method to select and reproduce better performed network individuals in a network pool to optimize prediction quality.

We investigate the effect of flexible vs. steady operation of the fuel synthesis and direct air capture, as well as the effects of different geographical locations. We find that if the system is optimized for cost, electricity is mainly supplied by the grid, and therefore the electricity prices and grid emission factors determine the economic and environmental performance. Moreover, the location plays a minor role in the cost of the minimum emissions point, as the direct air capture cost largely control the total plant costs. Along this line, the optimal design was found to rely on steady operation of the synthesis and direct air capture ensemble, as this allows for the lowest associated capital expenditure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","direct air capture; MILP; multi energy system; negative emissions technologies; net-zero",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092931050

Designing and setting the optimum operating conditions for the CLC reactors are important steps to be taken before implementing the process on an industrial scale. In this work, a dynamic mathematical model has been developed to simulate packed bed reactors used in a methane-based chemical looping combustion process with iron-based oxygen carrier. The air and fuel reactor models were interconnected with the models describing the purge steps of the process to highlight the dynamic behaviour of the entire process. The developed model was used to predict (in space and time): gas flow profile, gas composition distribution, behaviour of oxygen carrier and temperature profiles inside the air and fuel reactors. The simulation results of the 1D model had been compared with the experimental data published in the literature. The model developed is able to describe the process very accurately, for a wide range of gas flow rates. Increasing the flowrate by 20% of the base value lead to a shorter time in which the process achieved stationarity by approximately 300 s (for oxidation step).

To this end, thermal energy storage (TES) is an appealing technology that facilitates dynamic heat integration between supplier and consumer plants. A long-term strategy for energy savings must involve adequate consideration for the optimal design of the TES. From an industrial perspective, finding the capacity of the TES unit is often based on heuristic rules which may lead to suboptimal design. This approach does not account for the short-term variability in operation of the TES system. Scenario-based stochastic programming approaches, where the operational uncertainty is described in form of discrete scenarios, can be used to find the best design for the TES system. We present two problem formulations for finding the optimal capacity of the TES unit. The first is a single-level formulation where the design and operating constraints are combined for all scenarios, with the objective of minimizing the combined cost of design and operation. The second is a bilevel formulation where the design decisions are taken on the upper level to minimize overall system cost, whereas the lower level problems (one per scenario) represent the optimal operation for the chosen design variables, each minimizing the operating cost for their respective scenarios. We compare the results of the two approaches with an illustrative case study of an industrial cluster with one supplier plant and one consumer plant exchanging heat via a TES unit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","bilevel programming; industrial cluster; thermal energy storage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092779564

The increase of the application of solar energy equipment is beneficial for technology development related to the issue of sustainable energy and green energy buildings. This study develops a SWH system for hot water supply with modification of absorber plate. An integrated V-shaped absorber plate with phase change material (PCM) energy storage in the SWH system has been installed and its performance has been investigated experimentally. Two SWH systems consisting of V-shape absorber plate with and without PCM storage are built. The V-shape absorber plate is constructed and integrated with PCM storage in the system. The experimental tests of the two SWH systems using V-shaped absorber plate with and without PCM storage have been carried-out in the same operation time with various flowrates. The temperature of the paraffin has increased until the melting temperature and has decreased with the decrease of solar radiation in the afternoon. Paraffin as PCM storage contributes to increase the outlet water temperature. The results show that the average efficiency of the SWH system with PCM storage using paraffin is higher than the one of the SWH system without PCM storage. It has increased significantly of 20%, 14% and 13% with flowrates of 0.5; 1 and 1.5 L/min respectively. In addition, the characteristics of the PCM storage are shown clearly from 16:00 to 20:00 local time.

The charging balance of batteries is accomplished by utilising a new hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-based proportional integral (PI) controller with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This new hybrid GA-based PI with ANFIS control method is compared with the GA-based PI controller and the conventional PI controller based on Ziegler Nichols (ZN) technique. Dynamic simulations exhibit the right performance of the hybrid GA-based PI with ANFIS control for the proposed power system under study and the better performance than the GA-based PI controller and ZN-based PI controller.

The obtained results showed that the melting point of the PLA decreases from 162.2° (which is specific to PLA filament) to 153.1° after the 3D printing process and to 149.7° after the laser heating. The glass transition suffered the same lowering after the printing process but an important increasing after the laser heating. The elastic modulus evolution proved a decreasing of the plasticity and that is hapenning when the material suffers an increasing of its rigidity. The elongation viscosity was analyzed and its values were decreasing with the increasing of the temperature that happened on the material. The decreasing was produced by the reduction of the elasticity, when the chain branches are decreasing their length. The decreasing is more pronounced with the increasing of the temperature. The ratio between the loss modulus to the storage modulus and quantifies the way in which the PLA absorbs and disperses energy moves its peak from 65° (curve specific to the PLA filament) to 45° (curve specific to the last layer deposited by 3D printing process and re-heated by laser beam for marking). The peak means the lowest storage modulus, which is a measure of elastic response of a material, so the transition from glass to high elasticity moves to the lower temperatures. © 2020 Syscom 18 SRL.

Numerical analysis was performed to study the thermal energy storage tank using Ansys CFX. In this paper, the unsteady discharging process was studied with two values of water flow rate. The model was simulated with two diffusers at the top and the bottom of the tank. The point of this research was to reduce the turbulence in the tank and the thermocline thickness. Results indicated that the thermal stratification improves with low inlet velocity, and high temperature difference, while the storage mixing increases by enlarging the inlet water flow rate. Then again, the inlet flow rates can be enlarged, without the increase of the mixing, beyond the thermocline has been formed. Again, thermoclines can be formed between the high temperature differences and varied with the variation in flow rate. In addition, large thermocline thickness between the water layers stored in the tank and the inlet water reduces the mixing due to the high difference in the density between the layers also high inlet water velocity results in increasing the mixing of water. © 2020 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

An air-PCM thermal storage unit integrated in solar systems is a device, which employs the latent heat TES to balance between the demand and supply of heat (or cold) for space heating (or cooling) in buildings. Previously published studies demonstrate that this approach is viable but design parameters of the unit need to be optimized. In the paper, a computer model of the heat storage unit was developed and coupled to metaheuristic nature-inspired optimization algorithms with the aim of design optimization of the TES unit. The unit consisted of flat plates made of a PCM, which was macro-encapsulated in aluminium containers. The energy balance and control volume methods were used to build the model and the effective heat capacity technique was applied for phase change modelling. The model was created in Python, validated against experimental data and an open-source optimization library DEAP with metaheuristics was used as an optimization solver. A design optimization problem was specified with including the arrangement of the PCM plates and their thickness.

Energy storage technologies have the ability to overcome the intermittent nature of energy sources (such as wind and solar energy) and respond to unexpected situations like power failure. Liquid air energy storage (LAES) achieves good round-trip efficiencies by using hot and cold energy storages for heat transfer between the charging and discharging operations. In this work, the LAES technology has been studied and multi-component fluid cycles (MCFCs) are considered for the first time to replace the previously suggested single-component fluids in the cold thermal energy storage cycles to increase the performance of the cold cycles. Two case studies related to single MCFC and dual MCFC are simulated, optimized and compared. The optimal composition for the multi-component fluids is determined by using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. The objective function is to maximize the round-trip efficiency of the process. The results indicate that the LAES process with dual MCFC is superior to the case with single MCFC in terms of liquid yield (95.1 % vs. 87.1 %), exergy efficiency (86.1 % vs. 82.4 % for charging and 85.5 % vs. 78.5 % for discharging) and round-trip efficiency (61.8 % vs. 53.9 %). © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092103065

In contrast to electricity, the use of solar energy in the form of heat is simple and straightforward. Solar air collectors (SAC), which convert solar radiation into heat and transfer it to the air, represent a way how to use solar energy for space heating in buildings. In the paper, the operation and optimal design of a solar air collector integrating a phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage is computationally investigated. A computer model of a front and back pass solar air collector with a PCM-based absorber was developed and validated against experimental data. The energy balance approach coupled with the control volume method was implemented for solving conduction heat transfer inside the PCM, and the effective heat capacity method was used for phase change modelling. The developed model was consequently coupled with the self-adaptive differential evolution optimization method. The cost function was defined as the root mean square error between the outlet SAC temperature and the set temperature. Using PCM parameters and its width as variables, the optimal set of parameters was determined. The optimal temperature of phase change was equal to 64.8 °C , PCM thickness 0.08 m and material parameter c1 = 69,997 J/kg K. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092100608

Consequently, global industrial and political commitments have been established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon reduction can be achieved either by increasing the efficiency of the existing processes, using renewable sources of power instead of burning fossil fuels, or through implementing carbon capture, utilization, and/or sequestration technologies. Unfortunately, the implementation of carbon reduction projects is minor compared to the existing opportunities. For projects to be implemented, it is very important to establish their economic feasibility. Given the different access to renewable energy, utilization, and storage options, CO2 emissions reduction would exhibit very different economics depending on the location. The implementation of carbon reduction technologies should be performed in a strategic approach that yields minimal investment and operating costs. This work incorporates different options for renewable energy sources, carbon utilization, and/or carbon sequestration. The aim is to plan an optimal arrangement of these technologies for implementation in different geographic locations such as Norway, Japan, and Qatar. Process Integration techniques used to optimize the operation of chemical processes have been developed to support decisions and organize the planning of carbon reduction projects. Carbon abatement cost curves have been applied as a policy and decision support tool allowing easy comparison between different technologies and pathways. This work tries to find the minimum cost of mitigating emissions through applying Process Integration principles on the different geographical regions and constructing the corresponding cost curves. The results will allow understanding the opportunities for carbon reduction under the economic constraints. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092079631

The portion of the process heat duty that can effectively be supplied from solar thermal energy, or solar fraction, increases with the inlet temperature of the solar field. The increase of inlet temperature is beneficial since it reduces the size of the solar field. The way to achieve higher inlet temperatures is by means of surplus heat that is stored during sunny hour. For further increasing the period of operation beyond sunny hours, thermal storage must be increased. In this work, two case studies are considered and it is found that the integration of solar thermal plants proves to be a cost-effective alternative in energy conservation and pollution reduction. The payback time reveals that doubling the time where the solar system delivers the required temperature is still profitable. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092064949

The considered objective function is formulated in terms of the current and voltage errors to enable the HRES to participate effectively within the connected micro-grid via optimal gains of the PID controllers. The results verify that the performance of the HRES is enhanced considerably by optimizing the parameters of the HRES controllers using the ASCA under several operating conditions of solar irradiation, temperature and wind speed. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.","Levy flight distribution; Micro-grid; Optimization; PID controller; Renewable energy system; Sine cosine algorithm",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091538633

The aim is to increase the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in buildings while keeping optimal operational conditions of storage devices. However, the variability and the unpredictable behavior of the power produced by RESs require the use of energy management systems and adaptive control strategies for their seamless integration within the traditional electric grid. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is developed, named MAPCAST, for measuring, analyzing, predicting, and forecasting actions in order to ensure efficient and optimal operation of MG systems. The control strategy is based on machine-learning algorithms to predict main parameter inputs, which are used for forecasting suitable actions. Its main objective is to manage the batteries' charge/discharge (C/D) currents, and consequently, the battery state of charge (SoC), taking into consideration the variable nature of RES generation and loads demand satisfaction. A real data-set was gathered from our actual MG system using an IoT/Big-Data platform, which was deployed to measure the different input control parameters. Simulation results are presented to show the utility of the proposed control strategy for efficient operation and optimal energy balance in MG systems. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.","Energy management system; IoT and big-data platform; Machine-learning algorithms; Micro-grid systems; Model predictive control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091510991

This paper studies the optimal set point of isolated MG units containing renewable generators, diesel generators and battery storage. The optimal energy dispatch of MG's units is determined to supply the required load demand for a 48h horizon time. As the battery device has an important contribution in the MG, this paper proposes to implement battery degradation cost in the optimization model in addition to the fuel cost function. For this purpose, the Rainflow algorithm is used to count charging-discharging cycles and quantify the battery degradation. In addition, a Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Sine Cosine Acceleration Coefficients (H-PSO-SCAC) algorithm is used to solve the defined objective function for an optimal energy management system of the isolated MG. A Weight Factor (WF) is proposed in the objective function. For the simulation tests, different values of WF are considered. The impact of WF is analysed on the algorithm behaviour, on the status of the State Of Charge (SOC) of the battery and its influence on the optimized MG cost function. The results demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate value of WF allows to the H-PSO-SCAC algorithm to achieve the best solution. In addition, with WF equals to 0.5, the charge/discharge cycles are reduced and the battery SOC is more stable. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.","Battery degradation cost; Hybrid particle swarm optimization with sine cosine acceleration coefficients; Hybrid resources; Microgrid; Rainflow algorithm; Weight factor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091484567

Some of the major applications of heat storage systems are in buildings, solar energy technologies, and waste heat recovery from high-temperature applications. Thermal energy storage could be in the form of sensible heat, latent heat, or chemical heat arising from bond breaking and formation in chemical reactions. Among all these forms of solar energy storage aforementioned, latent heat thermal energy storage is greatly explored because it is generally safe to use and its ability to store a large quantity of heat in a relatively small volume. Phase change materials (PCMs) are widely used in latent heat thermal energy storage systems. Some of the setbacks encountered with the use of PCMs are its low-thermal conductivity and subcooling characteristics. Nanoparticles have been found very useful in improving the thermal conductivity of PCMs, thereby improving its general performance. The nano-PCM considered in this work is (graphene + octadecanol). The top surface of the nano-PCM enclosure was exposed to ambient solar radiation. The solar radiation data for Johannesburg (26.2041° S, 28.0473° E) was used for the simulation. A two-dimensional heat transfer equation was solved numerically using initial, boundary, and phase transition conditions. The effect of volume fractions of nanoparticles on the melt fractions was investigated. From the result obtained, the PCM with 4% loading of nanoparticles yielded the best result. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","CFD; Graphene nanoparticles Trombe walls; Phase change materials (PCMs)",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091322771

The economic analysis of the payback period for the investment in storage systems when the storage system provides energy arbitrage services only has been analysed under the ToU tariff schemes. For the distribution network operator owning a storage system, the payback period, when storage systems are incorporated into the network, ranges from 83 to 5 years when there is an increase in variation of consumer tariffs from 1 to 10% of the present electricity costs.

Energy storage systems are used to counteract the intermittent nature of renewable sources. Therefore, the optimal sizing and design of stand-alone renewable generating systems is a significant concern to get a more cost-effective system. This paper focuses on achieving the optimum design and size of a microgrid to meet the load requirements and reducing the total cost including capital, investment, operational and maintenance costs. For this aim, the sizing problem is formulated to be solved using three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO). The employed microgrid comprises hybrid renewable energy sources of PV/Wind systems integrated with a hybrid energy storage system of Battery and FC/Electrolyzer set for supplying AC loads located in Zafarana, Egypt.

Because of the constant use of fuel for power generation, which releases CO2 that could be sequestered in geologic sites preventing their eventual release to the atmosphere. This study used Afam IV Gas Turbines in Nigeria as a case study and evaluated the emission of CO2 from the plants and the techno-economic analysis of transporting captured CO2 from this power plant to Jones Creek (the proposed sequestration site in this study). The CO2 emission factor was determined from the daily energy generation from the gas consumption of the two turbines at the plant. Pipe Flo Professional 14 software was used for the pipeline design that was used for the transportation. The CO2 emissions from the two turbines were found to have a flow rate of 0.68kg/s, requiring 4,416kW and 61.402kW of compressor power and pump power, respectively, each at 85% efficiency. This power requirement constitutes 3.44% of 130MW of the installed capacity of the two turbines at Afam IV. The capacity of Jones Creek was found to be 8.94x106m3, and the pipeline cost for the transportation of CO2 was found to be ₦21.994Billion. The National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO) D3 billing rose to 600% during the construction period but dropped to 19% increment beyond the construction period as a result of the CO2 compression and transportation. It is recommended that the Federal Government of Nigeria should start to implement policies that would propel oil and gas companies in Nigeria to start considering CCS as an emission mitigation option in Nigeria. © International Research Publication House.","Carbon capture and storage; CO2; Multi-year tariff order; Pipeline; Sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090622732

The tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) device structure, located inside the magnetic read-write head of a hard drive, is the most complex and sensitive component, which contains sensitive components, such as a touchdown sensor and a near-field transducer. The laser used in the writing process might cause degradation of magnetic head components. The effects of laser irradiation on the TMR device have been investigated using a quasi-static test measurement to observe the characteristic changes of the magnetic response sensitivity function. The results showed only the amplitude degradation, as the resistance and asymmetry parameters were unchanged. The nanostructure of the degradation TMR devices was investigated by using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. It was found that the manganese depletion in the antiferromagnetic layer causes a nonactive zone due to the poor magnetic coupling pinning function and reduces the functioning of the HDD. The ratio of active and nonactive zone elements has a strong correlation to the amplitude degradation of individual TMR devices. The TMR structure with shorter strip height can have a higher risk of device degradation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","heat-assisted magnetic recording; information storage; Magneto-electronics; recording heads; tunneling magnetoresistance","Hard disk storage; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetic recording; Photodegradation; Scanning electron microscopy; Antiferromagnetic layers; Heat assisted magnetic recording; Magnetic data recording heads; Near-field transducers; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Sensitive components; Tunneling magneto resistive; X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry; Magnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090561886

Prostheses have evolved in recent centuries, at first, they were made of wood but specialists in the field have conducted research to develop new materials and technologies, such as carbon fiber foot or bionic ankle joint. Generally, prosthetic feet can be divided into three categories. According to the schedule presented into the article, they are regular feet (CF), energy storage and return (ESR) feet, and the so-called “bionic” feet. Each prosthesis is designed and assembled according to the person’s physical appearance, functional needs, and accessibility. To this day, the design of the leg prosthesis has improved, but it cannot actively adapt to different walking speeds in a way comparable to biological limbs. Since the 1990s, more and more attention has been paid to the incorporation of active components in prosthetic limbs because passive devices cannot provide enough power for the ankle while walking. Today, most of these bionic devices are still at the research level, but they can be expected to be on the market soon. In this paper, the evolution of prosthetic feet over the last two decades is reflected, from early prosthetic feet to recent bionic feet. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Bionic feet; Energy-storing-and-returning; Foot prostheses",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090512356

The development of new materials with high dielectric constant and low losses is one of the main goals in scientific research for electronic applications. These properties allow reduction of the size and weight of the electronic devices. In this work, powders of sodium ferrite were prepared by sol-gel, using iron nitrate and sodium acetate as raw materials, according to the Pechini route. In order to optimize the synthesis parameters, the materials were heat-treated, and structural, morphological and dielectric characterization was performed to find the most suitable ones for storing energy. The sample structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and the morphology surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The dielectric properties were studied in a frequency range between 100 Hz and 1 MHz at temperatures from 200 up to 370 K by impedance spectroscopy measurements. The complex permittivity at 2.7 GHz and 5 GHz (T = 300 K) was determined using the small perturbation method through resonant cavities. The sample of sodium ferrite heat-treated at 1100 °C is the most promising for energy storage with a dielectric constant of ≈818 (f = 1 kHz; T = 300 K) and ≈6 (f = 5 GHz; T = 300 K), with low losses. The dielectric constant increases with the presence of Na3Fe5O9 phase and with the grain size and consequently porosity decreases. At low frequencies, this sample presents two relaxation processes described by Cole-Cole model and the relaxation time versus temperature has an Arrhenius behaviour. © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.","Dielectric relaxation; Impedance spectroscopy; Microwaves; Sodium ferrites",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090371638

First, a technical comparison is carried out comparing also with traditional OPC and PPC and considering standards applied in the island. Secondly, an economic assessment of production and investment costs is carried out using life cycle costing (LCC) technique. Afterwards, to assess environmental impacts a simplified life cycle assessment is performed to compare both cements, OPC and PPC. Cement based on LC2 reports economic advantages in comparison with the other cements: industrial LC3, OPC and PPC. Environmental results show a similar behaviour for local and industrial LC3 but a significant decrease of emissions and energy demand versus OPC and PPC. Technical comparison shows that local LC3 results are variable but complies with the standard for its use in mortars and non-structural applications. Finally, results show that LC3 introduction is a feasible option to reduce impacts of the cement industry in Cuba, and a combination of its local and industrial production is the best alternative to achieve sustainability goals in the short and mid-terms. Main opportunities of local LC3 are the reduction of costs, the easier storage, the use of local materials, amongst other.

Two formalisms were used to analyze the data: (a) the electrical conductivity which has found to follow the Jonscher’s law with single and double exponents for carbon nanotube concentrations below and above the percolation threshold, respectively, and (b) the complex impedance that has permitted to identify the relaxation peaks according to the Cole–Cole model. Both the two formalisms showed that when the carbon nanotube concentration is higher than the percolation threshold, a positive temperature coefficient and a remarkable change in conductivity were observed, suggesting that the presence of the carbon nanotube greatly affect the electrical properties of the engine oil as a result of additional polarization effect induced by these nanoparticles.

To avoid collisions that may occur between readers, anti-collision protocols use two approaches. The centralized approach based on Time Divisible Multiple Access (TDMA). The decentralized approach is based on the Carrier Sense multiple Access (CSMA) and uses notifications. That’s why we offer Called Beacon Analysis-based Collision Prevention more (BACP+) to provide better performance for Called Beacon Analysis-based Collision Prevention (BACP) which uses the centralized approach by optimizing resources, and promoting the greatest number of reading with less interference. BACP+ makes full use of available resources, and frequency channels to ensure proper collision management and coverage time. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Anti-colision protocol; Radio Frequency IDentification; Reader-tag","Agricultural robots; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Collision avoidance; Medium access control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Storage as a service (STaaS); Wireless sensor networks; Anti-collision protocols; Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA); Centralized approaches; Decentralized approach; Frequency channels; Medium access control(MAC); Proper collision; Transmission capacities; Time division multiple access",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089720080

Compared to more widespread thermal engines, fuel cells have the advantage of a direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy with higher efficiency (approx. 40%-60%). In this chapter, the main innovative fuel cell technologies (e.g., proton exchange membrane fuel cell, phosphoric acid, and solid oxide fuel cell) are explained based on their characteristics with respect to potential advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. The current major challenges due to the partly low technological readiness level of some fuel cell types are the relatively high costs, as well as durability and reliability. These three factors must be overcome in order to realize a high market penetration in the power and mobility sector. However, fuel cells are getting closer to cost-competitiveness in a growing variety of applications, ranging from vehicles to stationary and portable applications. Today’s most important applications for fuel cells, measured in terms of the number of devices installed, are building and off-grid power supply but also power generation and storage applications. Another growing market is the field of vehicle powertrains in versatile applications especially where required ranges and operating times are high and hardly satisfiable by renewable alternatives like, e.g., battery powered systems. Today most of the hydrogen is derived from fossil natural gas. Hydrogen produced via renewable powered water electrolysis can provide significant environmental benefits for the fuel production. However, the environmental impact associated with the manufacture of fuel cells still represent challenges to be addressed in future years. Given a sustained policy support, together with the intense research and resulting technological progress in hydrogen and fuel cell development in the recent years, fuel cells are potentially supposed to experience a cost and performance trajectory similar to those of photovoltaics and batteries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The device is powered by applying an external power source to force ions from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution through alternating ion exchange membranes. The current is discharged by allowing ions to move from the concentrated solution through the same membranes to dilute solutions, supplying electrical energy at the electrodes.

Currently, our energy system is dominated by fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases. Thus, it is necessary to switch to renewable energy forms and increase efforts in waste-to-energy systems. However, once renewable energy sources are introduced in the industrial system, the most important considerations are stability and sustainability of the energy supply because of the intermittency of renewable energy. Based on the previous considerations, storage technologies for electrical energy are discussed to compensate for this problem. A few mature technologies are introduced, such as pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), compressed air energy storage (CAES), H2 energy storage and batteries. However, they have not been widely applied due to some limitations such as geographical constraints, high capital costs and low system efficiencies. Liquid air energy storage (LAES) has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of the previous technologies and can integrate well with existing equipment and power systems. In this chapter, the principle of LAES is analysed, and four LAES technologies with different liquefaction processes are compared. Four evaluation parameters are used: round-trip efficiency, specific energy consumption, liquid yield and exergy efficiency. Capacity and response time are also essential properties. The results indicate that LAES with hot and cold energy storage has considerable advantages over the other processes. Finally, the prospects of a hybrid system with higher system efficiency and performance, where LAES is integrated with renewable energy, waste heat and batteries are discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089323116

Furthermore, the energy density of batteries, in general, has developed significantly from around 30 Wh kg-1 for lead-based batteries, up to over 200 Wh kg-1 for Li-ion batteries [1]. Because of these significant increases in specific energy (as well as reductions in cost and improvements in durability), Li-ion-based batteries have already been implemented into small transport vehicles. Presently Li-ion batteries are being implemented into large-scale hybrid and electric vehicles [2], such as electric buses, hybrid electric buses and hybrid-powered ships [3], as bigger cells have become cost-effective. Because bigger cars use electricity, there is a need for bigger battery packs that can withstand more severe usage. To realise the full potential of Li-ion batteries, thermal management of their internal and external environments is required. To achieve this, small sensors (e.g. 10 µm thick), stable and inert are required.

Lithium-ion batteries have become the leading energy storage technology in many sectors due to their superior properties. However, for being fully compatible with alternative technologies, there are still obstacles to overcome. The most urgent requirements are cost reduction, accompanied by an increase in battery life. This chapter gives a brief introduction into the working principle of lithium-ion batteries, the most common commercially available cathode materials lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC), lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and the anode materials hard carbon and graphite. It summarises the most recent developments in applications of lithium-ion batteries, the accompanying new requirements and operating conditions. Moreover, a literature review of studies investigating the capacity degradation is included and compared in terms of the influence of operating conditions on the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries for different chemistries. The results indicate that the NMC/hard carbon battery performed best when evaluating the cycling, the LFP/graphite batteries are more stable in terms of calendar ageing. Moreover, increased temperature seems to be the most detrimental factor for almost all chemistries for both cycling and storage although the critical temperature differs.

Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel or other highly radioactive waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management in the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE’s repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical issues. Licensing and design work for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository was halted under the Obama Administration, which cited continued opposition from Nevada. To develop an alternative nuclear waste policy, the Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, which in 2012 recommended a “consent based” process for siting nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The Trump Administration included funds to restart Yucca Mountain licensing in its FY2018 and FY2019 budget submissions to Congress. The FY2018 Yucca Mountain funding request was not enacted. For FY2019, the House voted to provide $100 million above the Administration’s request for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate zeroed it out (H.R. 5895). Although no funding has been appropriated for Yucca Mountain activities since FY2010, a federal appeals court on August 13, 2013, ordered NRC to continue the licensing process with previously appropriated funds. The NRC staff completed its safety evaluation report on Yucca Mountain on January 29, 2015, concluding that the repository would meet NRC standards after specific additional actions were taken, such as acquisition of land and water rights. A bill to provide the necessary land controls for the planned Yucca Mountain repository (H.R. 3053, H.Rept. 115-355) passed the House on May 10, 2018. In addition, the House-passed bill would authorize DOE to store commercial waste from nuclear power plants at a nonfederal interim storage facility. It would also increase the capacity limit on the Yucca Mountain repository from 70,000 to 110,000 metric tons, in comparison with the approximately 80,000 metric tons currently stored at U.S. nuclear plants. Nonfederal interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel are being proposed in New Mexico and Texas. An NRC license application for the New Mexico facility was filed March 30, 2017. Developers of the proposed Texas storage site filed a license application in 2016, subsequently withdrew it because of rising costs, and then submitted a renewed application with an additional partner on June 11, 2018. Interim storage proponents contend that DOE could fulfill its disposal obligations under NWPA by taking title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites and storing it at private facilities until a permanent underground repository could be opened. NWPA required DOE to begin removing spent fuel from reactor sites by January 31, 1998. Because that deadline was missed, nuclear utilities have sued DOE to recover the additional storage costs they have incurred, with damage payment so far totaling $6.9 billion. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Solar photovoltaic (PV), Wind and Battery Storage are the prime components of interest constituting the hybrid system. In addition to the economic aspect of the systems, the formulation focuses on renewable prioritized operation, system reliability and environmental sustainability enhancement. Being a multi-objective (MO) problem, a modified non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization is used for solving the problem, considering operational cost, pollutant emission, and expected energy not served as operational objectives. The non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) is augmented with crowding distance technique, stochastic weight trade-off and chaotic mutation approaches, to control the exploration of global and particle bests, alleviating premature convergence, and enhancing solution search capability. A two-stage approach is used to derive the best solution. A modified IEEE 30-bus test system is used to demonstrate the results.

The work analyses the global solar irradiation by average monthly values and the sunshine duration, based on the statistical data from the last 21 years, specific to Romania, in several cities and in Bucharest. These parameters are compared for Bucharest with data from other eight European cities, using the archive data of the World Radiation Data Centre, for the period 1995–2016, for January, April, July and October months. This chapter also presents values of experimental measurement of solar irradiation, with high accuracy, made in Bucharest, from each season, during 2017–2018. In this chapter, we also review in brief the types of solar thermal collectors that can be used to improve the thermal comfort of buildings. The authors present solar air collectors in various constructive solutions and technologies to store the solar energy. They analyse their performance with changing environmental factors such as wind and atmospheric instability, keeping these performances longer with advanced storage technology. The applications of these thermal solar collectors are multiple, both for heating and cooling of the space, installed both separately or in thermoelectric hybrid systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Solar air collectors; Solar irradiation; Sunshine duration",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088727659

This comes at the cost of excessive energy utilization. Many solutions have been put forwarded, however, only few of them are tested in a real-time environment, where the energy saving is achieved by compromising the systems’ reliability. Therefore, energy-efficient resource utilization without compromising the system’s reliability is still a challenge. In this research, a novel architecture, “Sleep Alert”, is proposed that not only avoids the excessive energy utilization but also improves the system reliability by using Resource Manager (RM) concept. In contrary to traditional approaches, Primary and Secondary Resource Managers i.e. RMP and RMS respectively are used to avoid the single point of failure. The proposed architecture is tested on a network where active users were accessing the distributed virtual storage and other applications deployed on the desktop machines, those are connected with each other through a peer-to-peer network. Experimental results show that the solution can save considerable amount of energy while making sure that reliability is not compromised. This solution is useful for small enterprise networks, where saving energy is a big challenge besides reliability. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy-efficient computing; Enterprise networks; Green computing; Resource manager; Sleep proxy","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent computing; Managers; Network architecture; Peer to peer networks; Real time systems; Sleep research; Virtual storage; Computing machines; Enterprise networks; Proposed architectures; Real-time environment; Resource utilizations; Secondary resources; System reliability; Traditional approaches; Reliability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088520390

They can be used to obtain an auxiliary clinical tool, as close as possible to reality, with great potential for the development of preventive measures, diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. A wide range of models defining the rheological behavior of blood, ranging from the Newtonian to the purely shearthinning non-Newtonian models have been used by many authors. However, in vessels, such as carotid or coronary arteries, the validity of such simplified models for blood is not completely clear, mainly in stenotic or aneurysm cases - regions of high velocity gradients. It iswell-known, from literature, that blood has complex rheology, behaving as a viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluid due to the storage and release of elastic energy from red blood cells aggregates. Therefore, authors of the present work implemented the viscoelastic property of blood, in UDFs of Ansys® software, in order to simulate the most accurate hemodynamics. Afterwards, the velocity contours, in the middle plane of a 3D idealized coronary artery, were obtained considering the purely shear-thinning model, Carreau model, and two viscoelastic non-Newtonian models. Using the Generalized Oldroyd-B, a quasi-linear model, the viscoelastic effects are not highlighted. Comparing results taking into account the multi-mode Giesekus, a non-linear model, and Carreau model, differences are significant and equal to 0.20 m/s under a maximum velocity of 1.40 m/s (14.3%). Using the multi-mode Giesekus model, the viscoelastic effects are pronounced in addition to the shear-thinning, mainly in regions with high velocity gradients as the stenotic region. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blood rheology; Hemodynamics; Non-linear models; Quasi-linear models; Viscoelasticity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088423496

A mathematical model consisting of the general power balance equation, equations describing the operation of all generators, electrical load and losses, as well as limitations and initial conditions has been developed for the research. The obtained model allows studying the features of frequency and power regulation during operation of wind, solar power plants and battery energy storage systems for different conditions and characteristics of system elements, as well as determining the most effective laws of regulation. Calculations were performed on an aggregated scheme of the power system, which includes nuclear and thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants, loads, losses, wind, solar power plants and battery energy storage systems. It is shown that introduction of wind and solar power plants of large capacity into the structure of generating capacities of the integrated power system without taking additional measures on power balancing can lead to unacceptable frequency deviations in the system. It was proved that stabilization of frequency and power in integrated power systems with powerful wind and solar power plants can be achieved by introducing into the structure of integrated power systems of battery energy storage systems with a capacity comparable to the installed capacity of renewable energy sources.

The processes occurring in ash dumps are described, specifically: evaporation of water with the formation of dry ash and dust particles in the territory of dry sites under the influence of wind and water infiltration (illuminated or even partially untreated) and the penetration of dissolved forms of toxic ash-slag components into groundwater and water bodies located beyond them. The features of the transport of pollutants in the zone of influence of ash-slag dumps are investigated. The processes and phenomena that are observed during the transport of dissolved substances in the soil are determined. The components of the process of wind erosion and the mechanisms of action on particles located on the surface layer of the territory of ash dumps are described. The factors determining the erosion of ash-slag dumps as an areal object are listed. A mathematical model of the migration of pollutants in soils is described, which consists of a system of differential equations in partial derivatives of the second order with variable coefficients. An analytical solution of these equations is presented with certain simplifications for the case of two-dimensional flow, when the aquifer can be considered horizontal, single-layer and homogeneous.

PMMA-CCT filled with metal precursor solution were carbonized under N2 followed by oxidized under 50% O2 in N2 atmosphere. X-ray diffraction patterns of the obtained porous LaCoO3 are rhombohedral LaCoO3 phase without impurity. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to examine the morphology of porous LaCoO3. The SEM image of the LCO-Lys/Cit exhibits better connected particles and a well-defined pore structure compared to those prepared by Lys or 40%Me/EG metal precursor solutions. The evolution of pore formation of LCO-Lys/Cit was investigated by SEM, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermal gravitational analysis (TGA). The materials show high catalytic properties for the electrochemical water oxidation reaction. The high capacitances of all porous LaCoO3 are attributed to the controlled three-dimensional porous morphology of the catalysts.

The MPC was designed to effectively manage the energy supplied to the batteries, depending on the state of charge, hence the controller output is the signal used to regulate the charging current. The data used for prediction is the meteorological measures taken during three years using an insitu weather station that collected irradiance, wind speed and direction, temperature, and pressure.

Objective: This study evaluated the effect of fortification with snail meat powder on physicochemical properties and shelf-life of sorghum-wheat buns. Methods: Buns were prepared by replacing a part of sorghum-wheat flour with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% of snail meat powder. Physical properties including volume, density, baking loss, yield, weight, hardness and colour, the proximate analyses including moisture, crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre and ash and mineral composition of iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium and copper were analyzed for the buns. In vitro protein digestibility was determined by pepsin digestion. Plate count agar and potato dextrose agar were respectively used for enumeration of bacterial and fungal flora in the buns during storage. Shelf-life determination was based on the number of days before the production of off flavours and fungal infestation. Results: Compositing sorghum-wheat flour with snail meat powder progressively improved the density, baking loss, yield, weight and texture of the buns. Protein, fat, ash, energy, iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium and copper contents were also increased. Fortification of buns at 5% and 25% with SMP improved in vitro protein digestibility by 16% and 22%, respectively. Maximum bacterial count in buns was below the International Microbiological Standard recommended units for dry and ready to eat foods of 103 cfu/g. Conclusion: Buns composited with snail meat powder showed a considerable potential to be used as protein rich foods in preventing protein energy malnutrition among young children. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Buns; Digestibility; Nutrient imbalance; Protein energy malnutrition; Protein rich foods; Snail meat powder; Sor-ghum-wheat","agar; calcium; glucose; iron; magnesium; mineral; protein; zinc; Article; ash; bacterial flora; biochemical composition; controlled study; density; dietary fiber; digestion; food color; fungal flora; hardness; in vitro study; meat; moisture; physical chemistry; plate count; potato; powder; priority journal; shelf life; snail; sorghum; sorghum flour; wheat; wheat flour",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087864863

It is intended to develop, through different methods, green energy systems to power up electric vehicles. During the last years, several energy storage systems have been tested and implemented, but each solution has brought advantages and disadvantages regarding infrastructure, charging stations, speed of charging or autonomy. This paper proposes to study a power management strategy for a hybrid energy system which consists in a photovoltaic panel (PV), as main power source and super-capacitors and batteries. The last two energy storage devices, due to the various power densities, will provide the steady and transient power demand. For each power source of hybrid storage energy system, dynamic and mathematical models are described and a strategy of power sharing is presented. The experimental stand, represents the main contribution to this paper, and is made on small scale using low voltages and currents. The entire purpose of this paper was to build a system for energy management, controlled by a microcontroller ArduinoNano. The overall objective of present work is to analyze the distribution of energy between existing sources in the system according to their characteristics. During simulations, each energy storage device is predominant in either charging or discharging mode and different control strategies for sharing energy will be developed and studied. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

The aim of this study was to investigate its stability at 60 °C in the presence of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) extract rich in anthocyanins (7 206.6 mg·kg-1 dry weight) and characterized by high antioxidant and antiradical activities. Thermal degradation of the oil during storage was evaluated on the basis of the fatty acid profile using analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and kinetic studies based on peroxide value and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The evolution of the unsaturated fatty acids showed protective properties of the natural extract against lipid oxidation. Accumulation of peroxides in oil was reduced by 56 % in the presence of roselle extract compared to untreated oil, which was confirmed by kinetic analysis of the induction period. The thermal degradation kinetics using the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method indicated that 0.2% (w/w) addition of roselle extract to hempseed oil improved its stability due to higher activation energy compared to other samples. The antioxidant effect of Hibiscus extract was also validated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.

As the demand for green energy technologies—including solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and energy storage—continues to increase, so too does the demand for the minerals required to develop and deploy them. This growing demand should serve as an economic boon to those countries that are home to the principal reserves of strategic minerals for the transition, including cobalt, lithium and rare earths. However, in countries struggling with political instability, where governance for the mining sector is weak, the extraction of these minerals could be linked to violence, conflict and human rights abuses. This chapter, adapted from the report Green Conflict Minerals: The fuels of conflict in the transition to a low-carbon economy, explores the conflict and violence implications of the low-carbon transition for mineral-rich, fragile states. It builds on extensive desk-based research, stakeholder consultations, case studies and a mapping analysis. It seeks to understand the extent to which increased demand for the minerals critical to green energy technologies could affect fragility, conflict and violence in producing states, and explores what would be required of the international community to mitigate these local and national threats. © The Author(s) 2020.",,"Carbon; Environmental management; Mineral industry; Minerals; Rare earths; Conflict minerals; Energy transitions; Green energy technologies; International community; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon transitions; Political instability; Stakeholder consultation; Mineral exploration",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086766469

The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of four even-aged, fully stocked mature Norway spruce stands along a temperature, precipitation, and altitudinal gradient of the Czech Republic was investigated. A new straightforward, methodological approach involving an analysis of digital hemispherical photographs for RUE estimation was applied. The highest annual RUE value (0.72 g MJ−1) was observed in the stand characterised by the lowest mean annual air temperature, the highest annual amount of precipitation, located at the highest altitude, and with the lowest site index reflecting site fertility. From the viewpoint of global climate change mitigation, this stand fixed 4.14 Mg ha−1 and 13.93 Mg ha−1 of carbon units and CO2 molecules into above-ground biomass, respectively. The lowest RUE value (0.21 g MJ−1) within the studied growing season was found in the stand located at the lowest altitude representing the site with the highest mean air temperature and the lowest amount of precipitation where 1.27 Mg ha−1 and 4.28 Mg ha−1 of carbon units and CO2 molecules, respectively, were fixed.

HEPS is a 6 GeV kilometer-scale synchrotron light source promising ultralow emittance currently being constructed in Beijing. A proof-of-principle cavity has been previously in-house developed and vertical tested achieving excellent cryogenic performances. A helium jacket was subsequently designed adopting a simple structure and an integrated magnetic field shielding. The mechanical properties of the dressed cavity were largely improved focusing on pressure sensitivity, stress and Lorentz force detuning, while frequency tunability and microphonics were carefully monitored. Elastic buckling and fatigue were also examined. The helium jacket was later fabricated and welded directly with the niobium cavity. Mounted with an input power coupler and tuners, the dressed cavity was finally assembled in a modified cryomodule and tested at both 4.2 K and 2.0 K. The favored low pressure sensitivity and small Lorentz force detuning was confirmed. Microphonics spectrum was scanned and measured, presenting good consistencies with simulation predictions. Finally, the cavity was successfully tuned to the operating frequency of 166.6 MHz at cold and its frequency could be regulated within +/-3 Hz range. This paper covers the mechanical aspects in the development and horizontal cryogenic tests of the first dressed 166.6 MHz superconducting cavity.

As a consequence, our knowledge of the evaporation process is highly biased by agricultural settings, and results in erroneous estimates of evaporation for other land surfaces and especially for forest systems. The reason why crop and forest systems differ has to do with the vegetation height and what is happening in the space between the plant top and surface. Forests are multi-layered systems, where under the tallest tree species, lower vegetation layers are present. These lower vegetation layers transpire, but at a different rate then the main vegetation, since the atmospheric conditions are different under the canopy. Additionally, the sub-vegetation layers, and also the forest floor, intercept water. Next to different atmospheric conditions per layer, the interception process is highly complex due to differences in interception capacity and a time delay caused by the cascade of water when water flows from the top canopy down to the forest floor. Lastly, forests also have the capacity to store heat and vapor in the air column, biomass, and soil. While this energy storage can be up to 110 W/m 2 it is often neglected in evaporation models. To get a better understanding of what is happening inside a forest, for the purpose of evaporation modeling, we should make use of new sensing techniques that allow identifying the rainfall, energy, and evaporation partitioning. This will help to improve evaporation estimates for tall vegetation, like forest, and allow spatial up scaling. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Natural rubber compound is one kind of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) composed of natural rubber compound acted as a matrix phase and filler acted as a dispersed or reinforcement phase. There are many kinds of fillers used in the PMCs in terms of particles, fibers, and structural sheets. Adding organic/inorganic fibers into the natural rubber composites can increase the mechanical-thermal-physical properties and sound absorption. The natural rubber embedded fiber composite samples were prepared via the vulcanization process at the curing temperature 150°C by the two-roll mill. The amount of whisker alumina (Al2O3), coconut coir and water hyacinth fiber were varied from 0 to 50 phr on 100 phr of natural rubber in a sulfur curing system. The obtained rubber composite samples were of good mechanical properties, low thermal conductivity and good acoustic-sound absorption, suitable for various applications such as automobile, insulation and storage tank. The obtained rubber composite with 10 phr whisker alumina added (NR-Al-10) possessed the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, elongation at break and thermal conductivity values equal to 14.38 ± 1.95 MPa, 545.63 ± 25.67 MPa, 1038.4 ± 41.45% and 0.02527 ± 0.0003 W/m.K, respectively. Furthermore, the sound absorption value of natural rubber composite added 10 phr whisker alumina (NR-Al-10) is equal to 45.09% in the range of 3000-4000 Hz of acoustic sound level better than the pure natural compound without adding filler. © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Acoustic sound absorption; Natural rubber; Thermal property; Whisker alumina fiber","Acoustic wave absorption; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Curing; Fibers; Filled polymers; Fillers; Polymer matrix composites; Rubber applications; Rubber industry; Sound insulating materials; Sound insulation; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Energy absorption ability; Insulation applications; Low thermal conductivity; Natural rubber composites; Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs); Thermal-physical property; Vulcanization process; Water hyacinth fibers; Rubber products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085196128

In this study, the effect of different design parameters such as the solar collector area and the storage tank capacity for the solar absorption cooling system of 30 kW were investigated. Also, the effect of the hot water temperature entering the absorption chiller on the ratio of the cooling energy gained to the nominal cooling capacity was studied. The TRNSYS simulation program was implemented to simulate the thermal performance of the solar absorption cooling systems in the summer period in Cairo, Egypt. The theoretical results of the simulation proved that increasing the solar collector surface area from 20 to 200 m2 increased the operating period of the absorption chiller from 2.9 to 11.5 h in June. While increasing the storage tank capacity from 2 to 4 m3 reduced the outlet hot water temperature from the storage tank. This reduction varies throughout the day time. Increasing the inlet water temperature to the absorption chiller from 90 to 125 C raises the ratio of cooling gained to the chiller nominal capacity from 74 to 87 % at a chilled water setpoint temperature of 3 C and from 90 to 99 % at setpoint temperature of 12 °C. This improvement depends on the setting temperature of the outlet chilled water. © 2020, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Adsorption chiller; Simulation; Solar collector; Storage tank; TRNSYS",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085167750

Despite that DSMS demonstrate to reduce operational costs of power systems and microgrids, there is a paucity of literature exploring how DSMS can affect the planning of SAMG. In this regard, this paper presents the design of a DSMS using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for the planning of SAMG. To evaluate the performance of the DSMS in the planning of the SAMG, the proposed methodology uses a ILP formulation for the optimal dispatch of the energy sources and the DSMS. The ILP formulation runs inside of a heuristic approximation of the gradient descent method that computes the size of the energy sources of the SAMG. Simulation results show reductions in the size of the energy sources and the Levelized Cost of Energy when the planning of the SAMG uses the designed DSMS. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the reductions in the size of the energy sources and the LCOE are consistent under variations in the Diesel price, Global Horizontal Irradiation and Battery Energy Storage System costs. © 2020, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Day ahead tariffs; Demand forecasting; Demand-side management; Generation forecasting; Stand-alone microgrids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085160152

Based on academic research and on successful case studies, the opportunity for residential prosumers to organize in microgrids emerges as a viable and promising solution. This paper focuses on microgrids that are planned to generate electricity with a PV unit and use a shared storage system, and that opt to have a connection with the main grid. However, the point of common coupling needs to be agreed first between the microgrid operator and the network operator, and this agreement is determined by several factors and conditions beyond the basic technical and regulatory requirements. A survey of academic literature on the determinant factors for such an agreement exposes the fact that current research either focuses on the integration of individual prosumers in the main grid, or regards the point of common coupling as a given component of microgrids. We argue that neither of the two approaches is helpful in the case of microgrids vs. main grid, seeing as the agreement is not self-evident under just any circumstances, nor can the microgrid be equated to a single, large prosumer. Therefore this short paper compiles a set of determinant factors for the microgrid integration, as they emerge from academic literature, with the aim to document further research needs and support the discussion on microgrid integration. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Decentralization; Microgrids; Point of common coupling; Residential prosumers","Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Housing; Integration; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Academic literature; Decentralized electricity; Determinant factors; Generate electricity; Point of common coupling; Regulatory requirements; Renewable energy generation; Residential areas; Microgrids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084702310

The 4IR extends the paradigm of the industrial revolution to a future in which the most familiar exponential technology is the significant increase in the power of the computer and the decrease in the cost of storage. When these exponential digital technologies are combined with other technologies that expand in a similar way (biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence), a convergence called “singularity” is created. The 4IR can also allow technological solutions to the environmental threats that arise from the accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the massive factories that arise from our first two industrial revolutions. In this article, we report on the results of the application of a challenge based learning teaching technique with students of the Sustainable Development Engineering Program of the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico. The challenge consisted on the application of engineering solutions to the energetic improvement of a rural artisan production factory of Mezcal, a very popular beverage in Mexico. In the first instance, the areas of energy opportunity were evaluated. The students determined that the production of mezcal decreases drastically after a few weeks of operation because the water used in the cooling process, which is in a closed circuit, reaches temperatures above 60 °C in the tank where it condenses the mezcal The cooling system was modified to increase the mixing and increase the heat transfer coefficient. Additionally a home cooling tower was built in atmospheric natural circulation to control the temperature of the cooling water that is stored in the cistern. With these modifications it was possible to maintain the temperature of the cooling water at 22 °C, which increased the production of mezcal, favoring the economic sustainability of the producer, and decreased the amount of firewood used in the kiln, which helps reduce the impact in environmental pollution. The students evaluated the challenge in a positive way, highlighting the importance of having a real and practical challenge. Competencies were evaluated with precise instruments. Our results confirmed that the use of CBL is a novel scheme to acquire competences and cover contents within the programmatic sequences of engineering education. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","4IR; CBL; Educational innovation; Higher education; Sustainability; Tec21 model","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric temperature; Biotechnology; Cooling; Cooling water; Education computing; Greenhouse gases; Industry 4.0; Students; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Challenge-based learning; Digital technologies; Economic sustainability; Engineering solutions; Environmental pollutions; Environmental threats; Industrial revolutions; Technological solution; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084174553

Hence, this research proposes a planning framework to optimize the power and technology of the DER that the objective function is minimizing the life cycle cost of islanded micro-grids during the planning period. The DER that utilizes renewable energy has many advantages and is often considered to invest in micro-grids. However, the output power of them often changes and depends on the primary energy, such as wind and solar irradiance. Hence, the power and capacity of the battery energy storage system (BESS) are simultaneously considered in planning problems to improve the reliability and effectiveness of the islanded micro-grids. Additionally, the natural intermittent generation power of the renewable energy sources and uncertainty of the demand loads are modeled by probability density functions then they are integrated into the planning model. The binary variables are also integrated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to select the modular type corresponding to the rated power of the DER with the objective function, which is the life cycle cost of the project. Similarly, the rated power and capacity of the BESS are also discrete values thus the binary variables are utilized to select the sizes and charge or discharge modes of the BESS. The constraints on the energy balance, limit power and capacity of equipment are taken into account in this model.

The vegetables studied were: (Jute Mallow), (Slender Leaf), (Cowpea), (Nightshade), and (Amaranthus). Drying experiment was done at 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C in a convective laboratory dryer and drying was pattern fitted to existing models, moisture diffusivity, and activation energy trends were determined, shrinkage was determined from change in leaf thickness, and vitamins A, C, and E were analyzed using spectroscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatography as freshly harvested and after drying at 40°C and storage for 60 days. Results showed that drying occurred in the falling rate period and Page model could simulate the drying pattern of the vegetables with a 97% correlation between the empirical and predicted values with the model prediction being precise above 0.5 moisture content on wet basis (w.b.). Shrinkage was found to be a function of moisture loss at a range of 89% to 98% linear correlation. The rate of moisture loss and activation energy correlated with air temperature. The trend in the drying characteristics and moisture transport of the vegetables was unique with each vegetable. Drying at 40°C and storage for 60 days realized a retention in the scale range of 50% to 75% for vitamins A, C, and E. The study showed that drying is an effective way to preserve the vegetables.

This study aims to identify the production rate, inventory and supply flow of biomass by integrating Pinch Analysis and mathematical model. Storage to overcome the deficits of biomass supply at the following time interval is also identified. The demonstrated case study suggested a fix production rate of 22,000 GJ/month and adapted to 6,167 GJ/month after the pinch point to meet the fluctuating demand. The required inventory is also suggested. For example, 3,167 GJ of product (bio-oil) inventory on Month 4 to meet the following demand, and with 3,764.1 GJ (301 t) of biomass as storage to overcome the supply deficit (fluctuated) in the following month. The mathematical approach optimises the biomass network flow (allocation) at each time intervals (Month).

The purpose of this paper is to analyze CO2 mitigation options from the power sector under the cleaner supply-side options beyond the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of Cambodia. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze the share of electricity generation and CO2 emissions during 2015 to 2050 under four main scenarios, namely Business-as-Usual (BAU), Renewable Energy (RE), Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and Carbon Tax (CT). Results illustrate that in the BAU scenario, electricity generation and CO2 emissions from the power sector would be increased by almost 16 and 42 times respectively in 2050 when compared to 2015. Results also show with CO2 emission reduction potential of about 32.94% in 2050. The imposition of carbon tax amounting to USD500/tCO2 has the highest CO2 emission reduction potential in the power sector when compared with other scenarios. Results depict that except the RE scenarios considering lower shares of solar and biomass, all scenarios would help in attainting the 27% CO2 emission reduction target of Cambodia's INDC by 2030. © 2020 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

The best survival rates are observed for large seeds (germination rate-77.5%, energy of germination-55.0%). Assessment of seed survival in the storage rate showed a linear decrease in germination rate and energy of germination during storage. After 1.5 years of storage, germination decreased to 30.0%.As part of the research, the container was optimized for cryopreservation of Calendula officinalis seeds, defrosting conditions, seed humidity and the use of different cryoprotectors. The results showed that the optimal container for freezing in liquid nitrogen was plastic cryotubes; defrosting should be carried out at room temperature; the best survival rates were found at seed humidity 5-6%; the use of cryoprotectors was not feasible.

Such blessings must always be maintained, managed, and developed for a greater good. The environment has a carrying capacity for life, all living things will be perished if the environment is degraded. As the science, technology, and industry increasingly develop, it has also an impact on the environmental degradation. The environmental degradation in Indonesia as the result of human almost reach its highest point. Deforestation, peatland degradation, and forest fires have placed Indonesia as one of the world's greatest greenhouse gas emitters at number three. This research aims to (1) analyze the application of green constitution concept in Indonesia and (2) study the application of technology in controlling its carbon dioxide emissions to achieve green Indonesia 2030. This research uses normative legal research methods with statute approach. This research uses secondary data as the main data source obtained from library research. It uses documentation method to collect the data to obtain valid information. The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia accommodates the concept of sustainable development and provisions on human rights for a good and healthy environment, as stated in Article 28H paragraph (1) juncto Article 34 paragraph (4) of 1945 Constitution. The results of the study indicate that the 1945 Constitution and different laws and regulations below it have not been able to address the environmental issues in Indonesia. Indonesian constitution has a glimpse of “green” nuance. However, the 1945 Constitution only regulates the environment implicitly and has not specifically adopted the environmental sovereignty in some of its provisions. Environmental sovereignty in the 1945 Constitution has not been included in dedicated articles, but inherent on fundamental rights, i.e. human rights to the environment, while the laws under the 1945 Constitution do not reflect the alignment and harmonization of rights assurance for the sustainable development and pro-environment concept. Indonesia is committed to independently reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29% and by 41% with international cooperation under the business as usual projection towards a green Indonesia 2030. The results show that the application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can maintain the stability of CO2 to not exceed the concentration of 450 ppm in the atmosphere, it also created a negative impact in the environment. A leakage in CO2 storage will cause carbon dioxide to seep through the caprocks pores in the form of flakes through the openings in faults, fractures, or traces of gas or oil drilling. The water around the CCS planting area will become acidic and even an explosion. Moreover, CCS technology is costly and requires large amounts of energy during the separation of CO2 from all the gas released from the burning of fossil fuels and O2 purification in gases to produce a clean combustion. © 2020 SERSC.","CCS technology; Environment; Green constitution; Green Indonesia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082000780

Renewable sources are free, clean and virtually limitless and for those reasons they present a great potential. This chapter addresses two concerns related to photovoltaic (PV) production with energy storage system integrating multi-cell Lithium-ion batteries. To increase the efficiency of a PV production, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method is proposed based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed PSO-based MPPT is able to avoid the oscillations around the maximum power point (MPP) and the convergence to a local maximum under partial shading conditions. Also, it exhibits an excellent tracking under rapid variation in the environment conditions (irradiance and temperature). Additionally, a new charging method was developed based on the parameters of the battery pack in real time, extending the battery lifespan, improving the capacity usage and the performance of the Energy Storage System (ESS). The proposed Lithium Ion (Li-ion) battery charging method analyses at each moment the difference between the desired voltage and the mean voltage of the cells, the temperature of the pack and the difference of voltages between cells. Based on the obtained information, the algorithm calculates the charging current through trilinear interpolation. It should also be noted that the proposed charging method combines a balancing method and a state of charge determination method based on the Coulomb counting method, which represents an innovation when compared to the existing methods in the literature. The experimental results of both methods demonstrate excellent performance allowing to, on the one hand, achieve an optimized PV production, and on the other hand, make the ESS more effective and efficient. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Battery cell balancing; Battery cell charging; Energy storage systems; Partial shading conditions; Particle swarm optimization; Photovoltaic MPPT",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081631326

As described by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), these sources are classified as Categories 1 and 2, which pose high risks to human health if they are not managed properly. The radioactive waste management facility (RWMF) does not have the capability of handling SHARS; thus, the RWMF of the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) initiated the safe and secure management of these sources with the assistance of the IAEA through the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa (NECSA). The RWMF performed site preparation for the construction of the mobile hot cell (MHC). The management process involves dismantling the equipment, recovering and encapsulating the source, and placing it inside the long-term storage shields (LTSSs), which are performed inside the MHC. In total, 16 sources were successfully retrieved with a total activity of 204 TBq. The dose rate of both LTSS-1 and LTSS-2 at the surface of the shield was 103 μSv/h and 102 μSv/h, respectively – both of which are below the regulatory limit of 2 mSv/h for the safe transportation of radioactive package. The utilization of the MHC in managing SHARS has made it possible the safe and secure retrieval of SHARSs, given the lack of capability of the Philippines in handling this type of wastes. © 2020, Department of Science and Technology.

The load-following (LFW) strategy for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is proposed to sustain the power flow balance on the DC bus of a hybrid power system (HPS) with the battery operating in charge-sustaining mode. This battery operating mode has many advantages (like small size), especially for FC vehicles where space is vital. In addition, the state of charge (SoC) for battery is almost constant, so there is no need for SoC monitoring as in rule-based strategies. The power-following (PFW) strategy for stand-alone FC/renewable HPSs is the variant of the LFW control using as input the difference between the load and available renewable energy instead of the load. The excess of energy during light load stage can supply an electrolyzer or can be sold if FC HPS is connected to the network. Optimization of the FC HPS operation may be performed using well-known optimization algorithms such as the global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) algorithms, global maximum efficiency point tracking (GMEPT) algorithms, or fuel economy algorithms. An advanced fuel economy strategy using fueling regulators switching is presented and analyzed in this chapter as fuel economy under constant and variable load. A pulse mitigation strategy using an anti-pulse control for the hybrid storage system (HSS) based on battery and ultracapacitors is also proposed and analyzed in this chapter. The design and performance evaluation are presented for both strategies. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-pulse control; Fuel economy strategy; Hybrid power system (HPS); Hybrid storage system (HSS); Load-following (LFW) control; Power-following (PFW) control; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Global optimization; Maximum power point trackers; Secondary batteries; Energy management strategies; Global maximum power point tracking; Hybrid power systems (HPS); Hybrid storage systems; Load following; Mitigation strategy; Optimization algorithms; Pulse control; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079787163

Every message sent can incur a cost in storage, computation, energy, and bandwidth. Consequently, reducing the communication costs of distributed applications is highly desirable. The best way to reduce message costs is by communicating without sending any messages whatsoever. This article initiates a rigorous investigation into the use of silence in synchronous settings, in which processes can fail. We formalize sufficient conditions for information transfer using silence, as well as necessary conditions for particular cases of interest. This allows us to identify message patterns that enable communication through silence. In particular, a pattern called a silent choir is identified, and shown to be central to information transfer via silence in failure-prone systems. The power of the new framework is demonstrated on the atomic commitment problem (AC). A complete characterization of the tradeoff between message complexity and round complexity in the synchronous model with crash failures is provided, in terms of lower bounds and matching protocols. In particular, a new message-optimal AC protocol is designed using silence, in which processes decide in three rounds in the common case. This significantly improves on the best previously known message-optimal AC protocol, in which decisions were performed in Θ(n) rounds. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A computational investigation to examine the thermal behavior of constrained phase change of paraffin wax inside an elliptical cell under the influence of different wall heat fluxes is presented. The impact of two orientations of the capsule (prolate and oblate) on the transient movement of the melting-front and liquid fraction is examined. The results exhibit that the imposed wall heat flux has an important influence on the melting characteristics, whereas a small effect on the melting process is exhibited by the orientation of the capsule. Nevertheless, the melting process is relatively faster and lower time is required in an oblate capsule than that experienced in the prolate capsule. The reduction in fusion time resulted from container orientation increases with the increase in supplied heat flux. The maximum reduction in the melting time of the oblate capsule is about 7.71% less than that of the prolate capsule for the same size. Besides, it is found that the time needed for complete melting in an elliptical cell is lower than that observed in spherical one for the same size, surface area and amount of heat flux. © 2020, Shiraz University.","Constrained melting; Elliptical capsule; Heat flux; Latent heat storage; Natural convection; PCM",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079154310

Reducing the likelihood of system disturbances or, in the extreme, load (demand) shedding is a fundamental objective of Transmission System Operators during planning and operation of electricity grids. The integration of new forms of generation - diverse in location and operation profile – as well as rapidly changing demand from new consumer technologies powered by breakthroughs in technology, poses a different set of challenges in their daily business. System flexibility, like many other aspects of the bulk electric system, can be examined as a supply and demand problem. A holistic assessment of flexibility examines the resources available to supply flexibility and the factors driving the demand or requirements for flexibility. This paper aims to highlight the importance of flexibility assessment studies alongside capacity adequacy studies being carried out during system planning. Moreover, the paper will present the challenges facing the electricity networks for integrating high amount of renewable energy which are well expressed by the views of the energy stakeholders regarding priorities for innovation technologies and this is also very well reflected in the research and development projects. The FLEXITRANSTORE project, which is aiming to implement innovative technologies of battery storage solutions, smart grid technologies and market platforms in the SEE region, is briefly presented. Furthermore, a wide review of flexibility-related research and innovation projects in Europe and United States has been carried out during the project and their contribution is presented, analysed and mapped against specific power system challenges. A detailed survey conducted during FLEXITRANSTORE on identifying stakeholders’ opinion on electricity networks’ challenges is presented and commented. Stakeholders’ are stressing that highest priorities for the electricity networks in their country are renewable energy integration, cross border interconnections, grid stability in short- and long-term horizon. These renewables integration and cross border interconnections answers could be also linked with the European targets: To sum up, the paper is identifying significant opportunities for future research and innovation in storage and market models, regarding the inherent flexibility of the electricity networks to host the electrification ‘wave’ of the following decades. © 2020, The Author(s).","Flexibility; FLEXITRANSTORE project; Power systems; Transmission systems operators","Commerce; Electric load shedding; Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Integration; Standby power systems; Flexibility; FLEXITRANSTORE project; Renewable energy integrations; Renewables integrations; Research and development projects; Smart Grid technologies; Transmission system operators; Transmission systems; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079105766

The model allows us to identify the state of the user (consumer or prosumer) according to various defined states (creation, transmission, storage or energy consumption) in order to ensure a balanced power flow. The change of states is regulated by several input parametrs and dynamics attributes such as demand, occupancy, temperature, irradiation, voltage, current and SOS of the battery. The neighborhood considered is the generalized Moore neighborhood with a dynamic radius, of which the links between nodes can change dynamically during the simulation. This radius change is governed by an algorithm for exploring the nearest user.

In terms of the IEA report, the largest sources of emission in 2016, which approaches to 42% of global total, is generated by power sector and heat sector. This indicates that reducing the emission in the power sector can play a crucial role to limit global warming. Large shares of low-carbon generators such as renewables, power plants with carbon capture and storage and implementing a sustainable environmental tax or carbon price are the possible approaches to reduce the emissions from the power sector. The paper investigates how carbon prices affect the Northern European power system. The power system model is net transfer capacity-based model which aims to minimize economic performance, such as operational cost and environmental cost, with the common power system constraints and large expansions of sustainable energy development, i.e., solar and wind energy. The carbon prices are based on scenarios of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which aims to limit global warming to below 2 °C with a probability greater than 66%. Four scenarios are conducted based on SSPs carbon prices. Results show that the carbon prices have a great impact on the economic performance of the power system, i.e., the higher carbon price, the higher power prices. Increasing carbon prices result in decreasing of coal production including hard coal and lignite coal production but increasing the gas production. This is due to different fuel carbon prices. Furthermore, renewable energy such as wind production continues to increase. This implies a positive relationship between renewable energy and carbon prices, such as the higher the carbon prices, the higher renewable energy production. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","Carbon price; Power market model; Sustainable energy development","Carbon capture; Coal; Commerce; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Power markets; Sustainable development; Wind power; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon price; Economic performance; Power market modeling; Power system constraints; Renewable energy using; Solar and wind energies; Sustainable energy development; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078426241

However, these devices have much more limited capabilities both computation and memory-wise compared to traditional computers, which in turn limits the options available to use them for classification problems. One of the available options is using Lookup Table-based classifiers that require minimal computation, although in return they require more memory space. Sequential Fuzzy Indexing Tables are improved versions of Lookup Tables that require less memory, but for large problem spaces their storage cost is still very high. This is due to the size of its structure, which can be reduced with suitable domain conversion techniques. In this paper, multiple options are investigated, analyzed and compared in order to solve this problem. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data hashing; Domain reduction; Machine learning; Text processing",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078087521

Several studies have been reported on atmospheric corrosion of electronic devices with focus on functionality, storage capacity, and their miniaturization. However, there is a lack of studies focused on identifying the components most susceptible to atmospheric corrosion, the corrosion products generated in them, and the possible variables that have a greater impact on deterioration. The present study is focused on linking the deterioration of electronic boards with temperature and humidity cycles. This was accomplished through accelerated tests inside an atmospheric chamber, where the concentrations of pollutant gases (NO2 and SO2) are kept constant. Each trapezoidal cycle within the accelerated tests equals one day of field exposure. The results show that the NO2 and SO2 gasses reduced the life of the electronic components by 49.8%. The SO2 gas was found to be the contaminant gas that most influenced the deterioration of electronic devices. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) show the formation of CuSO4. The development of protective coating against these pollutant gasses could improve the operation of electronic components. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","accelerated tests; atmospheric corrosion; Electronic components; gases pollutants","Atmospheric humidity; Copper compounds; Deterioration; Electronic equipment; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Network components; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Protective coatings; Thermoelectric equipment; Accelerated tests; Atmospheric chambers; Corrosion products; Electronic boards; Electronic component; Electronic device; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Temperature and humidities; Atmospheric corrosion",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077717478

Due to climate change, renewable energy sources are considered as stochastic and intermittent sources. The fluctuation in frequency and power requires the integration of an adequate control system to reduce the effect of the disturbances on the stability of the electric microgrid. This control is ensured by the integration of PID whose parameters are optimized using an objective function resolved by the application of genetic algorithms.

This system is destined to supply a residential agricultural zone at the southern of Algeria based on the integrated PV renewable energy resource, the energy storage system ESS, and the backup unit that consists of diesel generator DG. In this regard, the proposed topology is a grid-off DC-coupled system, which regroups four farms linked via power lines and power converters to ensure the bidirectional sharing of energy following a specified load schedule and an energy management policy EMP. The EMP center combines both decentralized controllers such as MPPT, and DC-DC converters closed loops that regulate voltages of the nodal DC buses and states of the energy of the storage devices. In the other hand, a centralized control strategy aims to manage the external shared energy of the DC-MG, considering nodal voltages, states of energy, and the load demand in each farm. Hence, the output signal commands are the PWM to the switching devices of the power converters, references currents, and voltages to the closed control loops, and references power values of the distributed energy resources DERs.

Thus, an energy management centre EMC controls the functioning of the whole system and managing the shared energy inside the Microgrid. The Microgrid is run in ETAP software, where static and dynamic regimes are studied. From power flow analyses, we can observe that the DC network operates efficiently under stable nodal buses that reflect the availability of the power supply. Hence, the design concept is verified through test scenarios to demonstrate the capability of the proposed microgrid. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","DC microgrid; Energy management system EMS; Power flow analyses; Renewable energies REs; Standalone system",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077442766

Pomegranate fruit were stored at 5ºC and 85% relative humidity for 90 d. Impact tests were performed by dropping fruit from three drop heights (20, 40, and 60 cm) onto a flat hard surface to obtain different impact energy levels. The energy absorbed at impact, bruise volume (BV, mm3), bruise area (BA, mm2) and bruise susceptibility (BS, mm3/mJ) of pomegranate fruit were determined at 30 d interval for each impact dropped fruit. Textural properties for whole bruised and control (non-bruised) cold-stored fruit were carried out at 14 d intervals to determine the mechanical strength based on compression, cutting and puncture resistance tests. Based on impact tests, the increase in BV and BA of pomegranate fruit with increased drop heights and duration of cold storage were found significant (p <.05) during the first 2 months of storage and then decreased in the last month of storage time. Pearson correlations indicated a strong linear relationship between the increase in both BV and BA with an increase in impact energy throughout the 90 d storage period. Fruit puncture resistance and whole fruit cutting force, cutting energy and power as well as fruit compression strength properties; firmness, and related textural properties increased with higher impact bruising and prolonged storage. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that long-term storage, indeed, influenced the susceptibility of pomegranate fruit to bruise, and altered fruit texture. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Bruise volume; Postharvest losses; Textural properties","compression; food storage; fruit; long-term change; relative humidity; Lythraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077388415

The problem of EEDP aims at finding the optimal scheduling of renewable energy resources (RERs) in isolated and grid-connected MGs. The EEDP is formulated as a non-linear constrained multi-objective optimisation problem. It minimises the total cost and emission simultaneously. Simulation results in nine different cases are conducted to emulate the complexity of the EEDP. Also, the proposed scheduling procedure is tested under abnormal operation of MGs considering unexpected increase in power demand, shortage of battery storage and partial shedding of photovoltaic units. These cases reveal the capability of the proposed method. A multi-objective function is employed to increase the economic benefits and minimise emission issues. In this line, the simulation results are obtained using an enhanced moth-flame optimisation (EMFO) algorithm. The obtained results verified the effectiveness, robustness and global convergence for minimising emission and generation costs. These results are compared with several well-known techniques in the literature. Notable economic and environmental benefits are achieved using the EMFO that lead to flexible scheduling of RERs for MG operation under uncertainty. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019",,"Constrained optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Abnormal operation; Economic and environmental benefits; Economic benefits; Emission dispatch problem; Flexible scheduling; Global conver-gence; Multi-objective functions; Optimal scheduling; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077239466

Wind and photovoltaic sources are one of the cleaner forms of energy conversion available. One of the advantages offered by the hybridization of different sources is to provide sustainable electricity in areas not served by the conventional power grid. They are used in many applications, but due to their nonlinearity, hybrid energy systems are proposed to overcome this problem with important improvements. The most used systems in the scientific literature are presented and then studied under MATLAB/Simulink.

The configuration of a hybrid system essentially depends on the choice of static converters, which in general, depends on the nature of the source and of the load. Indeed, for a DC bus architecture, all generators must be connected in series with the inverter in order to supply alternative loads. On the other hand, in the case of an AC bus configuration, each converter will be associated with its generator in such a way as to supply the load independently and simultaneously with the other converters. In the mixed DC/AC configuration, the converters located between two can be replaced by a bidirectional converter.

The effectiveness indicator is characterized by a unit (unit parameter) or several effectiveness properties (complex parameter), such as: reliability (the ability of system to maintain continuous working ability within the limits of allowed deviations during the calendar period of time, quantified through indicators: probability of operation without cancellation, medium time in work, intensity of cancellation and cancellation rate), maintenance convenience (ability to prevent and detect cancellation and damage, to restore working ability and correctness through technical service and technical repairs, quantified through: probability of renewal for the given calendar period of time, medium recovery time and the intensity of renewal), durability (the system’s ability to maintain its working ability from the very beginning of its application or exploitation until the transition to limit states in which certain stop is possible in the realization of certain activities for technical service maintenance and repairs, defined through indicators: medium resource, gamma-percentage resource, medium expiration date, gamma-percentage life), stability (the system’s ability to continuously maintain hot reserves, storage and/or transport). Optimal management of complex technical systems must be based on the assessment and complex optimization of the reliability indicators, depending on how they are provided and the hierarchical level of detailing, as well as the current phase of the life cycle. For these reasons, the optimization process includes the basic structural, parametric and constructive solutions related to the technical system itself through the change of its most important characteristics: efficiency (mostly energy), maneuverability, reliability and economic effectiveness in general. The set of goals of optimization is concluded in the overall choice of reliability indicators and possible ways to secure them, and given the already established rules regarding the higher hierarchical level of the system. Creating effectiveness is closely related to the concrete energy system, its behavior at a certain time and the environment in which it works (the power system as a higher hierarchical system). For this realization, it is necessary to provide the appropriate backgrounds, first of all the database, then to define based on the function of the goal and the available database of the interconnection and the relationship between the individual elements of the system. Within this chapter, appropriate methods will be provided for prognosis and optimizing the effectiveness based on the quality of design, production and testing, assembly and trial release, exploitation, development of procedures for prognosis of the complex systems behavior based on the characteristics of certain constituent elements of the system and the possible impact of human factors and environment itself on the system. Starting from the initial stage of development, design and conquering the production of certain types of thermal energy equipment in the goal of fulfilling all requirements without limitations, if it is based on its purpose, a multivariate assembly is set up before the designer, with the need to optimize according to certain already adopted algorithms. The goal is to create such a facility that has a satisfactory structure in terms of reliability indicators, with minimal costs of maintenance during the projected working life. Defining the plant that best meets the set requirements related to reliability and the process of exploitation and maintenance itself must be the result of the implemented optimization process (in this case, on the basis of the selected minimum investment criterion). The sum consumption of all devices that ensure the normal operation of the thermal power plant is called own consumption. General consumption consists of all other devices that do not have a direct impact on the technological process at the plant. Preserving the continuity in supplying of own power consumption is essential for safe operation under normal operating conditions, in the case of short-term transitions, as well as in starting and normal stopping, it is particularly important in case of stopping in case of disorder or failure of the system. With the growing unit block strength, there is also the growth of unit power of electric motors with their own consumption, and therefore requirements related to the power supply. The basic problem is to achieve safe power supply in a variety of drive operation situations, with fewer short-circuit currents and the voltage drop when starting large synchronous motors. The solution is achieved by the proper choice of the transformer of own consumption and voltage level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Effectiveness; Effectiveness indicators; Energy system; Estimates prognosis; Life cycle; Optimal management; Optimization methods","Electric power systems; Hierarchical systems; Hot working; Life cycle; Probability; Reliability; Repair; Storage as a service (STaaS); Thermoelectric power plants; Effectiveness; Effectiveness indicators; Energy systems; Estimates prognosis; Optimal management; Optimization method; Investments",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076748521

The effect of pressure on degradation kinetics of a polyphenol, Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), was explored at pressures up to 200 MPa (HS levels) for several hours, with and without fructose. In a baroresistant buffer, pressure enhanced EGCG degradation, due to a negative activation volume, while in phosphate buffer the pH decreased (as is also expected to occur in many foods) resulting in a superposition of accelerating and protective effects. A previously undescribed protective, pressure-level dependent, effect of fructose was identified. Novel in situ spectroscopy and HPLC analysis revealed that in addition to the effect on EGCG degradation rate, pressure also modifies the ratios between the numerous degradation products, likely due to a varying effect on the different steps involved in the degradation pathway. Industrial relevance: The effect of pressure on reaction kinetics in food systems can be of great importance in processing conditions combining thermal and high pressure, and critical for the emerging concept of hyperbaric storage, where the food is exposed to high pressures for long duration of time, allowing a plethora of reactions to take place, all varyingly affected by pressure. Yet the effects of pressure on kinetics are often overlooked. Polyphenolic compounds are a large group of molecules responsible for both sensorial and health-promoting functionality in plant-based foods. Those compounds are known to undergo degradation by several mechanisms during processing and storage and their successful conservation is often considered of significant industrial importance. The presented work provides fundamental information regarding the effects of pressure on the kinetics of EGCG (Epigallocatechin-gallate) degradation, as a model for relatively unstable, polyphenolic compound, (taking into account pressure-induced pH shifts, and the presence of co-solutes). EGCG is also of specific importance in many products where it naturally occurs (green tea drinks etc.) and where it is externally added as a valuable supplement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation kinetics; EGCG; High-pressure; Hyperbaric storage; Polyphenols","Association reactions; Beverages; Degradation; Fructose; High pressure effects; Kinetics; pH effects; Polyphenolic compounds; Reaction kinetics; Thermal processing (foods); Degradation kinetics; Degradation products; EGCG; Epigallocatechin gallate; High pressure; In-situ spectroscopy; Polyphenols; Processing condition; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076273919

The advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system is designed to enhance the system flexibility. Simulations of the proposed power system are performed to demonstrate the amount of power that can supply to the loads during normal and peak modes of operation under steady-state conditions. The pressure ratios of the GT and AA-CAES and the additional air feed are used to design the system and analyze the system performance. The results show that a small additional air feed to the GT is certainly required for the hybrid system. The GT pressure ratio of 2 provides a maximum benefit. The AA-CAES pressure ratio of 5 is recommended to spare some air in the storage and minimize storage volume.

In particular, the addition of nanofillers in a polymer matrix can significantly improve the thermal, mechanical, electrical, optical, and biological or corrosion protection properties of a nanocomposite, provided that the fillers exist as discrete entities and strongly adhere to the matrix. Nanocomposite synthesis generates major technological challenges, due to the natural tendency of nanomaterials to agglomerate and to their poor compatibility with polymeric materials. The main approach to tackle these issues consists in modifying the fillers surface to enhance their affinity with the matrix and produce repulsive interactions between the particles.

Two complementary optimization frameworks are used to represent power systems with a varying degree of complexity. The corresponding models approximate the wholesale electricity market, combined with the rational retirement of dispatchable capacity. Two different generic storage technologies are introduced exogenously to assess their impact on the system. The analysis covers two countries: France, where the power supply's large nuclear share allows for the discussion of storage impact on a single generator type; and Germany, whose diverse power supply structure enables storage interactions with multiple electricity generators. In the most general case, additional storage capacity increases dispatchable power production (e.g. nuclear, coal) for small wind and solar shares, i.e. it compensates the replacement induced by renewable energies. For larger variable renewable electricity volumes, it actively contributes to dispatchable power replacement. In a diverse power system, this results in storage-induced sequential mutual replacements of power generation from different plant types, as wind and solar capacities are increased. This mechanism is strongly dependent on the technical parameters of the storage assets. As a result, the impact of different storage types can have opposite signs under certain circumstances. The influence of CO2 emission prices, wind and solar profile shapes, and power plant ramping costs is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","De-carbonization of power supply; Emissions from electricity production; Expansion of wind and solar power; Impact of bulk storage on electricity systems","Carbonization; Coal storage; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric generators; Electric load dispatching; Electric power plants; Solar energy; Electricity generators; Electricity production; Electricity system; Optimization framework; Power supply; Renewable electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Wind and solar power; Electric power generation; alternative energy; complementarity; complexity; electricity supply; energy market; optimization; power plant; solar power; wind power; France; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075582287

The sensor nodes in the network are resource constrained in terms of energy, storage and computational power. Node failure is a common phenomenon, which occurs due to environmental factors, adversary attacks, draining of battery power, etc. After node failure, recovery is challenging that needs a strong mechanism. In this paper, Blockchain-based Node Recovery (BNR) scheme for WSNs is proposed. In BNR scheme, recovery of failed nodes is on the basis of node degree. The working mechanism of the scheme is that firstly, the failed nodes are detected using the state (active or inactive) of Cluster Heads (CHs). In the second phase, the recovery process is initiated for inactive nodes. The main purpose of this step is to recover the failed CH, which ultimately results in restoring the active states of its member nodes. NodeRecovery Smart Contract (SC) is written for the purpose. The cost analysis for NodeRecovery is also performed in the proposed work. Moreover, the security analysis is performed to ensure the security of the proposed scheme. Effectiveness of the proposed model is shown by the simulation results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Blockchain; Node failure; Node recovery; Wireless Sensor Networks",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074695522

In this study, the energy and environmental performances of both subcritical (SubC) and supercritical (SC) pulverized coal-fired power plants with biomass co-firing and integrated with an advanced amine-based postcombustion CO2 capture system were evaluated and compared. The impact of biomass (hybrid poplar) addition was investigated at different co-firing ratios varying up to 30% on a heat input basis. All plant configurations were modeled and simulated with Aspen Plus process simulation software. The results show that the use of a SC steam cycle has a positive impact on the energy and environmental performance of the investigated plants, improving the efficiency by 2.4% points and reducing the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 6% in comparison to those of the SubC cases. Biomass co-firing has a negative impact on the energy performance of plants while significantly reducing fossil-based carbon emissions. The reduction of net CO2 emissions is almost proportional to the biomass percentage in the feed. At 30% biomass co-firing, the net plant efficiency is reduced by approx. 1% point, while the net CO2 emissions are 28% lower than those in coal-fired only plants. The introduction of CO2 capture has a major impact both on the emissions generated and on the energy efficiency.

The original model is hard to solve due to nonconvexities and nonlinearities of several constraints, but with the application of correct linearization techniques, accurate MILP models can be efficiently obtained and solved. The proposed MILP model differs from most of other approaches available in the literature in that it applies to several types of power generation, and includes a large number of real characteristics of the integrated system. A modified IEEE 31-bus with 2 pumped stations and 7-node natural gas system is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model; test cases are solved by commercial package Gurobi.

With the fast-paced changing technologies in the context of sustainable development, new approaches and concepts are needed to cope with the variability and uncertainty affecting generation, transmission and load demand. The main challenge remains in developing technologies that can efficiently make use of the available renewable resources. Alternatives in the form of microgrids or virtual power plants along with electricity storage are potential candidates for enhancing flexibility. However, intelligence must be added at all levels in the grid and among all the equipment comprising each subsystem, in order to achieve two-way communications and bidirectional flow of power. Then, the concept of smart grid can be realized and, relying upon software systems, it can remotely and automatically dispatch and optimize generation or storage resources in a single, secure and Web-connected way. Deploying smart configurations and metering promises new possibilities for self-managed energy consumption, improved energy efficiency among final consumers and transition to more consumer-centric energy systems via demand response and demand-side management mechanisms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Demand response; Demand-side management; Electricity storage; Microgrid; Smart grid; Virtual power plant","Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Microgrids; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Demand response; Electricity storages; Micro grid; Smart grid; Virtual power plants; Smart power grids",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073565957

Hence, interconnecting installations via a micro-grid (MG) should allow supply installations experiencing an energy lack by sending them energy surplus from others. This article presents a Hybrid Petri Net (HPN) strategy for a micro-grid energy provider in order to make hourly decisions on dispatching energy between the connected installations. An HPN model combines discrete events (house energy state) and continuous events (energy flow) to cover the need of some installations by energy surplus offered by its neighbours. The algorithm has been validated for three connected houses with different load profiles.

A novel computational methodology is implemented to help the sustainable integration of parabolic trough collectors photothermal technology into the low and medium enthalpy industrial activities. A multivariate artificial neural network that involves environmental, operational, and economic aspects was used to transfer the phenomenon under study into a simple and fast computing multi-output mathematical model. The optimal trade-off between environmental benefits and investment viability of the hybrid solar plant's design is obtained by a multi-objective optimization process. The objective functions consider the maximization in CO2 mitigation and net present value, and the minimization of the total life-cycle cost. The final optimal result is selected by using the TOPSIS decision-making method. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to report the system performance with respect to back-up boiler fuel type, climate region, the volume of the storage tank, and solar field area. The work contemplates the case study of a solar thermal plant based on parabolic collectors integrated into a pre-existing industrial process in Mexico. The study considered four of the most common climatic regions and the most representative heating fossil fuels in the national industrial sector. Based on the results, the best profitability and CO2 mitigation are achieved in warm climate regions. Moreover, diesel was identified as the most profitable back-up fuel scenario and natural gas as the least viable. Analysis of the energy contribution describes that implementation of parabolic trough collectors in the presented industrial process covers just over 40%–80% of the energy required, depending on the climate region. The presented methodology constitutes a rapid and low-cost computational tool which facilitates decision making for the implementation of solar heat industrial process systems. Moreover, it can be applied to other industrial processes with several photothermal technologies for clean heat generation. © 2019","Clean heat production; Decision-making method; Industrial process; Multi-objective optimization; Solar thermal; Surrogate models","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heat generation; Investments; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Natural gasoline plants; Neural networks; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Decision-making method; Heat production; Industrial processs; Solar thermal; Surrogate model; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072654053

Product assignment to the available spaces in warehouses can reduce the overall distance require for material handling equipment and people to storage, reach and manipulate the stocks in the warehouse. This way, a correct assignment can produce a reduction in the cost of energy, a reduction in the number of forklifts and people as well as in the time required for such operations in the storage facilities. For that reason, it is really important the establishment of optimal storage positions, seeking better conditions of profitability and service levels in companies. This article presents a mathematical model for the allocation of products in the available storage spaces in the warehouses, which is based in the minimization of the total distance required in the warehouse’ global operation. Due to the mathematical complexity implied in solving the model, a genetic algorithm was used, which efficiently solves the problem. With the aim of validate the model and the genetic procedure for its solution, a comparison between the actual material allocation in a real company and the assignment proposal produced by the model in the same conditions was made, in which an effectively the model reduced the allocations costs. The model also shows a good stability due to the little variation in the results through several runs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Cost reduction; Genetic algorithm; Material handling; Optimization; Product allocation; Warehousing",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072076705

The in situ synthesis method avoids post-growth transfer and isolation steps and allows the graphene to be directly synthesised into graphene wool. In the absence of a catalyst during graphene growth, the cracking of methane and nucleation is not as efficient, resulting in graphene defects which can be minimised by optimising the growth conditions. The roles of the methane and hydrogen flow rates in the synthesis of the graphene wool were investigated, as was the effect of growth temperature, growth time and cooling rates. The precursor flow rates and growth temperature were found to be the most vital parameters. The best quality graphene wool showed a minimum ratio of the disordered carbon relative to the graphitic carbon (ID/IG ≈ 0.8) with a calculated crystallite grain size of 24 nm. The morphology of the optimised graphene wool was flake-like, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed a surface composition of 94.05 at.% C 1s and 5.95 at.% O 1s. With this new material, the integrity of the synthesised graphene surface is preserved in use and it has the added advantage of structural support from the quartz substrate. Unlike many other forms of graphene, this fibrous graphene wool is flexible, malleable and compressible, allowing for a wealth of potential applications including in electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and gas sorption, storage, separation and sensing applications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Catalytic cracking; Chemical vapor deposition; Crystallite size; Flexible electronics; Growth temperature; Methane; Morphology; Quartz; Substrates; Wool; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Yarn; Chemical vapour deposition; Disordered carbon; Graphitic carbons; Growth conditions; Hydrogen flow rate; Precursor flow rates; Sensing applications; Structural support; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071658946

A smart microgrid consists of a smaller grid that can function independently or in conjunction with the main power grid and it is suitable for institutional, commercial and industrial consumers and also for urban and rural communities. A microgrid can operate in two modes, stand-alone mode and grid-connected mode, with the possibility to switch between modes because of faults in the local grid, scheduled maintenance and upgrade, shortages and outages in the host grid or for other reasons. With various distributed energy resources (DER) and interconnected loads in the microgrid, IoT is intended to provide solutions for high energy management, security mechanisms and control methods and applications. The basic components of a microgrid refer to local generation, consumption, energy storage and point of coupling to the main power grid. Local generation consists of different energy resources that provide electricity to users, from single residential house to commercial and industrial centers, which represent consumption. Energy storage is where the power is stored and comes with multiple functions such as voltage and frequency regulation, power backup or cost optimization. A coupling point refers to the junction between a smaller smart microgrid and the main smart grid. The main purposes of this chapter are to show the role of Internet of Things in creating and developing smart microgrids including benefits, challenges and risks and to reveal a variety of mechanisms, methods and procedures built to control and protect smart microgrids. Different technologies, architectures and applications using IoT, as the main key features, with the major goal of protecting and controlling innovative smart microgrids in line with modern optimization features and policies are intended to upgrade and improve efficiency, resiliency and economics.

An accurate development in proper energy storage systems with high ability to store and supply energy on demand should effectively eliminate the potentially adverse negative impacts of actual grid operation technologies, such as severe power fluctuation provided by intermittent power generations and photovoltaic arrays. Therefore, the hydrogen economy is regarded as continuous research that can be understood as a significant effort to modify the actual energy system into a system that combines the hydrogen advantage of as energy carrier with high efficiency of proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFC) as electrochemical processes that converts energy power into electricity and heat. In this chapter an experimental investigation on the performance of an integrated microgrid, installed at the National Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell, is presented. This system is equipped with specific components such as photovoltaic generator, solid polymer electrolyzer producing 1 m3 h−1, 4.2 kW PEMFC and power conditioning system to develop different topologies. Experimental investigations of an energy storage system in microgrids were analysed under realistic scenarios in different environmental conditions. The water electrolyzer stack is powered mainly by the solar PV energy source, then the produced hydrogen is stored in the hydrogen tank. The role of water electrolyzer is to generate hydrogen when the generated power by solar PV is greater than the power demand, and the role of PEMFC is to consume the generated hydrogen from water electrolyzer and to transform in electrical power energy. The target of the present work has been to assess the dynamic model of both systems to investigate the effect of these elements into the microgrid using measurements of the real systems. Modelling of the described system has been achieved using the MATLAB/Simulink. The model parameters have been acquired from manufacturer’s performance data-sheets. Based on above information, the proposed concept combining the PEMFC and water electrolyzer hybrid sources could offer an important improvement for real time power imbalances. Therefore, this chapter take into account the control system based power conditioning and energy management of a controllable electrolyzer in order to investigate the real time fluctuations of microgrid’s real power balance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alkaline water electrolyzers; Control strategy; Energy storage systems; Hydrogen; Microgrids; PEM fuel cell",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070503127

All typical microgrids use two or more sources by which electricity is generated, at least one of which is a renewable source. In this respect the main issues of the energy storage systems (ESS) are the enhancing of the stability of microgrid and power balance. Also the insertion of the energy storage systems is beneficial for both operation modes of microgrids, grid connected and islanded. This chapter begins with an overview of the current state of microgrids and ESS. The island operation mode of microgrids is based on the energy storage system. At the first level the control tasks during this mode of operation are to regulate the voltage and to maintain the frequency at the constant value. The power in each unit is shared among the storage units by secondary control of the energy storage system taking into account the energy level of each of them. Further, the authors present storage technologies of the electrical energy, i.e. converting it into mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, electromagnetic and thermal energy. The widespread mechanical energy storage technology is the pumped hydro (99% of the world total storage capacity) followed by the compressed air energy and flywheel. Afterwards, the fuel cell, biomass and fossil fuel compose the chemical storage domain. Batteries constitute the electrochemical storage technology. Electromagnetic and thermal energy storage technologies are represented by the super capacitors respectively the heat pumps. Both the features of the energy Storage technologies and the main properties will be presented. A comparison of the discharge time of the storage technologies by application is taken into account. The advantages and disadvantages of the storage technologies will be highlighted. The lack of the appropriate standards of interconnecting different kinds of energy sources and ESS to the microgrid is a disadvantage in technology developing. Thereby the IEC/ISO 62264 standards refers to wind turbine technology, while the IEEE 2000 standard refers to photovoltaic interconnection power systems. In order to reduce air pollution and mitigate climate change, in recent years the need to use renewable energy sources in microgrids has become important. In fact, technological development, public and political policies, availability of different renewable energy resources to be used in microgrids, are elements that create real perspectives in widespread development of renewable energies and their required ESS. The environmental impact and the costs of renewable energy resources have been estimated through the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, which determines whether the use of renewable sources and ESS is sustainable. A case study regarding a PV system with and without batteries used into a microgrid that supply a wastewater treatment plant situated in Romania will be presented. Life cycle assessment was used to quantify ecological sustainability and costs in both cases compared to a conventional supply of electricity from the grid. Conclusions and measures are drawn in order to increase the utilization of renewable sources and ESS in microgrids. Also the technically, economic and environmental benefits of inserting microgrids are discussed.

Globally, energy demand is constantly increasing and nowadays the power system has developed according to past and present needs. But, this has to be changed in order to adapt to the future rapid evolutions: today’s digitized society need efficient, scalable and resilient power systems, because, without it, our life style will reduce to an almost medieval existence. The difficulty and complexity of the power system transition from the traditional to the intelligent system consists in the fact that this must be done in order to solve the present problems and to prevent those which the system might face in the future by allowing the new technological innovations. All of this must take place while the system is in operation, without affecting the consumers. Among the risks associated with the traditional power system, based on a small number of large power stations, we mention the need to implement some power plants to take over the over-consumption (peaks), with major disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages can be summarized as follows: they only work temporarily; they do not easily depreciate their costs; low resiliency (e.g. collapse of the system, for natural reasons, or a malfunction in the production or transport chain. Microgrids come with added value through protection, resilience and low cost due to the avoidance of power cuts which, with respect to each sector of activity, generate significant financial losses in case of occurrence. About these challenges and the link between the connectivity of microgrids and the risks they are exposed to, the authors refer in the second paragraph of this chapter. Taking into account the technical requirements of the microgrids, protection solutions for both DC and AC currents will be presented. The level of pollution which our planet is facing imposes certain standards that change the approach of some industries. For example, in the transport sector, the authorities prohibit or impose extra-charges for cars with diesel engines and provide aid for the purchase of electric cars. Such a car raises the electricity needs of a home a few times, the colder winters and hotter summers put pressure on the system again, increasing the likelihood that the power system will crash. Therefore, reference will be made to the appropriate standards to which these protections should be aligned. At the end of the chapter, development trends in this area will be mentioned. The microgrids solve many problems of the classic power system because a power system made up of a microgrids array acts as a whole and, in the event of a problem, it disconnects from the system without propagating up. The probability of the occurrence of a power cut is much diminished because, for example, as in the case of Denmark, the system is decentralized and a problem can be propagated at most on the local level, not nationally, and the energy storage component in the microgrids ensures good functioning during peak periods as well as in the event of a public network failure. Besides certain advantages of implementing microgrids, they come also with new threats from the cyber spectrum, with increased complexity, threats which other sectors have already faced and found solutions. Such examples are given in the fourth paragraph. The chapter ends with conclusions and a large number of references in the field of microgrids protection. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Connectivity; Microgrid; Protection; Standards",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070496159

Even if the earth receives only a small fraction of the solar radiation emitted by the Sun (because the radiation suffers the phenomena of absorption and diffusion in the atmosphere) the solar energy has become one of the most important renewable sources. Solar energy can be captured and converted into electrical energy by using the photovoltaic technologies and/or thermal energy, through the use of various types of solar panels heat shields. In this context, the field of producing electricity with photovoltaic panels is approached in this chapter. The photovoltaic panels are devices that convert the solar energy into electrical energy. Depending on weather conditions, the generated renewable energy oscillates, being required an energy storage system to store the excess energy or to discharge energy during the lack of energy. The best solution applied for short-term storage of energy is the battery. On the other hand, the photovoltaic systems only use a portion of the solar radiation and of certain wavelengths, in order to produce electrical energy. The rest of the energy received at the surface is converted into heat, leading to a rise in temperature of the cells components and reduction in yield. In conclusion, increasing productivity and energy efficiency of these facilities involves both the efficiency of their operation in the electric field and the study of the thermal phenomena that take place. In order to ensure a high degree of felicity of the electrical energy management at the level of a microgrid type user, it is necessary to know the energy flows, the structure of the distribution network, and identification of the technical solutions depending on the field. In this chapter, the main functional parameters of the system considered will be analyzed, the quality parameters at the level of the electricity system of the user will be estimated, and the operating parameters of the system considered will be also analyzed. The objective of the chapter is to propose a technical solution to improve the efficiency of a photovoltaic power plant within an area of seventy hectares through control, surveillance, metering and monitoring of the system from distance based on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The photovoltaic power plant used to carry out the experiments is located in Romania. The location of the photovoltaic park is in a plain area where solar radiation is higher (over 1450 kWh/m2 year, in particular in the summer). With the help of the SCADA system, the energy management of the photovoltaic park can be achieved for: a short period (one day) or for a longer period (a week). The SCADA system offers information about: total energy delivered (kWh), day energy delivered (kWh), active inverter power (kW), percent of availability for photovoltaic power plant, weather info (ambient temperature, plane radiation etc.), hourly graphs about plant production, alarms, current strings, energy meter (exported active-reactive power, imported active-reactive power), data about the weather station, inverter graphs, state of power transformers, breaker state, earthing state, month radiation, month exported active energy, currents variation (Ia, Ib, Ic), leakage current variation (Ig), and voltage variation (Va, Vb, Vc). The data stored by the system will allow the user to receive current information, but also these data can be compared with the data stored in the same period of the past years, in order to establish the productive efficiency of the photovoltaic power plant. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alarms; Control; Energy management; Energy meter; Metering; Monitoring; Photovoltaic power plant; SCADA; Surveillance",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070486617

Although fuel price varies in response to demand, most of the value of forest fuel depends on its energy content, and thereby its moisture content. To maximise the economic value of the fuel, supply chains must be managed to minimise moisture content. One method for this is covering residue stacks to reduce rewetting during storage. The aim of this study was to describe the effects on moisture content in covered and uncovered residue stacks after storage in cases with and without direct ground contact. Results varied between study sites, but the only method that consistently produced a drier fuel compared to no coverage was when biomass cover had been placed both under and over the stacks. This produces the most reliable economic outcome of the tested treatments, and a more homogeneous fuel for the customer. Covering only the tops of stacks may not produce a significantly drier fuel than no cover in dry areas, but will be an insurance against rewetting in rainy areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Economy; Forest fuel","Biomass; Costs; Forestry; Fuels; Moisture; Moisture determination; Supply chains; Coverage strategies; Economic values; Economy; Energy content; Forest fuel; Ground contacts; Logging residues; Production cost; Fuel economy; economic analysis; fuelwood; logging (timber); moisture content; plant residue; profitability; rewetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070198874

As a high pressure casing hydraulic hoses of high pressure pressed to the elliptic state were used. Hydraulic pump—a pulsator—is the upgraded gear pump in which a quarter of one tooth was cut. The modes of transition of a hydraulic motor through resonance were investigated. It is proposed to use the mode of fluctuation switching from coordinate X to Y and vice versa to create vibrating actuators of periodic action with a large vibration traction effort due to the massive energy storage. The developed experimental complex can be used both for one-sided and for dry isostatic pressing. The complex allows to implement spatial variations of the press-mould. The frequency and oscillation amplitude can be regulated. The frequency can be regulated by changing the turns of the hydromotor, and the amplitude—by changing the pressure values in the system. The method of calculating vibration modules on a high pressure casing is developed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Fluctuation; High pressure casing; Powder materials; Pressure; Resonance; Vibration",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067077547

A 46 year-old man was sent to the rheumatology outpatient department with a 3-year history of severe exercise-induced cramps and myalgias. The episodes began when he worked in France and used to practice ski and snowboard in the Alps Mountain, with exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and myoglobinuria. The laboratory results showed elevated serum creatine kinase levels (∼15,000 U/L), and the biopsy of the deltoid muscle revealed glycogen subsarcolemmal vacuoles and absence of myophosphorylase enzymatic activity. This clinical case emphasises the importance of taking into account this metabolic disorder when faced with a patient with exercise intolerance and cramps, especially after vigorous/anaerobic exercise and elevated levels of CK activity. It is fundamental to explain the aetiology of the patient symptoms in order to improve quality of life and avoid unnecessary complications. © 2019 Asociación Colombiana de Reumatología","Exercise intolerance; Glycogen storage disease; McArdle's disease; Metabolic myopathy; Myophosphorylase","brain natriuretic peptide; creatine kinase; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; glycogen; glycogen phosphorylase; myoglobin; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; consultation; creatine kinase blood level; deltoid muscle; disease severity; enzyme activity; exercise; fatigue; genetic variability; glycogen storage disease type 5; heart ventricle function; homozygote; human; male; middle aged; muscle biopsy; muscle cramp; myalgia; myoglobinuria; outpatient department; quality of life; skiing; symptom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066623338
