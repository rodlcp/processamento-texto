Unluckily, hydrogen storage presents the most crucial difficulty restricting utilization of hydrogen energy for real applications. However, Mg metal is the best known cheap solid-state hydrogen storage media with high hydrogen capacity and operational cost effectiveness; it shows high thermal stability and poor hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics. In the present work we have succeeded to prepare nanocrystalline MgH2 powders doped with a mixture of 8 wt% Nb2O5/2 wt% Ni nanocatalytic system. The synthesized nanocomposite powders possessed superior hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics (2.6 min/3 min) at relatively low temperature (250 °C) with long cycle-life-time (400 h). The powders were consolidated into green-compacts, using cold pressing technique. The compacts were utilized as solid-state hydrogen source needed for charging a battery of a cell-phone device, using integrated Ti-tank/commercial proton-exchange membrane fuel cell system. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalysts; Gas-solid reaction; Kinetics; Powder consolidation; Reactive ball milling; Thermal stability","Ball milling; Catalysts; Cellular telephone systems; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Enzyme kinetics; Hydrogenation; Kinetics; Magnesium compounds; Mobile phones; Nanocomposites; Nanocrystals; Niobium oxide; Powder metals; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Thermodynamic stability; Cold-pressing techniques; Gas-solid reaction; High thermal stability; Nano-composite powders; Powder consolidations; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems; Reactive ball milling; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057014985

The checkpoints are stored in alternative already paid VMs. This allows resuming a task execution faster and cheaper after a node crash. Since checkpoints are distributed and replicated, our approach increases also the system reliability.

We find that cations distribute homogeneously on BPC and C2N with a maximum densities of 1.9 and 1.7 ion/nm2, respectively. The H2 adsorption on cation-decorated BPC shows binding energies that vary from −0.14 to −0.26 eV/H2, depending on whether the cation is single or double charged, where the storage capacity are calculated to be around 10 wt%. Whereas, for cation-doped C2N, the H2 binding energies vary from −0.11 to −0.31 eV/H2, with storage capacity between 7.3 and 8.8 wt%.

They produce a great amount of biomass, and also are of great interest because of the ecosystem services they provide from which carbon storage stands out. This work aims to study the energy and mass exchanged by a salt marsh located in southeastern Buenos Aires province (Argentina) and to characterize its net ecosystem production. A field campaign was carried out from February 2014 to March 2015. Sensible heat, water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with eddy covariance technique at 6 m height over a Spartina densiflora canopy. Fifty five percent of the data were lost and 15% more were discarded due to low turbulence conditions. This gaps were filled with a combination of techniques (look-up tables and mean diurnal variations), which allowed the estimation of monthly mean net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. As in other marshes, the latent heat flux consumed more than 55% of the available energy of the system, reaching up to 85% after a large flood event. This flux systematically exceeds the values of sensible heat measured throughout the study period. Unlike other environments, this southern salt marsh behaved as a CO2 sink throughout the year. The net ecosystem production from March 2014 to February 2015 was approximately −10.5 t of CO2 ha−1 yr−1 which is greater than reported results for other wetlands. These preliminary results for a southern S. densiflora salt marsh are encouraging, although new field studies are under way to confirm their accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Argentina; Eddy covariance; Energy and mass fluxes; Net ecosystem exchange; Salt marsh","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; canopy exchange; carbon flux; eddy covariance; flooding; grass; latent heat flux; net primary production; saltmarsh; turbulence; water vapor; Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; South America; Spartina densiflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051815084

The hard-segment content (30%) positively affected the adhesive properties. The probe–tack showed a maximum adhesion energy of 147 J/cm2, and the 180° peel test showed a 15.67 N/25 mm peel force.

This paper presents an optimal design and energy management strategy of photovoltaic-diesel-battery (PDB) decentralized hybrid power system (DHPS) that minimizes operating costs and provides reliable power supply. The nonlinear objective cost function is formulated for the economic dispatch problem taking into consideration various operating constraints. The diesel generator (DG) minimum operation efficiency is expanded and solved using Newton-Quasi method. The DG is constrained to operate between the proposed minimum and rated efficiency during its operation in order to achieve desired load factor. Mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) technique is explored to optimize the utilization of RES in supplying the load demand reliably. A combined dispatch strategy which minimizes daily fuel consumption cost by the maximization of RES using a set of prioritized rules was developed and compared with the MINLP technique. The performance of the proposed combined strategy is validated by simulating the following operating scenarios: single household and community daily load profiles. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed combined dispatch algorithm as it reduces DG fuel consumption cost and improves supply reliability. Consequently, the effectiveness of these strategies encourages the integration of DHPS in remote and isolated communities. © 2018 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Battery energy storage system; Decentralized hybrid power system; Energy dispatch strategy; Minimum operation efficiency; Newton-Quasi method; Photovoltaic-diesel-battery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059345035

In 2015, the shares of electricity generation generated from coal, hydro, oil and biomass were 48.1%, 47.40%, 3.65% and 0.85%, respectively. The government of Cambodia has set up the Power Development Plan (PDP) 2020 which mainly emphasizes the development of renewable energy and coal-based power. The drastically increasing share of coal-based electricity generation in the recent years is providing an alarming signal in terms of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the power sector. Recently, renewable energy and efficient technologies have played an important role in GHG emission's reduction. The aim of this paper is to quantify the potentials of renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation options in the power sector of Cambodia. In this study, the Long-range Energy Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze the electricity generation mix and CO2 mitigation during 2015 to 2050. The BAU scenario is constructed in this study following the power development targets of PDP2020, and the share of renewable energy-based power generation is assumed to reach 44% by 2050. Three countermeasure (CM) scenarios of CO2 mitigation (namely, CM1, CM2, and CM3) are modeled along with the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario. Two countermeasure scenarios, namely CM1 and CM2 considering an additional 5% of power generation based on solar PV and biomass-based technologies have been constructed in this study respectively. In the CM3 scenario, the CO2 mitigation effects of replacing 50% of conventional coal-fired power plants with the efficient carbon capture storage (CCS) technology in coal power plants have been analyzed. The results demonstrate that in the BAU scenario, electricity supply and CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 65.9TWh and 14,683.5kt-CO2eq, respectively, in 2050. In countermeasures scenarios, CO2 emissions in 2050 would be reduced by 45% in the CM3, 15% in CM1 and 12.47% in the CM2 scenario when compared to the BAU scenario. © 2018 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC).

Results: A large number of structurally distinct metabolites can be analyzed to facilitate the investigation of differences between physiological and pathophysiological metabolic profiles associated with adipose tissue. Understanding the molecular basis of adipose tissue regulation can thereby provide insight into the monitoring of obesity-related metabolic disorders and lead to the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

In this regard, metal oxides are particularly promising materials to be used in core technologies such as photovoltaics or solar fuel production as well as in energy storage technologies such as batteries. In particular, the production of solar fuels by photo-(electro)chemical methods is currently considered to be the ‘holy grail’ of energy research by some. This high consideration stems from the desirability of converting solar energy directly into chemical bonds and thus into a storable energy carrier. In this regard, the generation of hydrogen via solar water splitting forms a key building block related to this field of research. As a result of its low-cost, environmentally-friendly and earth-abundant nature, ZnO represents a promising material for this application. However, this material possesses some natural limitations, which are currently hindering the use of ZnO for solar water splitting. After considering some general material properties, this review introduces strategies that have been applied to increase the performance of ZnO for photo-(electro)chemical applications. It is discussed how these can help to overcome the most urgent material challenges, such as low visible-light absorption, fast charge carrier recombination and the deterioration of the material due to photo-corrosion. The focus of this short review is therefore on the opportunities associated with different synthetic approaches to manipulate the material's structure, defect-chemistry, opto-electronic properties and chemical stability. Thus nano-structuring, defect-engineering, doping and functional over-coating strategies are analyzed and their potential for the facilitation of ZnO's use for solar water splitting are outlined. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Defects; Doping; Nanostructure; Photo-corrosion; Photo-electrochemical cell; ZnO","Bond strength (chemical); Charging (batteries); Chemical stability; Defects; Deterioration; Doping (additives); Electrochemical corrosion; Electronic properties; Fuel storage; Hydrogen production; II-VI semiconductors; Light absorption; Nanostructures; Solar energy; Zinc oxide; Chemical applications; Defect engineering; Energy storage technologies; Optoelectronic properties; Renewable energies; Solar water splitting; Synthetic approach; Visible light absorption; Solar power generation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055693558

However, during cold ischemia, the liver suffers molecular alterations that can affect its performance. Also, deleterious mechanisms set forth in the storage phase are exacerbated during reperfusion. This study aimed to identify liver proteins associated with injury during cold storage and/or normothermic reperfusion using the isolated perfused rat liver model. Livers from male rats were subjected to either (1) cold storage for 24 h, (2) ex vivo normothermic reperfusion for 90 min or (3) cold storage for 24 h followed by ex vivo normothermic reperfusion for 90 min. Then, the livers were homogenized and proteins were extracted. Protein expression between each experimental group and the control (freshly resected livers) was compared by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Protein identification was carried out by matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF/TOF) using MASCOT as the search engine. 23 proteins were detected with significantly altered levels of expression among the different treatments, including molecular chaperones, antioxidant enzymes, and proteins involved in energy metabolism. Some of them have been postulated as biomarkers for liver damage while others had been identified in other organs subjected to ischemia and reperfusion injury. The whole data set will be a useful resource for studying deleterious molecular mechanisms that result in diminished liver function during storage and subsequent reperfusion. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cold ischemia; Liver; Proteomics; Reperfusion injury; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","antioxidant; biological marker; chaperone; proteome; proteome; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cold ischemia; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; ex vivo study; isolated liver; liver homogenate; liver injury; liver ischemia; liver resection; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein isolation; rat; reperfusion injury; time factor; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; animal; cold; cryopreservation; liver; liver transplantation; metabolism; procedures; proteomics; Animals; Cold Ischemia; Cold Temperature; Cryopreservation; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Male; Proteome; Proteomics; Rats; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054424306

However, in the real energy world hydrogen has not yet delivered. The major reason is that it has still to become economically feasible. With increasing electricity generation from variable renewables and its temporarily cheap surplus production, new prospects for hydrogen are on the horizon especially due to the rising need for a solution to the problem of the long-term storage of excess electricity. The core objective of this paper is to analyze the economic prospects of hydrogen use in the energy system keeping in mind two challenges: (i) integration of variable renewables in power systems, and (ii) substitution of fossil fuels in the transport sector. The future economics of hydrogen in passenger car transport is investigated regarding hydrogen production costs and possible learning effects of the fuel cell vehicles. The major conclusion is that the future perspective of hydrogen use depends on the policy framework, the full exploitation of economies-of-scale and technological learning for electrolysis as well as possible full-load hours per year.

VPPs will eventually help to overcome the stochastic nature of DERs which will result in a more stable and smart power grid. VPPs are constituted of an integration of heterogeneous systems, organizations and entities which collaborate to ensure optimal generation, distribution, storage, and sale of renewable energy in the energy market. By its composition, a VPP forms a kind of collaborative business ecosystem with high degree of interactions and interdependences among stakeholders. This survey, is focused on analysing the trends and also identifying areas of convergence between the collaborative networks (CN) discipline and the VPP concept and development using foreknowledge from the domain of CNs. A systematic literature review method was employed to summarize research evidence, by evaluating and interpreting available research works under specifically defined focus areas, relevant to both domains. The results confirmed a visible convergence between VPPs and CNs although the convergence level manifested differently under each “focus area”. The results showed that within a VPP, various strategic and dynamic collaborative alliances are formed. The forms of these alliances are similar to various CN organizational forms which include goal oriented networks, virtual breeding environments (VBE), grasping opportunity driven networks and continuous production driven networks. Additionally, various underlying functional principles of VPPs were also found to be similar to CN principles which include: virtual organization creation, operation, and dissolution, negotiations, broker services, VBE administrator services, VO planer services, VO coordinator services, and partner search and selection processes. A variety of organizational forms, similar to traditional CN forms or a mix of those could also be found.

Numerous oil fields do not have possibilities for transport of gas separated during oil production to final consumers due to technological or economic limitations. This paper deals with possibility of introducing small technological improvement like implementation of gas separator, which might lead to CO2 reduction at flare. First, it was necessary to calculate accurate oil production decline through lifetime of a reservoir, then pressure decline for a mature oil field was correlated. The payout period for such improvement, along with other economical parameters, has been calculated in economic analysis. It can be concluded that CO2 reduction is possible and economically feasible by introducing separator at oil production field. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emission; economics of CO2 reduction; Gas flaring; Pressure depletion","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Separators; CO2 emissions; CO2 reduction; Economical parameters; Gas flaring; Hydrocarbon production; Oil production decline; Pressure depletion; Technological improvements; Well stimulation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic analysis; emissions trading; hydrocarbon exploration; oil field; oil production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052467320

The pervasive adoption of cloud in the IoT framework, makes the underlying data centers exacerbate problems like the environmental carbon footprint and operational costs which arise from the high energy consumption of computing servers. Several works proposed virtual machine placement and task scheduling algorithms to reduce the energy consumption of the underlying cloud infrastructure. However, each algorithm uses a different environment, experimental setup, power consumption model and workload for its evaluation, making it difficult to compare among them. In this paper, we give a classification and evaluation of 13 different algorithms using a unified setup, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. The workload used for the evaluation is selected to typify IoT applications, such as connected vehicles, wide area measurement systems for the power grid, and smart meters for advanced meter infrastructure.

Our results showed lipids as the main energy reserve in Drosophila, and their physiological level and metabolism were shown to be under the control of AKH. AKH abundance in the body resulted in lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than in the controls, probably due to a more intensive metabolism; interestingly, there was a disproportional representation of fatty acids in triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols in Drosophila. Lower level of glycogen and its partial control by AKH suggest its lesser role as the storage substance. However, maintenance of free carbohydrate level in Drosophila seemed to be critical; when glycogen stores are exhausted, carbohydrates are synthesized from other sources. Protein levels and their alterations, under starvation, did not seem controlled by AKH. AKH-deficient flies were more resistant while AKH-abundant flies were more sensitive to starvation; females were found to be more resistant than males, regardless of the AKH level, probably due to higher body mass and higher amount of nutrients. However, in accordance with the level of all nutrients, that of AKH also gradually decreased with prolonged starvation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adipokinetic hormone; Drosophila melanogaster mutants; homeostasis; metabolism; mortality; nutrients; starvation","adipokinetic hormone; carbohydrate; diacylglycerol; glycogen; palmitic acid; palmitoleic acid; triacylglycerol; DAKH peptide; diacylglycerol; Drosophila protein; glycogen; insect hormone; oligopeptide; pyroglutamic acid; triacylglycerol; adult; animal experiment; Article; body mass; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; Drosophila melanogaster; female; food deprivation; male; metabolism; mortality; nonhuman; priority journal; starvation; triacylglycerol blood level; analogs and derivatives; animal; carbohydrate metabolism; Drosophila melanogaster; energy metabolism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene deletion; genetic cross; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; randomization; reproducibility; sexual characteristics; starvation; survival analysis; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Crosses, Genetic; Diglycerides; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Gene Deletion; Glycogen; Insect Hormones; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oligopeptides; Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid; Random Allocation; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics; Starvation; Survival Analysis; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051656925

Due to available precision medicine approaches in many inborn errors of metabolism and sophisticated traditional diagnostics, this group of disorders is of special relevance to clinicians. Besides, as current treatment is challenging and unsuccessful in more than 30% of all epilepsy patients, these diseases may provide valuable models for ictogenesis and epileptogenesis studies and potentially pave the ways to identification of novel treatments. The aim of this study was to elucidate genetic architecture of inborn errors of metabolism involving epilepsy or seizures and to evaluate their diagnostic approaches. After extensive search, 880 human genes were identified with a considerable part, 373 genes (42%), associated with inborn errors of metabolism. The most numerous group comprised disorders of energy metabolism (115, 31% of all inborn errors of metabolism). A substantial number of these diseases (26%, 97/373) have established specific treatments, therefore timely diagnosis comes as an obligation. Highly heterogenous, overlapping and non-specific phenotypes in most of inborn errors of metabolism presenting with epilepsy or seizures usually preclude phenotype-driven diagnostics. Besides, as traditional diagnostics involves a range of specialized metabolic tests with low diagnostic yields and is generally inefficient and lengthy, next-generation sequencing-based methods were proposed as a cost-efficient one-step way to shorten “diagnostic odyssey”.

This demands extreme operational conditions on the Power Take-Off components and an undesirable decrease of overall efficiency. The size of the system, in particular, of the main hydraulic pump, is also substantially increased.

We model the CDC platforms with an open queuing system that can be used to estimate the expected quality of service (QoS) parameters such as the throughput, the drop rate, the CPU utilization and the response time. In addition, we present an energy consumption model to study and estimate the energy consumption in the CDC.

The effect of post annealing temperature on structural, magnetic, and optical properties of thin films has been investigated. Thin films have been characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), UV-VIS spectroscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis. The as-deposited thin films are amorphous in nature. After deposition, these thin films post annealed at different temperature ranges from 200 to 500 ∘C to enhance the crystallinity of films. The film post annealed at 200 ∘C is also amorphous in nature. As the post annealing temperature increases, the thin films become more crystalline. X-ray diffractometer and Raman analysis confirm the formation of cubical inverse spinel structure of thin films. The saturation magnetization of the thin films decreases with the annealing temperature due to the sites occupancy of cations between tetrahedral and octahedral. The reduction in coercivity is correlated with the anisotropy constant, but the anisotropy value is still high which is suitable to form stable magnetic storage memories. The band gap energy are decreased which is mainly attributed due to increase in grain size of the film. It is noted that the band gap energy of these thin films are higher than that of bulk material, so these may be suggested for use in wide band gap applications. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Band gap energy; E-beam deposition; Magnetic properties; Thin films","Amorphous films; Anisotropy; Annealing; Atomic force microscopy; Cobalt compounds; Deposition; Energy gap; Ferrite; Iron compounds; Magnetic properties; Magnetic storage; Optical films; Optical properties; Saturation magnetization; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Substrates; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Zinc compounds; Band gap energy; E-beam deposition; Electron beam depositions; Inverse spinel structures; Magnetic and optical properties; Optical properties of thin films; Post-annealing temperature; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045435149

Its relevance relies on the high energy potential of charcoal, its renewable nature, storage and transportation capacity in liquid form, as well as on the economic and environmental advantages derived thereof. The ability of a commercially available charcoal to be dispersed in three different organic solvents was assessed through the rheological characterisation of the resulting charcoal oil slurries (ChOS). The charcoal was ground in a conventional ball mill and dispersed with the aid of three different surfactants. The effects of the most relevant factors influencing the rheological properties of the suspensions were evaluated, including: (i) the solvent producing the lowest fuel viscosity (η) at a given charcoal content; (ii) the most efficient surfactant (and its amount) minimising the fuel viscosity (η) at a given solids fraction; and (iii) the charcoal content, which should be as high as possible. High-stability ChOS containing 62 wt% solids and 0.4 wt% surfactant, and exhibiting adequate flow properties and high calorific values, were successfully obtained. © 2017 Energy Institute","Biofuel; Charcoal oil slurry; Coal oil slurry; Dispersant; Rheological behaviour","Biofuels; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Slurries; Surface active agents; Viscosity; Dispersants; Flow properties; High-calorific-value; Oil slurry; Rheological behaviour; Rheological property; Solids fraction; Storage and transportations; Charcoal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029724466

Phytoplankton is at the base of marine food webs and diatoms are major contributors to global primary production. Therefore, environmental changes, such as heat, influencing growth, physiology and biochemical composition of diatoms, impact other organisms at higher trophic levels. The model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, particularly rich in the long chain omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and able to accumulate substantial amounts of storage lipids, has recently been the object of numerous works, regarding fundamental aspects of lipid metabolism and exploring its biotechnological potential for biodiesel and aquaculture purposes. The aim of this study was to use P. tricornutum, growing under controlled conditions, to examine the effects of a heat wave, in order to identify heat stress biomarkers. The photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism was investigated by Chlorophyll a fluorescence and by O2 evolution and discussed in connection with changes observed in the composition of photosynthetic pigments and fatty acids. Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells exposed to 26 °C displayed lower photosynthetic O2 production, but similar respiratory rate, comparing to cells at control temperature (18 °C), which is likely related to the biomass decrease observed under heat stress. Heat wave exposed cells also showed a less efficient PSII, higher energy dissipation and higher chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin concentrations, suggesting a heat-induced amplification of the light energy absorption capacity. Heat wave exposed cells showed lower relative EPA contents and double bond indexes, whereas the parameter inversely related to nutritional value, omega 6/omega 3 ratio, increased. Moreover, the analysis of the fatty acid profiles also suggested that heat exposure negatively impacted thylakoid lipids, in agreement with the decrease observed in photosynthesis. Results obtained highlight the negative impact of heat waves on diatom photosynthesis and nutritional value, as well as on their capacity to oxygenate ocean water. Furthermore, physiological parameters as well as fatty acids and photosynthetic pigments signatures, were identified, that could represent expedite biomarkers of thermal stress in future studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomarkers; Climate change; Eicosapentadienoic acid (EPA); Omega-3 fatty acids; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Photosynthesis","Biomarkers; Cells; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Cytology; Ecosystems; Energy dissipation; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel storage; Global warming; Lipids; Metabolism; Offshore structures; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Phytoplankton; Thermal stress; Biotechnological potentials; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Eicosapentadienoic acid (EPA); Global primary productions; Omega-3-fatty acids; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Photosynthetic pigments; Physiological parameters; Fatty acids; aquatic organism; biochemical composition; biomarker; biomass; cell; chlorophyll a; climate change; cultural change; diatom; environmental change; fatty acid; food web; marine ecosystem; metabolism; net primary production; petrochemistry; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; temperature effect; trophic level; Bacillariophyta; Phaeodactylum tricornutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027219876

Biomass from animal waste such as horse manure has unutilized potential as it has yet to be implemented at a large scale as an energy source. Research has demonstrated the technical feasibility of using animal waste for energy conversion, though their supply chain cost poses a barrier, as does a gap in research regarding the specific design of efficient horse manure-to-energy supply chains. In response, we investigated the design of horse manure-to-energy supply chains through interviews and site visits at stables, as well as through interviews with transport companies. Our findings show that horse manure-to-energy supply chains have distinct attributes at all stages of the supply chain such as the geographical spread of stables that determines supply chain design and hampers efficiency. They share several such attributes with forest biomass-to-energy supply chains, from which important needs can be identified, including the industrial development of trucks dedicated to the purpose, mathematical modeling to handle the trade-off of cost of substance loss in storage and cost of transport, and business models that reconcile the conflicting goals of different actors along the supply chains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Horse manure; Logistics and sustainability; Supply chain","Animals; Biomass; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Farm buildings; Fertilizers; Manures; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bio-energy; Energy supply chains; Horse manure; Industrial development; Renewable energy source; Supply chain costs; Supply chain design; Transport companies; Costs; anthropogenic effect; bioenergy; biomass; design; feasibility study; logistics; manure; research work; supply chain management; sustainability; Animalia; Equidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017455474

The majority of small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DER)-microgeneration units, energy storage devices, and flexible loads-are connected to LV networks, requiring local control solutions to mitigate technical problems resulting from its integration in the system. Simultaneously, LV connected DER can be aggregated in small cells in order to globally provide new functionalities to system operators. Within this view, the Microgrid (MG) concept has been pointed out as a solution to extend and decentralize the distribution network monitoring and control capability. An MG is a highly flexible, active, and controllable LV cell, incorporating microgeneration units based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) or low carbon technologies for small-scale combined heat and power applications, energy storage devices, and loads. The coordination of MG local resources, achieved through an appropriated network of controllers and communication system, endows the LV system with sufficient autonomy to operate interconnected to the upstream network or autonomously-emergency operation. In this case, the potentialities of DER can be truly realized if the islanded operation is allowed and bottom-up black start functionalities are implemented. To achieve this operational capability, this chapter presents the control procedures to be used in such a system to deal with the islanded operation and to exploit the local generation resources as a way to help in power system restoration in case of an emergency situation. A sequence of actions for a black start procedure is identified, and it is expected to be an advantage for power system operation regarding reliability as a result from the presence of a huge amount of dispersed generation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Hydrogen-bromine flow batteries (HBFBs) are promising cost-effective energy storage systems. In HBFBs, proton exchange membranes are required to separate the two reactive materials, enabling proton transport for charge balancing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the key properties and an experimental performance map of cation exchange membranes for HBFBs. Our study shows that membrane water uptake is an important property due to its strong correlation with membrane resistance and bromide species crossover. Long chain perfluorosulfonic acid (LC PFSA) membranes are shown to have a better power density–crossover tradeoff and a higher stability than other types of functionalized membranes. The good power density-crossover tradeoff of LC PFSA membranes is the result of the high level of separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains in the membrane, leading to well-connected ionic pathways for proton transport. Reinforcement of long chain LC PFSA membranes further improves their tradeoff because it mechanically constrains the swelling (lower water uptake), resulting in a lower crossover but a similar peak power density. Consequently, reinforced LC PFSA membranes are the most promising option for HBFBs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cation exchange membranes; Hydrogen bromine flow batteries; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Reinforcement; Water uptake","Bromine; Chains; Cost effectiveness; Electric energy storage; Flow batteries; Hydrogen storage; Positive ions; Reinforcement; Swelling; Cation exchange membranes; Functionalized membranes; Hydrogen bromine; Hydrophobic and hydrophilic; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Proton exchange membranes; Sustainable energy sources; Water uptake; Membranes; bromide; bromine; fluorosulfonic acid; hydrogen; perfluoro compound; water; Article; cation exchange; electricity; energy resource; heat tolerance; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; proton transport; surface charge; thermostability; water transport; Bromine; Cations; Chains; Cost Effectiveness; Reinforcement; Swelling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053444738

Zeolite-based materials are conventional adsorbents used to adsorb some gasses involving carbon dioxide. Mg-MOF-74 is an eminent reticular material among adsorbents due to its good CO2 capacity at low pressures (10–20 kPa). In this study, an experimentally validated model is used to report the H2O effect on CO2 separation using 13X and Mg-MOF-74 under ambient conditions. A computational model has been developed using ANSYS Fluent program linked by user-define-function (written in C). The adsorption breakthrough results show that a humid CO2/N2 mixture, under 300 K, 86% RH, 101.3 kPa, could slightly reduce the CO2 adsorption capacity by about 0.05% and 6% for 13X and Mg-MOF-74, respectively (at CO2 adsorption breakthrough saturation). Regardless of these reductions, Mg-MOF-74 has better adsorption capacity, even under humid ambient conditions, by about 5.77 mmol/g in a comparison to 2.27 mmol/g for 13X, respectively. Cycling stability over more than 90 cycles is also simulated; and shows that, a dehydration process is recommended to be carried out before the CO2 separation process for efficient energy consumption and sustainable adsorbents. The total recyclable amounts of adsorbed CO2 are about 0.94 and 3.07 mmol/g for 13X and Mg-MOF-74, respectively, under 101.3 kPa adsorption, 2 kPa desorption, 86% relative humidity, and 298 K.

A complete shift from non-renewable resources to renewable resources is currently impossible due to its major share in energy generation; making CCS an imperative need of the time. This study, therefore, aims to examine the reckoning of carbon dioxide (CO2), measurement methods, and its efficient capture and storage technologies with an ambition to combat global warming and achieve environmental sustainability. Conventionally, physical, geological and biological proxies are used to measure CO2. The recent methods for CO2 analyses are spectrometry, electrochemical gas sensors, and gas chromatography. Various procedures such as pre, post, and oxyfuel combustion, and use of algae, biochar, and charcoal are the promising ways for CO2 sequestration. However, the efficient implementation of CCS lies in the application of nanotechnology that, in the future, could provide a better condition for the environment and economic outlooks. The captured carbon can be stored in the earth crust for trillions of years, but its leakage during storage can raise many issues including its emissions in the atmosphere and soil acidification. Therefore, global and collective efforts are required to explore, optimize and implement new techniques for CCS to achieve high environmental sustainability and combat the issues of global warming. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Climate proxies; CO2 measurement; Global warming; Sustainable environment","adsorbent; carbon; carbon dioxide; charcoal; fuel; carbon sequestration; emission; environmental technology; global warming; implementation process; nanotechnology; power generation; sustainability; absorption; air pollution control; alga; Article; atmosphere; basalt; combustion; coral reef; electrochemical analysis; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; gas analysis; gas chromatography; gas transport; greenhouse effect; industrial production; membrane; nanotechnology; nonhuman; pollen; sea; sediment; spectroscopy; tree; carbon sequestration; greenhouse effect; mass fragmentography; algae; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Global Warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051384842

The prepared samples were heat-treated at the nucleation (625 °C) and crystallization (875 °C) temperatures for different soaking times. SEM, XRD, UV–Vis, DSC and electrical measurements were used. Ti(PO4) and Zn3(PO4)2 phases were formed at the nucleation temperature; while, Ti5O4(PO4)4 and α-Zn2P2O7 phases were observed at the crystallization temperature. Long soaking time caused color fading or formation of opaque white samples due to the decrease of Ti3+ ions or increase of Ti4+ ions, respectively. The formation of Ti3+ ions causes a development of violet color with absorption bands in the range 400–800 nm. SEM suggested that prolonged heating at the crystallization temperature caused disintegration of the formed phases. The electrical conductivities of the studied samples at the low and high measuring temperatures occur via electrons revealing their suitability to be applied as semiconductors. The values of σac and dielectric constant ε′ increase with rising the sintering temperature. The ε′ of the as-prepared sample (19.23) is increased to 152.45 or 189.11 when heat-treated at the nucleation temperature for 4 h and at crystallization temperature for 15 min, respectively.

The rate-limiting step for the reactions involved in methane steam reforming (MSR) is thought to be CH 4 activation. Praseodymium-doped ceria-based catalysts, with easily reducible Pr cations and high oxygen storage capacity, could be attractive for MSR. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the activity of a low Pr-doped CeO 2 (1 1 1) surface for methane reforming. The results show a significant lowering (0.48 eV) of the energy barrier for methane activation via homolytic H 3 C–H bond cleavage. This can be mainly explained by the easy occupation of Pr(4f) gap states by electrons transferred from adsorbed hydrogen species. The promotion of methane activation upon Pr doping of ceria was corroborated with methane temperature-programed reduction (CH 4 -TPR) experiments conducted in both Ce 0.95 Pr 0.05 O 2 and CeO 2 samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","DFT; Hydrogen; Methane activation; Pr-doped ceria","Cerium oxide; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Methane; Praseodymium compounds; Adsorbed hydrogen; Biomass Gasification; Methane activation; Methane reforming; Methane steam reforming; Pr-doped ceria; Praseodymium-doped ceria; Rate-limiting steps; Steam reforming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050097433

The software functions are accessed remotely by a web-interface using Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Several techniques for gain control (including an auto-adjustment of the gain by setting a selected photopeak in a prescribed channel) together with the corresponding approaches to the energy-scale calibration are implemented and examined over a wide temperature range −10÷+50°C in a thermo-chamber calibration experiment with 152Eu point gamma-ray sources. Calibrating the energy resolution of the detector is performed from line-width measurements of reference gamma-ray sources. The detection-efficiency calibration is carried out using Monte Carlo simulations based on the GEANT4 code taking into account the materials and geometry of the detector as well as the water environment. In addition, the efficiency of the detector immersed in a 8m3 water tank with dissolved gamma-ray sources of 139Ce, 137Cs and 40K of known activities is determined experimentally and compared with the theoretical findings. Finally, a trial deployment of the gamma-spectrometer in the Yellow Sea together with test measurements of the activity concentrations of dissolved radionuclides is fulfilled.

However, there are alternative passive and active cold storage systems that can be used to reduce building HVAC costs for on grid systems and provide a solution for off-grid HVAC. Such systems depend on harnessing the night time cold and using it for day time air cooling. Such systems can be driven by a solar photovoltaic powered fan. Although there is no mechanism for humidity control to attain recommended conditions (40–60% relative humidity and 21–26°C dry bulb temperature), temperatures can be attained to improve indoor thermal comfort.

Tests were conducted for a phase change material with a melting point of 25°C for varying air flow rates and air temperature. The PCM was encapsulated in aluminium casing providing good thermal contact between the PCM and air.

Region outage is one of distribution system and most of time caused by weather or a fault in transmission lines. The process of delivering energy is production, transmission and distribution; we focus on distribution process in this paper because in default transmission or in islanding case we have to power the majority of loads in the islanded zone during outage. Design/methodology/approach - Smart Grid is based on the evolution of IT communication technologies and the integrating of distributed generation and the integration of end users in the production of energy in the existing electrical grid and the bi-directional communication ensured in distribution network, we can distribute energy smartly or response emergencies demands. In this paper we propose an autonomous power distribution network through dynamic selection model using islanded micro grid context parameters and based on renewable resources like solar panel, wind turbine and storage batteries Findings - Smart loads selection is done through an intelligent controller who detects outage, collects information from different controllers and sensors, Analyze data and makes decisions for execution by controllers or actuators installed in different entities in the islanded microgrid. The result of our algorithm is a new distribution network that power the entities elected by our emergency operation program. An algorithm is developed to implement our approach with some distribution simulation to discuss and analyze results. Originality/value - Smart distribution network concept in outage condition is to increase consumer service quality, propose a solution to resolve shortage outage problem in a regular intervals, to response the maximum of demand and have a continuous power supply during outage duration by analyzing context parameters and make decisions. The objective is to make an efficient decision to manage distribution power during outage. © IAEME Publication","Context-Aware; Demands; Distributed Generations Resources; Distribution Network; Distribution Planning; Efficiency; Emergency; Loads; Micro Grid; Outage; Smart Grid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058094729

While starch digestibility has been characterized at some detail, studies on protein digestibility are still scarce. This work considered maize tortillas prepared from masa made with industrial and traditional nixtamalized flours to characterize the effect of the preparation method and storage time (up to 4 days). Protein content was slightly higher (8.5%) for artisanal tortilla than for industrial tortilla (7.4%), an effect caused by stringent nixtamalization under industrial and semi-industrial conditions. Tortilla made with artisanal methods exhibited increased hardness (2.14 N) and reduced adhesiveness (0.44 mJ) compared with its counterpart made with industrial flour (0.9 N and 0.41 mJ). FTIR analysis of Amide I group revealed that protein of artisanal tortilla had a lower amount (11.7%) of β formations (sheets and turns) as compared to tortilla made with industrial flour (27.5%). Protein digestibility of fresh tortilla was higher for artisanal method (∼89.0%) than for industrial method (∼84.0%). Also, protein digestibility decreased linearly with storage time, with artisanal tortilla presenting the lowest decreasing rate (∼0.5%/day). These results suggest that maize-based staple foods with improved nutritional values can be produced using artisanal methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digestibility; Maize tortillas; Protein secondary structure; Texture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056004508

HPMT resulted immediately after treatment in an increase in PPO activity up to 66.50% at 200 MPa and 45 °C compared with the untreated samples. The reaction order (nth) of PPO thermal inactivation was 1.951 (0.1 MPa, 50–60 °C) and 0.953 for the HPMT treatment (200–600 MPa, 25–45 °C). Fractional kinetic models were applied in PPO thermal (~89% labile fraction, 11% stabile fraction) and HPMT inactivation (up to ~67% stabile fraction at 200 MPa, 25 °C). The activation energy estimated for the thermal inactivation in 50–60 °C range at 0.1 MPa was 148.26 kJ/mol, while for the HPMT inactivation varied from 82.31 kJ/mol at 300 MPa to 226.16 kJ/mol at 500 MPa. A third order polynomial model described the PPO inactivation by HPMT. Practical application: Inactivation of polyphenoloxidase (PPO), enzyme responsible for browning is a mandatory condition for maintaining quality of the processed fruits. As this enzyme is generally known to display variable thermal and/or barostability, depending on the type of food matrix, kinetic data are required to optimize the processing parameters. The data on peach puree PPO and the models provided in the current study could help producers to identify the optimum peach processing condition necessary for the inactivation of PPO by high pressure-mild thermal treatment, leading to the extension of puree shelf life. However, methods for limitation of the oxygen presence in the peach puree mixtures should also be employed during processing and storage. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Activation energy; Digital storage; Enzymes; Fruits; Heat treatment; Kinetics; Reaction kinetics; Fractional kinetic models; Inactivation kinetics; Labile fractions; Polyphenol oxidase; Processing condition; Processing parameters; Thermal and high-pressure processing; Thermal inactivation; Thermal processing (foods)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054405778

The specimens were investigated under two states: (a) untreated (as cast) and (b) solution treated to 1100 °C. Dynamic flexural behavior was examined by means of three-point-bending tests performed with a dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA), and structural analysis was done by x-ray diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy; DMA tests were performed under two variants: (a) temperature scans, between − 150 and 400 °C and (b) isothermal strain sweeps, up to 0.15% strain amplitudes. The former emphasized the critical temperatures of thermally induced reversible martensitic transformation and antiferromagnetic–paramagnetic phase transition, while the latter enabled to monitor the storage modulus increase due to the work hardening caused by dynamic bending. Strain sweeps tests revealed the effects of both dynamic bending frequency and number of cycles. The largest work hardening effect, obtained after five strain sweep cycles applied at the frequency of 5 Hz, was associated with the finest distribution of precipitated carbides, observed by differential scanning calorimetry and the formation of slip micro-bands, illustrated on OM micrographs and SEM energy dispersion spectroscopy maps. © 2018, ASM International.","DMA; internal friction; manganese steel; storage modulus; work hardening","Carbides; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dispersion hardening; Elastic moduli; Internal friction; Martensitic transformations; Scanning electron microscopy; Steel; Strain hardening; Critical temperatures; Dynamic three point bending; Hardening capacities; Manganese steel; Paramagnetic phase transitions; Reversible martensitic transformation; Three-point bending test; Work hardening behaviors; Bending tests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054177137

The modified discrete Davydov model is first reduced to a space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, followed by the stability analysis of its plane wave solution. The phenomenon is also known as modulational instability and relies on the appropriate balance between nonlinearity and dispersion. The fractional-order parameter (σ), related to the long-range coupling strength, is found to reduce the instability domain, especially in the case 1 ≤ σ < 2. Beyond that interval, i.e., σ > 2, the fractional NLS reduces to the classical cubic NLS equation, whose dispersion coefficient depends on σ.

The proposed methodology is used to efficiently regulate the power flow from renewable resources into the utility grid, to supply energy to loads, and to storage energy. Simulation results are presented to assess the performance of the proposed controller for a case study dc microgrid, where its adequate operation depends on the dc bus voltage regulation; hence, for guaranteeing such voltage regulation through the converter (inverter) connected to the utility grid, the optimal control scheme is in addition combined with a super-twisting controller (a robust sliding mode-based control technique) to enhance the inverter control strategy robustness. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","microgrids; Nonlinear optimal control; power converters; super-twisting control","Controllers; Dynamic programming; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Power converters; Robust control; State feedback; Voltage regulators; Dc-bus voltage regulations; Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation; Micro grid; Non-linear optimal control; Optimal control scheme; Robust non-linear controls; State-feedback optimal controllers; Super twisting controls; Power control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053497014

Historical skarn tailings at Yxsjöberg, Sweden, containing e.g. Be, Bi, Cu, F, Sn, S, W, and Zn were geochemically characterized as a first step to evaluate the environmental impact and the potential to re-mine the tailings. The tailings were deposited between 1897 and 1963 in the Smaltjärnen Repository without dams or a complete cover, and have been in contact with the atmosphere for &gt;30 years. Four vertical cores throughout the tailings were taken and divided into 134 subsamples, which were analyzed for total concentrations and paste pH. Selected samples from different depths were mineralogically characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Minerals, hand-picked from drilled rock cores, were analyzed for the element content, and a modified Element to Mineral Conversion (EMC) that pinpoints the quantitative distribution of elements between the minerals in the tailings was carried out. The average concentrations of Be, Bi, Cu, Sn, Zn, W, F and S in the tailings were 284, 495, 946, 559, 301, and 960 ppm, and 1.9 and 1.2 wt%, respectively. The tailings has reached a late stage development due to pyrrhotite oxidation resulting in low pH (&lt;4) in the uppermost tailings, and formations of secondary minerals such as gypsum, hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) and orthogonal calcite. Secondary pyrite and magnetite, formed from monoclinic pyrrhotite was detected, and different weathering rates of secondary pyrite, hexagonal and monoclinic pyrrhotite was indicated, with secondary pyrite as the most stable and monoclinic pyrrhotite as the least. The rare and easily-weathered mineral danalite (Fe4Be3(SiO4)3S) was found in the drilled rock cores and by XRD in the tailings. However, the mineral could not be found by optical microscopy or SEM-EDS. This suggests that the mineral has been weathered to a great extent, which poses a high risk of releasing elements of potential concern to the groundwater since danalite contains approximately 40% of the total Be and Zn concentrations in the tailings. Fluorine was mainly found in fluorite, Cu in chalcopyrite, and Bi in bismuthinite; which all showed signs of weathering in acidic condition in the uppermost part, subsequent with decreased concentrations, followed by accumulation peaks deeper down in the tailings correlated with Al. Tungsten was mainly found in scheelite; most grains were unweathered, but a few grains had altered rims or HFO on the mineral surfaces. Tin was mainly found in ferrohornblende, hedenbergite and grossular. Beryllium, Cu, F, and Zn has high potential to be released to the surrounding environment from the Smaltjärnen Repository, while W, Bi and Sn are relatively stable in the tailings. Most of the scheelite is intact and re-mining could, therefore, be a suitable remediation method that would both reduce the environmental impact and simultaneously support the supply of critical raw materials in the EU. © 2018",,"Calcite; Copper; Copper compounds; Core drilling; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fluorspar; Groundwater; Infill drilling; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Ore deposits; Pyrites; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur compounds; Tungstate minerals; Weathering; X ray diffraction; Zinc; Critical raw materials; Distribution of element; Elevated concentrations; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Geochemical characterization; Hydrous ferric oxides; Raman vibrational spectroscopy; Surrounding environment; Environmental impact; concentration (composition); copper; fluorine; geochemical method; ore deposit; skarn; tailings; tungsten; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053199965

However, the appropriate diameter and external structure of CNTs are crucial for the efficient encapsulation. Moreover, the low-cost encapsulation techniques for large-scale production are still required. In this work, ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2) has been chosen as a guest molecule to be encapsulated in CNTs since it is a relatively stable compound and used for a wide range of chemical and biological systems. Encapsulation of ferrocene in CNTs was carried out using low-temperature solution processing based on a capillary filling technique. The influence of surface environment, diameter, and length of the nanotubes on the encapsulation yield has been investigated. We show that even using simple encapsulation processes, ferrocene can be encapsulated inside the nanotubes when the encapsulation was performed under the suitable encapsulation conditions.

The common approach in these studies, regarding the assessment of the impact of the variability and related balancing assets, is by showing yearly aggregates (or longer) of results based on a variety of indicators. Although significant, these studies often lack in temporal details. This paper therefore focuses on the dynamics between load, generation, marginal cost and assets for balancing the generation variability, within a variety of typical days in a fully-integrated European power market. This is done by assessments of daily snapshots based on an hourly time resolution. The assessments underline the necessity of balancing assets, both during peaks as well as during lows in the output of variable generators. Interconnection capacity, electricity storage and demand response (DR) applications all contribute to renewables integration and to optimized utilization of cost-efficient generation capacity throughout the European power system. Important load flows from and towards load centers with high capacities of variable renewables are identified, as well as a significant role for transit countries with high interconnection capacities between these load centers. Despite the importance of electricity storage, it is shown that the traditional diurnal utilization of centralized electricity storage fleets becomes less viable with increasing penetration of variable renewables. A potential high CO2 price in the future European power market can become a determining factor in the system dynamics. Large price differentials in the merit order stimulate long distance flows as well as an increasing profitability for storage assets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artelys Crystal Super Grid; European power system; Integrated energy market; Power system modelling; Variable renewables","Electric energy storage; Power markets; System theory; Energy markets; Power System; Power system modelling; Renewables; Super grids; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052136773

The OLCs prove to be ideal candidates for the development of solid-state sensing technology of hydrogen working at room temperature, due to their hydrophobic nature and their non-porous texture. Using dielectrophoreis as a method of electromanipulation, the OLCs undergo ultrasonication in ethanol and, according to the analysis results through the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of OLC/C2H6O nanoparticles showed significant structural changes compared to the pristine OLCs. The fullerene C60 nanoparticles exposed to ethanol can present several solvation shells around the central fullerene molecule, and in the first layer of the solvation shell, ethanol molecules tend to form non-polar alkyl groups exposed to the surface, which contributes to the stimulation of structural defects of the OLC layers. The fast decrease in resistance of the OLC/C2H6O sensor under 10 ppm H2 exposure can be attributed to the switch of the nanoparticles to n-type semiconductor behaviour together with the additional increase in the number of electrons in the conduction band. Countless carbon-based sensing devices were previously reported, but the major drawback of these solutions was the irreversible response to hydrogen because of the high energy required by the adsorbed binding molecules to desorb from the material at low working temperatures. The sensor presented exploits the binding capacity of hydrogen to OLCs/C2H6O, as demonstrated by the previously proposed hydrogen storage solutions based on these fullerenes. In order to ensure sensors enhanced operability at room temperature current, stimulated desorption was used to stimulate desorption of the analyte molecules in the absence of an external heating source. © 2018, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","electrostimulated desorption; Hydrogen sensor; interdigitated electrode; onion-like carbons","Binding energy; Chemical sensors; Desorption; Ethanol; Fullerenes; Molecules; Nanoparticles; Solvation; Fourier transform infrared; Hydrogen sensor; Inter-digitated electrodes; Irreversible response; N-type semiconductors; Onion-like carbon; Stimulated desorption; Working temperatures; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051640916

The TSA process consists of interconnected multi-stage fluidized bed columns and utilizes solid amine sorbents for selective adsorption of CO2. The simulation tool has been developed in the process simulation software IPSEpro™ and performs mass- and energy balance calculations that are based on a suitable adsorption equilibrium model. Changes of the adsorbent CO2 loadings and the corresponding heating or cooling requirements are calculated for the individual fluidized bed stages of the adsorber and desorber column. The adsorption equilibrium calculations have been performed, using a Langmuir model that was fitted to CO2 adsorption data of an amine functionalized solid sorbent material. Within this work, the qualitative impact of the regeneration temperature and the stripping gas feeding rate on the overall process performance has been studied. Furthermore, the feasibility for integration of a high temperature compression heat pump (HP) has been assessed. The HP recovers heat from the adsorber to drive adsorbent regeneration within the desorber.

They consume currently roughly 3% of all the electricity produced globally and are expected to only increase their consumption as the world becomes more connected and digitalized. As data centers are required to operate without any interruptions, they use power protection systems and energy storages. This paper investigates the technical and economic feasibility of dual-purposing these power protection systems, the uninterruptible power supplies, and their batteries in data centers to perform primary frequency regulation services. While the topic of data centers and demand response has been extensively covered in the current scientific literature, the focus has been on the demand response enabled by server workload shifting or hardware-enabled peak shaving. Based on an extensive literature review, there is a knowledge gap in the literature concerning primary frequency regulation and dynamic response enabled by modern power electronics systems in data centers. In this paper, this knowledge gap is bridged by suggesting a novel approach of taking advantage of the bidirectional operations capabilities of the uninterruptible power supply systems, thereby enabling them to provide dynamic power response from their battery systems. The feasibility of this approach is examined with the proposed method, which includes (1) an analysis of the required energy for primary regulation and the availability of this energy in a typical data center, (2) a simulation of activation events and their impact on the service life of the battery systems, (3) reaction speed and reliability considerations of the operations, and (4) an economic feasibility and balancing market analysis. The results show that as primary frequency regulation is an energy nonintensive service and data center battery systems are by design oversized for redundancy reasons, typical data centers have more than ample amounts of energy to participate in the primary regulation without jeopardizing their own processes. The results also show that by maintaining reasonable levels of usage, the battery systems can be operated within their specifications, and the demand response operations will not cause premature aging of the battery systems. The reaction speed of the power electronics is found to be very high and easily meet the current market requirements. While the achievable revenue from the primary regulation service is small compared for example with the electricity costs of the data centers, it is still significant as there is little to no impact on the daily business of the data centers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Data center; Demand response; Primary frequency regulation; Smart grid; UPS","Activation analysis; Commerce; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Power electronics; Reliability analysis; Uninterruptible power systems; Battery; Data centers; Demand response; Primary frequency regulation; Smart grid; Electric power system protection; design method; dynamic response; electricity generation; feasibility study; fuel cell; global perspective; literature review; operations technology; simulation; smart grid; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050739764

As opposed to first-generation carbon capture concepts, CLC does not include a gas separation step and thus offers the advantage of having no thermodynamic energy penalty in the capture process. Manganese-containing oxygen carriers have been shown to offer a good compromise of gas conversion performance, availability, and cost. On the other hand, previously tested manganese materials have often been challenged with high attrition in continuous CLC. By sintering the ore prior to its use as oxygen carrier, the structure of the particles can be reinforced to increase their durability in the process. In this study, a sintered manganese ore was tested for 56 h in two pilot units of different size. The oxygen carrier worked well in the process, was easily fluidized, and did not exhibit any tendency towards agglomeration. Compared to other manganese materials tested in the same units, a higher lifetime based on fines production was reached, while gas conversion performance was similar. Different biomass fuels, mainly biochar of different sizes and black wood pellets, were employed in the study. A clear correlation between gas conversion and the fuel volatile content was detected; this is consistent with results reported in previous studies. The highest gas conversion reached in both units was ∼93.5% using wood char. The highest carbon capture efficiency, 99% and 100% in the 10- and 100-kW unit, respectively, was reached with black pellets. To compare the tested material with the state-of-the-art oxygen carrier ilmenite, some tests were conducted with a bituminous coal that had been used in the same pilot with ilmenite. The results indicate a higher conversion performance for the tested manganese material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BECCS; Carbon capture and storage; Chemical looping combustion; Oxygen carriers; Solid fuel combustion","Bituminous coal; Carbon capture; Coal combustion; Fluidization; Fuel storage; Gases; Ilmenite; Metal fuels; Metals; Ore analysis; Oxygen; Pelletizing; Redox reactions; Sintering; Wood fuels; BECCS; Capture efficiency; Chemical looping combustion; Metal oxide particles; Oxygen Carrier; Solid fuel combustion; Thermodynamic energy; Volatile contents; Particle size analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047067580

Methodology: Specimens were prepared to evaluate setting time (n = 6 for each group, specimen dimensions 10 × 8 × 5 mm), solubility (n = 6 for each group, specimen dimension 20 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick) after 1 and 28 days, pH (n = 10 for each group, specimen dimensions 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick) after 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days and surface roughness (n = 10 for each group, specimen dimensions 4 mm in diameter and 3 mm high) after 28 days when cements were cured at 95% humidity or immersed in saline or HBSS at 37 °C. The powder and liquid were mechanically mixed by an amalgamator. The set materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy-dispersive analysis. Statistical comparisons were employed using one-way anova. The level of significance was set at P = 0.05. Results: Setting time was significantly shorter when cements were cured at 95% humidity compared to those in saline (P < 0.001) and HBSS (P < 0.001). Setting time of MTA+ was significantly shorter than that of ProRoot MTA (P < 0.001), which had a significantly higher pH than MTA+ (P < 0.05) for all periods and immersion liquids. After immersion in saline, MTA+ was significantly less soluble than ProRoot MTA (P < 0.001); when immersed in HBSS, no significant difference was found (P = 1.00). The surface roughness of both cements was affected when exposed to HBSS (P < 0.001 for both cements) and saline (P < 0.001 for both cements). Storage in HBSS created a homogenous surface; incubation in saline or humidity created a biphasic surface. The main crystalline phases in both cements were tricalcium silicate, bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide. Conclusions: MTA+ had a shorter setting time than ProRoot MTA, promoted lower pH and had lower solubility in saline.

Consequently, contemporary improvement efforts on memory technologies are focusing more on the energy-efficiency aspects, which has resulted in biased CMOS SRAM cells that increase energy efficiency by favoring one logical value over another. In this paper, xor-masking, a method for exploiting such contemporary low power SRAM memories is proposed to improve the energy-efficiency of instruction fetching. Xor-masking utilizes static program analysis statistics to produce optimal encoding masks to reduce the occurrence of the more energy consuming instruction bit values in the fetched instructions. The method is evaluated on LatticeMico32, a small RISC core popular in ultra low power designs, and on a wide instruction word high performance low power DSP. Compared to the previous “bus invert” technique typically used with similar SRAMs, the proposed method reduces instruction read energy consumption of the LatticeMico32 by up to 13% and 38% on the DSP core. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Asymmetric SRAM; Energy optimization; Instruction fetch; Low-power processors","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy utilization; Static random access storage; Asymmetric SRAM; Energy optimization; Instruction fetch; Low power processors; Programmable processors; Static program analysis; Thermal dissipation; Ultra-low power design; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045895694

The composition of the samples was determined using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The particle size estimated from HRTEM, FESEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the samples were in the nanoscale range. The magnetic hysteresis loop of the samples was measured at room temperature (300 K) and at low temperatures (200 and 100 K). Rare behavior by shifting the hysteresis loop horizontally was observed for AgCrO2 delafossite at low temperatures (200 and 100 K). The optical properties were measured for the investigated samples.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was divided into monitoring of the performance of the electrical energy consumptions and ambient conditions of the hot water heating technologies without isotherm blanket installation and with isotherm blanket installation. Findings: The results reveal that the average standby thermal energy loss of the geyser without the installation of an isotherm blanket was 2.5 kWh. And this standby loss can be reduced to over 18.5 per cent by just installing a 40-mm thick isotherm blanket on the tank. The statistical tests show a significant mean difference in the group electrical energy consumed to compensate for the standby losses under both scenarios. In contrast, the average standby thermal energy losses for the split- and integrated-type ASHP water heaters were 1.33 kWh and 0.92 kWh, respectively. There was a reduction of 15.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in the electrical energy consumed in compensating for standby losses for both the split and integrated types, respectively, but there was no significant mean difference in the standby losses under both scenarios for the two systems. Again, without any loss of generality, the electrical energy factor of both the ASHP water heaters decreased upon installation of the isotherm blanks. Research limitations/implications: The experiments were conducted only for a 150-L geyser and 150-L split- and integrated-type ASHP water heaters. The category of the different types of ASHP water heaters was limited to one because of the cost implication. Practical implications: The experiments were not conducted with various hot water storage tanks installed in different positions (roof, inside or outside of a building wall, etc.) so that actual real-life observations could be obtained. The challenges of easy disassembling and deployment of systems and DAS to different positions were also a real concern. Social implications: The findings can help homeowners and ESCO in deciding whether to install isotherm blankets on storage tanks of ASHP water heaters on the basis of the impact of standby losses and its potential viability. Originality/value: The experimental design and methodology are the first of its kind to be conducted in South Africa. The results and interpretation were obtained from original data collected from a set of experiments conducted. The findings also show that the installation of isotherm blanket on an electric geyser can result in a significant mean reduction in the standby losses. In contrast, an installation of the isotherm blankets on the storage tanks of ASHP water heaters can reduce the standby losses, but there exists no significant mean difference. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ASHP-Air source heat pump; Isotherm blanket; Multiple comparison tests; Significant mean difference; Standby thermal energy losses","Air source heat pumps; Cylinders (shapes); Digital storage; Electric losses; Geysers; Heating; Installation; Isotherms; Statistical tests; Thermal energy; Water; Water heaters; Ambient conditions; Design/methodology/approach; Heating technology; Hot water storage tanks; Multiple comparison test; Multiple-comparison procedures; Real-life observations; Significant mean difference; Water tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055191632

One of the parameters to compare costs of energy across various technologies is levelised cost of energy (LCOE), but it has been conventional practice to neglect the external costs in estimating the LCOE of power generation technologies. Furthermore, as LCOE is a critical indicator for policy and decision makers, there is a need to juxtapose actual costs of renewable and conventional power generation technologies. This research paper attempts to internalise some of these external and GHG emission costs across various power generation and storage technologies in all the G20 countries, as they account for 85% of global power consumption. As future investment decisions are largely influenced by costs, estimates in this research prove renewables and storage to be far cheaper than fossil and nuclear sources by 2030, even without considering external costs. The myth that renewables are ‘way too expensive’ has been debunked repeatedly, and the cost decline of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies have outpaced most industry expectations. The results of this research not only substantiate this trend, but also statistically display that all the G20 countries have the opportunity to decrease their energy costs significantly, between now and 2030. Renewable energy technologies offer the lowest LCOE ranges across G20 countries in 2030. Utility-scale solar PV generally shows the lowest values ranging from 16 to 117 €/MWhel and onshore wind LCOE range is from 16 to 90 €/MWhel. Rooftop solar PV generally offers the next lowest LCOE ranging from 31 to 126 €/MWhel, followed by LCOE of offshore wind power ranging from 64 to 135 €/MWhel. Solar PV and battery systems are highly competitive on an LCOE basis at utility-scale ranging from 21 to 165 €/MWhel and at residential scale from 40 to 204 €/MWhel. The G20, as well as other countries, can continue to develop their economies in a sustainable manner, along with substantial co-benefits in adjacent policy fields such as higher national welfare, better health of citizens, lower respective health costs and improved energy security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","External costs; Group of Twenty (G20); Levelised cost of energy (LCOE); Renewable energy","Cost estimating; Decision making; Economics; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Solar power generation; Wind power; Electricity generation cost; External costs; Group of Twenty (G20); Levelised cost of energies; Power generation technology; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaic technology; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051786093

Zero current switching, assisted with the leakage inductance of the isolation transformer, can be achieved at the current-fed side along with zero voltage switching of the VF side, assisted by snubber or intrinsic capacitances of the transistors. Soft switching can be maintained over a wide range of voltage and power levels, regardless of the energy transfer direction.

Real-life examples of highly renewable and sustainable island energy systems can be found all over the World. Islands on small geographic proximity provide the potential for the development of 100% renewable island energy systems by exploiting their grid interconnections. This paper proposes that interconnections of a group of islands can be used to integrate the production from locally available renewable energy sources. Besides interconnection, electric vehicles were used as a demand response technology to provide storage for electrical energy from variable sources. Electric vehicles were connected to the grid using smart charging systems (vehicle-to-grid). In addition, stationary batteries were explored in sub-scenarios for the year 2035. This enabled to analyse the influence of the battery location through two main different scenarios, i.e. one big central battery and several smaller distributed batteries. Scenarios with different integration dynamic of variable renewable energy sources and electrical vehicles were modelled with EnergyPLAN model, while the interconnection analysis was carried out with the MultiNode tool expansion. The results showed that the interconnections increased the share of energy from renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption and declined the total critical excess electricity production, while vehicle to grid technology enabled exploitation of synergies between sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","EnergyPLAN; Interconnection; MultiNode; Renewable energy sources; Sustainable island systems","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Integrated circuit interconnects; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Electricity production; EnergyPLAN; Grid interconnections; Integration of renewable energies; Interconnection; MultiNode; Renewable energy source; Variable renewable energies; Electric power system interconnection; alternative energy; demand-side management; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy use; island state; simulation; storage structure; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053142580

These particles are generally excellent conductors of heat and electricity and when dispersed in a continuous medium influence dramatically the transport properties of the heterogeneous material by forming a percolating network. Numerous theories exist to predict key parameters such as particle concentration at the percolation threshold and transport properties at concentrations beyond the threshold. The microstructure formed by connecting particles in the material is an important determinant toward such parameters but often requires complex numerical models to resolve. In this paper, we present an analytical, probabilistic model capturing the microstructure of a system of randomly positioned, soft-core, cylindrical particles with a finite aspect ratio, valid at arbitrary particle concentration. Our analytical framework allows for the calculation of the particle contact number distribution and percolation probability of the particle system. We show that our analytical model is more accurate than excluded volume theory for predicting the percolation threshold for spherocylinders of finite aspect ratios, and agrees well with the corresponding numerical results. Our theory describes the percolating network topology above the percolation threshold and can serve as the foundation for analytical composition-structure-property relationships for heterogeneous materials with conducting cylindrical particles. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Electric energy storage; Heat transfer; Microstructure; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Probability distributions; Solvents; Transport properties; Yarn; Composition structure; Cylindrical particles; Electrochemical energy storage; Heterogeneous materials; Particle concentrations; Percolation probability; Percolation thresholds; Probabilistic modeling; Aspect ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054894446

The effects of surface coating using wax extracted from cabbage leaf (CB-Wax), and storage temperature on water vapour and gaseous exchange properties of fresh okra were investigated. CB-wax was prepared by immersion of outer cabbage leaves in dichloromethane solvent for 15 hr at ambient temperatures and stored in a dried form. The extract was mixed with ethanol for coating the intact okra surface through brushing. CB-Wax coated okra were kept in three different temperatures (10, 25 and 35°C) and effective skin permeance to water vapour (effective SPW), respiration rate, and effective skin permeance to CO2 (effective SPC) were studied and compared to those of a non-coated control. Values of effective SPW, respiration, and effective SPC of CB-Wax coated okra were significantly lower than those of non-coated fruit. These values showed temperature dependence where could be described by the Arrhenius model; values of error root mean squares were in a range of 0.001-0.422. However, CB-Wax coated okra apparently were less sensitive to temperature changes compared to non-coated okra as determined by activation of energy estimated from the model using a non-linear regression approach.

We can observe a reduction in consumption of fossil energy resources (gas and oil), and the need of their rational use. Therefore, the creation of its own renewable energy source based on the cultivation and processing of plant bioenergetic raw materials is promising. In many world countries the basis for bioenergy and the most suitable raw material for the production of solid biofuels are perennial grains. Specially grown biomass that can be used for biofuel production has a number of characteristics that differ from traditional fossil fuels. The most important fuel and energy characteristic of raw materials is its calorific value, which depends on a number of factors: the genetic characteristics of the crop, the content of cellulose, pectin, polymer and phenolic resins; humidity; conditions of growing and storage of raw materials.

The system selected a single-effect absorption cooling system has a cooling capacity of 7 kW and working with both hot storage tank in the solar collection loop and cold storage tank in the load loop. A transient system modular computer program has been developed for the cooling system to predict optimal operating conditions of the cooling system working in combination with thermal storage tanks. In this cycle, the hot storage tank is used to store the extra energy and thus to be used to operate the absorption system after the sunset. A cold storage tank is used to store the extra coolant water to cool the building at night time. The building area is 40 m2 and its load is calculated hourly in the steady region of Tikrit University, north of Iraq. The thermal storage tanks volume (cold and hot) ranges (0.2 to 1.25 m3) and this is done for an area range (10 to 30 m2) of parabolic concentric trough collector.

However, a theoretical study is necessary to give a more elaborate investigation of the electronic and optical properties since the role of the heterostructures is still deficient. Furthermore, no first-principles studies have been reported on 2D thermoelectric heterostructures comprising of MgAgAs, 2D-TiC and 2D-Mo2TiC material. Our calculated electronic results show no bandgap induction in the heterostructures compared to pure intermetallic MgAgAs, 2D-TiC and 2D-Mo2TiC material, which favours the separation and transfer of charge carriers and visible-light-driven activity. Based on the analysis of the electronic properties, band structure, projected density of state and spin-polarised contributions from the spin-down and spin-up eigenstates, the Mo2TiC–MgAgAs–Mo2TiC layer was found to have improved conductivity at the infrared region. This makes the electrons move easily from the surface of the thermoelectric material once generated and stored in the heterostructures. The proposed theoretical design offers a new way for the effective and large-scale fabrication of 2D-based thermoelectric materials for application in solar energy conversion and storage. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Density functional theory; Electronic; Intermetallic; Optical; Thermoelectric",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054661525

The confinement of the H2 molecule in GeNTs in both cases showed that the confinement energy is large for the smallest diameter, but it becomes close to zero for larger diameters. The main difference with respect to carbon nanotubes is the disappearance of H-H bond activation due to the absence of interactions between the π electrons and the hydrogen atoms. Compared to the BNNTs, we noted elongation of the H-H bond in both orientations for small diameters instead of breaking or shortening. This elongation is due to the strong interaction between the van der Waals radius of hydrogen and the atomic radius of germanium. This leads to a strong attraction between germanium and hydrogen for both orientations. This situation engenders a significant polarization. The most important consequence of the existence of this induced dipole moment is the IR activation of the H-H stretching vibration, which becomes very intense and whose value depends on the diameter of the nanotube. As an application, this vibration frequency can be used to detect and assay H2 contained in nanotubes or deduce the diameter of the host tube. This result shows that it is possible to detect H2 molecules inside GeNTs as well as in CNTs and BNNTs. However, in the germanium nanotubes, the most remarkable result that emerges from this study is that it is possible to detect and clearly differentiate the orientation of the H2 molecule inside the nanotubes, in contrast to other types of nanotubes. © 2018","Boron nitrogen nanotubes; Carbon nanotubes; Germanium nanotubes; H-H bond activation; Van der Waals interactions","Atoms; Chemical activation; Germanium; Hydrogen; Molecules; Stretching; Van der Waals forces; Yarn; Confinement energy; H-H bond activation; Induced dipole moments; Stretching vibrations; Strong interaction; Van Der Waals interactions; Van der Waals radius; Vibration frequency; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054630078

The synthesized samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy. The UV–Visible absorption spectra showed a redshift with the increase in cobalt doping content in MgO host lattice while corresponding bandgap energy of cobalt doped MgO-NPs was decreased with the increase of doping concentration. The XRD patterns revealed the formation of rock salt MgO phase nanostructures. The Rietveld analysis revealed the formation of impurity phase (Co3O4), which was remarkably appear at higher doping concentration (x = 0.12). Rietveld refinement was utilized to investigate the individual influences of coherent domain sizes and lattice strain on the peak broadening of the pure and cobalt doped MgO-NPs. The coherent domain size increased from 7.44 nm to 8.11 nm with increasing Co doping amount up to x = 0.06. The strain decreased with increasing in cobalt content. The decreasing trend in lattice constant “a” was observed with increasing doping concentration which confirms the incorporation of Co ions into the MgO host lattice. Furthermore, the linear and planar defects were also considered. First-principles calculations based on DFT were employed to determine elastic constants for the pure and doped MgO. These values were then used in combination with X-ray diffraction data to measure stacking fault energies as a function of doping concentration. The results showed that the stacking fault energy decreased as the doping concentration increase. The formation enthalpy and bonding properties of the studied compounds were also inspected. Further, the magnetic features of Co monodoping and (Co, Mg or O vacancy) co-doping in MgO host lattice were studied. The results reveal that the studied compounds may have potential applications in spintronics and magnetic data storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Calculations; Differential thermal analysis; Digital storage; Magnesia; Magnetic storage; Nanoparticles; Precipitation (chemical); Rietveld analysis; Rietveld refinement; Stacking faults; Synthesis (chemical); X ray diffraction; Coprecipitation method; Differential thermal analyses (DTA); First-principles calculation; Magnesium oxide nanoparticles; Stacking fault energies; Synthesis and characterizations; Theoretical investigations; Visible absorption spectra; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054606067

Although some few polymerization reactions cannot be performed in dispersed media, new polymerization reactions can still benefit from advantages of heterophase reactions, which are fast kinetics due to high local concentration of reagents and advantageous heat exchange. We describe here advances in heterophase polymerizations, with a focus on miniemulsion polymerization, which are mainly driven by academic interest for biomedicine and energy science. Click-reactions in dispersion are particularly interesting because they are bioorthogonals. Synthesis of highly crosslinked polymer colloids, especially with conjugated polymers, has found applications in gas storage, catalysis, and production of energy.

Among other ones, the power sharing is one of the major problems in a microgrid that leads to the voltage and frequency limits violation and increased losses. This paper demonstrates that the voltage source converter (VSC) can extend its role of interfacing renewable sources to a new role of performing a high dynamic response as a generating unit of the microgrid. A Laplace model of the power converter is presented, which allows to analyze the converter behaviour in supporting the grid. The application of the converter to a weak microgrid is also presented to validate the proper behaviour of the power plant as a generation unit of the microgrid. The approach in controlling the converter operation is based on vector control implemented in a rotating reference frame handling the control variables in the dq domain. The VSC along with its controller is used in this paper to contribute the active and reactive power to stabilize the frequency and the voltage of the grid within the permissible limit. © 2018, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Microgrid; Reactive power; Renewable sources; Thevenin impedance; Voltage source converter","Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Active and Reactive Power; Micro grid; Power electronic devices; Renewable sources; Rotating reference frame; Thevenin impedance; Voltage Source Converter (VSC); Voltage source converters; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053270834

Setting: Laboratory evaluations at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel and the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel and the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel. Design: Experimental study. Method: Human donor corneolimbal rings were divided into fragments that were stored in commercial storage media with or without the addition of 10 mM ROCK inhibitor for 1 week and were then exposed to phacoemulsification energy. Samples were dissociated into single cells by trypsin digestion and CECs were targeted using the antihuman CD166 antibody, a new biomarker. The CEC survival was evaluated for early and late apoptosis rate with flow cytometric analysis of annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Results: Six corneoscleral rings from 4 donors were studied. After phacoemulsification, CEC exposed to ROCK inhibitor demonstrated a 37.06% reduction in early apoptosis rate (29.36% ± 4.33% [SD] versus 46.65% ± 1.51%, P =.006) and 45.27% reduction in late apoptosis rate (17.6% ± 16.81% versus 32.16% ± 26.30%, P =.007), compared with controls. Subsequently, ROCK levels in apoptotic CECs were significantly lower in cells incubated with ROCK inhibitor than the control medium. Conclusions: In this ex vivo study, ROCK inhibitor reduced endothelial loss and thus, could be used to limit or slow down CEC loss. Rho-associated kinase inhibitor might be used before cataract surgery, especially in high risk patients. This might be a promising new method for preventing pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. © 2018 ASCRS and ESCRS",,"4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; antibody; biological marker; Rho kinase; trypsin; 4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; ALCAM protein, human; amide; biological marker; enzyme inhibitor; fetoprotein; leukocyte antigen; lipocortin 5; nerve cell adhesion molecule; propidium iodide; pyridine derivative; Rho kinase; adult; aged; apoptosis rate; Article; cataract; cell survival; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; cornea endothelium; cornea limbus; cornea transplantation; Descemet membrane; Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty; endothelium cell; enzyme inhibition; ex vivo study; experimental study; eye protection; female; human; human cell; human tissue; male; phacoemulsification; preoperative care; priority journal; sample; apoptosis; cell count; cell culture; cornea endothelium; donor; drug effect; flow cytometry; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; Adult; Aged; Amides; Annexin A5; Antigens, CD; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Cell Count; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Endothelium, Corneal; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Fetal Proteins; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phacoemulsification; Propidium; Pyridines; rho-Associated Kinases; Tissue Donors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052833602

The MPST converts the electric parameters (voltage and current) at which the primary 'harvestings' stage provides energy to the secondary, conditioning, storage, and delivery stage of the module. The magnetic circuit of the MPST is hybrid, made of ferrite and a specially designed and produced magnetic nanofluid (MNF). Some considerations concerning the preparation and general characterization of the used MNF are included. Then, mathematical models and numerical simulation results that were used in the design phase of the MPST are presented. The electromagnetic field is analyzed for static, stationary, and harmonic working conditions, and the lumped, electric circuit parameters of the MPST are computed. The heat transfer analysis for steady-state conditions shows the good thermal stability of the MPST. Finally, some experiments conducted on the pulsewidth modulation-controlled MPST evidence a very good electric behavior of the dc/dc conversion stage of the PV, EH module. © 2018 IEEE.","Finite-element modeling (FEM); inductors and transformers; lumped electric circuit parameters; magnetic nanofluid (MNF); pulsewidth modulation","DC-DC converters; Electric network analysis; Electromagnetic fields; Energy harvesting; Ferrite; Finite element method; Heat transfer; Magnetic circuits; Nanofluidics; Pulse width modulation; Thermodynamic stability; Circuit parameter; DC/DC conversion; Electric behavior; Electric parameters; Heat transfer analysis; Magnetic nanofluid; Planar spirals; Steady-state condition; Electric network parameters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052824634

In this work, three different solar assisted heat pump underfloor heating systems with and without the use of phase change material are designed, simulated and evaluated energetically for a building of 100 m2 floor area. Different kinds of solar collectors (flat plate, photovoltaic, thermal photovoltaic) are coupled to a storage tank which feeds a heat pump for space heating purposes. The PCM is used on the underfloor heating system in order to increase the storage capacity and to avoid the operation of the heat pump during the peak electricity demand period. Furthermore, this work presents and compares the coefficient of performance, the electricity consumption, the solar coverage and the indoor temperature distribution of a building in Athens (Greece), with and without a PCM layer on the floor. More specifically, the PCM is placed on the underfloor heating system and different cases are examined by changing the collecting area, the collector type and the thickness of the insulation layer in the floor. The results prove that the use of the PCM layer on the underfloor heating system reduces the heating load by about 40%. The electricity consumption can be reduced between 42% and 67% using the solar-driven systems. It is also found that the system with the thermal PV consumes the lowest grid electricity. Moreover, the lowest simple payback period is found to be 9.61 years for the system with flat plate collectors without PCM. The simulation is conducted with TRNSYS for all the winter period. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Phase change materials; Solar assisted heat pump; Sustainability; Thermal photovoltaic collector; TRNSYS; Underfloor heating system","Coefficient of performance; Electric power utilization; Floors; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Investments; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar power generation; Space heating; Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Electricity-consumption; Flat-plate collector; Indoor thermal comfort; Peak electricity demand; Photovoltaic collectors; Solar assisted heat pump; TRNSYS; Underfloor heating systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051115823

The indirect solar dryer was designed in the Solar Energy and Environment Laboratory of Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco. It consists of a solar collector, a heat exchanger, a water storage tank and a drying chamber. Results show that during off sunshine hours, the heat transfer from the water storage tank kept the grapes temperature higher than ambient temperature. Drying results indicated that the times required for drying grapes starting at the initial moisture contents of 79.8% (w.b.) till final moisture contents of 20.2% (w.b.) were 120 h and 201 h in indirect solar and open sun drying, respectively.

The present work aims to determine, experimentally, the sorption isotherms of sewage sludge generated at the wastewater treatment plant of Marrakesh city in Morocco by using saturated salt solutions method at different temperatures. The obtained results show that, at constant water activity, the increase in temperature leads to a decrease of the sorption curves. Seven statistical models have been used for modeling and analyzing the experimental data of sorption. The Peleg model seems to be the most appropriate to describe the desorption and adsorption isotherm curves of sewage sludge with the highest value of correlation coefficient.

This paper evaluates two integration alternatives of excess-heat powered CO2 capture at an integrated iron and steel plant using the concept of partial capture. The two sources of CO2 investigated were the blast furnace gas (BFG) and flue gas from the combined heat and power (CHP) plant, representing a high and low level integration alternative, respectively. An amine capture system was simulated in Aspen Plus, and optimized for low energy requirement. To analyze the effects on the iron and steel system and the level of available excess heat, an in-house model was used containing interlinked energy and mass balances of each process step available. The results show that high level integration of CO2 capture gives a lower specific heat demand and improves the overall energy efficiency of the steel plant, resulting in more available heat. For this reason, it is possible to capture 3% more from BFG without any extensive alterations to the plant to recover excess heat. The total available excess heat at the plant will sustain capture of up to 46% of the steel plants total CO2 emissions, and beyond that point steam has to be imported. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Heat recovery; Integrated iron and steel; MEA; Partial capture","Blast furnaces; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Integration; Iron and steel industry; Metal recovery; Power generation; Specific heat; Steelmaking; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Blast furnace gas; Combined heat and power; Energy requirements; High level integrations; Iron and steel; Low-level integration; Overall energy efficiency; Partial capture; Heating; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency; iron and steel industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050729380

The discovery of these enzymes and their role in the course of catalytic conversion of glycogen was rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947. Nowadays, however, thermostable representatives attract special attention due to their vast potential in the enzymatic production of diverse carbohydrates and derivatives such as (functional) oligo- and (non-natural) polysaccharides, artificial starch, glycosides, and nucleotide sugars. One of the most recently explored utilizations of α-GPs is their role in the multi-enzymatic process of energy production stored in carbohydrate biobatteries. Regardless of their use, thermostable α-GPs offer significant advantages and facilitated bioprocess design due to their high operational temperatures.

They are primarily utilized for the synthesis of seed-storage proteins, but also serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and as a source of energy. Here, we aimed at describing the knowledge accumulated in recent years describing the changes occurring in the contents of free amino acids (FAAs) during seed development. Since several essential amino acids are found in low levels in seeds (e.g., Lys, Met, Thr, Val, Leu, Ile and His), or play unique functional roles in seed development (e.g., Pro and the non-proteinogenic γ-aminobutyrate [GABA]), we also briefly describe studies carried out in order to alter their levels in seeds and determine the effects of the manipulation on seed biology. The lion share of these studies highlights strong positive correlations between the biosynthetic pathways of FAAs, meaning that when the levels of a certain amino acid change in seeds, the contents of other FAAs tend to elevate as well. These observations infer a tight regulatory network operating in the biosynthesis of FAAs during seed development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amino acids; Genetic manipulation; Metabolic network; Seed development; Seed maturation; Seed-storage compounds","amino acid; histidine; lysine; methionine; threonine; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant seed; Amino Acids; Histidine; Lysine; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Methionine; Seeds; Threonine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050558388

However, only a few global energy system studies consider the latter. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of single-axis tracking PV on energy scenarios. For this purpose, two scenarios with and without the single-axis tracking option are studied for 100% renewable energy (RE) systems in 2030. To find the optimum energy mix for both scenarios, the total annual cost computed by the LUT Energy System model is minimized. The satellite-based input global data have a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0.45° × 0.45°. Furthermore, a model to estimate the annual yield of single-axis tracking PV is proposed and validated by using the PVsyst software. The simulation results are found to be within a 4% margin to the respective simulation results of PVsyst. Both scenarios demonstrate that a 100% RE system is possible at a low cost, where PV and wind power are the dominating generation technologies. Nevertheless, the results also show a significant effect of single-axis tracking PV. The global generation share of PV increases from 47% to 59%, and 20% of the total electricity is generated by single-axis tracking PV, while the share of wind energy decreases from 31% to 21%. Additionally, curtailment, power transmission requirements, storage demand, and the total cost decrease. The global average levelized cost of electricity decreases by 6% from 54.8 to 51.4 €/MWh.

They are used in image sensors, energy conversion, non-volatile memory, and waveguides applications. Due to these versatilities in the properties, nanostructured thin films of TlInS2 are successfully prepared by thermal evaporation. The average particle size changes due to thermal treatment are examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). A sharp reduction in the average particle size of the pristine nanostructured films is reported upon annealing processes at 423 K and 523 K. Besides, thermal treatment temperatures induce changes in the dispersion parameters viz oscillator energy, dispersion energy, high-frequency dielectric constant and dielectric constant. Of these, only the oscillator energy decreases with the annealing temperatures while all the other parameters increase.

This study addressed the physical stability of hydrophilic and hydrophobic core materials microencapsulated by spray-drying into taro starch spherical aggregates determined from a thermodynamic standpoint via vapor adsorption isotherms. Ascorbic acid and almond oil were used as compound models. Encapsulation efficiency, GAB sorption parameters, differential and integral thermodynamic properties, Gibb's free energy, entropy-enthalpy compensation, spreading pressure, effective diffusion rate, activation energy and critical water activity were determined. The encapsulation efficiency of ascorbic acid and almond oil was 99% and 56%, respectively. Monolayer moisture content was relatively low for ascorbic acid microcapsules. The adsorption process was driven by entropic mechanisms. The physical stability of taro starch spherical aggregates microcapsules with different core material was guaranteed for a range of water activities and temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds; Integral entropy; Starch spherical aggregates; Storage conditions; Thermodynamic properties","Activation energy; Aggregates; Coremaking; Entropy; Free energy; Gas adsorption; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Microencapsulation; Microstructure; Spheres; Spray drying; Starch; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Critical water activity; Encapsulation efficiency; Entropy-enthalpy compensation; Hydrophilic and hydrophobic; Monolayer moisture content; Spherical aggregates; Storage condition; Thermo dynamic analysis; Ascorbic acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048565595

Methods: Mid-coronal flat dentin surfaces were produced on sound third molars, selectively etched with 32% H 3 PO 4 for 3, 5, 10 or 15 s and bonded with a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal, 3 M ESPE: SU). SU in self-etch mode and a three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive were used as control groups. Bonded specimens were stored in deionized water for 24 h and sectioned into beams (cross sectional area of 0.7 mm 2 ). Micro-tensile bond strength test (n = 6) and nanoleakage evaluation were performed immediately, after thermocycling or 6-month storage in artificial saliva. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (n = 6) was performed to determine the residual Ca-content ratio at the hybrid layers and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the micromorphology of the etched dentin surfaces before and after SU application. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test (α = 0.05). Results: Selective dentin etching for 3 s improved the interaction depth of the tested universal adhesive without overexposing demineralized collagen or reducing Ca-content availability at the bonded interface. The improved immediate bond strengths of the selective etching protocol remained significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) after long-term aging producing hybrid layers without significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in silver uptake levels compared to those produced on non-etched dentin. Conclusions: Despite the adjunctive conclusion that universal adhesives used in self-etch mode produce superior long-term dentin bonding compared to the etch-and-rinse mode, selective etching for 3 s with conventionally used H 3 PO 4 improves dentin bonding effectiveness; nonetheless, longer etching times should be strictly avoided. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Calcium; Collagen matrix; Durability; Etch-and-rinse; Nanoleakage; Self-etch","Adhesives; Bond strength (materials); Calcium; Collagen; Deionized water; Digital storage; Durability; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Bonding effectiveness; Collagen matrices; Cross sectional area; Immediate bond strengths; Micro-tensile bond strength; Nanoleakages; Self-etch; Universal adhesives; Etching; adhesive agent; calcium; collagen; deionized water; phosphoric acid; resin; silver; aging; Article; dental etching; dentin; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; human; micromorphology; priority journal; saliva; scanning electron microscopy; third molar; adhesion; adult; dental etching; procedures; tensile strength; young adult; Adhesiveness; Adult; Dental Etching; Dentin; Humans; Tensile Strength; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048519901

Our objective was to evaluate the influence of weight reduction following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on serum cartonectin and vaspin levels. Subjects and Methods: Thirty-two individuals (29 female and 3 male) with morbid obesity underwent LSG. Anthropometric indices, lipid profile, fasting serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, vaspin, and cartonectin were measured prior and 3 months after LSG. Insulin sensitivity was determined using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Results: Following LSG, circulating cartonectin level increased significantly while serum vaspin was significantly decreased. The percentage change of serum cartonectin level correlated negatively with the percentage changes in body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio and positively with percentage changes in LDL-C, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR after adjustment for age and sex. Moreover, the changes in vaspin concentration positively correlated with the changes in insulin level and HOMA-IR after adjustment for age and sex. In a multiple stepwise linear regression model, the changes in waist circumference explained 13% variability of changes in cartonectin level while the changes in HOMA-IR and LDL-C were responsible for 31% of the variability in changes of vaspin level. Conclusion: LSG-induced weight loss rapidly increases serum cartonectin level and decreases the serum vaspin level in morbidly obese subjects. The changes in cartonictin level seem to be influenced by the changes of waist circumference while the changes of HOMA-IR and LDL-C might be determinant factors of the changes in vaspin level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cartonectin; Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; Obesity; Vaspin","adipocytokine; cartonectin; glucose; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; vaspin; C1QTNF3 protein, human; insulin; serine proteinase inhibitor; SERPINA12 protein, human; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; body mass; body weight loss; clinical article; cross-sectional study; female; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; male; morbid obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; adverse event; blood; gastrectomy; insulin resistance; laparoscopy; middle aged; morbid obesity; physiology; postoperative period; preoperative period; procedures; time factor; young adult; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gastrectomy; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Period; Preoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Serpins; Time Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factors; Weight Loss; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047914931

MCC was dispersed within the matrix of jute fibre reinforced epoxy composites to improve the fibre/matrix interface as well as mechanical, dynamic-mechanical and thermal performances. To develop these novel jute/epoxy/MCC hierarchical composites, MCC was first dispersed within an epoxy resin using a short ultrasonication process (1 h) and subsequently, the MCC/epoxy suspensions were infused through jute fabrics using the vacuum infusion technique and cured. Hierarchical composites by dispersing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) within the epoxy resin were also fabricated to compare their performance with MCC based hierarchical composites. Interface (single fibre pull-out test), mechanical (tensile, flexural, izod impact), thermal (thermogravimetric analysis) and dynamic mechanical performances of the developed composites were thoroughly studied. It was observed that the addition of MCC to the epoxy matrix led to a significant increase in the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between jute fibres and the epoxy matrix and consequently, resulted up to 18.4%, 21.5%, 28.3%, 67% and 49.5% improvements in the tensile strength, flexural strength, impact energy, storage and loss moduli, respectively as compared to the neat jute/epoxy composites. The above improvements achieved with MCC were significantly higher as compared to the MWCNT based hierarchical composites developed using the same technique. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic mechanical performance; Hierarchical composites; Interface; Jute; Mechanical properties; Micro-crystalline cellulose","Cellulose; Crystalline materials; Dynamics; Interfaces (materials); Jute fibers; Mechanical properties; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Textile fibers; Thermogravimetric analysis; Yarn; Conventional methods; Dynamic mechanical performance; Fibre-reinforced epoxy; Fibre/matrix interfaces; Hierarchical composite; Interfacial shear strength; Micro-crystalline cellulose; Storage and loss modulus; Epoxy resins; Cellulose; Dynamics; Mechanical Properties; Surface Treatment; Tensile Strength; Textile Fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047814039

The performance level of those competing varies dramatically, with elite competitors finishing in ~ 8:00:00, and lower performing amateurs finishing in ~ 14–15:00:00. When applying appropriate values for swimming, cycling and running economies to these performance times, it is demonstrated that the absolute energy cost of these events is high, and the rate of energy expenditure increases in proportion with the athlete’s competitive level. Given the finite human capacity for endogenous carbohydrate storage, minimising the endogenous carbohydrate cost associated with performing exercise at competitive intensities should be a goal of Ironman preparation. A range of strategies exist that may help to achieve this goal, including, but not limited to, adoption of a low-carbohydrate diet, exogenous carbohydrate supplementation and periodised training with low carbohydrate availability. Given the diverse metabolic stimuli evoked by Ironman triathlons at different performance levels, it is proposed that the performance level of the Ironman triathlete is considered when adopting metabolic strategies to minimise the endogenous carbohydrate cost associated with exercise at competitive intensities. Specifically, periodised training with low carbohydrate availability combined with exogenous carbohydrate supplementation during competition might be most appropriate for elite and top-amateur Ironman triathletes who elicit very high rates of energy expenditure. Conversely, the adoption of a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet might be appropriate for some lower performance amateurs (> 12 h), in whom associated high rates of fat oxidation may be almost completely sufficient to match the energy demands required. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,"adipose tissue; athlete; athletic performance; carbohydrate diet; cycling; endurance; energy metabolism; exercise; human; ketogenic diet; low carbohydrate diet; metabolism; nutrition; physiology; running; swimming; Adipose Tissue; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Bicycling; Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted; Diet, Ketogenic; Dietary Carbohydrates; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Physical Conditioning, Human; Physical Endurance; Running; Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Swimming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047146036

Similarly, outstanding mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties of aromatic polyimides have been enhanced by using nanodiamond particles. Surface nanodiamond modification with various functional groups has been achieved to enhance interfacial adhesion with the matrix, which in turn, improved the physical properties.

Due to this inherent characteristic, processing elements contend for shared on-chip resources such as Last Level Cache (LLC), interconnect, etc. and shared nodal resources such as DRAM, PCI-E links, etc. This has resulted in severe resource contention and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) that have posed serious challenges to model and algorithm developers. Moreover, the accelerators feature limited main memory compared to the multicore CPU host and are connected to it via limited bandwidth PCI-E links thereby requiring support for efficient out-of-card execution. To summarize, the complexities (resource contention, NUMA, accelerator-specific limitations, etc.) have introduced new challenges to optimization of data-parallel applications on these platforms for performance. Due to these complexities, the performance profiles of data-parallel applications executing on these platforms are not smooth and deviate significantly from the shapes that allowed state-of-the-art load-balancing algorithms to find optimal solutions. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimization of data-parallel applications on modern heterogeneous HPC platforms for performance. We then propose a new model-based data partitioning algorithm, which minimizes the execution time of computations in the parallel execution of the application. This algorithm takes as input a set of p discrete speed functions corresponding to p available heterogeneous processors. It does not make any assumptions about the shapes of these functions.

The impact of BESS energy and power capacity sizing is discussed, showing that the main contribution of storage lies in the provision of fast response reserves that facilitate the integration of increased intermittent RES generation. A feasibility analysis is then performed, considering BESS facilities either as independent storage investments or as facilities being developed in conjunction with new wind power capacity.

However, the evolution of those networks has been reduced by the energy scarcity. It retards the development of the WSN performances required while exploring new applications and improving the WSN potential. Besides, in order to design energy-efficient solutions, it is important to take into account the power dissipation due to noncompliance with time constraints. As a result, we will provide a model of power management that will be simulated and validated by the STORM Simulator (Simulation TOol for Real time Multiprocessor scheduling). However, unlike traditional WSN energy management systems, our power manager reduces the energy consumption through a dual approach: a global and dynamic approach using the analysis of the behavior of the network and a local one applied at the node level. We have relied on energy optimization techniques to yield extensive lifetime for every node battery and mainly both Dynamic Power Management and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling, which are appropriate for the WSN. This model will be based on a global Earliest Deadline First scheduling policy. Besides, we aim to extend the STORM simulation tool to include those power management techniques. © The Author(s) 2018.","Dynamic Power Management; Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling; Earliest Deadline First; energy; modeling; power; quality of service; scheduling; simulation; Wireless Sensor Networks","Buffer storage; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Models; Quality of service; Real time systems; Response time (computer systems); Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Storms; Voltage scaling; Wireless sensor networks; Dynamic power management; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Earliest deadline first; energy; power; simulation; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043482240

The performance of advanced batteries in terms of energy density, power density, cyclability, and safety is mainly determined by the primary functional components, particularly by the electrode materials. Black phosphorus (BP) and the following elements in group V (pnictogens) including arsenic, antimony, and bismuth with layered structures have attracted tremendous attention to replace the graphite anode. This is due to their extremely high specific-capacities for lithium and sodium storage based on the alloying reaction mechanism; however, the same mechanism causes an irreversible volume expansion and thus low cycling stability. Since the discovery of single layer BP and its outstanding physical properties such as tunable band gap, strong in-plane anisotropy, and high carrier mobility, the battery community have intensively studied this material as well as the 2D structures of other pnictogens. In this review, first, the preparation and properties of 2D-pnictogens including crystal structure and chemical stability are briefly described. Second, the theoretical and experimental details of the intercalation and alloying mechanisms are discussed.

Since RESs are normally coupled to the power grid by fast-response power converters without providing any inertia, the power system inertia generated by synchronous generators continues to decrease, making modern power systems sensitive to frequency events. As a result, undesirable load-shedding, cascading failures, or even large-scale blackouts may occur under severe frequency events. To address the lack of inertia concern, this paper presents a frequency derivative-based inertia enhancement method for battery storage systems. Specifically, the method achieves inertia emulation by proportionally linking the time derivative of the grid frequency and active power references of power converters. The main contribution is to use a frequency-locked-loop (FLL) to accurately estimate the frequency derivative signal, which avoids the high frequency noises introduced by differential operators. Simulation and experimental results are finally presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Nevertheless, lipid storage must be tightly controlled, because both its excess and the inability to store lipids can be detrimental to the organism, resulting in metabolic diseases or multifaceted systemic problems. Visualization and the monitoring of the concentration of LDs is essential to understanding these processes. Commercially available LD dyes, such as Nile Red and boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY), offer several advantageous characteristics, but can be limiting in multicolor imaging because most ready-made fluorescent reporter constructs fluoresce in the green-to-red region of the visible spectrum. Nile Red emits between green and red, and BODIPY can be photoconverted from green to red fluorescence, limiting its ability to be utilized for time-lapse imaging of living cells. Here, we report the design and synthesis, the photophysical characterization, and biological testing of two easily prepared series of new blue-fluorescing dyes as markers for LDs. Confocal fluorescence microscopy results showed an interesting correlation between the chemical structures of these fluorescent probes and their specific staining patterns.

Achieving this integration requires the investigation of different technical and infrastructural options, as well as economic analyses for improved implementation. In the city of Linz (Austria), the existing industry exhibits significant unused waste heat potentials which could be integrated into the existing urban DH system, however, a seasonal storage is required due to the competition with an existing waste incineration plant. This paper shows, that a strategic operation of the seasonal storage could increase the number of charging cycles and thereby increase significantly the revenues of the system. This is mainly due to the combined utilization of the storage in a seasonal approach to shift the waste heat from summer to the winter period and as a short term buffer.

On top of their energy payment, large electricity consumers pay a monthly fee per kW of peak demand. Therefore, installation of stationary battery storage can reduce electricity payments for large consumers in two ways: by reducing the peak demand and by shifting consumption from the high tariff to the low tariff. The aim of this paper is to formulate a model to determine optimal energy and power capacity of a stationary battery storage in order to minimize electricity payments. Since the future electricity consumption is uncertain, after formulating the deterministic model, two additional models that consider uncertainty are introduced. The first one is the stochastic model, which considers uncertain scenarios, and the second one is the robust model, where uncertainty is represented by only an uncertainty set, without an assumption on the distribution of uncertainty within this set.

This is usually done below the glass transition temperature of maximally freeze-concentrated solutions (Tg′), to avoid protein aggregation, preserve protein activity, and obtain pharmaceutically ‘elegant’ cakes. Unfortunately, this is a lengthy and energy-consuming process. However, it was recently shown that drying above Tg′ or even above the collapse temperature (Tc) is not necessarily detrimental for stability of biopharmaceuticals, and hence provides an attractive option for freeze-drying cycle optimisation. The goal of the present study was to optimise the freeze-drying cycle for a model IgG monoclonal antibody (20 mg/mL) in sucrose and sucrose/glycine formulations, by reducing primary drying time. To study the impact of shelf temperature (Ts) and chamber pressure on product temperature (Tp), one conventional and five aggressive cycles were tested. Aggressive conditions during primary drying were achieved by increasing Ts from −20 °C (conventional cycle) to 30 °C, with chamber pressure set to 0.1 mbar, 0.2 mbar or 0.3 mbar. These combinations of Ts and chamber pressure resulted in Tp well above Tg′ and in some cases, even above Tc, without causing macrocollapse. Other critical quality attributes of the products were also within the expected ranges, such as reconstitution time and residual water content. Physical stability was tested using size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and micro-flow imaging. All of the lyophilised samples were exposed to stress and the intended storage conditions, with no impacts on the product seen. These data show that implementation of aggressive conditions for the investigated formulations is possible and can significantly contribute to the reduction of primary drying times by up to 54% (from 48 to 22 h) in comparison to conventional freeze-drying. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aggressive drying; Conventional drying; Freeze-drying; Freeze-drying microscopy; Microcollapse; Monoclonal antibody","glycine; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G antibody; sucrose; excipient; monoclonal antibody; Article; controlled study; crystal structure; differential scanning calorimetry; dispersity; freeze drying; glass transition temperature; particle size; pH; photon correlation spectroscopy; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein stability; size exclusion chromatography; turbidity; water content; chemistry; drug formulation; freeze drying; procedures; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Drug Compounding; Excipients; Freeze Drying; Glycine; Immunoglobulin G; Sucrose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049753293

The determined measurable threshold dose is 0.55 Gy. For used energies, LFM dosimeters are more sensitive to X-ray irradiation than to electrons. The deconvolution of the EPR signal of irradiated LFM using Levenberg-Marquardt (M-L) algorithm shows that this spectrum is constituting of three gaussian contributions.

A bi-directional flow model is established for regional-district IES with the utilization of power-to-gas technologies which shows how regional and district IES can jointly enhance the IES resilience. The regional IES co-optimizes power grid and natural gas networks, while the district IES coordinates the energy conversion and storage facilities. The district IES is modeled as an energy hub which supplies electricity to the regional IES. A tri-level two-stage robust model is established to accommodate random outages caused by natural disasters in both natural gas and electricity generation and delivery systems. A two-level algorithm which utilizes Benders decomposition and column-and-constraint generation algorithms is proposed to solve the proposed robust IES problem. Numerical results tested on a 6-bus electrical -6-node natural gas system and a modified IEEE RTS-79 40-node natural gas system show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution technique for enhancing the IES resilience.

The technology evolution of the TMR device toward higher signal-to-noise performance has been achieved through aggressive scaling of the thin film layered structures in the device to the point that thermal stability and thermally induced degradation have come to limit reliability. In this study, a thermal stress has been applied to TMR devices between 150-250°C, and the resistance, amplitude, and asymmetry parameters, both before and after the thermal stress, were measured using a quasi-static test (QST). The results reveal a temperature dependence of the TMR device performance. The microstructure of the annealed devices was further studied using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, revealing structural defects that are related to the QST parametric changes.

Specifically, coupling differed to gold compared to GC; this is of interest because BQ/HQ are representative of a promising class of molecules used in redox flow batteries (RFBs). We calculated the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO), Fermi levels (EF), and density of states (DOS) of the electrode materials via density functional theory in periodic systems. The Au (111) surface was considered for gold modeling, whereas graphite and graphene were used for GC. We compared these results with experimental data to explain the differences in the reversible behavior of the BQ/HQ couple in both electrode materials, setting the pH, electrolyte composition, and electrode geometry equal in both electrodes. The loss of reversibility in GC can be attributed to the anodic branch of the cyclic voltammetry response, which is consistent with the larger energetic distance found for the HQ–HOMO from the EF of the electrode compared to BQ–LUMO. In contrast, the energetic distances in gold are similar in both cases and agree with the symmetry of the experimental current–potential response for both the anodic and cathodic branch. To validate the model, we calculated the total DOS and projected DOS for different quinone molecules—such as 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 1,2,4-trihydroxynaphtalene—adsorbed on gold and GC. The experimental findings support our hypothesis. Additionally, graphite and graphene models equivalently described GC electrodes; both models showed a similar trend in adsorption energy for quinone molecules [due to van der Waals (VDW) interactions], DOS, and partial charge density. For the gold electrode, we found a similar trend in adsorption energy to the graphite and graphene, also attributable to VDW interactions. Our results indicate that theoretical modeling can explain electrochemical principles which underpin quinone-based energy storage systems and RFBs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational modeling; Density of states; Glassy carbon; Gold electrode; Quinone","Computation theory; Cyclic voltammetry; Digital storage; Electrolytes; Electronic structure; Glass; Glass membrane electrodes; Glassy carbon; Gold; Graphene; Graphite; Graphite electrodes; Molecular orbitals; Molecules; Van der Waals forces; 2-Hydroxy-1 ,4-naphthoquinone; Computational model; Density of state; Electrochemical reactivity; Gold electrodes; Highest occupied molecular orbital; Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; Quinone; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050505516

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need electric power and thermal energy for their activities. In Burkina Faso, this type of thermal energy is generally produced by SMEs from firewood. However, cashew companies produce a large amount of waste (shell, press cake, nut shell liquid) which can be converted into fuel. Separating the cashew nut from the shell requires two energy-intensive steps: roasting and drying. The energy is provided by cashew shells which are usually burned in boilers, but this method results in the production of anacardic acid and smoke both of which are irritating and which may be carcinogenic due to the presence of cashew nuts shell liquid (CNSL). This paper describes the production of energy from cashew waste by making briquettes out of the press cake, which is left over after the removal of CNSL from the nut shell. The process consists in carbonizing the press cake at a temperature of 350 °C and grinding to a grain size of 0.5 mm. The resulting charcoal powder is then mixed with water and a binding agent (cassava starch), in this case cassava starch selected for its physical-chemical properties, availability in the local market, and its low price. The resulting mixture is then densified in a screw press to obtain briquettes 5.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length. Several proportions of water and cassava starch were tested and the best briquettes were obtained with a mixture of 35% of water, 10% of cassava starch and 55% of press cake charcoal. The mechanical and physicochemical analysis of briquettes gave a net calorific value of 25.7 MJ/kg, a density of 0.91, a compressive strength index of 382.89 kPa and an impact resistance index of 61.10. A water boiling test performed afterwards showed that the combustion performance of the briquettes was the same as that of wood charcoal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Briquettes; Cashew industry; Combustion; Industrial waste management","Biomass; Briquets; Briquetting; Charcoal; Combustion; Compressive strength; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Industrial wastes; Mixtures; Plants (botany); Pollution control; Shells (structures); Starch; Thermal energy; Waste incineration; Waste management; Bio-energy; Combustion performance; Environmental issues; Net calorific value; Physical chemical property; Physico-chemical analysis; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Water Boiling Test; Presses (machine tools)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049303791

It converts CH4 and CO2 into industrial syngas, while simultaneously utilizing CO2 from the atmosphere. Two reactor bed configurations were tested, based on the concept of double- and single-zone distribution of catalyst and OSM. Combinations of core-shell structured materials were applied, such as Ni/ZrO2@ZrO2 catalyst, Fe2O3/ZrO2@ZrO2 OSM and Fe/Zr@Zr-Ni@Zr bifunctional catalyst, to assess the spatial structuring at both reactor bed and pellet scale. Samples from different reactor beds were characterized before and after use by ex- or in-situ XRD, N2 adsorption, XPS and STEM-EDX. 25 redox cycles of CCAR were performed to investigate the effect of spatial structuring on the activity and stability. The Fe/Zr@Zr-Ni@Zr bifunctional catalyst possesses higher activity and stability for catalytic CH4 conversion in the reduction half-cycle than the Ni/ZrO2@ZrO2 catalyst due to its small Ni particle size (&lt;3 nm), high carbon resistance and thermal stability of the eccentric core-shell structure. A double-zone bed with Ni/ZrO2@ZrO2 catalyst and Fe2O3/ZrO2@ZrO2 OSM has a similar activity as a single-zone bed for producing syngas in the reduction half-cycle, but it presents a higher CO yield in the re-oxidation half-cycle. This is due to the full use of the oxygen storage capacity of the OSM achieved by complete reduction of Fe3O4 and the avoiding of Ni-Fe alloy formation during the reduction half-cycle. A double-zone bed with bifunctional catalyst and OSM combines both advantages. It provides the highest activity and stability for auto-thermal dry reforming and the highest oxygen storage capacity for CO2 utilization, offering a promising reactor technology for the CCAR process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Auto-thermal dry reforming; Chemical looping; Core-shell structure; Ni-Fe bifunctional catalyst; Process efficiency; Spatial structuring","Binary alloys; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Computer software maintenance; Energy conversion; Iron oxides; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Oxygen; Particle size; Reforming reactions; Shells (structures); Stability; Storage (materials); Synthesis gas; Thermodynamic stability; Zirconia; Bi-functional catalysts; Chemical looping; Core shell structure; Dry reforming; Process efficiency; Spatial structuring; Iron alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043374747

The Paris Agreement aims at achieving net zero carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in the second half of this century. The objective of this study is to identify the changes needed in the technologies and energy consumption pattern in Thailand’s energy sector in order to achieve the 1.5 °C global climate goal. Multiple scenarios are drawn to consider different CO 2 emission taxes, penetration of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear power. The AIM/Enduse model is used to quantify Thailand’s 1.5 °C climate goal. Results suggest that CO 2 emission taxes of US$500–US$1,000/tCO 2 would be a significant policy instrument to foster the CO 2 emission reduction. The CCS technology plays a key role to abate higher amounts of CO 2 emissions in the power sector. Moreover, electric vehicle (EV) and biofuel usage in the transport sector show relevant opportunities to lower CO 2 emissions. These technologies reveal challenging tasks in the case of Thailand in order to reduce CO 2 emissions. The 1.5 degree climate target is feasible for Thailand; however, uncertainties remain. The uncertainties include the adoption of CCS technology, costs of EV and the reliability of renewable energy supply. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","1.5 °C; AIM/Enduse; CO2 emissions mitigation; Global warming; Thailand","Carbon capture; Climate models; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Global warming; Nuclear fuels; AIM/Enduse; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Policy instruments; Renewable energies; Thailand; Transport sectors; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059896914

Carbon dioxide is the most influencing gas that significantly expedites global warming. Therefore, it is ultimately necessary to reduce the rapid increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by means of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CO2 separation by physical adsorption is an interesting technology to achieve CO2 capture with minimum energy penalties. Metal-organic framework (MOF) adsorbents forms a class of adsorbents with much higher specific surface areas than conventional porous materials such as activated carbons, and zeolites. However, most MOFs show notable hydro instability for CO2 separation from humid flue gas. Mg-MOF-74 is a superior adsorbent amongst other adsorbents owing to its high CO2 uptake at flue gas conditions. A model is developed using User-Defined-Function in an ANSYS Fluent program. Two and three-dimensional models are validated by comparing their results with experimental work carried out by the authors, at ambient temperature, and published experimental data for high temperature conditions. The effect of water vapor is studied at different temperatures and various relative humidity values for Mg-MOF-74. Results indicate that CO2 uptake has been significantly reduced with the existence of more than 5% water vapor when Mg-MOF-74 is used as an adsorbent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Carbon capture; Global warming; Humidity, MOFs; Mg-MOF-74","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Flue gases; Global warming; Magnesium compounds; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Porous materials; Separation; Water vapor; Zeolites; Adsorption breakthroughs; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon dioxide adsorption; Conventional porous materials; High temperature condition; Physical adsorption; Three-dimensional model; User Defined Functions; Gas adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049533470

Since no separation happened in the stable PMBs, research focus was placed on capturing and analysing the phase separation process in the unstable PMBs. A phase inversion phenomenon was observed in one unstable PMB during the phase separation, showing the possible viscoelastic effects. Furthermore, it is indicated that criteria only based on compositional parameters can give misleading predictions of PMB storage stability. New criteria still need to be defined. The potential approaches to PMB phase behaviour prediction are reviewed and exploratively discussed in the context of the four investigated PMBs. This leads to a further discussion on the possibility of having a thermodynamic approach to PMB phase behaviour prediction by looking into the free energy of PMB. The Flory–Huggins theory provides a way to do this, upon the consideration of PMB as a pseudo-binary blend and some made assumptions. Free energy curves have the strength of giving more information like the equilibrium phase composition. In addition, some more aspects should be also considered for PMB phase behaviour prediction towards an applicable criterion. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Flory–Huggins theory; fluorescence microscopy; phase separation; Polymer-modified bitumen; storage stability","Binders; Bituminous materials; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Forecasting; Free energy; Polymers; Stability criteria; Styrene; Experimental investigations; Huggins; Phase-separation process; Polymer-modified bitumen; Separation behaviour; Storage stability; Styrene butadiene styrenes; Thermodynamic approaches; Phase separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979085761

This study investigated the effect of using different binder type on the physico-chemical and calorific properties of briquettes made from maize cob, sugarcane bagasse and polyethene waste using cassava starch and plantain peel binders. The maize cob, sugarcane bagasse and polyethene waste were mixed at ratio 50 g:50 g:3 g. By using American Standard Testing Methods (ASTM), the study indicated that the two briquettes (having cassava starch or plantain peel binder) have low moisture content required for handling and storage. The briquette with cassava starch (CSB) has the range of volatile matter being 10.74-18.1%, while the one with plantain peel binder (PPB) had the range 14.56-23.08%. Increase in binder concentration (4-20%) resulted to increased volatile matter of the briquettes; though within the range of 9.0-25.8% recommended for carbonizate briquette. CSB has the highest fixed carbon content being 76.39%, ash content of 14.0% and the highest calorific value of 28.14 MJ/kg, compared to PPB with fixed carbon content of 68.20%, ash content 21.08%, calorific value of 15.91 MJ/kg. The result reveals that briquette produced using 4% cassava starch binder has the best properties required for biomass fuel compared to the briquette using plantain peel binder.

This is a serious problem which necessitates tackling if WT energy is to be relied upon producing a constant power. To solve these issues, the present paper develops and assesses a control system that is aimed to ensure the regular feeding of a given power grid with a steady energy flow. It investigates both components of the hybrid wind energy system (HWES), viz., the WT/PMSG ensemble constituting the principal element of wind energy harnessing and the ESS composed of batteries and supercapacitors. The control system suggested here consists of two supervision algorithms (basic/modified) developed according to the constraints of the different elements of HWES. While the first algorithm deals with the state of charge of the storage system, the second takes account the wind speed. The hybrid system is developed and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. Satisfactory control results are obtained, which testify the efficiency of the basic/modified algorithm-based control system. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Control systems; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Hybrid systems; Synchronous generators; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Constant power; Energy storage systems; Hybrid wind; Renewable energies; Satisfactory control; State of charge; Storage systems; Technical difficulties; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055701459

This is due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate forecasts of the energy expected from these renewable energy sources and prosumers. Operators of such microgrids therefore require additional grid-balancing tools to maintain power supply and demand balance during grid operation. In this paper, the impact of demand response aggregators (DRAs) in a prosumer microgrid is investigated. This is achieved by developing and solving a deterministic mathematical formulation for the operational planning of the grid. Also, taking a cue from CAISO's proposed tariff revision which allows the state-of-charge of non-generator resources (like storage units) to be submitted as a bid parameter in the day-ahead market and permits scheduling coordinators of these resources to self-manage their energy limits and state-of-charge, the proposed formulation permits prosumers to submit the battery energy content as a bid parameter and self-manage their battery energy limits. Furthermore, a robust counterpart of the model is developed. Both formulations are constrained mixed integer optimization problems which are solved using the CPLEX solver in the Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modelling System environment. The results obtained from tests carried out on a hypothetical prosumer microgrid show that the operating cost of the microgrid reduces in the presence of DRAs. In addition, the storage facility owner may benefit from self-managing its energy limits, but this may cut the amount of grid-balancing resource available to the microgrid operator, thereby increasing the operating cost of the microgrid. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Charging (batteries); Constrained optimization; Economics; Integer programming; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Mathematical formulation; Mixed integer optimization; Multidimensional modelling; Operational planning; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Scheduling co-ordinators; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053932788

Energy storage technology (EST) devices can supply more flexibility and balance to the main grid, providing a backup to intermittent energy needs. ESTs can provide an improvement in the transmission and distribution networks, which will improve energy efficiency. This in turn will considerably reduce the cost of energy transmission. In light of this, ESTs can not only accelerate the de-carbonization of the electricity grid, but also enhance the security and efficiency of electricity transmission and its distribution by reducing unplanned loop flows, grid congestion, and voltage and frequency variations. This can stabilize electricity market prices and correspondingly guarantee a higher security of energy supply to the consumers. ESTs can also pave the way to the introduction of renewable energy. In this study, the advantages of ESTs to meet the future energy demand for the arid region are investigated. The integration of the various ESTs that are suitable for arid region's power system is evaluated in terms of technical, environmental, and economic aspects to obtain the optimal EST for each position. Both Energy Storage Computational Tool and Energy Storage Select tools are used to evaluate and assess the ESTs and accordingly realize the optimum EST for each position. Based on the investigation and analysis, the rankings of ESTs suitable to an arid region are sodium sulphur batteries, lead acid batteries, and sodium nickel chloride batteries. These are ideal ESTs for the arid region's power sector as they are more probable to optimize the power supply and high demands at peak loads within the existing electrical power system. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Arid regions; Carbonization; Chlorine compounds; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Lead acid batteries; Light transmission; Nickel compounds; Sodium compounds; Computational tools; Electrical power system; Electricity transmission; Energy storage technologies; Frequency variation; Investigation and analysis; Techno- economic analysis; Transmission and distribution; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053905823

XRD analysis is applied to the prepared samples and the formation of GO is confirmed. Raman scattering measurements for GO and fGO samples confirmed the existence of the D band and G band at 1337 and 1598 cm−1. In addition, the ID/IG ratio increased for the PVC/fGO nanocomposite films, indicating that the relative fraction of sp2-hybridized carbon atom was lowered, and the distorted structure of PVC/fGO nanocomposites. Dispersion of fGO in the PVC/fGO composites was also observed using SEM. DMA measurements revealed that the nanocomposite samples exhibit higher storage moduli than pure PVC as the storage modulus for pure PVC at 20 °C is 173 MPa, whereas it is 176, 334, 498, and 920 MPa for 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 wt% fGO loading, respectively.

FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify interaction in PVC/fGO polymer composites, which the peak around 863 cm−1 of pure film shifts to a lower wavenumber ~ 833 cm−1 with the incorporation of fGO, indicating the existence of strong and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between free C–Cl of PVC and amino groups of fGO. The direct optical energy gap (Eopt) decreased from 5.21 to 5.04 eV and Urbach energy (EU) increased with increasing fGO content. The average excitation energy for electronic transitions (Eo), the dispersion energy (Ed), refractive index, dipole strength (f), optical conductivity, and both static and high-frequency dielectric constants are enhanced with increasing fGO content.

The key to achieving this goal is cryo-fixation, where the biological materials, tissues and associated solutions are rapidly frozen and preserved in a vitreous state. We developed a correlative cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) protocol that provides quantitative elemental analysis correlated with spatial imaging of cryo-immobilized specimens. We report the accuracy and sensitivity of the cryo-EDS method, as well as insights we derive on biomineralization pathways in a foraminifer. Foraminifera are marine protozoans that produce Mg-containing calcitic shells and are major calcifying organisms in the oceans. We use the cryo-SEM/EDS correlative method to characterize unusual Mg and Ca-rich particles in the cytoplasm of a benthic foraminifer. The Mg/Ca ratio of these particles is consistently lower than that of seawater, the source solution for these ions. We infer that these particles are involved in Ca ion supply to the shell. We document the internal structure of the MgCa particles, which in some cases include a separate Si rich core phase. This approach to mapping ion distribution in cryo-preserved specimens may have broad applications to other mineralized biomaterials. Statement of significance: Ions are an integral part of life, and some ions play fundamental roles in cell metabolism. Determining the concentrations of ions in cells and between cells, as well as their distributions at high resolution can provide valuable insights into ion uptake, storage, functions and the formation of biomaterials. Here we present a new cryo-SEM/EDS protocol that allows the mapping of different ion distributions in solutions and biological samples that have been cryo-preserved. We demonstrate the value of this novel approach by characterizing a novel biogenic mineral phase rich in Mg found in foraminifera, single celled marine organisms. This method has wide applicability in biology, and especially in understanding the formation and function of mineral-containing hard tissues. © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.","Biomineralization; Cryo-EDS; Cryo-fixation; Elemental analysis; Magnesium","Binary alloys; Calcium; Cells; Cytology; Histology; Ions; Magnesium; Mapping; Marine biology; Metabolism; Scanning electron microscopy; Tissue; Cryo-energy dispersive spectroscopy; Cryo-scanning electron microscopy; Cryofixation; Foraminifera shells; Foraminifers; High resolution; Intracellular distribution; Ion concentrations; Ion mapping; Ions distribution; Biomineralization; calcium ion; magnesium carbonate; sea water; biomaterial; calcium; calcium carbonate; ion; magnesium; mineral; silicon; accuracy; Amphistegina lessonii; Amphistegina lobifera; Article; benthic foraminifera; biomineralization; controlled study; cryopreservation; egg shell; elemental analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; freeze fracture; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; sensitivity analysis; surface property; calcinosis; calibration; chemistry; cryoelectron microscopy; cryopreservation; cytoplasm; foraminifer; metabolism; Raman spectrometry; reproducibility; scanning electron microscopy; sea; spectroscopy; Biocompatible Materials; Calcinosis; Calcium; Calcium Carbonate; Calibration; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Cryopreservation; Cytoplasm; Foraminifera; Ions; Magnesium; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Minerals; Oceans and Seas; Reproducibility of Results; Seawater; Silicon; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050616265

Dielectric properties of the nanocomposite were investigated in the frequency range (10 Hz to 10 MHz) over the temperature range (298–373 K). Many variables such as: dielectric constant, dielectric loss, loss tangent, electric moduli and AC conductivity were studied with changing frequency and temperature, showing improvement in the nanocomposite properties with both of them. The non-Debye behaviour of the samples was confirmed from the electric modulus analysis. AC conductivity (σac) was found to follow Jonscher’s universal power law. The enhancement in (σac) with frequency and temperature has implied the presence of free charge carriers that pass by hopping through defect sites over the potential barriers separating them in the PVVH/GO matrix. The correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model was found to be the best choice for describing AC conduction mechanism in the current nanocomposite over the above temperature range. Scaling of (σac) carried out for the prepared samples has exhibited that charge carriers within the current matrix follow a common conduction mechanism. A comparison between maximum barrier height and activation energy has been carried out to demonstrate the charge carriers transport mechanism. The PVVH-based nanocomposite with the highest concentration of GO (4 wt%) has achieved the highest enhancement in (σac) and mechanical properties, suggesting the feasibility of using it in designing electrochemical and energy storage devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Activation energy; Charge carriers; Chlorine compounds; Dielectric losses; Dielectric materials; Electric losses; Graphene; Nanocomposites; Polyvinyl acetates; AC electrical conductivity; Charge carriers transport; Conduction Mechanism; Correlated barrier hopping; Free charge carriers; Hydroxypropyl acrylates; Solution-casting technique; Universal power law; Dielectric properties of solids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050268356

However, the performance of such system is limited by the poor thermal conductivity of most phase change material. This paper provides a novel graphite-phase change material composite sphere, having high thermal conductivity. In this study, two different types of phase change material were used, organic (PureTemp4) and inorganic (water) phase change materials. The measured thermal conductivity of graphite-water and graphite-PureTemp4 composite spheres were 12 and 30 times higher than those of pure water and PureTemp4, respectively. The microstructure of the compressed expanded graphite and graphite-phase change material composites were examined using a scanning electron microscope. The result shows that the phase change material was completely filled the pores and adhered as a thin layer on the graphite surfaces. Differential scanning calorimeter and thermal cycling tests showed no significant changes in thermal properties of the graphite-phase change material composite spheres after 200 thermal cycles. The measured average freezing rates for graphite-phase change material composite and hollow plastic spheres containing the same amount of PCM are 14.42 W and 4.58 W respectively, while for melting are 31.34 and 10.28 W respectively. The super-cooling of water was reduced 2 °C by the effect of graphite, however it was totally eliminated in the presence of small amount of silver iodide as a nucleating agent.

The metal temperature was much higher within the thin layer near the internal tube of hydrogen feed.

This paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming microgrid investment model considering multi-period and multi-objective investment setups. It further investigates the effects of uncertain demand by using a target-oriented robust optimization (TORO) approach. The model was validated and analyzed by subjecting it in different scenarios. As a result, it is seen that there are four factors that affect the decision of the model: cost, budget, carbon emissions, and useful life. Since the objective of the model is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the system, the model would choose to prioritize the least cost among the different distribution energy resources (DER). The effects of load uncertainty was observed through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. As a result, the deterministic model shows a solution that might be too optimistic and might not be achievable in real life situations. Through the application of TORO, a profile of solutions is generated to serve as a guide to the investors in their decisions considering uncertain demand. The results show that pessimistic investors would have lower NPV targets since they would invest more in storage facilities, incurring more electricity stock out costs. On the contrary, an optimistic investor would tend to be aggressive in buying electricity generating equipment to meet most of the demand, however risking more storage stock out costs. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","microgrid; renewable resources; robust optimization; target-oriented robust optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048055801

However, in an abnormal grid voltage condition, this will affect the back-to-back converter, DFIG, and the drive train, and it may even disconnect from the grid. This paper proposes control techniques for a back-to-back converter that can be operated under abnormal voltage conditions. The model of positive- and negative-sequence components of the DFIG is used to analyze the problem and to design control techniques of the machine-side converter to reduce transients and pulsation of the rotor currents. The proposed control techniques were verified by an experimental DFIG wind turbine system composed of a DFIG, a back-to-back converter, an active crowbar, and a DC chopper operating together with test facilities such as a voltage sag generator, wind turbine simulator, and a data acquisition system. Experiments showed that severe and frequent events arose during single-phase voltage sags while the DFIG operated at super-synchronous speed and delivered the rated power. The experimental results also showed that the proposed control techniques succeeded in improving the unbalance of the stator current while being able to reduce high transient and oscillation of the rotor current and stress on power electronic devices and the active crowbar operation time to only one in six. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In this paper we propose and design a low voltage, differential write, single ended read memory cell that consists of a total of 6 transistors. The innovative idea is to bring the loadless 4-transistor latch into the realm of low voltage memory cells by exploiting features of the 28 nm FDSOI Process and by adding a 2-transistor readbuffer with a footer line. Stand-alone and on a system level, the cell is stable during read, write and hold operations and it has great write-ability due to its differential write and loadless nature. The single NWELL option in 28 nm FD-SOI allows the loadless core to have minimal device widths while greatly improving the time it takes to evaluate the read bit-line. The cell has, in this paper, been used in a 128 kb (217) SRAM in a 16 block configuration exploring 3 different types of logic libraries for the peripheral logic of the system. Depending on the application, the IO-peripheral logic may be implemented using either high threshold voltage transistors or low threshold voltage transistors in where the power consumption of the 128 kb system was found to range from 1.31 µW to 71.09 µW, the maximum operational frequency lies within 1.87 MHz and 14.97 MHz while the read energy varies from 13.08 to 75.21 fJ/operation/bit for a supply voltage of 350 mV.

Nuclear power is expected to have more economic advantages than intermittent renewable sources for generating base load electrical energy requirements. This would be especially important in the years from about 2025 up to 2065, during which one cannot expect a serious contribution from nuclear fusion and even less from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. In a strategy to eliminate all non-CCS coal power stations, some 1600 MW of nuclear power would be required and sufficient to cover the base load for the electrical energy supply system.

The power system discussed in this study is hourly resolved and based on 100% Renewable Energy (RE) technologies. Sub-Saharan Africa was subdivided into 16 sub-regions. Four different scenarios were considered involving the setup of a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission grid. An integrated scenario that considers water desalination and industrial gas production was also analyzed. This study reveals that RE is sufficient to cover 866.4 TWh estimated electricity demand for 2030 and additional electricity needed to fulfill 319 million m3 of water desalination and 268 TWhLHV of synthetic natural gas demand. Existing hydro dams can be used as virtual batteries for solar PV and wind electricity storage, diminishing the role of other storage technologies. The results for total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) decreases from 57.8 €/MWh for a highly decentralized to 54.7 €/MWh for a more centralized grid scenario. For the integrated scenario, including water desalination and synthetic natural gas demand, the levelised cost of gas and the levelised cost of water are 113.7 €/MWhLHV and 1.39 €/m3, respectively. A reduction of 6% in total cost and 19% in electricity generation was realized as a result of integrating desalination and power-to-gas sectors into the system.

The reaction rate was determined using a dye-binding method. Based on our findings, decrease in available lysine follows first-order reaction kinetics model. Small changes in temperature (2.5 °C) caused significant increase in the reaction rate constants. Relative humidity affected temperature dependency of the reaction, and activation energies were estimated to be 142.5–170.8 kJ mol−1.

One of the major challenges facing cloud computing is to predict the usage of these resources in real time. By knowing future demands, cloud data centres can dynamically scale resources to decrease energy consumption while maintaining a high quality of service. However cloud resource consumption is ever changing, making it difficult for accurate predictions to be produced. This motivates the research presented in this paper which aims to predict in advance the level of CPU consumption of a host. This research implements evolutionary Neural Networks (NN), a powerful machine learning method, to make these predictions. A number of state of the art swarm and evolutionary optimization algorithms are implemented to train the neural networks to predict host utilization: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). The results of this research demonstrate that CMA-ES converges faster to a better solution on the training data. However when evaluated on the test data, DE performs statistically equal to CMA-ES. The results also demonstrate that the trained networks are still accurate when applied to CPU utilization data from different hosts with no further training needed. When evaluated to predict multiple steps into the future, the accuracy of the network understandably decreases but still performs well on average. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy; CPU prediction; Differential Evolution; Neural networks; Neuroevolution; Optimization; Particle Swarm Optimization; Time series","Cloud computing; Covariance matrix; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Green computing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Time series; Covariance matrix adaptation; Differential Evolution; Evolutionary neural network; Evolutionary optimization algorithm; Evolutionary strategies; Machine learning methods; Neuro evolutions; Resource consumption; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045288180

To perform large computation and storage, a DC is equipped with more than thousands of servers or even more. Due to a large number of these computational devices put in use at DC, produces a large amount of heat. Therefore the cost to maintain the thermal balance in a DC has increased significantly and has become almost equal to the cost of operating these systems. The main problem in heat management is ‘Hot spots creation’ which can cause hardware inefficiencies, and operational disruptions and in turn have a negative impact on overall functionality. To address these issues this paper aims at decreasing energy consumption of DC by allowing administrators, designers, and planners to model, visualize and analyze the thermal status of various configurations and solutions. A major difficulty in the thermal analysis of DC is the lack of simulation tool, where the impact of design (layout) and workload on thermal status can be tested. Therefore there is a need for a simulator that approaches the problem from an end-user perspective and takes into account all the factors that are critical to analyzing thermal balance in DC. A simulator is developed that takes DC computational devices as input and provide models that allow designers to analyze and visualize DC thermal conditions. The simulator allows the user to apply different job allocation strategies and can analyze thermal status for each; that help them choose the best strategy for job allocation. It enables DC administrator to organize servers and racks before their actual implementation. Moreover, servers can be relocated to analyze and maintain thermal balance. The user will also able to predict thermal condition after a specific time period. The simulator enables a DC user/administrator to maintain thermal balance in DC by detecting the root cause of hot spots under different workload; which will help them make better workload balancing decisions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Data center; Modeling; Prediction; Simulator; Visualization","Data visualization; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Flow visualization; Forecasting; Models; Thermoanalysis; Visualization; Computational devices; Coupled element; Data centers; End-user perspective; Instrumented systems; Thermal balance; Thermal condition; Workload balancing; Simulators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041612553

In fact, the cost of energy is different along the day and companies can be encouraged to use these systems, since the extra energy required to charge the storage system can be obtained in periods where the cost of the energy is lower and used in periods when the energy cost is higher. Storage systems also allow reducing losses of the lines and improving voltage profile. However, in distribution networks there are benefits in using distributed storage instead of centralized storage. Under this context, this paper proposes a multiobjective optimization approach for the location and sizing of storage systems. In this problem, the objective functions are in conflict. Increasing the number of storage systems leads to a reduction in the peak power and losses, but also will increase the investment cost. This approach allows obtaining solutions of different trade-offs with respect to the two objectives. An IEEE 69 buses and a real 94 buses test feeders are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Distribution networks planning; Multiobjective optimization; NSGA-II; Storage systems","Costs; Economic and social effects; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Centralized storages; Distributed storage; Distribution networks planning; Investment costs; Location and sizings; NSGA-II; Objective functions; Storage systems; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038359054

The paper presents a mixed integer linear programming optimization algorithm for determining the optimal size of the distributed generation unit and battery storage system based on operational savings and investment costs, as well as estimation of environmental benefits.

While traditional approaches of assigning conventional generation units to maintain system stability can increase operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, or give signals for new investments, utilizing intelligent control of distributed sources might mitigate those negative effects. This can be achieved by controllable charging of domestic electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing number of public charging stations gives final users the opportunity to fast charge, making their vehicles an additional source of uncertainty rather than a provider of flexibility.

Due to decreasing and volatile wholesale electricity prices, the industrial partners/owners of the photovoltaic park are considering hydrogen storage in an attempt to increase the value proposition of their renewable energy installation. A major objective of the present work is to show how the utilization factor of the electrolyzer is affected by the design of the power supply system when the latter consists only of renewable energy sources instead of using the electric grid. Different hybrid designs were developed, by combining the existing photovoltaic source with wind power and state-of-the-art energy storage technologies (Vanadium Redox Flow or Lithium NMC). Finally, four scenarios were investigated, all considering a 1 MW PEM electrolyzer: A) 15 MW PV, B) 15 MW PV, 2MW Wind, C) 15 MW PV, 2 MW Wind, Battery, D) 15 MW PV, 15 MW Wind. The utilization factor was found as follows, for each scenario respectively: A) 41,5%, B) 65,5%, C) 66,0–86,0%, D) 82,0%. Furthermore, the analysis was extended to include economic evaluations (i.e. payback period, accumulated profit), specifically concerning scenario B and C. The results of this study lead to a number of conclusions such as: i) The utilization of the electrolyzer is limited when its power supply is intermittent. ii) Compared to PV, wind power makes larger contribution to the increase of the utilization factor, iii) 100% utilization can be achieved only if an energy storage system co-exists. iv) With a utilization factor at 65,5% scenario B can deliver a payback period in less than 8 years, if hydrogen is sold above 5€/kg.

On the base of calculated values of the Gibbs free energy for reaction of hydrogen absorption (ΔG &lt; 0) it reveals that hydrogenation reaction could thermodynamically proceed at room temperature, which is experimentally confirmed for all of the studied composites. It is clearly shown that β-MgH2 forms at RT under conditions of experiment. Comparative analysis of the Mg–Ti, Mg–V and Mg–Nb systems makes it possible to establish that the most effective additive facilitating hydrogen uptake, particularly at RT, is vanadium. It provides the degree of conversion into hydride phase α = 0.86 for the first minute of hydrogenation. In contrast, additives of Nb and Ti provide only α = 0.62 and 0.36, respectively, following the 30 min of exposure. However, this study reveals that for the dehydrogenation process, titanium is the best among the examined additives, which is evidenced by lowest value of activation energy Ea = 53.6 kJ/mol of the hydrogen desorption. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen storage; In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction; Magnesium hydride; Reactive ball milling; Sievert's method","Activation energy; Additives; Dehydrogenation; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Magnesium compounds; Magnesium powder; Milling (machining); Niobium; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; Degree of conversion; Detailed reaction mechanisms; Hydrogenation reactions; In-situ synchrotrons; Kinetics and thermodynamics; Magnesium hydride; Reactive ball milling; Sievert's method; Ball milling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048958936

Here, we have reported the 1D Cd1-xMnxS (x = 0-0.102) nanobelts (NBs) and investigated their optical and magnetic properties. These NBs were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition method. The successful incorporation of Mn ions into an individual CdS NB has been confirmed through several characterization tools: SEM-EDX analysis, significant higher angle and phonon mode shifts were observed in the XRD and Raman spectra. Roomerature PL showed two emission peaks at the near band edge. The first peak is related to exciton magnetic polaron (EMP) and the second one appeared on the low-energy side of the band edge emission and showed very large red-shift (∼33 nm) compared to EMP, which is attributed to bound magnetic polaron (BMP). BMP emission was detected for the first time in CdS low-dimensional nanostructures. Our study showed that Mn ions tuned CdS emission more than 400 nm (from 512 to 929 nm) covering the whole visible spectral region up to the near infrared region for the first time, and significantly boosted the roomerature ferromagnetism, which shows promise for optoelectronic and spintronic applications. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cadmium sulfide; Chemical vapor deposition; Ferromagnetism; II-VI semiconductors; Infrared devices; Magnetic properties; Magnetic storage; Nanobelts; Polarons; Semiconductor quantum wells; Bound magnetic polarons; Characterization tools; Chemical vapor deposition methods; Exciton magnetic polarons; Low dimensional nanostructures; Semiconductor nanostructures; Spintronic applications; Visible spectral regions; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053118517

Such synthetic fuels can serve as long-term energy storage media, providing back-up power generation for intermittent renewable energy sources. The effects of diluents such as helium and water on the thermal behavior of these fuels are mostly unexplored. Experimental results indicated the fuels' autoignition temperature increases with diluent content due to the heat sink effect of the inert water and helium. Simulations were performed using an updated mechanism to study the reaction pathways leading to thermal autoignition. Isocyanic acid underwent hydrolysis generating NH3 and most of the CO2. Ammonia was oxidized by either NO3 or NO2 to form NH2 and either HNO3 or HONO. Nitric acid reacted with HONO producing N2O4 and most of the H2O. Molecular nitrogen was mostly produced by the termination reaction between NH2 and NO. Sensitivity analyses indicated the ignition of these fuels is promoted by the generation of NH2 from NH3 by high oxidation NOx, and inhibited by the reduction of NO3 and NO2 to NO2 and NO, respectively.

An optimal sizing process can be employed in the design phase of such a newly developed hybrid power system to assure the power system's technical and economic efficiency. While optimal sizing algorithms have been developed for different types of hybrid power systems, these often treat stand-alone systems and do not consider the socioorganisational drivers for inter-firm energy supply facilities. Here, a techno-economic optimisation is carried out using a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal system configuration of a grid-connected power system. The current development of the project Eiland Zwijnaarde in Ghent provides the basis for a concrete case study. The main results suggest that the optimal configuration consists of a significant share of renewable sources. A cogeneration unit can compensate the renewables' intermittent behaviour and lower the thermal energy cost. Large-scale electrical storage is found not to be profitable under the used control structure.

The integral-direct, in-core, highly efficient domain construction technique of our local second-order Møller-Plesset (LMP2) scheme is extended to the CC level. The resulting scheme, which is also suitable for general-order LNO-CC calculations, inherits the beneficial properties of the LMP2 approach, such as the asymptotically linear-scaling operation count, the asymptotically constant data storage requirement, and the completely independent domain calculations. In addition to integrating our recent redundancy-free LMP2 and Laplace-transformed (T) algorithms with the LNO-CCSD(T) code, the memory demand, the domain and LNO construction, the auxiliary basis compression, and the previously rate-determining two-external integral transformation have been significantly improved. The accuracy of all of the approximations is carefully examined on medium-sized to large systems to determine reasonably tight default truncation thresholds. Our benchmark calculations, performed on molecules of up to 63 atoms, show that the optimized method with the default settings provides average correlation and reaction energy errors of less than 0.07% and 0.34 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to the canonical CCSD(T) reference. The efficiency of the present LNO-CCSD(T) implementation is demonstrated on realistic, three-dimensional examples.

The as-optimized crystal structures are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental. The bond lengths of these materials have been compared to show the effect of alkali metal (Na and K) in N2H4BH3. The density of states (DOS) indicated that these materials are considered as an insulator with wide band-gap: 5.78, 4.35 and 4.36 eV for N2H4BH3, NaN2H3BH3 and KN2H3BH3, respectively. This indicated that the substitution of one hydrogen atom from N2H4BH3 by alkali atom (Na or K) could reduce the band-gap. The partial DOS, Hirshfeld method and charge density distribution have been used to understand the nature of the chemical bond. It is found that the chemical bonding in each group namely [N2H4] and [BH3] for N2H4BH3 or [N2H3] and [BH3] for MN2H3BH3 (M = Na and K)) have mainly a covalent nature. While, an ionic character between M (Na and K) and the rest of N2H3BH3 group is suggested for MN2H3BH3 (M = Na and K). Interestingly, both N-H and B-H bonds are destabilized in MN2H3BH3 (M = Na and K) with a less protic character of [BH3] than that of N2H4BH3.

Expectedly, this has opened a lot of routes for vulnerabilities which can be maliciously exploited by today’s cyber criminals. The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is believed to be the foundation of the smart grid. Malicious exploitations of security vulnerabilities present in the smart grid AMI by cyber criminals would be detrimental to both energy providers and final consumers. This is in view of the huge task involved in the management and storage of data from the numerous intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) that traverse the smart grid’s AMI and beyond. A lack of capability in terms of processing, computations and storage of these data can only compound the cyber security problems facing the SG AMI. Cloud Computing is therefore a potential technology that can address the above challenging issues. Previous review works had concentrated mainly on the potentials of cloud computing for the smart grid. None of such works to the best of our knowledge had an extensive focus on the security of the SG AMI. We therefore provide in this paper firstly, a review of the cloud based solutions for the smart grid with appropriate SG domain classification in order to determine the focus points of previous related works. We then provide an elaborate overview on cloud based security solutions for the SG AMI. At the end, future research challenges were highlighted with open research ideas that could help to address the challenges also suggested. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Advanced metering infrastructure; Cloud based firewall; Cloud computing; Cyber security; Smart grid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056372480

The BES serves to store the excess of power resulted by PV and to transfer it to load if necessary, preventing voltage interruption, and adjusting charging and discharging energy in battery. Power quality analysis is carried out in two conditions i.e. PV connected to DC link without and with BES. Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is implemented to maintain DC voltage across the capacitor under disturbance scenarios of source and load as well as to compare the results with Proportional Intergral (PI) controller. The number of disturbance scenarios is six for each UPQC controller, so the total number of disturbances is 12. The six disturbances are: non-linear load (NL), unbalance and nonlinear load (Unba-NL), distortion supply and non-linear load (Dis-NL), sag and non-linear load (Sag-NL), swell and non-linear load (Swell-NL), and interruption and non-linear load (Inter-NL). FLC method on UPQC supplied by PV with BES is able to result in an average THD of load voltage slightly better than PI controller. In disturbance scenario 1 to 5, nominal of average THD of load voltage have met IEEE 519. FLC method on UPQC supplied by PV with BES is also capable to give average THD of source current better than PI controller. Under scenario 6 (Inter-NL), FLC is able to reduce the average THD of load voltage and source current significantly than PI controller. With the same disturbance, the combination of PV and BES is able to generate power to UPQC DC link and to inject full average compensation voltage through injection transformer on series active filter so that average load voltage remains stable. This simulations prove that the proposed artificial intelligent (AI) controller for UPQC with BES is able to improve power quality significantly under varying disturbances especially for interruption disturbance. The performance of the proposed model is validated and investigated through simulations using Matlab/Simulink. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","BES; Disturbance scenarios; Power quality; PV; Total harmonic distortion (THD); UPQC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056266640

Thirty adult mussels were collected on a monthly basis and evaluated for gonad developmental stages and changes in oocyte features (theoretical diameter, nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, lipid index, and carbohydrate index). The overall somatic coverage area versus gonad coverage area and energy reserves in the gonad (carbohydrates and neutral lipids) was also analyzed. In summer (26.5 ± 1.4°C and 2.3 ± 0.7 mg m-3 chlorophyll a), oocytes achieved greater sizes that were significantly correlated with higher lipid reserves in the gonad. This suggests that female gonads have superior breeding capacity in summer, compared with those in the autumn and winter periods, when oocyte performance and ovarian energy reserves were minimal. The evidence indicates that M. capax follows a conservative strategy to sustain gametogenesis relying on energy reserves previously stored in somatic tissue between autumn and winter. By contrast, optimal reproductive performance between April and August associates more with decreasing somatic coverage area and increasing gonad coverage area; this reflects a period of energy (lipids) transfer from storage tissues to the gonad to fuel gametogenesis. These results help establish the biological basis for gonad conditioning and maturation of M. capax to ensure continuous production of spat at the laboratory. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

It is also a major coproduct of second generation biofuels. The effective utilization of lignin is critical for the accelerated development of the advanced cellulosic biorefinery. Low cost and availability of lignin make it attractive precursor for preparation of a range of carbon materials, including activated carbons, activated carbon fibers (CF), structural CF, graphitic carbons or carbon black that could be used for environmental protection, as catalysts, in energy storage applications or as reinforcing components in advanced composite materials. Technical lignins are very diverse in terms of their molecular weight, structure, chemical reactivity, and chemical composition, which is a consequence of the different origin of the lignin and the various methods of lignin isolation. The inherent heterogeneity of lignin is the main obstacle to the preparation of high-performance CF. Although lignin-based CF still do not compete with polyacrylonitrile-derived CF in mechanical properties, they nevertheless provide new markets through high availability and low production costs. Alternatively, technical lignin could be used for production of carbon adsorbents, which have very high surface areas and pore volumes comparable to the best commercial activated carbons.

A cascade connection between a dc–dc chopper and a voltage source converter is made to integrate the SMES system. The proposed controller guarantees asymptotically stability in the Lyapunov's sense under closed-loop operation. This controller exploits the well-known advantages of the proportional-integral (PI) actions via passivation theory. Active and reactive power compensation in the ac system through the SMES integration is proposed as the control objective. To achieve this goal, a radial ac distribution feeder with high penetration of distributed energy resources and time-varying loads is employed. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed bilinear PI controller verified by comparing its dynamical performance to conventional approaches such as conventional PI and feedback controllers.

Recently, a dissolution recycling approach enhanced by ultrasonic treatment succeeded in the liberation of Cu foils from WPCBs as received. This research aims to synthesize Copper Nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) from the recovered Cu by using an advanced chemistry approach to obtain nano-product with high added value taking into consideration environmental risks. The experiments were carried out on the Cu foils recovered from the three types of WPCBs with different purity of Cu (Motherboard, Video Card, and Random Access Memory (RAM)). The synthesis process was performed in two stages: (a) preparation of Copper (II) Sulfate aqueous solutions from the recovered Cu and (b) chemical reduction of solutions for synthesis of Cu-NPs by using Native Cyclodextrins (NCDs), particularly ß-NCD as stabilizers. The efficiency of the developed approach for raw material of different purity was assessed and the final yield and the estimated recovery cost of synthesized Cu-NPs were calculated with high accuracy as well as the properties of the synthesized Cu-NPs. The obtained Cu-NPs were examined using SEM-EDS, TEM, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, and TGA. To maximize the potential biomedical application benefits, the antibacterial activity of Cu-NPs was investigated by the standard microdilution method for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus bacterial cultures. The results showed that the produced Cu-NPs had an average size of 7 nm and yield 90%, while the preparation costs were 6 times lower in comparison to the commercial counterparts. In addition, the results indicated that the synthesized Cu-NPs from RAM sample had a good antimicrobial action. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Antimicrobial activity; Chemical treatment; Copper nanoparticles; Green chemistry; Recycling of Waste Printed Circuit Board (WPCB)","Escherichia coli; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Printed circuit boards; Random access storage; Recycling; Solutions; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Timing circuits; Waste treatment; Anti-microbial activity; Chemical treatments; Copper nanoparticles; Green chemistry; Recycling of wastes; Copper compounds; ascorbic acid; beta cyclodextrin; copper nanoparticle; copper sulfate; antimicrobial activity; copper; industrial waste; nanoparticle; recycling; accuracy; advanced chemical technology; antibacterial activity; aqueous solution; Article; bactericidal activity; bacterium culture; biotechnology; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); controlled study; disk diffusion; drug structure; electron microscopy; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Escherichia coli; green chemistry; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; motherboard; nanofabrication; nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Raman spectrometry; random access memory; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus aureus; video card; waste printed circuit board; X ray diffraction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Staphylococcus aureus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048565109

Grid-connected ESB users schedule their usage based on time-of-use tariffs to follow economic charging cycles. However, charging several grid-connected ESBs during off-peak tariff interval may cause a decline of grid voltage below its limit. Therefore, this paper suggests a management scheme to maintain voltage-sag magnitude within its threshold, while minimizing the aggregated cost of charging the grid-connected ESBs.

Addressing this research question, a series of PLA/PCL blends were processed using melt-blending technique. The results show that the unique thermal stability of the dispersed PCL domains prolonged the complete degradation process of PLA. Furthermore, altering the activation energies (Ea) of PLA/PCL blends revealed that thermal stability depends not only on the governing mechanism change during degradation process but also on the behavior of phase-separated morphology characteristics. The presence of evenly dispersed PCL particles within PLA matrix enhanced the crystallization rate coefficient of PLA and tailored the spherulite morphologies by acting as a nucleating agent, thus promoting the crystallization ability of PLA chains. Consequently, remarkable increase in elongation at break was achieved for 60PLA/40PCL blend, with well-balance tensile modulus and tensile strength characteristics. Despite the significant storage modulus increase of the blends at low temperatures, significant storage modulus decrease is noted with increasing temperature, due to packing density, chain mobility phenomenon, and unfrozen PCL molecules. The enhanced processability of PLA by ductile PCL, with improved and balanced properties, enables the technological advancement of bio-based PLA for a wide range of applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Crystallization behavior; Material and mechanical properties; Polylactide/poly(ε-caprolactone) immiscible blends; Thermal degradation kinetics","Activation energy; Biodegradable polymers; Blending; Chains; Crystallization; Degradation; Elastic moduli; Morphology; Polyesters; Polymer blends; Polypropylenes; Tensile strength; Thermodynamic stability; Caprolactone; Crystallization behavior; Immiscible polymer blends; Phase separated morphology; Strength characteristics; Technological advancement; Thermal and mechanical properties; Thermal degradation kinetics; Mechanical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048475256

The design of a photocatalytic reactor that is simple, energy efficient, less expensive to build and operate is crucial for the development and widespread of TiO2 photocatalysis. A solar photocatalytic reactor is designed and constructed. The reactor is based on generating a thin water film to allow for solar light penetration and continuous oxygenation. Recirculating the reaction solution at a high flow rate ensure good mixing and avoid dead zones in the photoreactor. Reactor performance for degradation of phenol, as a model compound, was evaluated using aeroxide P25. Factors affecting the degradation efficiency were studied including catalyst loading, light intensity, initial pollutant concentration, oxidant addition and exposure time. Dissolved oxygen levels, temperature and pH were monitored through all the conducted tests. The water-bell photoreactor performance was compared with other photoreactors using benchmarks: the degradation rate constant and the reactor throughput.

The latest methods development has demonstrated the potential to grow ultrathin Mo2C domains of high quality through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) over melted substrates, together with graphene. This progress provides new routes towards the preparation of vertical Van der Waals (VdW) heterostructures. In the present work we provide a detailed study of the dominant growth mechanisms of pure Mo2C crystals as well as graphene/Mo2C heterostructures. The findings reveal that the methane flow controls the growth of graphene/Mo2C heterostructures or pure Mo2C domains, while the high growth temperature and presence of hydrogen significantly increase the growth rate. Additionally, the presence of graphene serves as a blocking diffusion layer, permitting the growth of ultrathin crystals and increasing their nucleation density.

The simpler way to solve the problem is to perform RES curtailment, but this is not the right decision from an environmental point-of-view. In this context, the storage alternative is becoming more and more a cost-effective option. This paper presents an integrated techno-economic model, whose purpose is to come up with the optimal configuration of a Water Pumped Storage System (WPSS). The expected output is the WPSS design configuration, i.e. the pump number and size and turbine number and size, which leads to the maximum Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment project. To reach the proposed objective, the model uses meta-heuristic optimization techniques, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), with a Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch module (UC + ED) of the thermal-based electrical generation units, in order to calculate the system operational costs.

The booming field of solar energy enables the solar energy utilization, and open new opportunities within commercial and research development programs. Emphasis has been given to the new development of novel technologies that are more efficient for capturing, storing and utilizing solar energy that can store thermal energy at high temperature and across a wide temperature range. Also, the coupling of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and storage systems presents a significant potential to improve the capture, utilization and storage of solar energy which enhances the reliability of alternative energy options and diversifying away from fossil fuels to mitigate environmental impacts while ensuring the continuous provision of power to meet the growing demand.

Environmental planetary boundaries mark out the safe operation space for human activities. The planetary boundary framework has yet to be fully incorporated into global energy scenario modeling, where the emphasis has been almost solely on CO2 emission mitigation. Stress on biochemical flows, land use change, biodiversity, ocean and climate systems are often neglected. Concurrently, social and economic aspects, such as limiting air pollution, providing universal access to modern energy services and improving energy efficiency by electrification of energy services are emerging as new paradigms in energy scenario modeling frameworks. However, ethical choices, such as current and future generations’ access to preserved ecosystems, aversion of energy resource risks, preventing resource use conflicts, and negative impacts on human lives from energy extraction and use are not usually discussed or justified in energy scenario modeling. All investigated global energy transition scenarios failed to adequately describing the critical roles of flexibility in future energy systems based on high shares of renewable energy, such as storage, grids, demand response, supply side management and sector coupling.

There is thus a need for a model that can calculate the surface temperature using only widely available weather data, thermal properties of the ground, and surface properties. The vegetated/permeable surface energy balance (VP-SEB) model introduced here requires no a priori knowledge of soil temperature or moisture at any depth. It combines a two-layer characterization of the soil column following the heat conservation law with a sinusoidal function to estimate deep soil temperature, and a simplified procedure for calculating moisture content. A physically based solution is used for each of the energy balance components allowing VP-SEB to be highly portable. VP-SEB was tested using field data measuring bare loess desert soil in dry weather and following rain events. Modeled hourly surface temperature correlated well with the measured data (r2 = 0.95 for a whole year), with a root-mean-square error of 2.77 K. The model was used to generate input for a pedestrian thermal comfort study using the Index of Thermal Stress (ITS). The simulation shows that the thermal stress on a pedestrian standing in the sun on a fully paved surface, which may be over 500 W on a warm summer day, may be as much as 100 W lower on a grass surface exposed to the same meteorological conditions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.","Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture; Sol-air temperature; Storage flux; Sub-surface ground temperature","air temperature; energy balance; evapotranspiration; micrometeorology; soil moisture; soil temperature; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023747968

The ability of a commercially available charcoal to be dispersed in water was evaluated by analysing the rheological behaviour of the resulting charcoal water slurries (ChWS). The charcoal was ground in a conventional ball mill and dispersed in water with the aid of different surfactants. The effects of the most relevant factors influencing the rheological properties of the suspensions were evaluated, including: (i) type of surfactant and its added amount on the fuel viscosity (η) at a given solids fraction; (ii) the charcoal content, which should be as high as possible. The results enabled selecting the most efficient surfactant and its optimal amount required for minimising the fuel viscosity (η) and enhancing the stability of the suspensions.

The favorable interfacial interactions promoted the graphene surface to control the aggregation of layered MoS2 and uniform decoration of in situ formed NiS nanoparticles was achieved in the resulting nanohybrids.

Copper benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxilate (Cu-BTC) is one of the most widely studied metal-organic framework (MOF)-based porous solids, including its potential application for hydrogen storage. Its iron analogue, Fe-BTC has received relatively minor attention probably because it is obtained as a material of low crystallinity and this is a handicap to understand the involved adsorption interactions. In this contribution, we are reporting the implications of their structural differences on the hydrogen storage capacity, with emphasis in the probable guest-host interactions that determine the adsorption process and considering the structural features of them. The samples to be study were prepared using a solvothermal route and then characterized from infrared (IR), Mössbauer, and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, thermogravimetric (TG) curves and adsorption data. Both, the H2 adsorption isotherms and the corresponding adsorption heats show significant differences for the two materials, which are explained according to their structural differences. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption forces; Adsorption heats; Cu-BTC; Fe-BTC; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage; MOF","Crystalline materials; Digital storage; Gas adsorption; Metalorganic frameworks; Organometallics; X ray diffraction; Adsorption force; Adsorption heats; Adsorption interactions; Guest-host interactions; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Metal organic framework; Powder X ray diffraction; Hydrogen storage; copper derivative; hydrogen; iron derivative; adsorption; Article; chemical structure; infrared spectroscopy; molecular interaction; priority journal; storage; thermogravimetry; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045399828

Towards the synthesis of prenylated phloroglucinol derivatives, 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acetophenone is required as an intermediate. Herein, this was synthesised by a tandem Claisen-Cope rearrangement reaction on 2,4-bis(methoxymethoxy)-6-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy)acetophenone and a subsequent hydrolysis to remove protecting groups. This reaction yielded the desired product as well as three by-products. Two of these by-products were isomeric chromane derivatives (2 and 3) and the third was a methoxy derivative (4). These compounds have been studied by single crystal X-ray crystallography and DFT methods. Compound (2) crystallised in the P21/c space group with two hydrogen-bonded molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z = 8). Compound (4) crystallised in the Pbca space group with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (Z = 8). Both compounds formed extensive supramolecular structures supported by hydrogen bonds in the solid state. Compound (2) forms a simple one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded chain co-linear with the a-axis. Compound (4) forms a two-dimensional supramolecular structure comprising “pentameric” hydrogen-bonded motifs linked by additional H-bonds to form the supramolecular structure. Both structures showed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the acetyl oxygen and adjacent OH group. DFT simulations were used to probe the relative energies of the molecules and hydrogen bonds. These simulations showed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond has a substantial stabilising effect with an interaction strength of 70.64 kJ mol−1. The formation of the hydrogen-bonded dimer of (2) from which the supramolecular structure is formed has a ΔHassoc constant of −42.32 kJ mol−1, illustrating that the formation of the hydrogen-bonded structure is energetically favourable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conformational analysis; DFT; Prenyl; Supramolecular; X-ray crystallography","Complexation; Dimers; Hydrogen storage; Ketones; Molecules; Plant extracts; Self assembly; Single crystals; Supramolecular chemistry; X ray analysis; X ray crystallography; X rays; Conformational analysis; Hydrogen bonded molecules; Hydrogen-bonded structures; Intra-molecular hydrogen bonds; Phloroglucinol derivatives; Prenyl; Single crystal X-ray crystallography; Supramolecular; Hydrogen bonds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047427735

Star Trek also addresses the energy topic multiple times and sketches a modern and powerful energy system, which provides seemingly abundant energy but also comes with significant risk of harming its users. In this chapter, we will address the properties of energy generation and storage in Star Trek and compare it to existing systems, which are in use or planned. The most prominent example are the fictional warp cores which power a starship's warp drive but also generally serve as power plant on the ship. Several episodes indicate that operating a warp core is a delicate control effort with risk of uncontrolled reaction depicted as ""warp core breach"", which shows a number of parallels to properties of modern day nuclear power plants. On the other hand, warp systems are typically explained as reaction chamber for matter-antimatter annihilation, which makes them a very powerful battery rather than a primary generator of energy. This raises the question how the energy for generating the antimatter was produced in the first place. An investigation on the required power vs. the available power on a planet such as Earth reveals a big gap between Star Trek fiction and possible reality. Furthermore, we will analyze the energy and power requirements of an exemplary Star Trek spaceship with a focus on the impulse propulsion system. Based on this analysis we will elaborate the properties of an energy system that is able to fulfill these requirements and look for promising technologies allowing the realization of such a system in the future. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

The target of incorporating rigid units, to yield thermosets with high thermal and mechanical performance, both in the biobased unsaturated polyester (UP) and reactive diluent (RD) while retaining miscibility was successfully achieved. The biobased unsaturated polyester thermosets were prepared by varying the content of isosorbide, 1,4-butanediol, maleic anhydride, and succinic anhydride in combination with the reactive diluent isosorbide-methacrylate (IM). Isosorbide was chosen as the main component in both the UP and the RD to enhance the rigidity of the formed thermosets, to overcome solubility issues commonly associated with biobased UPs and RDs and volatility and toxicity associated with styrene as RD. All UPs had good solubility in the RD and the viscosity of the mixtures was primarily tuned by the feed ratio of isosorbide but also by the amount of maleic anhydride. The flexural modulus and storage modulus were tailorable by altering the monomer composition The fabricated thermosets had superior thermal and mechanical properties compared to most biobased UP thermosets with thermal stability up to about 250 °C and a storage modulus at 25 °C varying between 0.5 and 3.0 GPa. These values are close to commercial petroleum-based UP thermosets.

Potential advantages of using plasma for gasification are summarized, fundamental chemistry of the plasma gasification process as well as basic thermodynamics, the energy balance, and the kinetics of the process are described. Examples of results of thermal plasma gasification of various organic wastes are presented. Produced gas compositions for different feed materials are shown, including sawdust, wooden pellets, brown coal, polyethylene, and pyrolytic oil produced from car tires. The results show that it is possible to produce syngas of high hydrogen and carbon monoxide content, with low levels of contaminants, and with a high calorific value.

It was found that the total process is exergonic and that the hydrogen diffusion occurs with very low energy barriers. The process has a hydrogen detachment energy barrier lower than the one of the uncatalyzed AB, and that is easily overcome by the energy expelled in the previous stage of formation of the initial activated species.

We utilized sugar-based surfactants including Quillaja Saponin (QS), Sucrose Monopalmitate (SMP), and Octyl Modified Starch (OMS). The outcomes presented that nanoemulsions could be successfully formed. Whereas oregano emulsions stabilized by SMP exposed to salt and acidic pH were highly unstable, QS could form more stable colloidal systems. Oregano nanoemulsions containing a very low amount of sunflower oil (SO) were not susceptible to Ostwald ripening during 60 days of storage at 20 °C. The optimization of the production process through response surface methodology revealed that incorporation of only 6.9 wt % SO at a microfluidization pressure of 73.5 MPa was sufficient to form a long-term stable nanoemulsion with no changes in antibacterial activity. This work gives valuable and practical information to produce a natural antimicrobial agent potentially applicable in food and beverage, as well as cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Practical applications: Recently, there has been a great demand by not only food consumers but also manufacturers for products containing natural ingredients. In this study, a promising nanoemulsion delivery system for oregano as an essential oil model with long-term stability using a biosurfactant (Quillaja Saponin) was successfully produced by microfluidization. We optimized the formulation in terms of energy requirement and costs, which are important factors from an industry point of view.

Another application may be the moderation of temperature increases in concrete encasements of radionuclides during their decay. The phase-change behavior of a material is determined by its heat capacity and the peak it exhibits near a phase change. We analyze the behavior of such peaks for a selected PCM at heating rates varying between 0.1∘C·min-1 and 1∘C·min-1, corresponding in real situations to different decay rates of radionuclides.

In this context, Mn substituted BiFeO3 was synthesized using sol–gel accompanying auto-combustion method. X-ray diffraction of the calcined BiFe1−xMnxO3 samples exhibited a crystalline nature and phase purity of the samples. Among the samples, BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 depicted more stable rhombohedral structure as compared to BiFeO3, whereas mixed phases of orthorhombic and monoclinic were observed in BiFe1−xMnxO3 at 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1.0. Surface morphology, as seen using a field emission electron microscope, revealed decreasing granular size which interpreted modified magnetic attributes examined by vibrating sample magnetometer for specific Mn contents. Elemental wt% were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. To extract the optimized results from Mn substituted BiFeO3, magnetodielectric coupling was examined as well under 6 kOe applied magnetic field which declared BiFe0.8Mn0.2O3 as the most optimized composition.

Sweden has appropriate infrastructure for handling food waste in place, recycling nutrients and energy, but there is still great potential to move upwards in the waste hierarchy and prevent waste. An important step in designing waste reduction measures is to identify and quantify the importance of different risk factors, in order to start by solving the problems with the greatest potential benefit and the lowest cost. This study sought to identify and quantify risk factors for food waste generation in public sector canteens by correlation analyses and statistical modelling. The empirical material comprised food waste quantification data for 177 kitchens in the Swedish municipalities of Falun, Malmö Sala, Uppsala and Örebro, supplemented with quantifiable information about the kitchens obtained using a questionnaire. According to the findings, plate waste in schools and pre-schools increases with children's age. Schools with older children could potentially reduce plate waste by introducing more structured lunch breaks. Plate waste also increases with dining hall capacity, potentially due to rising stress and noise levels. Both plate waste and serving waste increase with greater overproduction, as indicated by calculated portion size, and could be reduced by schools and pre-schools estimating their daily number of diners and their diners’ food intake more accurately. As serving waste was significantly higher in satellite units (which bring in cooked food), due to lack of cooling and storage possibilities, than in production units (which cook, serve and sometimes deliver hot food), satellite units in particular would benefit from more accurate quantification of the food required on a daily basis. These findings were confirmed by multiple linear regression models, which explained >85% of the variation in plate, serving and total waste per portion. When used for quantification after changing the value of different factors, these models confirmed that the main factors influencing serving waste and total waste per portion were type of kitchen and rate of overproduction, while plate waste was mainly influenced by children's age and factors indicating a stressful dining environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Food waste cause; Food waste measurement; Plate waste; Public kitchen; Serving waste","Digital storage; Kitchens; Linear regression; Risk assessment; Thermal processing (foods); Accurate quantifications; Correlation analysis; Different risk factors; Food waste; Multiple linear regression models; Potential benefits; Statistical modelling; Waste hierarchies; Food storage; food waste; recycling; risk factor; waste management; Article; catering service; cooking; correlation analysis; environmental stress; food intake; food waste; kindergarten; kitchen; meal; noise; portion size; primary school; priority journal; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; risk factor; statistical model; Sweden; aged; child; human; school; waste management; Sweden; Aged; Child; Food Services; Humans; Lunch; Risk Factors; Schools; Sweden; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047063838

To harness this opportunity, this study reviews how a typical integrated solid waste management system (ISWM) may be reconfigured into one with lower operation costs and minimal GHG emissions. First, four literatures which conducted various environmental analyses on several ISWM scenarios for municipal solid waste management were reviewed to determine which ISWM among them had the lowest quantity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2eq. Then, a simplified comparative economic analysis was conducted on the operation strategies of five different commercial solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) technologies. This economic analysis was then followed with frugal recommendations on how best an SS-AD system can be incorporated into the ‘least GHG emitting’ ISWM to lower the operational costs of the ISWM system. The final ISWM superstructure recommended by this study included a centralized section for commercial MSW waste, and a decentralized section primarily for residential MSW waste, and the superstructure was recommended for densely poulated urban areas.

During obesity, an impairment in the capacity of SAT to store triglycerides and synthesize adiponectin is associated with increased free fatty acids (FFA) release, leading to VAT hypertrophy and hepatic and skeletal muscle lipotoxicity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) may be involved in SAT dysfunction during obesity. The objectives of this study were to assess UPR activation and adiponectin synthesis in: 1) SAT and VAT from mice exposed to acute pharmacologic or chronic obesity-induced ER stress and in 2) cultured mice primary mature adipocytes or adipocytes differentiated in vitro from SAT and VAT exposed to tunicamycin or thapsigargin. Mice fed a high-fat diet developed obesity, increased FFA and lower circulating adiponectin in association with lower adiponectin synthesis and increased UPR markers in SAT. Mice subjected to acute ER stress by pioglitazone administration and a low-dose tunicamycin injection presented a maladaptive UPR activation in SAT along with reduced adiponectin synthesis and secretion and increased lipolysis with respect to VAT, associated with lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver. Primary adipocytes and adipocytes differentiated from SAT exposed to pharmacologic ER stress also developed maladaptive UPR, along with reduced adiponectin synthesis and increased lipolysis with respect to those from VAT. Our results indicate that compared to VAT, SAT is more susceptible to ER stress, leading to increased lipolysis and reduced adiponectin synthesis and secretion. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adiponectin; endoplasmic reticulum stress; lipolysis; obesity; subcutaneous adipose tissue; tunicamycin; visceral adipose tissue","adiponectin; leptin; pioglitazone; thapsigargin; tunicamycin; adiponectin; Adipoq protein, mouse; adipocyte; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; body weight; cell differentiation; controlled study; endoplasmic reticulum stress; intra-abdominal fat; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipolysis; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein secretion; protein synthesis; skeletal muscle; subcutaneous fat; unfolded protein response; animal; C57BL mouse; female; metabolism; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; subcutaneous fat; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Animals; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; Lipolysis; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Subcutaneous Fat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044428453

Day to day, there is an increasing demand for data processing and storage, thus cloud computing has evolved, supported by the continuous growth of internet services worldwide. This has led to significant energy consumption, accompanied with serious environmental impacts, such as earth resources spending, greenhouse gas emissions, electronic equipment waste and environmental pollution. Various metrics have been proposed to evaluate efficiency in data centers, aiming to develop energy conscious behavior and resources savings, however they are falling short, when assessing sustainability of a data center in a holistic view. Sustainability aims at preserving the environment, along with economic, operational and social longevity. The creation of sustainable data centers, using renewable energy, optimizing energy efficiency and minimizing resources waste, makes both environmental and business sense. In this paper, we present a new methodology, for assessing sustainability based on five major quantifiable elements, composed by different influencing factors, with the aim to obtain a holistic approach.

Therefore, adequate models generated by system identification are essential in order to analyze resonances, and especially to design solutions to mitigate these adverse effects by means of control. In this paper, the resonating mechanical driveline of a hybrid city bus is identified by feeding different excitation signals, such as a pseudo-random binary signal, stepped sine, and chirp to the driveline, and by measuring the frequency response at a standstill and during on-road experiments. The identification experiments are conducted by operating the bus in the series electric hybrid mode, that is, in an operating mode that corresponds to a full electric mode powered by energy storages. Resonating two-mass system models are parametrized based on the obtained frequency responses and used to validate the identification experiments. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Driveline resonance; hybrid bus; parameter estimation; system identification","Frequency response; Hybrid vehicles; Identification (control systems); Religious buildings; Resonance; Drivelines; Excitation signals; Experimental identification; Hybrid bus; Mechanical parts; Passenger discomfort; Pseudo random binary signals; Two mass systems; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038856279

Although they offer superior energy efficiency over the conventional memories, benefiting from approximate computing approach, some novel techniques can be applied to lower the power consumption even further. In this brief, we propose a progressive scaling scheme for spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) arrays, by which the power consumption is reduced at the expense of small quality degradation. According to the proposed approach, access transistors in STT-RAM cells are scaled based on an optimized scaling factor, where least significant bits and most significant bits come with different bit error rates in the data word.

Inspired by ruminants, bacteria, or fungi, many methods to overcome this hardly digestable lignocellulose structure have already been proposed. For its ability to possibly recover energy, under-hot-water maceration that is followed by a steam-explosion is often used in biogas plants, bioethanol refineries and even during the processing of sludge from sewage treatment plants. Quality indicators of organic matter in the phytomass, however, are variable in relation to the storage method, fertilization, the uniqueness of the growing season, and the like. Therefore, the processing parameters of chosen technologies should always be precisely tailored to avoid the formation of substances that would inhibit subsequent processing.

This paper presents a techno-economic optimization model, to perform the optimal sizing of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind/hydrogen/battery system. Optimum sizing has been applied to a system consisting of an induction motor coupled to a centrifugal pump, located at Sahline-Tunisia. The optimal-cost design and the new suitable power management approach are the two main objectives. The optimal sizing is assessed on the basis of technical (the Deficiency of Power Supply Probability, the Relative Excess Power Generated) and economic (the Energy Cost as well as the Total Net Present Cost) criteria. The power management strategy optimizes how the spare energy is used. The results highlight the important role of the hybridization of renewable energy sources, photovoltaic and wind turbine, in reducing the cost of the system. It is also noted that the hydrogen chain prolongs the life of the battery, preventing the massive use of the latter. The optimized sizing algorithm gives all the possible configurations of the hybrid system not only for a pumping system but also for any autonomous load located all over the world. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Energy management; Fuel cell/electrolyzer storage system; Hybrid photovoltaic/wind pumping system; Optimal sizing","Energy management; Fuel storage; Hybrid systems; Induction motors; Natural resources; Power management; Pumping plants; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Battery; Energy management strategies; Optimal sizing; Power management strategies; Pumping systems; Renewable energy source; Renewable power generation systems; Storage systems; Energy management systems; design method; fuel cell; integrated approach; methodology; numerical model; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; pumping; strategic approach; technical efficiency; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047384656

We used a low-energy N-ion beam to induce mutations in Thai jasmine rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. KDML 105) to improve the yield and seed quality. Seeds of BKOS6, a Thai jasmine rice mutant previously induced by ion beams, were re-bombarded with 60-kV-accelerated N-ions (N++N2 +) to fluences of 1–2 × 1016 ions/cm2. The resulting mutant, named HyKOS21, exhibited photoperiod insensitivity, semi-dwarfness, and high yield potential. Seed storability of the mutant was studied in natural and accelerated ageing conditions and compared to that of KDML 105 and six other Thai rice varieties. In both testing conditions, HyKOS21 mutant had the highest seed storability among the tested varieties. After storage in the natural condition for 18 months, HyKOS21 had a seed germination percentage nearly two times as that of the original KDML 105. Biochemical analysis showed that the lipid peroxidation level of the mutant seeds was the lowest among those of the tested varieties. Furthermore, an expression analysis of genes encoding lipoxygenase isoenzyme (lox1, lox2, and lox3) revealed that the mutant lacked expression of lox1 and lox2 and expressed only lox3 in seeds. These results may explain the improved seed longevity of the mutant after storage. This work provides further evidence of the modification of biological materials using a low-energy ion beam to produce rice mutants with improved yield and seed storability. The benefits of this technology, to create new varieties with improved values, could serve for local economic development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","High yield; Low-energy ion beam; Mutant; N-ion; Rice; Seed storability","Biotechnology; Economic and social effects; Gene expression; Heavy ions; High yield; Low energy ion beam; Mutant; Rice; Seed storability; Ion beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045472646

In cow milk, NMR-based metabolomics has gained important insight into the associations between metabolic/health status of the cow and the milk metabolite profile, and also the heritability of individual milk metabolites have been established through NMR-based metabolomics analyses. In processed milk such as UHT milk, NMR-based metabolomics can probe storage-induced chemical changes including formation of amino acids as a result of proteolysis, and in fermented dairy products, NMR-based metabolomics is recently established as a useful tool to study the fermentation process and elucidate synergistic and symbiotic microbial interactions. Based on correlation analyses between the cheese metabolome and sensory properties of soft cheese, specific metabolites of importance for cheese aroma have been identified. On meat, NMR metabolomics has been used to elucidate the associations between postmortem metabolism and subsequent meat quality development, where lactate and energy-rich phosphorous-containing metabolites are essential. Furthermore, NMR metabolomics has been applied to examine how the meat metabolite profile varies between species and breeds and as function of slaughter age and aging. In processed meat, NMR metabolomics of lipophilic meat extracts has been demonstrated to hold a promise for discrimination of nonirradiated and irradiated products. Overall, NMR-based metabolomics is found useful in a variety of applications on animal-based foods. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Animal species; Authenticity; Beef; Cheese; Duck; Fermentation; Irradiation; Lactosereduced milk; Magic-angle spinning; Mastitis; Meat aging; Meat proteolysis; Milk; Milk coagulation; Pork; Postmortem metabolism; Protected designation of origin (PDO); Somatic cell count","Animals; Authentication; Beef; Biomolecules; Cheeses; Fermentation; Fermented milk; Irradiation; Magic angle spinning; Meats; Metabolism; Metabolites; Physiology; Proteolysis; Sensory analysis; Animal species; Authenticity; Duck; Lactosereduced milk; Mastitis; Milk; Milk coagulation; Pork; Postmortem metabolisms; Protected designation of origins; Somatic cell count; Dairies",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054371799

This interaction results in an increase of the total surface area of hydrophobic sites and destabilizes the chains. Here, we make use of this phenomenon to drive the counterintuitive self-assembly of a PNIPAM-containing double-hydrophilic graft copolymer in water-ethanol mixtures at T ≪ LCST. Rheological frequency sweeps are used to quantify the distinct solvation states of PNIPAM at various temperatures and ethanol concentrations. The energy stored through elastic deformation at the de-mixing transition is simply related to the solvent binding. We find that the storage modulus decreases progressively, but nonlinearly with ethanol concentration, which evidences a preferential solvation pattern. Analogously, through a combination of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope analyses, we demonstrate that a low-temperature structure variation takes place by adding ethanol following a similar solvent-content morphology dependent model. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Acrylic monomers; Amides; Ethanol; Hydrophilicity; Mixing; Self assembly; Solutions; Solvation; Temperature; Double-hydrophilic copolymer; Ethanol concentrations; Ethanol water mixtures; Low-temperature structure; Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM); Preferential adsorption; Preferential solvation; Water ethanol mixtures; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047066512

In this paper, we present a study of elastic, magnetic, transport, and electronic properties of a family of magnetic skyrmions M2Mo3N (M = Fe, Co, Rh) along with their isotypic Ni2Mo3N compound by using density functional theory. The elastic constants and moduli of elasticity are calculated to analyze the stability of M2Mo3N. The noncentrosymmetric M2Mo3N crystals are found to be elastically stable and ductile in nature. The Vickers hardness values indicate that Fe2Mo3N and Ni2Mo3N are relatively hard, Co2Mo3N and Rh2Mo3N are relatively soft materials. The calculated Debye temperature from elastic constants of Rh2Mo3N is reasonably close to the experimental value. The calculated magnetic moment and polarization of M2Mo3N are consistent with the experimental results. The magnetic moment and polarization of Fe2Mo3N are 15.48μB and 62% respectively indicating that it is a potential candidate for applications in the magnetic storage, logic devices, and spintronics. The linear proportionality relation of electronic heat capacity with temperature is only held for Rh2Mo3N indicating its superconducting nature. The density of states at the Fermi energy of M2Mo3N is dominated by M-d and Mo-d orbitals. Rh2Mo3N crystal is found to be a moderately coupled superconductor.

These materials have tremendous impact on a variety of technologies, including memory and light-emitting devices, magnetic data storage, nanolithography, photo-electronic devices, MEMS devices, energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, actuators, sensors, and biomedicine. The growing interest in polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) in the last two decades has been mainly associated with their use as initial precursors for the synthesis of multifunctional materials. Polymer-derived ceramics, also known as preceramic organosilicon polymers, provide an effective, safe and rapid process for producing technical ceramics; the main advantages being processing (easy shaping/forming using polymeric processing techniques e.g. melt spinning, extrusion, injection molding, coating, and low firing temperatures) and desirable material properties. Polymer-derived ceramics have emerged as a promising class of ceramic materials, which are generally synthesized through controlled thermal degradation of polymeric precursors in inert atmosphere. This quick, straightforward polymer-to-ceramic conversion can be used to produce homogeneous and high-purity composite materials with a novel composition and exceptional properties. The incorporation of fillers, either active or passive, into the preceramic polymers can induce various functionalities and generate a wide range of compositions and ceramic morphologies, possessing outstanding properties. The concept of fillers provides an invaluable tool for obtaining not only crack-free monolithic pieces, but also modifies the chemistry and architecture of PDCs. Thus far, the majority of research has been directed toward designing and engineering organosilicon materials for structural applications, rather than biological, electronic and magnetic applications. The motivation of the present review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of all processing strategies for the modification of preceramic polymers and resultant functional properties of polymer-derived ceramic composites. This review discusses the available literature focusing mainly on: (i) biological tests; (ii) filler-free and filler-containing polymers for electronic applications; (iii) magnetic properties of metallopolymers and filler-containing PDCs; and (iv) optical properties.

This allows for the consideration of the full drive cycle and respective efficiency map for every motor design. The prediction error of the ANFIS is minimized by employing appropriate membership functions, initial training data, and an adaptive learning scheme via iterative training. The efficiency map is then implemented in a vehicle dynamic model to compute the total consumed energy over the driving cycle. The optimization profile accounts for total energy efficiency, torque density, and additionally considers complementary design criteria via an a posteriori selection procedure on the resulting Pareto set.

The fast responding devices are deployed to achieve a swift frequency regulation in transient state. In steady state, these devices are returned to their normal operating condition by changing loading conditions of the DZ without employing interdevice communication. The proposed control strategy not only achieves frequency regulation in adherence to IEEE Standard 1547, but also maintains customers' quality of service while manipulating TCLs for frequency regulation.

Over the past few years, electrification of remote communities including efficient on-site energy resources utilization has achieved high progress.

The main objective of this paper is to design an optimal economic power supply from a hybrid standalone energy system (HSES). The system is intended to cover the energy required for a desalination unit (DU) installed in a farm in Noubarya, Egypt. The proposed system consists of PV panels, wind turbines (WT), batteries, and DG. DU load is about 105.6 kWh/day rated power with 6.6 kW peak load operating 16 h a day. The objective of system optimization is to reach the suitable size of each component and the control strategy that provide reliable, efficient, and cost effective system using net present cost (NPC) as a criterion. The harmonization of different energy sources, energy storage and load requirements is a challenging task. Thus, the performance of various possible configurations is investigated, using iHOGA software that is based on genetic algorithm (GA). In this study the achieved optimum configuration is further improved by adapting the daily load pattern to the periods of high renewable generated energy to increase direct energy utilization rather than charging batteries.

HESS consists of fuel cell (FC) as the main source and battery and ultracapacitor (UC) as secondary sources. Each source is connected to DC bus via DC–DC converter: FC is connected to DC bus via boost converter, while battery and UC are connected to DC bus via buck–boost converter. Based on the nonlinear behavior of power sources and converters, a dynamic model of the system is developed. A nonlinear control technique based on Lyapunov theory is applied to meet the following requirements: (1) accurate DC bus voltage regulation and (2) rapid tracking of battery and UC current to their desired reference values. Both mathematical analysis and simulations are performed to prove the asymptotic convergence of the proposed controller.

The examined LFR has an inverted flat plate receiver with a 36 m2 total collecting aperture area and is coupled to a storage tank of 1 m3 volume. This system is investigated experimentally for daily operation in the period from May to October for the climate conditions of Athens (Greece), using water as the working fluid (temperature levels up to 100 °C). Moreover, a detailed mathematical model for the prediction of the instantaneous and of the daily performance is developed. This model is validated with the experimental results for 52 operating days and it estimates the daily useful energy production with a mean error of 3%. This modeling is based on the energy balance on the collector loop and the storage tank. The emphasis is given on the determination of the optical losses of the collector, which are associated with the sun position during the day. It is found that the maximum useful heat production is about 8.4 kW, while the maximum daily heat production is about 260 MJ.

The hydroxide anions, while transported from the cathode to the anode, attack the positively charged functional groups in the polymer membrane, neutralizing it and suppressing its anion-conducting capability. In recent years, several new quaternary ammonium salts have been proposed to address this challenge, but while they perform well in ex-situ chemical studies, their performance is very limited in real fuel cell studies. While cation chemistry dictates the intrinsic chemical stability of the anion conducting ionomeric materials, it was recently shown that chemical degradation is significantly influenced by the hydration level at which the fuel cell operates. Understanding the principles governing the chemical degradation under fuel cell operation, and its critical relationship with the hydration levels in the operating fuel cell electrodes will facilitate the path to overcome the challenge and finally develop and demonstrate highly stable AEMFC devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045556408

This support from the government usually comes with an obligation for the main electricity supplier to purchase the excessive power produced by small independent generators. In this paper the impact brought by different demand sector profiles on the daily operational cost and optimal scheduling of grid connected photovoltaic systems with bidirectional power flow is analysed for the specific case of Bloemfontein in South Africa. For this purpose, residential, commercial and industrial daily load curves are used to estimate daily load demands. For comparison purposes, three load profiles representing the demands from the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, have been used and normalized to display the same daily energy consumption level with different demand patterns. The results of the simulations, obtained using Matlab 2016, have revealed that for the same energy consumption and renewable resources, the running expenses of any proposed scheme are mainly dependent on the demand sector. Consequently, it can be recommended that in Bloemfontein and South Africa in general more focus should be on implementing grid-connected renewable technologies with storage systems on the commercial and industrial sector instead of on the residential sector. © 2018","Demand sectors; Distributed generation; Grid-connected; Optimal scheduling; Time of used","Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Housing; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Solar energy; Bi-directional power flows; Demand sectors; Energy consumption levels; Grid-connected; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Optimal scheduling; South African government; Time of used; Electric load dispatching; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy use; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; Bloemfontein; Free State; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045471459

Single-axis tracking PV and battery storage contribute the highest to the final LCOE of the system. By 2050, single-axis tracking PV accounts for 79% of the total electricity generation. Battery storage accounts for 30% of the total electricity demand. Battery storage and desalination plants provide additional flexibility to the energy system. Through sensitivity analysis, it is found that decreasing the capex of desalination plants results in lower full load hours (FLH) and a decrease in battery storage output. This results in lower energy system costs. However, the SWRO capex has to be reduced by 50% to achieve a reduction of 1% in SWRO FLH and a 2.1% in the annualised energy system costs. This is because it is preferable to run the expensive SWRO plants in baseload operation for total energy system cost reasons. Flexibility to the energy system can be provided at a lower cost by solar PV and battery storage than by SWRO plants and water storage. Decreasing battery capex reduces the flexibility of desalination plants further, increases single-axis tracking PV capacities, decreases wind and CCGT capacities, and ultimately results in lower LCOE. These insights enable to establish the least cost pathway for Saudi Arabia to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","100% renewable energy; Battery; Energy transition; Flexibility; Saudi Arabia; Water storage","Combined cycle power plants; Costs; Desalination; Electric batteries; Gas industry; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Battery; Energy transitions; Flexibility; Renewable energies; Saudi Arabia; Water storage; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044783838

In-between-meals that are texture modified are of particular importance for people suffering from dysphagia. To meet their adequate daily amount of food intake they are recommended to eat 3–5 in-between-meals daily. The aim of the current pilot study was to identify the most liked in-between-meals for old adults based on flavour and describe the basic sensory properties of these in-between-meals. Following, the equality between flavour and appearance-based preferences was investigated. Methods: From three nursing homes 30 old adults aged 70 years or older suffering from dysphagia were recruited. They were assessing 20 texture modified in-between-meals based on their flavour and appearance on a 3 point hedonic scale. Results: When participants were asked to assign liking based on flavour, the most liked in-between-meals were frozen, cold and sweet (vanilla ice cream, strawberry parfait and panna cotta). These meals were among the in-between-meals richest in fat and energy. Liking based on flavour and appearance was equal in 18 out of 20 samples. Furthermore, nutritional and sensory characteristics of the preferred meals were described. Conclusion: Flavour and sensory-based ranking of in-between-meals opens the possibility to design new in-between-meals to old adults with dysphagia, by choosing the most liked in-between-meals to offer the target group. © 2018 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Eating Validation Scheme (EVS); Liking; Minimal Eating Observational Form (MEOF); Nursing home residents; Protein enriched products; Undernutrition","aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; color; dementia; dysphagia; Eating Validation Scheme; female; flavor; food composition; food storage; food texture; human; major clinical study; male; Minimal Eating Observational Form; nursing home; nutritional assessment; Parkinson disease; questionnaire; taste; very elderly; administration and dosage; age; aging; caloric intake; comparative study; diet therapy; dietary reference intake; dysphagia; fast food; feeding behavior; geriatric assessment; home for the aged; malnutrition; nutritional status; nutritional value; pathophysiology; patient attitude; patient satisfaction; philosophy; pilot study; protein intake; psychology; treatment outcome; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Deglutition Disorders; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Malnutrition; Nursing Homes; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Philosophy; Pilot Projects; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Snacks; Taste; Taste Perception; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044598073

As a result, cellular operators are increasingly deploying renewable energy (RE) sources in BSs as a promising way to reduce the on-grid consumption and operational expenditure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework on green energy driven cellular networks aiming to maximize the utilization of the green energy and minimize the grid energy consumption considering stochastic traffic demand profile. Each BS is equipped with renewable energy generators, such as solar panel along with a set of batteries as an energy storage device and also connected to commercial grid supply. In addition, joint transmission (JT) coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission technique is integrated with the proposed model for selecting the best serving BSs for a user equipment (UE). The prime goal is to quantify the EE of various selection schemes namely, distance based, SINR based and SINR–distance based JT CoMP techniques under the proposed network model. Provision of sleep mode approach in BSs is also considered.

Thus, the utilization of renewable energy sources in the building sector is vital in order to achieve the sustainability. The objective of this work is to present a novel solar-driven trigeneration system ideal for building applications which produces heating, cooling and electricity. This system includes parabolic trough collectors, an absorption heat pump operating with LiBr-H2O and a turbine. More specifically, the produced superheated steam from the generator is separated into two quantities: the first one goes to the condenser (heating production) and to the evaporator (cooling production), while the other to the turbine for electricity production. An important advantage of this system is the possibility to produce different proportions of the useful products. Parabolic trough collectors of 100 m2 collecting area are coupled to a storage tank of 5 m3 and this sub-system feeds the generator with heat input. For the typical case of 80% steam fraction to the turbine, the electricity production is 7.16 kW, the heating production is 9.35 kW, the cooling production is 8.55 kW and the system exergetic efficiency is 9.80%.

Stand-alone microgrids present challenges regarding guaranteeing electricity supply and increasing the reliability of the system under the uncertainties introduced by the renewable power sources and the stochastic demand of the consumers.

A microgrid composed of PV system, battery bank, DC bus, and loads is modeled using PSCAD/EMTDC computer package. The impact of SFCL on battery current and its rate of rising is obtained under different battery conditions. Moreover, the change of battery state of charge after using SFCL is highlighted.

In EM-WNSNs, nano-sinks that aggregate data from nanosensors to the Internet of Things (IoT) gateway collectively form a backhaul tier of EM-WNSNs. Unlike the data tier composed of densely deployed nanosensors that are closely connected, the backhaul tier consisting of less dense nano-sinks is highly vulnerable to the dynamic channel states of THz band that is sensitive to the surrounding humidity change. Considering the limited energy storage of nano-devices, an energy-efficient forwarding scheme that adapts to dynamic channel states is needed to ensure both connectivity and efficiency of data transfers over the backhaul. Current channel-aware approaches are based on complex hardware support that cannot be deployed on nano-devices due to the size constraints. To solve this problem, the lightweight time-to-live (TTL)-based efficient forwarding (TEForward) has been proposed for the backhaul tier of multihop polling-based EM-WNSNs. In TEForward, nano-sinks select forwarders and direct packets based on the duplicate counts and TTL values of polling beacons which reflect the latest network topology. In this paper, we develop a TEForward scheme for EM-WNSNs with multiple coordinated IoT gateways. This TEForward scheme has low complexity and resource demand and achieves high energy efficiency that is 1.4% below the optimum. © 2018 IEEE.","Dynamic channel; forwarding; Internet of nano Things; nanonetworks","Complex networks; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Nanosensors; Nanotechnology; Dynamic channels; forwarding; Forwarding schemes; High energy efficiency; Internet of thing (IOT); Multi-hop polling; Nano-networks; Sensing resolution; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043373830

We investigated if young adult men and women conceived by ICSI have a normal body fat patterning and adipocytokine production. Design: Cohort study. Patients: One hundred twenty-seven young adults conceived by ICSI and 138 peers born after spontaneous conception. Measurements: Anthropometric parameters (skinfold thickness, hip and waist circumferences), dual X-ray absorptiometry (whole body and regional) measurements and adipocytokine levels (leptin and adiponectin) were analysed in relation to fertility markers (serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B). Results: While at age 18 years, a normal body fat distribution and normal leptin and adiponectin production was found in both male and female ICSI offspring, young men conceived by ICSI had a higher peripheral fat deposition in comparison with spontaneously conceived peers. No correlation between AMH and inhibin B with leptin or adiponectin was observed.

It is thus important to optimize the size of hybrid microgrid system (HMS) components, including storage, to determine system cost and reliability. In this paper, optimal sizing of a PV/wind/diesel HMS with battery storage is conducted using the Multi-Objective Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (MOSaDE) algorithm for the city of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. Using the multi-objective optimization approach, the objectives are treated simultaneously and independently, thereby leading to a reduction in computational time. One of the main criteria to consider when designing and optimizing the HMS is the energy management strategy, which is required to coordinate the different units comprising the HMS. The multi-objective optimization approach is then used to analyze the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), the Cost of Electricity (COE), and the Renewable Factor (RF) in relation to HMS cost and reliability and is tested using three case studies involving differing house numbers. Results verify its application in optimizing the HMS and in its practical implementation. In addition, optimization results using the proposed approach provided a set of design solutions for the HMS, which will assist researchers and practitioners in selecting the optimal HMS configuration. Moreover, it is important to select optimally sized HMS components to ensure that all load demands are met at the minimum energy cost and high reliability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Differential evolution algorithm; Hybrid system; Optimization; PV; Renewable energy; Wind energy","Battery storage; Costs; Electric power systems; Energy management; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability; Solar power generation; Wind power; Differential evolution algorithms; Energy management strategies; Loss of power supply probability; Minimum energy costs; Renewable energies; Self-adaptive differential evolution algorithms; Self-adaptive differential evolutions; Solar photovoltaic power; Evolutionary algorithms; algorithm; alternative energy; design; optimization; photovoltaic system; reliability analysis; smart grid; wind power; Madinah; Saudi Arabia; Yanbu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042882244

Among different RE technologies, hydrokinetic is a promising technology that has proved to generate electricity cheaper than solar and wind technologies. Among different energy storage devices, pumped hydro storage (PHS) has proved to be the most cost-effective option. Due to rising electricity price, domestic farm-houses situated in close proximity to the flowing water resource can make use of a hydrokinetic-PHS system to reduce the electricity cost and to sell excess energy into the grid through feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme. This paper introduces an optimal energy management model for power dispatching within a grid-interactive micro-hydrokinetic pumped hydro storage (MHK-PHS) system. The aim is to minimize the grid consumption costs and to maximize the energy sales revenue by considering the weekdays and weekend time-of-use (TOU) tariffs. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the model since it allows most of the load power demand to be met by the RE systems during expensive peak-period as a means of minimizing the grid consumption costs. Most of the energy sales took place during standard and expensive peak periods as a means of maximizing the energy sales revenue. Additionally, the simulation results have shown that an energy saving potential of 100.1% and 104.23% can be achieved during high demand and low demand seasons, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management; Micro-hydrokinetic; Optimization; Pumped hydro storage","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy management; Optimization; Sales; Storage management; Water resources; Developing nations; Energy saving potential; Generate electricity; Hydro storage systems; Micro-hydrokinetic; Optimal power dispatch; Renewable energy technologies; Time of use (TOU) tariffs; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042686402

Nevertheless maintaining freshness and functional quality of diced onions is a challenge in the food industry. Thus it is important to know and model the influence of external factors on the product respiration phenomena in order to better control product deterioration. The respiration rate (RR) of diced red onions (Allium cepa L., cv. Vermelha da Póvoa) was studied over a period of storage time after dicing at different temperatures (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 °C) under a normal atmosphere. At each of the tested temperatures, RR for both O2 and CO2 showed an exponential increase over time. This effect was enhanced with temperature. It was further observed that both the initial RR and reaction rate constants changed with temperature according to an Arrhenius-type equation with identical activation energy. This effect was incorporated in the primary model and the fit of the global model to experimental data was good (R2 = 0.94), with normal distribution of the residuals and correlation coefficients between the model constants below 0.85. Results helped establish a global mathematical model describing RR dependency on temperature over a period of storage time after dicing onions that will allow for a proper package design of this product. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide production rate; Fresh-cut; Mathematical modelling; Minimally processed vegetables; Oxygen consumption rate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042366216

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies confirmed the glass-enzyme linkage. Dissolution of PS-glass in acidic and neutral pH is higher than that of alkaline pH. Some immobilization variables were optimized using statistical factorial design (Central Composite Design). Optimized immobilization variables enhanced the immobilization yield (IY) from 27.9 to 79.9% (2.9-fold). It was found that the immobilized enzyme had higher optimum temperature, higher half-life time (t1/2), lower activation energy (Ea), lower deactivation constant rate (kd) and higher decimal reduction time (D-values) within the temperature range of 40–60°C. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC) confirmed the thermalstability of the immobilized enzyme. The immobilized enzyme was stable at a wide pH range (5.0-8.0). Kinetic studies of starch hydrolysis demonstrated that immobilized enzyme had lower Michaelis constant (Km), maximum velocity (Vmax) and catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) values.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mobilization patterns on early and advanced juveniles—first free stage and one-gram juveniles—of redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus). A biochemical approach was used to analyse the organic carbon, total proteins, lipids and glycogen levels of the entire animal, and a histochemical approach was adopted to identify location of metabolites in the hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle. While starvation did not affect early juvenile protein levels, it showed a significant decrease in advanced juveniles. Histochemical analysis showed that lipid storage of hepatopancreas R cells was depleted near point of no return (PNR) and recovered after feeding. Glycogen storage was localized in the F cells of the hepatopancreas, and among muscle fibres of the abdomen, where after feeding, a pronounced accumulation was observed. Early and advanced juveniles of redclaw crayfish showed different patterns of consumption mainly related to the protein level, which was the most abundant reserve in advanced juveniles and the most consumed during starvation. Hepatopancreas R cells were confirmed as the principal lipid storage, whereas the abdominal muscle was the main glycogen storage. In crustacean aquaculture, the understanding of resistance to temporary feed deprivation is relevant to achieve an adequate feeding management, thereby avoiding the overfeeding and diminishing operating costs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","crustacean aquaculture; glycogen; hepatopancreas; histochemistry; lipids; muscle; point of no return",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031744628

Storage and alternative production of energy from fuels, such as methane, represents one of the many alternative approaches. Natural gas containing methane represents a powerful source of energy producing large volume of greenhouse gases. However, methane can be also produced in closed, CO2-neutral cycles. In our study, we compare detailed chemical composition of CH4 fuel produced in two different processes: Classical production of biogas in a rendering station, industrial wastewater treatment station and landfill gas station together with novel approach of artificial photosynthesis from CO2 over acidic anatase TiO2 in experimental apparatus developed in our laboratory. The analysis of CH4 fuel produced in these processes is important. Trace gaseous traces can be for example corrosive or toxic, low quality of the mixture suppresses effectivity of energy production, etc. In this analysis, we present a combination of two methods: High resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (HR-FTIR) suitable for the main component analysis; and the complementary extremely sensitive method of Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and gas chromatography (GC–MS), which are in turn best suited for trace analysis. The combination of these methods provides more information than any single of them would be able to and promises a new possible analytical approach to fuel and gaseous mixture analysis. © 2017","Biogas analysis; Carbon dioxide; FTIR; Global warming; Photocatalytic reduction; SIFT-MS","Artificial photosynthesis; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuel storage; Gas chromatography; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial water treatment; Mass spectrometry; Methane; Mixtures; Oxide minerals; Petroleum prospecting; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater treatment; Alternative energy source; Chemical compositions; Experimental apparatus; FTIR; Industrial wastewater treatment; Photocatalytic reduction; Selected ion flow tubes; SIFT-MS; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030854696

The calculations suggest that the Ti-BNNT assembly can attract small molecules and it has a good affinity towards H2 molecules.

Experimental test runs were carried out in a membrane unit to experimentally determine the amount of refrigerant produced at different operating temperatures. With the obtained information, an intermittent absorption cooling system was modelled at a larger scale using information from real solar collectors and considering a 1 m2 membrane area. According to the experimental performance of the desorber/condenser unit, after 4 h of operation, the total amount of refrigerant produced was 14.50, 11.59 and 7.20 kg for desorber temperatures of 95.1, 85.2 and 75.1 °C, respectively. The designed solar system was composed of a 0.3 m3 storage thermal tank, and 30.2, 25.6 and 20.9 m2 of solar collector area for each desorber thermal level. According to the simulation of the absorption cooling system, evaporator temperatures of 18 and 14 °C were achieved for desorber temperatures of 75.1 and 85.2 °C, while evaporator temperatures of 17 and 12 °C were obtained at 95.1 °C. The COPs were 0.15, 0.21 and 0.26, which increased according to the increase in the desorber temperatures. Based on the clear desorber/condenser tendencies obtained from the refrigerant production, additional absorption conditions were calculated and may be useful for future designs. The lowest evaporator temperature was 6 °C when the initial LiBr concentration was 54.83% w/w, instead of 50.30% w/w at a temperature of 95.1 °C; however, the COP decreased 33%. © 2018","Absorption systems; Air gap membrane distillation; Thermal solar energy; Water/LiBr mixture","Bromine compounds; Cooling systems; Distillation; Evaporators; Hydrophobicity; Lithium compounds; Membranes; Refrigerants; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Water absorption; Absorption system; Air gap membrane distillation; Evaporator temperature; Hydrophobic porous membranes; Membrane separation process; Operating temperature; Solar collector areas; Thermal solar energies; Absorption cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044514968

It was shown that it is a very effective catalyst for the reversible storage of hydrogen based on the formate-bicarbonate equilibrium. In this paper, we present a DFT investigation on the noninnocent behavior of the NHC ligand toward C-H activation of the N-ethyl side chain and its possible role in the hydrogen storage mechanism. After preliminary investigations, using both computations and NMR measurements, we conclude that the COD ligand leaves the precatalyst irreversibly and the C-H activation takes place on a monophosphine complex. Two main pathways are considered in which the active Ir(III) complexes are generated differently: One is the cyclometalation path involving the ethyl side chain, the other is the oxidative addition step of a water molecule which has a higher barrier but provide a more stable starting state. We find that though the latter, a catalytic cycle where a hydride is abstracted from formate and gets protonated by solvent molecules gives the lowest calculated energy barrier, +25.8 kcal mol-1. That is, avoiding further redox processes is preferred. There are other pathways involving thermodynamically accessible C-H activated iridacycles but those involve slightly higher overall activation barriers due to the required Ir(I)/Ir(III) transitions. The cycle which involves only iridacycle intermediates offer the lowest energy span (energy difference calculated between only the highest and lowest energy points inside the cycle), however. Together with the experimental results, this implies that C-H activation of the N-ethyl side chain happens off-cycle or the starting solvent addition step of the dominant pathway is blocked kinetically. We also discuss the hydrogen uptake reaction catalyzed by cyclometalated species where the reduction of CO2 is preferred over reversing the first main cycle. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"formic acid; formic acid derivative; hydrogen; iridium; organometallic compound; catalysis; chemistry; Catalysis; Formates; Hydrogen; Iridium; Organometallic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047296224

The variable-speed wind turbine drives a permanent-magnet synchronous generator, which is connected to the power grid through a frequency converter. A cascaded ANFIS-GA controller is introduced to control both of the generator-side converter and the grid-side inverter. ANFIS is a non-linear, adaptive, and robustness controller, which integrates the merits of the artificial neural network and the FIS. A GA-based learning design procedure is proposed to identify the ANFIS parameters. Detailed modelling of the system under investigation and its control strategies are demonstrated. For achieving realistic responses, real wind speed data extracted from Zaafarana wind farm, Egypt, are considered in the analyses. The effectiveness of the ANFIS-GA controller is compared with that obtained using optimised proportional–integral controllers by the novel grey wolf optimiser algorithm taking into consideration severe grid disturbances. The validity of the ANFIS-GA control scheme is verified by the extensive simulation analyses, which are performed using MATLAB/Simulink environment.

This masks the variability of emissions associated with different forms of generation over different timescales. Variability is a characteristic of electricity systems with high levels of renewable generation, where fossil fuels are typically used to meet any shortfall in supply. In this paper we argue that quantification of the time variability of carbon intensity is necessary to understand the detailed patterns of carbon emissions in electricity systems, particularly as future systems are likely to increasingly rely on a mix of time-variable generation types such as wind, hydro and solar. We analysed the time-varying carbon intensity of New Zealand's electricity sector, which has approximately 80% renewable generation. In contrast to many other nations, we found that carbon intensity did not consistently follow daily peak demand, and was only weakly correlated with demand. This result, and the finding that carbon intensity has significant seasonal variation, stems from the dominance of hydro (albeit with limited storage capacity) in New Zealand's generation mix. Further investigation of the operating regimes of the fossil fuel generators, using time-varying analysis, indicates that New Zealand's electricity system is sub-optimal from a GHG emission perspective, with more coal generation than would seem to be required. Two policy measures, which also generalize to other countries, are proposed to address this issue: (i) the creation of an electricity capacity market – providing revenue for standby fossil fuel generation capacity without the need for continual generation; (ii) use of time-varying carbon intensity to inform demand-side measures and decisions about new renewable generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity generation; GHG emissions; Peak demand; Time-varying carbon intensity","Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon intensity; Electricity generation; Fossil fuel generators; Generation capacity; GHG emission; Peak demand; Renewable generation; Time varying analysis; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046009103

This study investigated the impact of a pre-storage splitting treatment on moisture content alteration, dry matter loss and volumetric energy density. Further, economic and environmental implications of splitting were investigated. Splitting increased the drying rates of large poplar logs 2–3 times and enabled to reach a 15.3% lower final moisture content compared to intact logs at similar dry matter loss rates (9.2% vs. 7.8%). Final volumetric energy density of split logs was 27.2% higher than for intact logs. Splitting increased the profit from poplar fuelwood and decreased respective supply cost. Further, 26.3% less truck trips were required for woodchips produced from split logs. Pre-storage splitting is highly recommended for large logs of slowly drying species like poplar, to, firstly, reach low moisture content levels at all, and secondly, reach them in less time. This treatment has the potential to become an integral part of sustainable and responsible utilization of our fuelwood resources, as less material is required to supply the same amount of energy. At the same time, less truck trips are required to transport it, which is clearly beneficial from an environmental viewpoint. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fuelwood; Logwood; Natural drying; Poplar; Splitting; Transport","Drying; Moisture; Moisture determination; Storage (materials); Truck transportation; Trucks; Wood products; Fuelwood; Logwood; Natural drying; Poplar; Splitting; Transport; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042271947

The high thermal conductivity sensible storage materials (graphite) works as an energy source to basin within the times of lower intensity of solar radiation and also after sunset. The graphite used in the present study is more effective than the other sensible storage materials used in the previous studies such as (sand, black gravel, and glass balls), mainly due to the high thermal conductivity of graphite and the graphite properties used in this study in Table 1. The experimental results showed that the daily production of a single-basin still with graphite is bigger than that of a traditional single-basin still.

The samples were synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The modification of the properties was evaluated by the characterization of the morphology and chemical composition by some techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. We found a change from semi-spherical to almost cylindrical shape in our samples with the addition of the Gd2O3:Er3+ shell. The optical properties were analyzed using the excitation and emission photoluminescence spectra in the UV–visible range. We found that under light excitation at (i) 379 nm or (ii) 980 nm the photoluminescence spectra for the Er3+ ions showed a dominant emission intensity in the red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H9/2 → 4I11/2) and green (2H11/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) bands, respectively. For the second radiation wavelength, our results are in good agreement with the model of upconversion where some transitions are produced by the Er3+ ions due to energy transfer mechanisms between Er3+ → Er3+ resulting in a self-quenched green emission by a cross-relaxation process involved in populating the 4F9/2 state, which bypasses the green-emitting states. The magnetic properties were analyzed by means of hysteresis loops measurements at 300 K. The results showed a dependency of the magnetization value with the Gd2O3:Er3+ shell.

Due to the fluctuation of renewable energy sources, the battery energy storage system (BESS) is one of the essential components to control and improve the quality of power microgrid. However, a placement for BESS installation with minimizing line loss is one of the most concern problems. This paper aims to determine the optimal location of the BESS by using the analytical method with the line loss sensitivity index. A multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) and line loss analysis with BESS parameters were investigated considering the daily operation of a microgrid in connected mode. The simulation performed on the microgrid that wants to keep total power generation from DGs in BESS and low energy consumption from the utility. Microgrid includes 3 DGs (biomass, solar and wind turbine generators) to assess the robustness of BESS placement. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the presented method.

Their performance and cost are detrimental to the concerned systems. Carbon foam material excels as heat storage medium due to its high thermal conductivity coupled with its high heat capacity, and light weight, allowing design of smaller, more efficient, cheaper, and lighter heat storages. To optimize the design of small sized carbon foam heat storage, ANOVA analysis was employed to determine significances of heat transfer controlling factors such as pore size, porosity, length and diameter of the bed, and mass flow rate of charging hot air. Also, Surface Response Method was employed to construct a statistical model that describes the energy/volume as a function of the above parameters. The model employs one-dimensional continuity, momentum and energy equations to simulate the heat transfer process within a volume of carbon foam material with pore diameter of 0.003 m, and porosity (ε) ranging from 0.08 to 0.385. The investigation shows that coefficient of determination (R2)=0.84 of the statistical model. With ambient and charging temperatures of 25°C and 85°C, bed length of 0.4 m, bed diameter of 0.1 m, mass flow rate per area of 0.25 kg/sm2, and e of 0.19, the maximum heat energy/volume (82000kj/m3) is achieved at about 1.3 hours of charging time. At mass flow rate per area of 0.125 kg/sm2 and ε of 0.175 the maximum energy stored is achieved at about 1.7 hours of charging time. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Fluid flow; Heat transfer; Numerical analysis; Regression analysis; Spongy-porous media; Thermal performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047427165

The selection of a suitable site may be the most important contributing factor to the cost of a large-scale seawater desalination plant. Large-scale seawater desalination requires the continuous abstraction of a large quantity of consistent quality seawater, the delivery of this feed-water into a high-pressure industrial process plant, where energy will be used to separate some of the volume as freshwater, with the remaining portion returned to the sea as brine. The marine works is a key element of the capital outlay of a desalination plant. These structures generally appear overdesigned, and much larger than one would intuitively estimate they should be. The process of selecting a site requires thorough analysis, but it also involves the anticipation of environmental and societal responses, which can make it more iterative than linear in character. The plot size should be adequate to allow for up-scaling of the desalination plant, and for the safe on-site storage of chemicals.",,"cost analysis; desalination; seawater; site selection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047273300

The antioxidant effect of HDL is mostly associated with paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity. Increasing PON1 activity using nutrients might improve HDL function and quality and thus, decrease atherosclerotic risk. We previously isolated and identified a novel active compound, lyso-DGTS (C20:5,0) from Nannochloropsis sp. ethanol extract. In the present study, its effect on PON1 activities was examined and the mechanism by which the compound affects PON1 activity was explored. Lyso-DGTS elevated recombinant PON1 (rePON1) lactonase and esterase activities in a dose- and time-responsive manner, and further stabilized and preserved rePON1 lactonase activity. Incubation of lyso-DGTS with human serum for 4 h at 37 °C also increased PON1 lactonase activity in a dose-responsive manner. Using tryptophan-fluorescence-quenching assay, lyso-DGTS was found to interact with rePON1 spontaneously with negative free energy (ΔG = −22.87 kJ mol−1 at 25 °C). Thermodynamic parameters and molecular modeling calculations showed that the main interaction of lyso-DGTS with the enzyme is through a hydrogen bond with supporting van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, lyso-DGTS significantly increased rePON1 influx into macrophages and prevented lipid accumulation in macrophages stimulated with oxidized low-density lipid dose-dependently. In vivo supplementation of lyso-DGTS to the circulation of mice fed a high-fat diet via osmotic mini-pumps implanted subcutaneously significantly increased serum PON1 lactonase activity and decreased serum glucose concentrations to the level of mice fed a normal diet. Our findings suggest a beneficial effect of lyso-DGTS on increasing PON1 activity and thus, improving HDL quality and atherosclerotic risk factors. © 2018 BioFactors, 44(3):299–310, 2018. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","atherosclerosis; HDL; Lyso-DGTS lipid; macrophages; microalgae; paraxonase 1","alcohol; aryldialkylphosphatase 1; esterase; gluconolactonase; glucose; high density lipoprotein; lipid; lyso diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine; oxidized low density lipoprotein; unclassified drug; aryldialkylphosphatase; homoserine; PON1 protein, human; PON1 protein, mouse; protein binding; recombinant protein; animal experiment; Article; enzyme activity; foam cell; glucose blood level; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid storage; macrophage; molecular docking; molecular model; mouse; Nannochloropsis; nonhuman; priority journal; supplementation; thermodynamics; alpha helix; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; beta sheet; cell differentiation; cell line; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; enzyme active site; enzymology; gene expression; genetics; human; isolation and purification; kinetics; macrophage; metabolism; microalga; protein domain; transport at the cellular level; Animals; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Biological Transport; Catalytic Domain; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Foam Cells; Gene Expression; Homoserine; Humans; Kinetics; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Microalgae; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Recombinant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045846761

The obtained results showed that after 3 years of weathering the porosity of the analyzed bricks increased up to five percentage points which led to an increase in liquid and gaseous moisture transport parameters and a decrease in thermal conductivity.

The simulated results indicated an improvement in the annual energy balances and a decrease in the time-of-wetness functions as a result of the use of data obtained after the 3-year exposure to the environment. The effects of weathering on both heat and moisture transport and storage parameters of the analyzed bricks and on their hygrothermal performance were found significant despite the occurrence of warm winters in the time period of 2012–2015 when the brick specimens were exposed to the environment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bricks; Hygric properties; Hygrothermal performance; Thermal properties; Weathering","Brick; Digital storage; Lime; Lime brick; Moisture; Solar buildings; Thermodynamic properties; Weathering; Climatic conditions; Computational model; Computational technique; External environments; Heat and moisture transports; Hygric properties; Hygrothermal performance; Physical parameters; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044622942

However, there can be problems of reliability and availability where fuel supply is erratic and expensive, high maintenance cost, and short life expectancy. These and recent concerns for the environment associated with the diesel engines call for a viable alternative source of power for irrigational water pumping. Renewable energy sources have gained a lot of attention as a replacement for fossil fuels or as a supplement in hybrid systems. Solar-powered (photovoltaic) systems are one of the viable alternatives that have attracted considerable attention in this regard. They have been deployed in many remote regions for various applications, ranging from rural electrification and community water supplies to irrigation and livestock water supplies. Although photovoltaic (PV) systems generally have a high investment cost, it has many features which make it attractive as an alternative source of power for water pumping. It is clean, as it produces no carbon emission, it generates no noise, and it has low operational and maintenance cost.

The concept relies on springs that store and release energy into the system when required. Conventional mechanical springs impose some limitations on a system, mainly in terms of compactness, friction, material fatigue, and failure. Magnetic springs have the potential to overcome these issues, especially for long-stroke high-frequency operation. We report here on the investigation of a magnetic spring into a linear oscillatory motor without any changes to the permanent magnet arrangement on the mover. We focus on a compact and highly integrated design with maximum energy storage capacity.

In the current work, the thermal behaviour of Estonian oil shale (EOS) and its semicoke (SC), pine saw dust, and their blends were studied comparatively under model air (21%O2/79%Ar) and OF (30%O2/70%CO2) conditions using thermogravimetric analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was applied to monitor the evolved gases. The effect of SC and pine saw dust addition on different combustion stages was analysed using kinetic analysis methods. In addition, different co-firing cases were simulated using the ASPEN PLUS V8.6 (APV86) software tool to evaluate the effects of blending EOS with different biomass fuels of low and high moisture contents. The specific boiler temperatures of each simulated case with the same adjusted thermal fuel input were calculated while applying the operation conditions of air and OF combustion. According to the experiment and process simulation results, the low heating value and high carbonate content of SC brings along endothermic decomposition of carbonates, which negatively affects the heat balance during the conventional co-combustion of EOS with SC. Instead, firing of EOS with SC and biomass in OF process can be an effective solution to reduce the environmental impact in terms of the reduction of CO2 emissions and ash. Furthermore, the sensible heat from SC can positively affect the energy balance of the system as the endothermic effect of decomposition of CaCO3 (for both EOS and SC) can be avoided in OF combustion.

The exploitation of whole biogas energy is locally limited and utilization of the natural gas transport system requires CO2 removal or its conversion to methane. The biological conversion of CO2 and hydrogen to methane is well known reaction without the demand of high pressure and temperature and is carried out by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Reducing equivalents to the biotransformation of carbon dioxide from biogas or other resources to biomethane can be supplied by external hydrogen. Discontinuous electricity production from wind and solar energy combined with fluctuating utilization cause serious storage problems that can be solved by power-to-gas strategy representing the production of storable hydrogen via the electrolysis of water. The possibility of subsequent repowering of the energy of hydrogen to the easily utilizable and transportable form is a biological conversion with CO2 to biomethane. Biomethanization of CO2 can take place directly in anaerobic digesters fed with organic substrates or in separate bioreactors. The major bottleneck in the process is gas-liquid mass transfer of H2 and the method of the effective input of hydrogen into the system. There are many studies with different bioreactors arrangements and a way of enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, but the system still has to be optimized for a higher efficiency.

A supplementary control strategy for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) systems to improve the frequency regulation is presented in this paper. The scenario where the MTDC system cannot resort to the power reserves of either other ac systems or offshore wind farms is particularly studied. The proposed control is able to independently support both the primary frequency regulation and the system inertia by using the capacitive energy of the MTDC grid converters. On the other hand, the reactive power of the converter stations is coordinately controlled to improve the damping of low-frequency electromechanical oscillations. The simultaneous frequency support of the MTDC system and onshore wind farms is also studied and validated in a practical multi-machine power system. Transient and small-signal stability analyses are performed to evaluate and quantify the improvements and the control limitations of the proposed scheme. This enhanced frequency control can increase the system reliability and reduce the required amount of spinning reserve, diminishing the operation costs and allowing to increase the penetration of renewable energy sources. © 2017 IEEE.","Capacitive energy storage; distributed frequency control; inertia mimicry capability; multi-terminal high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems; wind power integration","Capacitors; Circuit oscillations; DC power transmission; Electric frequency control; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; HVDC power transmission; Offshore wind farms; Onshore wind farms; Power converters; Renewable energy resources; Textile industry; Wind power; Wind turbines; Capacitive energy storage; High voltage direct current; inertia mimicry capability; Power conversion; Power system stability; Wind farm; Wind power integrations; System stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030774438

This damage is one of the factors contributing to postharvest losses and decline in quality of produce. This study investigated the susceptibility of three pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruit cultivars 'Acco', 'Herskawitz' and 'Wonderful' to impact bruising by letting the fruit fall from selected heights onto a flat surface. The impact threshold level (based on minimal drop heights (10, 15, 20 cm)) required to cause bruising was investigated by determining the probability of bruise occurrence (PBO) from the population of randomly selected fruits of each cultivar. The effect of the storage temperature on bruise susceptibility and fruit physiological response was studied by impacting fruit equilibrated at 5 and 20°C from three drop heights (20, 40 and 60 cm) followed by storage for 10 d to monitor the weight loss and respiration rate of the fruit. The bruising susceptibility at higher drop heights (20, 40 and 60 cm) was cultivar dependent in the order of 'Wonderful'&gt;'Herskawitz'&gt; 'Acco'. The cooler fruit had greater bruise sizes compared to the warmer fruit. The minimum drop height at which bruising was first observed and the associated bruising occurrence (PBO) was at 10 cm (0.44), 15 cm (0.50) and 15 cm (0.75) for 'Wonderful', 'Herskawitz' and 'Acco', respectively. The cultivar 'Wonderful' was most susceptible to bruising with the highest value of PBO corresponding to the minimal impact energy (371.87 mJ). The respiration rate was the highest in 'Herskawitz' (125 mL CO2 kg-1 h-1) followed by 'Acco' (113 mL CO2 kg-1 h-1). Mean percentage weight loss was 2.01, 2.41 and 2.75% for 'Wonderful', 'Herskawitz' and 'Acco' fruit, respectively. Overall, the measured physiological responses increased with the increasing level of impact bruising and storage temperatures in all cultivars.

Due to the expected high microgeneration (µG) penetration level, several problems are likely to arise, such as overvoltages and reverse power flow. This study presents a review of the several techniques used to deal with these problems. These are compared in terms of their capacity to smooth the voltage profile and avoid reverse power flow. An unbalanced three-phase power flow algorithm, based on current summation method for radial distribution networks, is proposed. A study based on a highly unbalanced test radial LV distribution network for a typical summer day, with a high µG penetration, is performed. The voltage profile, active power flow in the service transformer, and power losses on the network are the monitored electrical quantities. The obtained results indicate that self-consumption with storage is the recommended solution to eliminate overvoltages, to avoid reverse power flow and allow for a decreasing in the power losses. Nevertheless, the economic viability of this solution must be carefully assessed, because the profitability of the project is not straightforward at the current time. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.",,"Electric power distribution; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Voltage distribution measurement; Electrical quantities; Low voltage distribution network; Low-voltage distributions; LV distribution networks; Overvoltage mitigations; Radial distribution networks; Renewable energy source; Three-phase power flow; Electric load flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045529355

The calculations are performed using the all-electron full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO9.00-34). Our findings indicate that the doping of Li beside TM played an important role in improving the thermodynamic properties of MgH2. Through this double substitution, a reduction of heat of formation/desorption and preservation of the optimum gravimetric capacity are obtained. Precisely, we find that the co-doping with V–Li; Zr–Li; Ti–Li; Y–Li, have desorption temperatures within the optimum range 289 K–393 K, for the practical applications. More precisely, the V–Li co-doping exposes a heat of formation −39.21kj/mol which is the closest to the ideal heat of formation −40kj/mol. Besides, our results suggested that, the combination of Li with V into MgH2 is greatly favourable compared to V doping alone.

We report the results of an electron spin resonance investigation in the nature, transformation, and long term stability of the irradiation paramagnetic point defects (IPPDs) produced by high fluence (2 × 1016 cm-2), high energy (27 MeV) electrons in n-type, P-doped standard floating zone silicon. We found out that both freshly irradiated and aged (i.e., stored after irradiation for 3.5 years at 250 K) samples mainly contain negatively charged tetravacancy and pentavacancy defects in the first case and tetravacancy defects in the second one. The fact that such small cluster vacancy defects have not been observed by irradiation with low energy (below 5 MeV) electrons, but were abundantly produced by irradiation with neutrons, strongly suggests the presence of the same mechanism of direct formation of small vacancy clusters by irradiation with neutrons and high energy, high fluence electrons, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Differences in the nature and annealing properties of the IPPDs observed between the 27 MeV electrons freshly irradiated, and irradiated and aged samples were attributed to the presence of a high concentration of divacancies in the freshly irradiated samples, defects which transform during storage at 250 K through diffusion and recombination processes. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Defects; Electrons; High energy physics; Irradiation; Magnetic moments; Paramagnetism; Phosphorus; Point defects; Radiation; Silicon; Silicon detectors; Vacancies; Annealing properties; High energy physics experiments; Irradiated samples; Long term stability; Negatively charged; Radiation defects; Recombination process; Stable performance; Neutron irradiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035047356

This is in contrast with the frequently advocated influent load equalization at WWTPs. The concept is demonstrated on a case study using an integrated system composed of detailed models for sewer system and WWTP where it reveals considerable potential for energy savings and effluent quality improvement. Moreover, the integrated control allows for the reduction of combined sewer overflows during wet weather events and decreased sedimentation potential in the sewer system.

Phase change memories (PCMs) are a leading contender in the emerging race for non-volatile memories due to their fast operation speed, high scalability, good reliability and low power consumption. However, in order to meet the present and future storage demands, PCM technologies must further increase the storage density. Here, we employ a probabilistic cellular automata approach to explore the multi-step threshold switching from the reset (off) to the set (on) state in chalcogenide stacked structures. Simulations have shown that in order to obtain multi-step switching with high contrast among different resistance states, the stacked structure needs to contain materials with a large difference among their crystallization temperatures and careful tuning of strata thicknesses. The crystallization dynamics can be controlled through the external energy pulses applied to the system, in such a way that a balance between nucleation and growth in phase change behavior can be achieved, optimized for PCMs. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","cellular automata; chalcogenide; data retention; multi-step resistance memory; phase change; stacked films","Antimony compounds; Cellular automata; Chalcogenides; Gallium compounds; Germanium compounds; III-V semiconductors; Layered semiconductors; Selenium compounds; Storage (materials); Tellurium compounds; Tin compounds; Cellular automata modeling; Crystallization dynamics; Crystallization temperature; Data retention; Multi-step; Nucleation and growth; Phase Change; Stacked film; Phase change memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046548762

However, despite short-term benefits, tail regeneration may also impose costs. Several studies have demonstrated that tail loss compromises other vital functions such as lipid storage, reproduction, and the immune system. Several lizard species are hosts of mites and ticks. Here we evaluated in three lizard species from the genus Sceloporus, whether individuals that have lost their tails and invested energy in tail regeneration are more susceptible to ectoparasites. Using a multimodel inference framework, we examined if tail loss and regeneration, as well as sex, body condition, and season (dry or rainy) predict ectoparasite load. Our results indicate that investing energy and resources in tail regeneration compromises defence against ectoparasites. These costs differed between sexes and among species. Overall, ectoparasite load increases during the rainy season and is on average higher in males. In S. grammicus, during the rainy season, males with regenerated tails and in poor body condition had more ectoparasites than males with intact tails in good body condition. In S. megalepidurus, we observed the same effect during the rainy season but in females rather than males. In S. torquatus, we found no effect of tail loss on ectoparasite load.

Pear fruit is stored for several months and its fruit anatomy, surface-to-volume ratio, and gas exchange properties may result in uncharacterized gradients in adenylate nucleotides. The aim of this work was to characterize the axial and radial gradients of adenylate nucleotides and energy charge in pear fruit. ‘Rocha’ pear (Pyrus communis L.) fruits with 55-60 mm were sampled after 3 months under controlled atmosphere storage, in a mature but unripe stage. Fruits were sectioned transversely in skin (1.5 mm thick), outer flesh (10 mm thick under skin), and inner flesh (10 mm thick under outer flesh) and longitudinally in three-thirds, proximal, medial, and distal. The sections were freeze-dried and adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP) measured by bioluminescence. Adenylate energy charge (AEC) was calculated as: AEC = [[ATP] + 0.5[ADP]] / [[ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]]. A radial AEC gradient was measured in the fruit but no significant gradient was observed from the proximal to the distal fruit sections. Total pool of nucleotides, on a fresh mass basis, was 865.7 nmol g-1 in the skin, 438.1 nmol g-1 in the outer flesh, and 585.6 nmol g-1 in the inner flesh. AEC was 0.80, 0.72, and 0.69 in the skin, outer, and inner flesh, respectively. AMP levels were less than 11% of the total nucleotide pool. ATP accounted for 70, 53, and 46% of the total adenylate nucleotides, in the skin, outer, and inner flesh, respectively. In conclusion, there was variation in energy charge in the radial direction, with lower values at the fruit center. Whether this transversal gradient is related to susceptibility of internal browning disorders remains to be clarified. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Stunting during childhood might affect brain development and impair development cognitive function. Additionally, this condition associated with the increased risk for obesity during adulthood. Several studies have shown that the increment risk of obesity and overweight in children with a short stature was due to their metabolic efficiency. Children with stunting have lower resting energy expenditure compared to non stunting children. Additionally, stunted children has higher respiratory quotient and carbohydrate oxidation but lower fat oxidation compared to non-stunting children. These results might explain why stunted children easily become obese, which is due to lower fat oxidation and leading to tendency to store fat.This review discussed the current status on studies in the nutrigenetic aspects of the relationship between stunting in the childhood and obesity in adulthood. I hypothesized that stunted children are more likely to become obese in their later life because they have lower metabolic rate and higher tendency of fat storage. There are several candidate genes and pathway involved in obesity and I suspected that ghrelin and its receptor growth hormone secretague receptor (GHSR) were responsible.","gene polymorphism; ghrelin; growth hormone secretague receptor (GHSR); obesity; stunting","ghrelin; ghrelin receptor; adult; child; complication; genetic polymorphism; genetics; growth disorder; human; metabolism; obesity; Adult; Child; Ghrelin; Growth Disorders; Humans; Obesity; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, Ghrelin",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064864956

Design/methodology/approach: The investigation was carried out by means of numerical simulation. In mathematical description of gas processes relations of thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer were used. To determine the coefficients of thermal and physical parameters of working bodies the Peng-Robinson equation of state was used through the computer program REFPROP. The system of equations is represented as the interrelations between the functional elements according to the principle ""output from the element A – input into the element B"". Its solution was obtained by the method of successive approximations, namely by the Newton-Raphson iteration method. Using this method we have determined the values of temperature, pressure, mass flow rate and mass content of the hydrocarbon gas mixture components in each reference cross-section of the power facility. Findings: As a result of numerical simulation, it is determined that when the multicomponent hydrocarbon mixtures are separated, three flows of energy resources may be obtained: with a high mass content of methane of 91.5% and 83.4%, which may be used as motor fuel, and a gas flow suitable for maintaining the process of waste gasification. However, to remove heat in the condenser of the rectification column, it is necessary to use expensive liquid nitrogen. The cost of methane production may be reduced if the condenser is removed from the rectification column. However, such approach reduces the overall yield of commercial products almost in four times and significantly reduces the methane with the third product (molar percentage of 35%). Research limitations/implications: The investigation was carried out for the material of used tires without a metal frame. Practical implications: The implementation of the technology of high-temperature recycling of used tires gives the opportunity to use the generated synthetic gas to maintain the process of utilization, and gives the opportunity to produce liquefied methane, suitable for storage. Originality/value: The main problem of high-temperature recycling of tires is the emission of toxic gas to the atmosphere. It is proposed to allocate methane energy resource from this gas. For the first time an attempt was made to justify the expedience of the technology of high-temperature utilization of tires for liquefied methane production. © International OCSCO World Press.

In this paper we assess the feasibility of a hybrid memory cell, and explore the design space of 3D stacked hybrid dual-port memory arrays which combine the appealing NEMFET properties, i.e., ultra-low leakage currents and abrupt switching, with the CMOS technology versatility. In the evaluation we performed a comparison in terms of footprint, access time, and energy, against state of the art CMOS dual-ports memories, considering small and large size memory arrays (8-Kbytes up to 128-Kbytes) implemented in various technology nodes. The 3D NEMFET-CMOS hybrid dual-port memory is on the average 25 percent smaller and 8 and 95 percent larger in terms of footprint when compared to 90, and 45 nm CMOS implementations, respectively. The write access time is approximately 2 × higher, as it is dominated by the mechanical movement of the NEMFET's suspended gate, while the read access time is about 12 percent lower, when compared with 45 nm CMOS counterparts. For small size memories our proposal results in at least 15 percent and 23 percent energy reductions for 100 and 50 percent data transition probability, respectively.

A high-capacity HKUST-1 type metal-organic framework was used as adsorbent. The time-dependent phenomenological model of the adsorbed natural gas storage tank was developed considering mass, momentum and energy transfers. The cylindrical tank was 1.09 m in length with a radius of 0.15 m, and was equipped with an inlet hole for gas inflow. The simulation results show that the temperature increase in the tank due to adsorption heat is very significant. This affects the adsorption ability of the bed inside the tank, so the storage efficiency is consequently low. For the inlet gas flowrate of 50 L/min, the storage efficiency is 38% and increases to only 47% at 5 L/min. Corresponding filling capacities for the two flowrates are not very different, i.e. 89 V(STP)/V and 109 V(STP)/V.

Hence, a marine vessel power system with photovoltaic, WT, SWE, and ESS can be considered as a specific mobile islanded microgrid. Consequently, the main target of this paper is to design a new optimal fractional order fuzzy PD+I load frequency controller (LFC) for islanded microgrids in a ship power system. Since the performance of the controller depends on its parameters, the optimization of these coefficients can play a significant role in improving the output performance of the LFC control. Accordingly, a modified black hole optimization algorithm is utilized for the adaptive tuning of the coefficients of noninteger fuzzy PD+I controller. The performance of the shipboard microgrid is evaluated by utilizing real-world wind power fluctuation and solar radiation data. Finally, the extensive studies and hardware-in-the-loop simulations are applied to prove that the proposed controller can track the reference frequency with lower deviation as well as it is more robust in comparison with the prior-art controllers utilized in the case studies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","fractional controller; load frequency control (LFC); modified black hole algorithm (MBHA); sea wave energy (SWE); Shipboard microgrids","Controllers; Digital storage; Electric control equipment; Electric load management; Gravitation; Integer programming; Marine pollution; Optimization; Press load control; Renewable energy resources; Ships; Solar power generation; Stars; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Wind power; Wind turbines; Black holes; Fractional controllers; Load-frequency control; Micro grid; Sea wave energies; Electric frequency control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044499744

This approach is based on realistic separable representations of the driving two-body interaction in the πN, ηN, and NN subsystems. It is shown that the influence of rescattering effects in the intermediate state on the tensor target spin asymmetries is sizable at extreme backward pion angles. At forward angles, the contribution from the pure impulse approximation is dominated and the spin asymmetries show very little influence of rescattering effects. The sensitivity of results to the elementary pion photoproduction operator and to the NN potential model adopted for the deuteron wave function is investigated, and considerable dependences are found. The predicted spin asymmetries are also compared with available experimental data, and a satisfactory agreement with the recent data from VEPP-3 is obtained at photon energies below 400 MeV. At higher energies, the calculated spin asymmetries slightly underestimate the data. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Meson production; Photoproduction reactions; Polarized targets; Spin observables",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044319592

Using data from a representative sample (N=271) of households in a rural part of eastern Tanzania, we estimated a mixed logit model to take into account the limitations of the standard multinomial logit model and relaxed the restrictive assumption of the conditional logit model. The experiment results show a strong correlation between payment mechanisms and adoption of ICS. We also found interesting results that households provided with just one type of ICS adopted it less (30%). On the other hand, households supplied with more than one type of ICS largely adopted it (48%). In addition, the ICS that uses both charcoal and firewood was purchased by most households (80%), which raised the total uptake of ICS to 48 %. These results also provide empirical evidence of a shift from consuming firewood for energy to charcoal in rural areas. The study suggests that any efforts to promote ICS should seriously consider offering rural households a choice of ICS as opposed to a single type, inducing suppliers of ICS to extend them on credit, and offering ICS for cash at harvest time, as their cash flow depends on seasonal income from agricultural activities. © 2017",,"Charcoal; Digital storage; Agricultural activities; Conditional logit; Fuelwood consumption; Improved cooking stoves; Mixed logit models; Multinomial logit model; Representative sample; Strong correlation; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042482295

Such dichotomies are not endemic to Vietnam, but permeates the whole climate and forest debate globally. It encompasses a perception that forests are of higher value kept standing and that agricultural practices, forest conservation and sustainable use of forests are mutually excluding activities. The study has been based on a survey carried out in the Province of Bac Kan in northern Vietnam. It applied a livelihood framework to investigate the multiple values of forest lands in household economies. The case demonstrated the complexities of adaptations to forest-sector policies, and that households in different institutional and agro-ecological settings use forest lands differently to generate livelihood incomes. It also showed that if all productive values are taken into account, relatively speaking forest lands represent more important livelihood assets for the poorer segments of households than the more well-off ones. The findings may have important implications for climate relate forest policies, such as REDD+ and REALU. Policy makers should engage with people and local communities, their social institutions and agricultural practices, and look at context-specific approaches for integrating the objectives of conserving trees, increasing carbon stocks and enhancing the total productivity and values of landscapes. The study recommends inter-sectoral and multi-stakeholder policy approaches integrating and mainstreaming multiple objectives, including forestry, agriculture, energy and other environmental services, such as carbon capture and storage, water provision, and biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forest land use; Forest policies; REALU; REDD+; Sustainable livelihoods; Vietnam","adaptive management; deforestation; ecosystem service; emission control; forest management; forestry policy; household survey; land use change; livelihood; policy making; stakeholder; sustainability; Bac Kan; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042175799

In this study an unconventional method for industrial microalgae cultivation for bio-oil production using pulp and paper mill waste resources while harvesting only once a year was performed, mainly in order to investigate the energy efficiency of the process. Algae were cultivated for three months in 2014 in covered pond systems with access to flue gas and waste heat from the industry, and the biomass was recovered as thick sediment sludge after dewatering. The cultivation systems, designed to manage the waste resources, reached a promising photosynthetic efficiency of at most 1.1%, a net energy ratio (NER) of 0.25, and a projected year-round energy biomass yield per area 5.2 times higher than corresponding rapeseed production at the location. Thus, microalgae cultivation was, for the first time, proven energy efficient in a cold continental climate. Energy-rich indigenous communities quickly out-competed the oleaginous monocultures used for inoculation. The recovered biomass had higher heating values of 20–23 MJ kg− 1 and contained 14–19% oil dominated by C16 followed by C18 fatty acids. The cultivation season at 59°15′N, 14°18′E was projected to be efficient for 10 months and waste heat drying of the biomass is suggested for two winter months. The technique is proposed for carbon sequestering and energy storage in the form of microalgal sludge or dry matter for later conversion into biochemicals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Autotrophic; Energy efficiency; Flue gas; Lipids; Microalgae; Pulp and paper",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041819849

In this study, we show that loading magnesium by graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) enhances the kinetics by more than an order of magnitude. The GNP presence reduces the Mg agglomeration, induced by de/hydriding, and accelerates the kinetics by connecting between Mg particles. The GNP were prepared by top-down graphite ball-milling in the presence of various organic protective agents. We found that both the molecular structure of the protective agent and the milling energy dictated the GNP properties, namely, size, thickness, defect density and specific surface area.

The n-type α-CrOOH passivation of the p-type 3R-CuCrO2 film has provided a doubling of JSC and a threefold increase in the VOC compared to the pure 3R-CuCrO2 photocathode in DSSC. This remarkable enhancement could be explained in that α-CrOOH layer acts as a barrier layer for charge recombination between the holes in the valence band and the electrolyte or dye. In addition, formed p-n junction would facilitate the charge separation. Therefore, the α-CrOOH is proposed as a promising material to modify the photocathode of p-type DSSC with excellent photovoltaic efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy storage and conversion; Hydrothermal synthesis; P-type dye-sensitized solar cell; Semiconductors; Solar energy materials","Chromium compounds; Copper compounds; Electrolytes; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nanostructured materials; Passivation; Photocathodes; Photovoltaic effects; Semiconductor junctions; Semiconductor materials; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Charge recombinations; Energy storage and conversions; High performance surfaces; P-type; Passivation materials; Photo-voltaic efficiency; Photovoltaic performance; Solar energy materials; Dye-sensitized solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040322859

CLC technology has the capability to generate concentrated CO2 as further use for carbon capture and storage and thus reduce CO2 emissions. Since the use of cheap and non toxic oxygen carriers is favourable, iron is a potential candidate as active component. The performance of iron oxide impregnated on alumina (called Fe17) as oxygen carrier is investigated. Fe17 is tested in a 120kWth chemical looping combustion pilot plant at TU Wien. Various tests are carried out, the influence of active solid inventory, temperature, used gaseous fuel and oxygen carrier to fuel ratio are in the focus of the investigation. Post-experimental tests with thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray fluorescence analysis, particle size distribution and scanning electron microscope are used to characterize Fe17. The oxygen carrier shows attrition and a loss of iron. This leads to a drop of fuel conversion. The energy based fuel conversion is approx 40% to 60 %. For good fuel conversion, high inventories are needed in both reactors. Furthermore, high solid circulation rates and a high iron content on the particles show better fuel conversion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical looping combustion; Dual circulating fluidized bed; Fe based oxygen carrier; Impregnated on Al2O3","Alumina; Aluminum compounds; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Fluorescence; Fuels; Iron; Iron oxides; Oxygen; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pilot plants; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Active components; Chemical looping combustion; Circulating fluidized bed; Combustion pro-cess; Experimental test; Fe-based oxygen carriers; Impregnated on Al2O3; X ray fluorescence analysis; Fluidized bed combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040096233

To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868 MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40 kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5 μA at 3 V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2 days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments. © 2017","Directional antenna; Internet of Things (IoT); Low power; Photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting; Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); RF wake-up sensor; Zone differentiation","Antennas; Directive antennas; Energy harvesting; Middleware; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Radio transceivers; Radio transmission; Radio waves; Ultrasonic applications; Wakes; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Directional Antenna; Internet of Things (IOT); Low Power; Photovoltaic energy; Received signal strength indicators; Wake up; Internet of things",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040001669

Fundamental aspects such as interaction energy, natural bond orbital (NBO), charge transfer, energy gap, and the projected density of states (PDOS) are elucidated to analyze the adsorption properties of H2 molecules. Our results revealed that H2 is introduced sequentially on the Ti-C7, Ti(B)-B4N3, and Ti(N)-B3N4 complexes and the H2 uptake capacity are found to be 10.89, 10.80, and 10.58 wt%, respectively. Moreover, two Ti atoms can be adsorbed concomitantly to the ends of C7, B4N3, and B3N4 chains where Ti sites can accommodate 16 H2 molecules, with 8 per Ti center, leading to a storage capacity of up to 26.40, 26.28, and 25.94 wt%, respectively. In addition, two binding mechanisms contribute to the adsorption of hydrogen molecules: polarization of the H2 under the electric field produced by the Ti–chain dipole and hybridization of the 3d orbitals of Ti with σ orbitals of H2. These lead to the hydrogen binding energies within the range of 0.22–0.56 eV/H2, open a prospect of a promising material system for hydrogen storage at ambient temperature. The large difference in charge transfer and interaction between the metal and chains is responsible for the large hyperpolarizability. Moreover, the C and BN chains can be stabilized effectively by C20 fullerene termination and store 8 H2 with an average binding energy of 0.22 eV/H2. The hydrogen desorption energies and temperatures indicate that the Ti-C7,Ti(B)-B4N3, Ti(N)-B3N4, Ti-C7-Ti, Ti(B)-B4N3-Ti(B), Ti(N)-B3N4-Ti(N), Ti-C7-C20, Ti(B)-B4N3-C20, and Ti(N)-B3N4-C20 complexes are easy to desorb H2 molecules. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","C and BN chain; Desorption temperature; DFT calculations; Hydrogen storage; Ti adsorption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038852389

The wide scan XPS spectra support the presence of C, N and O in neat hydrogel; while, the XPS spectra of HCuNPs demonstrate the presence of Cu along with C, N, and O elements.

Most of these schemes use battery voltage observations as a primary source of information and neglect variables external to the vehicle that affect its autonomy and help to characterise the behaviour of the battery as main energy storage device. Using an electric bicycle as case study, we show that the incorporation of external variables (e.g., altitude measurements) improves predictions associated with evolution of the battery voltage in time. We achieve this by proposing a novel kernel adaptive filter for multiple inputs and with a data-dependent dictionary construction. This allows us to model the dependency between battery voltage and altitude variations in a sequential manner. The proposed methodology combines automatic discovery of the relationship between voltage and altitude from data, and a kernel-based voltage predictor to address an important issue in reliability of electric vehicles. The proposed method is validated against a standard kernel adaptive filter, fixed linear filters and adaptive linear filters as baselines on the short- and long-term prediction of real-world battery voltage data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data-driven prediction; Electric transportation; Kernel adaptive filter; Kernel methods; Learning and adaptive systems; Signal processing","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive systems; Bicycles; Digital storage; Electric bikes; Electric energy storage; Electric signal systems; Electric vehicles; Forecasting; Secondary batteries; Signal processing; Data driven; Electric transportation; Kernel adaptive filters; Kernel methods; Learning and adaptive system; Adaptive filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029222958

The results show that the orthorhombic structure is thermodynamically stable, while the hexagonal structure is unstable owing to the presence of negative mode frequency.

However, when applied to very easily biodegradable substrates, there is a need to mitigate the sudden pH drop, in order to improve the stability and feasibility of the process. In this work, and for the first time, waste-based geopolymer spheres were used as pH regulators in AD. The influence of the binder composition and content on the ability to control pH and on the methane yield was evaluated. The pH buffer capacity of the geopolymers can be controlled by the fly ash content in the composition, with higher contents leading to higher alkalis leaching and narrower pH fluctuation over time. The spheres promoted an excellent control of pH in batch operated anaerobic reactors (up to 70 days), which increases the stability and efficiency of the systems. The pH range in the reactor without spheres remained mostly between 3.84 and 4.38, preventing methane production, whereas in reactors with spheres pH was mostly kept between 6.45 and 7.94. The fast pH stabilization during the entire experiments, which occurred with fly ash-based geopolymers, stimulated the early methane production, demonstrating the huge potential of these innovative spheres as a pH buffering material. Using this innovative waste-based material, instead of commercial alkaline materials, enhances process simplicity (prevent the need for continuous pH adjustment) and sustainability, which may overcome the limitations associated with the existing applications such as the use of substrates with a high acidogenic potential and, therefore, contribute to the spread of AD technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alkalis leaching; Anaerobic digestion; Biomass fly ash; Buffer capacity; Geopolymer sphere; Methane","Alkalinity; Batch reactors; Buffer storage; Environmental technology; Fly ash; Geopolymers; Inorganic polymers; Leaching; Methane; pH effects; Spheres; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Added value products; Binder composition; Buffer capacity; Environmental benefits; Geopolymer; Methane production; Process simplicity; Renewable energies; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041805343

Efforts have been made to assess the energy and cost required for the transition towards a sustainable energy supply covering the demand for power, desalination and industrial gas sectors. Hourly resolved model was used and optimization was carried out for each time period (transition is modeled in 5-year steps) on the basis of assumed costs and technological status till 2050 for all energy technologies involved. Solar PV dominates the installed technologies and contributes 92.7% and 96.6% in power and integrated scenarios. Seawater desalination sector dominates the integrated scenario and clean water demand is found to be 2.8⋅1011 m3 by 2050. The levelised cost of electricity declines from 106.6 €/MWh in 2015 to 46.2 €/MWh in 2050 in power scenario.

In order to study the contribution of these phases in ZrCr1-xNiMox alloys performance, secondary Zr9Ni11 and Zr7Ni10, together with ZrCr2 and ZrMo2 Laves phases were synthesized and their crystalline structures determined with XRD patterns. Zr7Ni10 exhibits an orthorhombic structure, whereas Zr9Ni11 depicts a tetragonal structure. ZrCr2 presents a hexagonal structure (C14), while ZrMo2 depicts a cubic structure (C15). ZrCr2 shows zero discharge capacities, while ZrMo2 exhibits a first capacity value of 245 mAh g−1. Zr9Ni11 and Zr7Ni10 phases exhibit maximum discharge capacities of 119 and 157 mAh g−1, respectively. Theoretical results show that the hydride stability for ZrCr2 is larger than that for ZrMo2. However, the great hydrogen storage capacity yields a slower desorption kinetics since it requires a considerable de-hydrogenation energy. The opposite effect is observed for the proposed hexagonal structure ZrMo2. The 100% charge of the alloys shows different results for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Zr7Ni10 phase depicts a better performance since the required potentials are lower than −1.05 V. There is a change in the rate determining step (rds) from a chemical recombination of surface hydrogen (Tafel pathway) in Zr7Ni10 to a fast first electron transfer (Volmer step) for Zr9Ni11. Thus, the rds is strongly affected by the type of secondary phase dominant in each sample, being Zr7Ni10 the most favorable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AB2 alloys; Laves phases; Molybdenum; Ni-MH batteries; Synergy","Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Chromium metallography; Hydrogen storage; Molybdenum; Molybdenum alloys; Molybdenum metallography; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Nickel metallography; Zircaloy; Crystalline structure; Hexagonal structures; Hydrogen storage capacities; Laves phasis; Orthorhombic structures; Rate-determining step; Synergy; Tetragonal structure; Zirconium metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037987489

Method: The Solar Power Bank (SPB) was constructed with local materials based on their individual properties. The functionality of the SPB was tested in a convective environment. Davis automatic Weather Station (DWS) was used to get the weather parameters (like solar irradiance, solar energy and temperature) for each day the SPB was tested. The maximum solar irradiance for four days (during the experiment) were 220 W/m2, 208 W/m2, 450 W/m2 and 900 W/m2. The maximum solar energy was 0.33 J, 03 J, 0.64 J and 1.33 J. Result: The maximum voltage and power obtained from the Solar Power Bank (SPB) was 0.18V and 0.065W respectively. The design showed tremendous heat energy entrapment during solar irradiance peak as the temperature in the SPB was about three times the DWS. Conclusion: It was specifically noted that the convection of the heat transfer that is triggered by the glass shield determines the functionality of the thermo-electric module. This is a clear indication that though the power output may be low to charge the batteries, the prospects of the SPB to operate in convective-rural communities (in tropic region) is very high. © 2018 Emetere et al.","Construction; Design; Energy; Low cost; Nuclear power; Solar; Solar storage; Thermo-electric module",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045272658

This is due to technical constraints of the conventional generating units and the dynamic penetration limit that is usually applied for grid stability. This problem can be tackled with energy storage, namely, pumped hydro, when the topography is suitable. In addition, when an island has few or no freshwater resources and the desalination of seawater is a necessity, excess wind power can be provided to desalination units that can produce desalinated water to be used in the pumping and hydrostation and later be supplied to the population. This study couples these two issues, using an integrated approach to power and water supply systems' planning, with the purpose of increasing the integration of intermittent RES and minimizing the electricity and water production costs. This approach is applied to the Island of S. Vicente, in Cape Verde, where the results show that the penetration of RES in an arid island can increase, while decreasing the production costs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The global desalination demand by 2030, based solely on water stress and water demand, is estimated. Using the respective 2030 costs of renewable energy power plants, storage, and seawater reverse osmosis plants, the levelized cost of electricity and water is found. The optimal renewable energy power plants comprise solar photovoltaics and wind power plants, balanced by battery and power-to-gas storage. The global levelized cost of water range, including costs for water transportation, is found to be 1-2/m3. Meanwhile, the costs of fossil powered desalination plants today, excluding water transportation, is said to be in the range 0.6-1.9/m3.

In the present paper, the implications of a remote water source location (typically the seashore) are analyzed in terms of a definition for the combined water and energy operational cost required to transport ore concentrate using long distance pipelines. A typical process route is defined to expose the relevance of key process variables, including source remoteness and water reclamation both from tailing storage facilities and thickeners. Both mass and energy balances have been made to give an estimation of specific energy consumptions for a typical large scale Chilean mineral processing operations, considering a number of realistic hydraulic design criteria to make a comparative analysis of different plant processing capacities. In the present cost function definition, an account has been made on whether the water is either makeup or has been recirculated on the plant, and a distinction has been made on whether tailings are conventional or thickened, which allowed to analyze the relevance of in-plant water recovery compared to water recovery from the tailing disposal site. This has allowed to express the cost of water in terms of the various energy cost terms, thus showing in this case that the cost of water is ultimately the cost of energy, and therefore all cost components become proportional to the unit cost of energy. A piecewise constant pipeline diameter analysis scheme has been defined to allow studying the implications of water recovery on widely different plant sizes. Results show that for fixed water recovery rates, increasing plant throughput tends to cause a decrease on the specific energy for water transport. On the other hand, for fixed pipeline diameters, increasing the throughput causes an increase on the specific energy consumption, but such increase rate becomes milder at higher throughput rates. This suggests the advantage of the existence of common makeup water supply systems for mining districts with more than one mineral processing plant. On the other hand, for constant pipeline diameters, increasing the water recovery from the tailing disposal site or from thickeners generates a decrease of water specific energy consumption, where in the case of the water recovery from the tailing disposal site such decrease rate becomes stronger with the amount of water recovered. Results also shows that, except for very high solid concentrations, water makeup costs dominate over recirculation ones, supporting that producing thickened tailings is a more efficient option than conventional ones in the sense of specific energy consumption, in spite of the additional energy costs due to slurry transport that this option implies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Long distance pipelines; Mineral processing; Ore concentrate; Tailings; Water reclamation","Cost functions; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Minerals; Ores; Pipelines; Recovery; Tailings; Tailings disposal; Throughput; Wastewater reclamation; Water pipelines; Water supply; Water supply systems; High solid concentration; Long distance pipelines; Mass and energy balance; Mineral processing; Mineral processing plants; Ore concentrate; Processing capacities; Specific energy consumption; Pipeline processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041106976

The photovoltaic system supplies power to a DC load. When the power of the photovoltaic source is insufficient, the electrical grid compensates the energy deficit. On the other hand, if the load is satisfied and the PV source is still able of supplying energy, the energy excess is diverted to an own storage unit materialized by an electrolysis which produces gaseous hydrogen by the process of electrolysis of water. The authors show that the quantity of hydrogen produced is proportional to the photovoltaic energy excess and also to the flow of water injected into the electrolysis. In this case, it is a question of designing an electrolysis with specific characteristics, which takes into account the quantity of energy excess and the flow of water injected into it. The authors abandon the idea of controlling the water flow by means of a pumping-electrovalve system, and initiate the idea of replacing the function of the pump by the action of gravity. The work focuses on the development of an electrolysis optimization approach using the water flow control in its alliance with the PV power excess which is also maximized. For an optimized use of the global system (load and electrolysis), the authors present an architecture based on energy-converting structures (DC/DC and AC/DC). In addition, to increase the reliability and safety of the system, the authors finish by developing a power management strategy (PMS) in the designed system. This power management strategy organizes the energy flow and selects the appropriate path of this flow between the two energy sources (PV and electrical grid) and the two possible energy receivers (load and electrolysis). A complete modeling of the system is developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results show that the hybrid system (PV and electrical grid) is able to permanently supplying the load and potentially storing the excess of the PV energy in the form of hydrogen gas. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Electrical grid; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Photovoltaic; Power management; Water flow control","DC-DC converters; Electric power measurement; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Flow control; Flow of water; Hybrid systems; Hydraulics; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Power management; Virtual storage; Electrical grids; Electrolysis of waters; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Optimization approach; Photovoltaic; Power management strategies; Reliability and safeties; Water flow control; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036584728

The current work aims to elucidate the polymorphism behavior of the model compound indomethacin as well as the mechanism of polymorph selection of drugs in semicrystalline systems. Indomethacin crystallized as either the α- or -form, a new metastable form, or a mixture of the two polymorphs in dispersions containing different drug loadings in polyethylene glycol, poloxamer, or Gelucire as the result of the variation in the mobility of drug molecules. As a general rule, low molecular mobility of the amorphous drug favors the crystallization into thermodynamically stable forms whereas metastable crystalline polymorphs are preferred when the molecular mobility of the drug is sufficiently high. This rule provides insight into the polymorph selection of numerous active pharmaceutical ingredients in semicrystalline dispersions and can be used as a guide for polymorphic screening from melt crystallization by tuning the mobility of drug molecules. In addition, the drug crystallized faster while the polymer crystallized slower as the drug-loading increased with the maxima of drug crystallization rate in 70% indomethacin dispersion. Increasing the drug content in solid dispersions reduced the to α polymorphic transition rate, except for when the more stable form was initially dominant. The segregation of and α polymorphs as well as the polymorphic transformation during storage led to the inherent inhomogeneity of the semicrystalline dispersions. This study highlights and expands our understanding about the complex crystallization behavior of semicrystalline systems and is crucial for preparation of solid dispersions with reproducible and consistent physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical performance. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","activation energy; amorphous; crystallization; Gibbs energy; indomethacin; interfacial energy; metastable; molecular mobility; nucleation; poloxamer; polyethylene glycol; polymorphism; semicrystalline; solid dispersions","gelucire; indometacin; macrogol; poloxamer; polymer; drug carrier; fat; Gelucire 50-13; indometacin; oil; Article; crystal; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; dispersion; high performance liquid chromatography; infrared spectroscopy; microscopy; physical chemistry; priority journal; viscosity; X ray powder diffraction; chemistry; crystallization; drug formulation; medicinal chemistry; nonlinear optical microscopy; procedures; solubility; X ray diffraction; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Crystallization; Drug Carriers; Drug Compounding; Fats; Indomethacin; Nonlinear Optical Microscopy; Oils; Poloxamer; Polyethylene Glycols; Solubility; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041817662

As fuel and air are never mixed, the energy penalty typically associated with gas separation in first-generation carbon capture and storage technologies can be avoided. To be considered as oxygen carrier for this process, a material should be reactive at relevant conditions, environmentally friendly, non-toxic, mechanically durable and have potential to be produced at low cost in large scale. Combined oxides of manganese and silicon have previously shown promise to meet these requirements. In this study, a spray-dried oxygen carrier based on a combined oxide of manganese, silicon and titanium was examined with respect to its performance in continuous chemical looping combustion of solid fuels. The experiments were carried out in a 10 kW chemical looping pilot unit which uses interconnected fluidized beds for oxygen carrier cycling. Prior to these experiments, the attrition rate was determined in a jet-cup rig. As the particles were comparably small and light, elutriation from the air reactor was high. The fuels used during a total experimental duration of 32 h were wood char, devolatilized hard coal, pet coke and lignite. In addition to varying fuels, the influence of fuel power, solids circulation and fuel reactor temperature were investigated. Gas conversion performance correlated clearly with the volatile content of the fuels, peaking at 97.8% for wood char and 94.6% for pet coke, which is the highest value ever reached for this particular fuel in this unit. Higher temperatures and solids circulation rates increased gas conversion. No decrease in performance over time, in particular no loss of reactivity due to sulphur accumulation, could be detected. The oxygen carrier released gaseous oxygen at relevant conditions. The particles were easily fluidized and fines production was low, suggesting a sufficient lifetime for the purpose. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BECCS; Chemical looping combustion; CLOU; Solid fuels","Carbon capture; Coal combustion; Emission control; Fighter aircraft; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Gas fuel storage; Manganese; Metal fuels; Oxygen; Petroleum coke; Silicon; Titanium; Titanium oxides; Wood fuels; BECCS; Capture and storage technologies; Chemical looping combustion; CLOU; Interconnected fluidized bed; Solid fuels; Solids circulation; Solids circulation rates; Fluidized bed combustion; circulation; combustion; high temperature; manganese; separation; silicon; titanium; transport process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044764218

The reaction of the public to CCS will considerably affect the development of the technology. Previous research has identified general and local mechanisms in how the general public reacts to CCS. Researchers have noticed that differences exist between countries, but the effects of cross-cultural differences have not been explored in detail. We argue that it is crucial to understand how public perceptions of the technology emerge and form in their individual contexts or embedded in large-scale cultural frameworks. Public reaction to CCS is structured in two dimensions—risk perception and benefit perception—and we design a model with individual and national cultural level predictors. We indicate that effects of individual level variables such as familiarity with technology, or sociodemographic variables such as education, are important but their effects are likely mediated and confounded by the cultural setting people operate in. The results show that, in parallel with other factors such as trust, risk perception is affected by cultural dimensions such as uncertainty avoidance and the society's short-term or long-term orientation. We provide a framework to understand why and how societies challenge the technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Climate change; Energy policy; National culture; Risk perception; Social acceptability; Social acceptance","Climate change; Energy policy; Risk perception; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Cross-cultural differences; Individual level variables; National cultures; Social acceptability; Social acceptance; Socio-demographic variables; Uncertainty avoidance; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; energy policy; local participation; public attitude; risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044752750

The goal of this work is to evaluate from a techno-economic point of view such a plant that uses captured CO2 and renewable H2 obtained in a carbon-free way and produces methanol (MeOH). The paper presents (i) the impact of using a higher conversion rate (30%) than in previously reported works, (ii) the use of a gas turbine and (iii) the addition of organic Rankine cycles (ORC) for reducing the energy consumption. The CCUS plant uses 142.6∗106 kg of CO2 annually, reduces the amount of CO2 emitted by 140∗106 kg/year and produces 100∗106 kg/year of MeOH. H2 is obtained on site, using a water-electrolyzing unit; this consumes 130 MWe and generates the necessary H2 for the process. The proposed MeOH production plant is designed and simulated in ChemCAD. Total purchased equipment cost and operational costs are estimated using the process flow modeling. Key performance indicators (KPI) are calculated using the mass and energy balances obtained. The calculated capital costs are similar to previously reported results in the literature. A rigorous mass and energy integration of the plant resulted in an energetically fully self-sufficient MeOH plant, not taking into account the water-hydrolyzing unit. Electricity price is the main contributor for operational costs, either this should be halved, MeOH prices should increase two times or CO2 prices should increase to 0.255 €/kg to make the process economically viable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This converter uses only 9 active switches, making it cheaper than conventional matrix converter.

Justo 4302, Mar del Plata, 7600, Argentina","The self-assembly of n-alkyl chains at the bulk or at the interface of different types of materials and substrates has been extensively studied in the past. The packing of alkyl chains is driven by Van der Waals interactions and can generate crystalline or disordered domains, at the bulk of the material, or self-assembled monolayers at an interface. This natural property of alkyl chains has been employed in recent years to develop a new generation of materials for technological applications. These studies are dispersed in a variety of journals. The purpose of this article was to discuss some selected examples where these advanced properties arise from a process involving the self-assembly of alkyl chains. We included a description of electronic devices and new-generation catalysts with properties derived from a controlled two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) self-assembly of alkyl chains at an interface. Then, we showed that controlling the crystallization of alkyl chains at the bulk can be used to generate a variety of advanced materials such as superhydrophobic coatings, shape memory hydrogels, hot-melt adhesives, thermally reversible light scattering (TRLS) films for intelligent windows and form-stable phase change materials (FS-PCMs) for the storage of thermal energy. Finally, we discussed two examples where advanced properties derive from the formation of disordered domains by physical association of alkyl chains. This was the case of photoluminescent nanocomposites and materials used for reversible optical storage. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alkyl chains; Amphiphilic materials; Crystallization of alkyl chains; self-assembled monolayers (SAMs); Self-assembly of alkyl chains","Films; Hot melt adhesives; Interfaces (materials); Light scattering; Phase change memory; Self assembled monolayers; Self assembly; Van der Waals forces; Alkyl chain; Amphiphilic materials; Form stable phase change material; Sams; Superhydrophobic coatings; Technological applications; Threedimensional (3-d); Van Der Waals interactions; Phase change materials; adhesive agent; alkyl group; nanocomposite; self assembled monolayer; equipment design; hot melt extrusion; hydrogel; hydrogenation; hydrophobicity; light scattering; material coating; nanocatalyst; priority journal; Review; thermally reversible light scattering",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032229649

The hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Molar mass was determined by viscometric method. Rheological profiling of the hydrogels was carried out by rheological measurements at various temperatures and methacrylamide contents in hydrogels. Thermogravimetric data were analyzed to assess the kinetic triplet by iso-conversional method. The values of apparent activation energy (Ea) figured out from TG data were measured for each step by Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose method. On the findings of results, the decomposition reaction of terpolymeric hydrogels has been analyzed as a slow reaction, which is evident from the low-frequency factor values (A), i.e., 3 × 106, 2 × 1010, and 4 × 1015 s−1, respectively. The master plot method was used to predict the mechanism for degradation of MANIPAM-7. Flow curve and frequency sweep tests at different temperatures showed temperature dependency with shear rate indicating the pseudo-plastic nature of the synthesized samples. The rheological parameters were analyzed using various models. Out of these methods, the Ostwald, modified Bingham, and Herschel–Bulkley models were established to provide better fit to experimental data. Dynamic moduli measured as a function of angular frequency showed viscoelastic nature of all the samples. Frequency sweep studies indicated that storage (G′) and loss modulus (G″) showed an increase with increasing concentration of methacrylamide. Composition dependency of crossover frequency directed an increase in relaxation time with methacrylamide contents in the hydrogel. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Dynamic moduli; Flow curves; Iso-conversional method; Thermal degradation","Acrylic monomers; Activation energy; Amides; Carboxylic acids; Degradation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital storage; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Free radical polymerization; Free radicals; Polymer blends; Pyrolysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear flow; Thermogravimetric analysis; Apparent activation energy; Dynamic moduli; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Flow curves; Iso-conversional method; Rheological measurements; Synthesis and characterizations; Temperature dependencies; Hydrogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020527650

This process is mostly applied at switched mode power supplies (SMPS), where electrolytic capacitor within given period of operation acts as energy storage element (discharge period). Charging and discharging process of EDLC may cause additional heating, which consequently influences capacitor’s lifetime. This parameter (lifetime) is nowadays very important parameter of EDLC, because operational life of the most of complex power electronic systems is directly influenced by its most critical components, i.e., by electrolytic capacitors. In this paper, the theory necessary for capacitor analysis and analysis of heat transfer is presented. The particular aluminum electrolytic capacitor Nichicon is examined in the paper. The implementation of real model into COMSOL Multiphysics and consequent simulation settings are being described too. Based on the main parameters of target application, the simulation analysis is processed. These results are consequently verified by experimental measurements on a given sample of EDLC. Deviations between measured and simulated data are identified, and optimization steps for better accuracy are also given. Finally, the factors influencing the lifetime of electrolytic capacitors together with calculation of capacitor’s lifetime in power application are described. During lifetime estimation, heat transfer simulation modeling of capacitor is utilized. Presented approach offers acceleration of necessary variables identification, which are hardly to be identified with the use of measurements, e.g., capacitor’s core temperature. Thus, more accurate results regarding lifetime estimation can be achieved. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electrolytic capacitor; Lifetime; Power supply; Thermal effects; Thermal model","Capacitors; Digital storage; Electrolytic analysis; Heat transfer; Shape memory effect; Switched mode power supplies; Thermal effects; Thermoanalysis; Aluminum electrolytic capacitors; Charge and discharge; Double layer capacitor; Heat transfer simulation; Lifetime; Power electronic systems; Power supply; Thermal model; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995810945

Leaf blackening significantly reduces product quality and vase life, and is often the main reason for consignment rejection. This serious disorder has major negative consequences for export to international, long-distance markets. A shift from air to sea freight is progressively favored within the international flower trade. Sea freight is by far the more cost-effective alternative, with the additional benefit of reducing the energy consumed during the transport of these luxury products. Whilst sea freight offers more precise control and maintenance of the cold chain, a significantly longer cold storage period is required, which enhances the probability for the onset and development of leaf blackening. In order to maintain product quality under long-term storage conditions to ensure an extended vase life, a better understanding of how and why this postharvest disorder manifests itself is imperative. Factors which may be of relevance in the development of leaf blackening, such as water stress, carbohydrate stress, high respiration rates, nectar production, light and possibly ethylene, are discussed. Progress in the development of strategies to control leaf blackening is reviewed and include: girdling beneath the inflorescence; carbohydrate pulsing; ethanol pulsing; rapid cooling immediately after harvesting; and storage under controlled atmosphere. The latter technology, along with dynamic controlled atmosphere (DCA) and initial low oxygen stress (ILOS) warrants further investigation. Currently, approaches to reduce leaf blackening may vary widely between species and cultivars and with cultural practices, as each is prone to its own incidence of the disorder. As such, future research will need to be focused on a finer scale, such as the genetic level using an approach such as RNA-sequencing technology. An understanding of the genetic basis of the postharvest disorder may provide greater insight into the physiological processes and may better equip producers with finding alternate strategies to combat leaf blackening. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The upgrading process for biogas involves the removal of CO2. Amine scrubbing is one traditional method of upgrading that is applied due to its low methane slippage and its capability to provide a high purity renewable methane product. However, new technologies such as power to gas (P2G) can also upgrade biogas through biological methanation by combining the CO2 in biogas with H2 to produce renewable methane. The H2 for P2G can be produced through electrolysis of renewable electricity. Through simulation software – SuperPro Designer, the economics of different pathways for upgrading biogas from a grass silage and slurry fed digester are analysed and compared in this paper. Three scenarios were investigated: biogas upgrading through amine scrubbing (scenario 1); biogas upgrading through amine scrubbing with CO2 directed to ex-situ biological methanation (scenario 2) and biogas upgrading through ex-situ biological methanation only (scenario 3). The results show that at a net present value of zero, the minimum selling price (MSP) per m3 of renewable methane for scenario 1, 2 and 3 is €0.76; €1.50 and €1.43, respectively (with an electricity price to produce H2 of €0.10/kWh and a grass silage production cost of €27/t). The electricity price has a significant effect on the cost of renewable methane in both scenarios 2 and 3. The MSP reduces to €1.09 and €1.00 per m3 of renewable methane, respectively for scenarios 2 and 3, if the electricity price is reduced to €0.05/kWh. Since the renewable methane MSP from scenario 2 is higher than scenario 3, it is suggested that direct biogas injection to the methanation reactor is financially more attractive than capturing CO2 from biogas and feeding it to the methanation step. The MSP of renewable methane from both scenarios 2 and 3 are significantly higher than that of scenario 1. However, when considering climate change mitigation, balancing of the electricity network and storage of surplus electricity, utilising P2G can offset some of these costs. The cost of H2 is a significant factor in determining the cost of renewable methane. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amine scrubber; Biological power to gas; CO2 capture; Economic analysis; Methanation; Process simulation","Biogas; Bioinformatics; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer software; Economic analysis; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Scrubbers; Climate change mitigation; CO2 capture; Electricity networks; Process simulations; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Simulation software; Techno-Economic analysis; Costs; alternative energy; bioenergy; biogas; carbon sequestration; chemical reaction; economic analysis; electrokinesis; equipment; pollutant removal; simulation; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041681953

In this proposal the dithers’ amplitude is WT system dependent, not constant or decreasing exponentially as in the classic ESC schemes. So, instead of one, the proposed ESC scheme has two loops: (1) the classic ESC loop controlled by the loop gain (k1) to accurately find the Maximum Power Point (MPP); (2) the anticipative ESC loop controlled by the dither gain (k2) to speed-up the localization of the current MPP under turbulent wind. The obtained results for a 100 Hz dither highlight the performance of the ESC-based MPP tracking algorithm proposed: about 99.9% tracking accuracy and a searching time less than 120 ms.

Photovoltaic solar energy is the electricity produced by transforming part of the solar radiation using a photovoltaic cell. Photovoltaic cells are manufactured with semiconductor materials produced from a very pure material, such as silicon. These materials emit electrons when subjected to the action of light. These are ejected from the material and in a closed circuit, thereby producing electricity. Most people know about photovoltaic, wind, and some other renewable energy sources, but because of their nonlinearity, hybrid energy systems are proposed to overcome this problem with important improvements. In general, hybridization consists of combining several energy sources and storage units within the same system to optimize the production and energy management.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers are powered by grid connected PV system. In this system design, electrical grid is considered as a virtual energy storage system (VESS) where the surplus of PV production can be injected and subsequently taken to support the electrolyser. Methanol (ME) and hybrid sulfur (HSE) electrolysis are compared to the conventional water electrolysis (WE) in term of operating cell voltage. Based on the experimental results reported in the literature, semi-empirical models describing the relationship between the hydrogen production rate and the electrolyser cell power input are proposed. Furthermore, power and hydrogen management strategy (PHMS) is developed. Case study is carried out to show the impact of each type of electrolysis on the system component sizes and evaluate the hydrogen production potentialities. Results show that the use of ME allows to produce 65% more hydrogen than with using WE. Moreover, the amount of hydrogen produced is almost double in the case of HSE. At Algiers city, based on a grid connected PV/Electrolyser system, it is possible to produce about 25 g/m2 d and 29 g/m2 d of hydrogen, respectively, through ME and HSE compared to 15 g/m2 d of hydrogen when using WE. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Grid connected photovoltaic system; Hybrid sulfur electrolysis; Methanol electrolysis; Power and hydrogen management strategy; Semi-empirical model; Water electrolysis","Dielectric properties; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Methanol; Photovoltaic cells; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Sulfur; Sulfur determination; Comparative performance analysis; Grid connected PV system; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Hydrogen management; Hydrogen production rate; Proton-exchange membrane; Semi-empirical modeling; Water electrolysis; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039911161

Recent changes in climate results in storms and extended distribution of green gasses around the globe. These gases can cause acid rain and other environmental effects while influencing the quality of the surfaces of the energy storage and energy harvesting devices. In this case, chemically active fluid gradually collected on the surfaces gives rise corrosion and gradually erosion of the surfaces. Therefore, corrosion prevention of such surfaces becomes vital for sustainable and cost effective operation. On the other hand, metallic and non-metallic materials are widely used in the construction of the energy harvesting and thermal energy storage devices. The corrosion prevention of these materials in open environment requires surface treatment toward generating a passive layer while preventing surfaces from the chemical attacks. Consequently, in this chapter, the necessity of corrosion prevention of surfaces is introduced and some fundamentals of corrosion reactions and measurement techniques are presented. Generation of passive layer on such material surfaces is incorporated in the later sections. The electrochemical response and corrosion rates of treated surfaces in controlled environment is brought attention for various selective materials including alumina, titanium and copper alloys, aluminum-silicon composite, high-strength low alloy steel, and Hastelloy alloy. The findings of electrochemical tests are discussed in detail in the relevant sections. The future research direction is also included at the end of this chapter. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The building was locating at the northern part of Sweden and was served by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). The data from on-site measurements and analytical model were applied to evaluate the reduction potential of the suggested heat recovery system. The study focused on the evaluation of benefit of using an air preheater in front of the existing MVHR system. Two different sizes of an air preheater design: Small air preheater with the size of 0.4 m × 0.4 m × 0.4 m (AP0.4m×0.4m×0.4m), feed with waste water flow of 0.15 kg/s (from storage tank to air preheater); and a large air preheater with the size of 0.8 m × 0.8 m × 0.4 m (AP0.8m×0.8m×0.4m), feed with waste water flow of 0.2 kg/s.

They are widely used in nuclear power plant, medical facilities, nuclear shelters, and for radioactive materials transportation as well as storage of radioactive wastes. In this study four different concrete mixes were prepared with the following different types of coarse aggregates: dolomite, barite, goethite, and steel slag. The effect of changes in the fine aggregates, selected to be 50 % local sand and 50 % limonite with addition of 10 % silica fume (SF) and 10 % fly ash (FA) by replacement of the total cement weight, on the performance of the samples was also investigated. To examine the performance of such samples for radiation shielding applications, a set of physical, mechanical, and radiation attenuation properties was studied and compared with those of ordinary concrete. This investigation includes compressive strength, slump test, bulk density, ultrasonic pulse velocity test, and gamma rays attenuation measurements for the different samples. A verification of the experimental results concerning the radiation attenuation measurements was performed using WinXcom program (Version 3.1). The experimental results revealed that all concrete mixes; goethite-limonite concrete (G.L), barite-limonite concrete (B.L), steel slag-limonite concrete (S.L) and dolomite concrete (D.C) have good physical and mechanical properties that successfully satisfying them as high performance concretes. In addition the barite-limonite and the steel slag-limonite have the higher γ-ray attenuation coefficients at low and high energy range and hence have a better radiation shielding. The obtained results from WinXcom program calculations showed a good agreement with the experimental results concerning γ-ray attenuation measurements for the studied concrete mixes. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We evaluated in a large-scale study the reproduction cost of females and males of Leptuca uruguayensis in a temperate estuary, where their reproductive efforts are synchronized in a short reproductive season. The reproductive investments (vitellogenesis, spermatophore production, and male reproductive behaviors) were measured and related to the dynamics of storage and expenditure of energy reserves (glycogen, total lipids, and total protein) in the hepatopancreas, ovary, and muscle of the enlarged cheliped, throughout one annual cycle. Maximum energy storage occurred in winter, a period of low activity, whereas minimum energy storage occurred during the reproductive period, characterized by expensive activities. The glycogen reserves of the hepatopancreas decreased about 66% in females and 61% in males, suggesting high and similar physiological costs of reproduction between sexes, despite their different reproductive strategies to maximize their fitness. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Glycogen reserves; Leptuca uruguayensis; Male courtship behaviors; Sperm repletion; Vitellogenesis","animal; Brachyura; energy metabolism; female; growth, development and aging; male; metabolism; oocyte; physiology; reproduction; season; sexual behavior; Animals; Brachyura; Energy Metabolism; Female; Male; Oocytes; Reproduction; Seasons; Sexual Behavior, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041586807

The primary function of PHA is the storage of carbon and energy. Nevertheless, there are numerous reports that the presence of PHA granules in microbial cells enhances their stress resistance and fitness when exposed to various stress factors. In this work, we studied the protective mechanism of PHA granules against UV irradiation employing Cupriavidus necator as a model bacterial strain. The PHA-accumulating wild type strain showed substantially higher UV radiation resistance than the PHA non-accumulating mutant. Furthermore, the differences in UV-Vis radiation interactions with both cell types were studied using various spectroscopic approaches (turbidimetry, absorption spectroscopy, and nephelometry). Our results clearly demonstrate that intracellular PHA granules efficiently scatter UV radiation, which provides a substantial UV-protective effect for bacterial cells and, moreover, decreases the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species in UV-challenged cells. The protective properties of the PHA granules are enhanced by the fact that granules specifically bind to DNA, which in turn provides shield-like protection of DNA as the most UV-sensitive molecule. To conclude, the UV-protective action of PHA granules adds considerable value to their primary storage function, which can be beneficial in numerous environments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cupriavidus necator; Integrating sphere; Nephelometry; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Turbidity; UV radiation","Absorption spectroscopy; Cells; Cytology; Irradiation; Light scattering; Nephelometers; Radiation effects; Turbidity; Ultraviolet radiation; Cupriavidus necator; Integrating spheres; Nephelometry; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Protective properties; Radiation interactions; Radiation resistance; Reactive oxygen species; Granulation; DNA; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; bacterial DNA; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; bacterium; cell; DNA; ester; fitness; granular medium; irradiation; light scattering; prokaryote; reactive oxygen species; spectroscopy; stress resistance; ultraviolet radiation; absorption spectroscopy; Article; autofluorescence; bacterial cell; bacterial strain; bacterial viability; bacterium culture; cell density; cell suspension; cell ultrastructure; controlled study; Cupriavidus necator; cytoplasm; dispersion; DNA binding; flow cytometry; light absorption; light scattering; nephelometry; nonhuman; optical density; percentage of viable cells; photochemistry; radiation exposure; turbidimetry; turbidity; ultraviolet irradiation; wild type; chemistry; metabolism; microbial viability; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cupriavidus necator; Prokaryota; Cupriavidus necator; DNA, Bacterial; Microbial Viability; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040786575

The present study is focusing on Aspen Hysys™ simulations of different CO2 capture process configurations (namely “Rich Solvent Recycle” (RSR), “Solvent Split Flow” (SSF), “Lean/Rich Vapor Compression” (L/RVC)) applied to the flue gas coming from the Norcem Brevik cement plant (taken as case study) and using three different solvents, namely: monoethanolamine (MEA), piperazine (PZ) and piperazine-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) blend.

Total equivalent thermodynamic works and utilities costs were also analyzed.

This work aims to investigate by modeling and experimentation the effect of dividing the working duration into two bouts, where different PCM melting temperatures are used in each bout. An integrated bio-heat and fabric-PCM model predictions of physiological and subjective votes are validated via active human subject testing at hot conditions. A parametric study is performed to select, at two conditions (40 °C and 45 °C), the optimal PCM melting temperatures of the two bouts that would result with similar thermal comfort and sensation to the optimal single-bout case. The optimal case achieves most reductions in energy use for PCM regeneration, PCM carried weight and material cost. The results of the parametric study showed that heat storage is reduced in the second bout due to wearing the second vest with lower PCM melting temperature, thus thermal comfort and sensation are significantly improved. The optimal case at the 40 °C environment uses a vest with 21 °C PCMs in the first bout and a vest with 21 °C PCMs in the second bout (V21→V21).

Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to compare (selected) protein expression levels across fresh, partially dehydrated and stored seeds. A total of 114 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in embryonic axes of fresh seeds and those seeds exposed to dehydration and hydrated storage (which exposed seeds to a mild dehydration stress). Proteins involved in protein synthesis were up-regulated in stored and dehydrated seeds, possibly in response to dehydration-induced repair processes and/or germinative development. A range of proteins related to antioxidant protection were variably up- and down-regulated in stored and dehydrated seeds, respectively. Additionally, a class I heat shock protein was down-regulated in dehydrated and stored seeds; no late embryogenesis abundant proteins were identified in both stored and dehydrated seeds; and storage and dehydration up-regulated proteins involved in the provision of energy for cell survival. The results suggest that dehydration- and storage-induced viability loss in recalcitrant seeds may be based on proteomic changes that lead to cellular redox imbalance and increased cell energy demands. This, together with the absence/down-regulation of proteins associated with desiccation tolerance in plant tissues may form part of the proteomic footprint for desiccation sensitivity in seeds. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Desiccation; Hydrated storage; Proteomics; Recalcitrant seeds; Redox metabolism","plant protein; transcriptome; desiccation; gene expression profiling; genetics; Meliaceae; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; Desiccation; Gene Expression Profiling; Meliaceae; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038868455

This can reduce the electricity demand of the air conditioning systems. Furthermore, these systems can provide possibility of energy storage in the form of chemical energy in the liquid desiccant solution or thermal energy in the solar collector hot water. This article simulates a liquid desiccant dehumidification cycle by two dynamic models: transient and discrete-steady state model. The transient model takes into consider the unsteady term in the governing equations for both the dehumidifier/regenerator model and also liquid-liquid heat exchanger model. While, in the other dynamic model, the steady state terms are used only. Correspondingly, a liquid desiccant dehumidification system was constructed, troubleshoot and field tested at summer conditions. According to the simulation results, the dynamic models are compatible with the variances in operating conditions and supply heating water. Also, the deviation between the humidity ratio results from simulation and field test effects on the simulated solution concentration with less than 4% deviation. The maximum deviation between the moisture removal rate results from simulation and test are −0.21 g/s in the dehumidifier and −0.5 g/s in the regenerator. Thus, the models of liquid desiccant system have reliability to predict the performance with solution storage mode. The comparison between simulation results shows that the disagreement between the two employed dynamic models is insignificant. However, the transient model reduces the computational time by 21% less than the discrete-steady state model. This can speed up the processing time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air conditioning; Dehumidification; Liquid Desiccant","Air conditioning; Driers (materials); Dynamic models; Electric energy storage; Humidity control; Solar collectors; Dehumidification; Electricity demands; Heat exchanger model; Liquid desiccant; Liquid desiccant air-conditioning; Liquid desiccant system; Operating condition; Steady-state modeling; Liquids; air conditioning; concentration (composition); discrete element method; electricity; energy conservation; humidity; numerical model; performance assessment; simulation; steady-state equilibrium; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038821340

An energy storage system was integrated in the PV power plant primarily to enhance the power-control capability of the PV system. Because the the focus of this paper is on how the PV-storage system can provide dynamic frequency support in the microgrid, a frequency controller was added to the control scheme of the voltage source converter (VSC) that interfaced the PV power plant with the microgrid. The PV response to frequency deviations was adapted from the existing Romanian grid code and, according to the system's characteristics, a modified power-frequency curve was proposed.

In this study, simulation based performance analysis of a solar assisted single effect absorption cooling system is done for two system configurations in TRNSYS. The analysis is carried out to meet a peak cooling demand of 298 kW for an educational building located in Islamabad (33.71°N, 73.06°E). In configuration-1 (C-1), the working fluid returning from the generator of the absorption chiller always flows towards the hot storage tank which acts as a common element between the solar collector and the absorption chiller. In configuration-2 (C-2), the working fluid returning from the absorption chiller may become isolated from the collector-storage tank loop if the fluid temperature in the storage tank is less than the required temperature (i.e. 110 °C) and is directly fed to the auxiliary boiler. Both system configurations are fully modelled in TRNSYS and dynamic simulations are run for the entire summer season. Various performance factors such as solar fraction, collector efficiency and primary energy savings are evaluated to optimize the key system design variables which include collector tilt, storage volume, type and size of the solar collector. Simulation results demonstrate that for the whole summer season, C-2 with flat plate or evacuated tube solar collectors always results in higher primary energy savings than C-1. However, on the basis of solar fraction and monthly collector efficiency, difference between C-1 and C-2 is estimated to be marginal. Overall, C-2 in conjunction with evacuated tube collectors (ETC) results in minimum collector area per kilowatt of cooling demand and higher monthly collector efficiency than C-1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption cooling; Primary energy savings; Solar fraction; TRNSYS","Collector efficiency; Cooling; Cooling systems; Energy conservation; Fluids; Hot working; Refrigerators; Solar collectors; Tanks (containers); Thermoelectric equipment; Educational buildings; Evacuated tube collectors; Evacuated tube solar collector; Performance analysis; Primary energy savings; Solar fraction; System configurations; TRNSYS; Absorption cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037868135

HS at 75 MPa caused a reduction of about 3.5 log units of initial microbial counts, leading to an increase of the microbial shelf-life of at least 25 days, compared to RF (3 days) and HS at 50 MPa, while at 60 MPa a microbial growth slowdown was observed, increasing the microbial shelf-life to at least 6 days. Additionally, at 75 MPa no changes in colour was detected during the 25 days. However, HS/RT enhanced an increase in primary and secondary lipid oxidation products compared to RF, while for atmospheric pressure at room temperature, tertiary lipid oxidation increased. HS may represent an interesting methodology for fresh fish shelf-life extension by microbial growth inhibition and microbial reduction, with additional energy saving when compared to RF. Industrial relevance Hyperbaric storage at room temperature (HS/RT) has shown a shelf-life extension of fresh fish salmon, as well as possible energy savings, when compared to conventional refrigeration. HS/RT only involves energy consumption during the compression and decompression phases, not requiring additional energy to control the temperature or maintain the product under pressure.

Conversely, the inherent 2nd order power harmonic ripples burden inverters’ DC-Side. In fact, the passive solution to buffer these ripples imposes a threat to inverter's reliability and power density. Hence, varieties of active power decoupling methods were introduced in the literature to improve inverter's DC-Side volume and system's reliability. Yet, most existing techniques require auxiliary power electronics and energy storage elements. This contradicts the goal of optimizing system's overall power density. Therefore, a novel LLCL filter for grid-connected applications is introduced that merges AC-Side and DC-Side volume minimization methods without additional power electronics devices. Precisely, the common-mode (CM) operation is harnessed for active power decoupling and the differential-mode (DM) is utilized for active power injection. Besides, the stability analysis of the proposed system revealed that the CM and DM are resonating. Thus, an active resonance damping control scheme based on decoupled CM and DM capacitor currents feedbacks was developed. With the proposed topology, the DC-link capacitor was reduced 40 times compared to the passive solution. The robustness of the proposed solution to the grid-side inductance variation was also verified and validated on 750 W prototype system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Active LLCL resonance damping; Active power decoupling; Grid-connected PV; Inverter","Bandpass filters; Damping; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Passive filters; Power electronics; Resonance; Active power decoupling; Active resonance damping; Grid-connected PV; Inverter; Modeling and control; Power electronics devices; Resonance damping; Transformerless inverters; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033393600

Linseed oil was pretreated with multifunctional corn ingredient (E25 and E50) and alginate mixture (G25 and G50). No impairments in water binding properties of the modified frankfurter matrix were observed. Significant increase in b* and h values was observed, intensively in G treatments. Significantly higher hardness was observed in E25 and chewiness in both E treatments. During storage, an increase in yellowness, hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness was recorded in all treatments including control. Significant improvement of fatty acid profiles was recorded in all modified frankfurters. Observed differences in some parameters of technological characteristics were not confirmed in sensory evaluations. The results of sensory analysis indicate that the level of fat replacement with linseed oil and the manner of pretreatment did not lead to unacceptability. Practical applications: Frankfurters are well-known comminuted meat products usually made from pork and beef, but despite a considerable increase in poultry meat production over the past two decades, research on all-poultry frankfurters with fat partly replaced by pretreated oil are rare. The results of this current study showed that all-chicken frankfurters with 50% of recommended daily intake of ALA had very similar characteristics to control, while increasing content of linseed oil (to 100%) potentially can impair sensory characteristics, depending of oil pretreatment, but not below the acceptability.

Optimization-based strategies are formulated within a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Three strategies based on MPC are proposed and implemented, namely, centralized, decentralized and distributed MPC. The formulated strategies for voltage control are compared in a case study using a modified CIGRÉ European 3-area low-voltage network. Results indicate that decentralized MPC gives a better voltage profile in the network when compared to local voltage control strategy, since the latter inherently fails to maintain voltages of buses in the network not connected to photovoltaics or battery storage system within limits. Centralized MPC strategy is able to provide the optimal voltage profile across the network but utilizes 13% higher reactive power from the control devices to achieve this when compared to decentralized MPC. The latter performs well as long as the reactive power reserves within an area is sufficient but faces drawbacks similar to that of local voltage control strategy when the reactive reserves are completely exhausted. Distributed MPC utilizes 1.3% higher amount of reactive power reserves compared to centralized MPC in order to provide a network voltage profile similar to that of the latter while also yielding architectural advantages of decentralized MPC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Centralized control; Decentralized control; Distributed control; Distribution system; Local voltage control; Model predictive control","Data storage equipment; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric batteries; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Reactive power; Voltage control; Battery energy storage systems; Centralized control; Coordinated voltage control; Distributed control; Distribution systems; Low-voltage distributions; Reactive power reserves; Voltage control strategies; Decentralized control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028705637

Moreover, additional surface functionalization steps, such as the addition of nitrogen- or oxygen-containing groups, are more and more explored to increase the activity or the chemical stability of catalysts. In this work, we investigate a new methodology for the fabrication of nickel/carbon nanocatalysts relying on a low-pressure radio frequency plasma treatment of solid (powder) precursors. A mesoporous carbon xerogel is used as support for nickel NPs synthesized through the decomposition of an organometallic nickel precursor in a plasma discharge. Different plasma treatment conditions and chemical environments are applied by varying the plasma power and the gas mixture injected into the plasma chamber (Ar, N2, NH3, and O2). The nucleation kinetics of nickel NPs, their morphology evolution, and chemical state were fully characterized by combining analytical techniques such as in situ optical emission spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results indicate that the plasma chemistry and conditions strongly influence the organometallic compound decomposition as well as the size and the oxidation state of the homogeneously dispersed nickel NPs. We compare the organometallic precursor degradation efficiency for each plasma by defining a rational ""activation power"" associated with each plasma chemistry. Moreover, simultaneous carbon substrate functionalization is obtained through plasma treatment, which demonstrates the high versatility of the plasma fabrication for developing green and efficient catalysts and energy materials. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","low-pressure plasma; nanocatalysts; nickel nanoparticles; optical emission spectroscopy; organometal; photoelectron spectroscopy; surface functionalization","Ammonia; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Decomposition; Degradation; Environmental impact; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Light emission; Light transmission; Mesoporous materials; Metal nanoparticles; Morphology; Nanocatalysts; Nickel; Optical emission spectroscopy; Organometallics; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photons; Plasma applications; Substrates; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Degradation efficiency; Low pressure plasma; Nickel nanoparticles; Organometallic compounds; Organometallic precursors; Oxygen containing groups; Radio-frequency plasma treatment; Surface Functionalization; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050409647

The aim of the hydrogen storage technologies is thus to reduce the volume that hydrogen occupies in its thermodynamically stable state under conditions close to ambient salt. Recent work on hydrogen storage is mainly based on the use of metal hydrides. These metal hydrides have a high capacity for the hydrogen storage in the operating conditions. The effecting parameters on the performance of such a metal-hydrogen reactor are its design and configuration. In this case, there are a number of problems that need to be considered in designing a reactor. Among these parameters are the reactor configuration, the thermal and the mechanical strength, the kinetics of hydrogen storage and the security. Our study is concentrated on the problem of the thermal and the mechanical strength while focusing on the nature of the metal makes the reactor. In this work, the experimental studies of the hydrogen absorption phenomenon in different reactors, based on metal hydrides, were evaluated. The characteristics of the reaction kinetics in three different reactors using the same measurement conditions were compared. A numerical model describing the reaction kinetic of the H2 absorption by LaNi5 alloy validates the results were obtained.

The output QCM-D characteristics consist of the resonance frequency (MHz frequency range) and resonance bandwidth measured with extra-ordinary precision of a few tenths of Hz. Depending on the electrodes stiffness/softness, QCM-D operates either as a gravimetric or complex mechanical probe of their intrinsic structure. For at least 20 years, QCM-D has been successfully used in biochemical and environmental science and technology for its ability to probe the structure of soft solvated interfaces.Practical battery and supercapacitor electrodes appear frequently as porous solids with their stiffness changing due to interactions with electrolyte solutions or as a result of ion intercalation/adsorption and long-term electrode cycling.Unfortunately, most QCM measurements with electrochemical systems are carried out based on a single (fundamental) frequency and, as such, provided that the resonance bandwidth remains constant, are suitable for only gravimetric sensing. The multiharmonic measurements have been carried out mainly on conducting/redox polymer films rather than on typical composite battery/supercapacitor electrodes.Here, we summarize the most recent publications devoted to the development of electrochemical QCM-D (EQCM-D)-based methodology for systematic characterization of mechanical properties of operating battery/supercapacitor electrodes. By varying the electrodes' composition and structure (thin/thick layers, small/large particles, binders with different mechanical properties, etc.), nature of the electrolyte solutions and charging/cycling conditions, the method is shown to be operated in different application modes. A variety of useful electrode-material properties are assessed noninvasively, in situ, and in real time frames of ion intercalation into the electrodes of interest.A detailed algorithm for the mechanical characterization of battery electrodes kept in the gas phase and immersed into the electrolyte solutions has been developed for fast recognition of stiff and viscoelastic materials in terms of EQCM-D signatures treated by the hydrodynamic and viscoelastic models. Working examples of the use of in situ hydrodynamic spectroscopy to characterize stiff rough/porous solids of complex geometry and viscoelastic characterization of soft electrodes are presented. The most demonstrative example relates to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase on Li4Ti5O12 electrodes in the presence of different electrolyte solutions and additives: only a few cycles (an experiment during ∼30 min) were required for screening the electrolyte systems for their ability to form high-quality surface films in experimental EQCM-D cells as compared to 100 cycles (200 h cycling) in conventional coin cells. Thin/small-mass electrodes required for the EQCM-D analysis enable accelerated cycling tests for ultrafast mechanical characterization of these electrodes in different electrolyte solutions. Hence, this methodology can be easily implemented as a highly effective in situ analytical tool in the field of energy storage and conversion. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041328889

It is believed that climate change could be mitigated by means of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CO2 physical adsorption separation has the potential of capture carbon dioxide with minimum energy costs. A special type of metal organic frameworks named Mg-MOF-74 is an exceptional adsorbent amongst other porous materials with high CO2 uptake at flue gas conditions. Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) composed of 4 steps (feed, rinse, heating, and cooling), for separating CO2 from CO2/N2 mixture using Mg-MOF-74; has been mathematically modeled. A computer model implementation was developed employing User-Defined-Functions linked to Ansys-Fluent software. The CFD two- and three-dimensional models have been validated against adsorption breakthrough experimental data obtained by the authors, at ambient temperature, and against published experimental data for high temperature conditions. The regeneration (heating and cooling) time has been tuned to explore the performance improvement for the TSA process. The TSA optimal key performance indices in terms of CO2 purity, recovery, productivity, and process power consumption have been found to be 96.22%, 86.5%, 0.279 kg of CO2 per hour per kg of Mg-MOF-74, and 663.8 kWh per ton of CO2 captured, respectively.

While a free BeO monolayer is dielectric, the BeO/Mo(112) system is definitely metallic as follows from the bands crossing E F and significant density of states at E F . The honeycomb BeO monolayer is bound to the Mo(112) surface through O atoms situated atop Mo atoms of the surface rows. A substantial rigidity of the BeO monolayer leads to the appearance of empty space above the Mo(112) surface furrows, which may be filled by some gas or water molecules.

Since high Renewable Energy Resources (RES) penetration is assumed, the expected deviations due to their intermittency are accounted for by the reserve provision by the FC system, in order to deviate as little as possible from the scheduled energy demand injected by the upstream grid. All these are incorporated into the operating cost of the microgrid assuming penalization of unscheduled power injections from the grid. The intermittency of RES and load are incorporated in the model by assuming known probability density functions for the forecasting errors. Then, energy and reserve scheduling is performed utilizing the Harmony Search algorithm in order to minimize the expected operating costs of the examined system by optimal reserve and energy provision from the stored/generated hydrogen. For that purpose, hourly optimizations are performed for a given year to assess the value on-site hydrogen generation and FC technologies add to microgrid operation and Distributed Generation (DG) in general. The purpose is to prove the use of hydrogen storage systems in effective uncertainty balancing. The hydrogen storage system appears to effectively counter the intermittency of renewables in moderate penetration, reducing the uncertainty costs. In higher renewable penetrations, due to uncertainty being already accounted for by the storage, the benefits of the RES penetration are even greater. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Distributed energy resources; Electrolyzer; Fuel cell; Renewable energy sources; Smart microgrid; Storage management","Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Operating costs; Probability density function; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Storage management; Distributed Energy Resources; Electrolyzers; Harmony search algorithms; Hydrogen storage system; Renewable energy resource (RES); Renewable energy source; Smart Micro Grids; Smart microgrid operations; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023647584

The surface temperature of macadamia nuts was controlled between 60 and 80 °C using a thermal radiation detector. For drying without the surface temperature control, drying temperatures in the range of 40–60 °C and microwave power were controlled in the range of 1.6–4.4 Wg−1. We found that increase in microwave power and temperature had a positive effect with shorter drying time and increased drying rate. Microwave assisted hot air drying by surface temperature control led to a better quality product in respect of kernel brightness and suitable aw for storage, but a harder kernel. In addition, drying without surface temperature control had the highest energy efficiency followed by surface temperature control and hot air only.

As such bulk milk coolers (BMC) are used for cooling and storage of milk on dairy farms. This paper presents performance monitoring of a direct expansion bulk milk cooler to establish its baseline energy consumption without milk pre-cooling through mathematical modelling. A data acquisition system comprising a power meter, a data logger, temperature sensors and relative humidity and ambient temperature sensors was constructed to capture the energy consumption of the BMC, room temperature and ambient conditions. On-farm milk records were used to determine milk production per milking session. Two milking times were considered, that is for the morning and the late afternoon periods. The average daily electrical energy consumption of the BMC for the two milking times was 48.31 kWh and 43.23 kWh, respectively. Mathematical models represented as multiple linear regression models were built and developed using the experimental data. The developed mathematical models gave good agreement with the experimental results as evidenced by correlation coefficients of 0.922 and 0.8995.

Two coupled mathematical models have been developed. One of them describes the thermal behaviour of the Hybrid Solar Collector (HSC) and the second one describes the simultaneous operation of the HSC and of a fully mixed water storage tank. The dependence of the performance of the HSC system on the following three parameters has been studied: (1) water and air mass flow rate; (2) water pipe diameter and air channel height; (3) water storage tank volume. The mathematical models were used to evaluate the HSC system performance during 29 different days, covering all four seasons. A higher water flow rate generally enhances the thermal efficiency of the HSC system, but the enhancement became significantly smaller at higher air flow rates. Positive but small values are recommended for the difference between the fluid temperature at solar collectors exit and the water temperature in the tank. The thermal efficiency of the HSC system is higher on nearly clear sky and decreases in case the amount of clouds on the sky increases. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","air heater; Hybrid solar collector; modelling; thermal efficiency; water heater","Flow of water; Models; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Tanks (containers); Water heaters; Water pipelines; Air heater; Air mass flow rate; Fluid temperatures; Hybrid solar collectors; Simultaneous operation; Solar energy collectors; Thermal efficiency; Water storage tanks; Collector efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020203315

The ability to compute, process, and retain information in parallel, without referencing other circuit elements, offers enhanced speed, storage density, energy efficiency, and functionality benefits. A novel crossbar microwire-based device consisting of Nb/NbO/Pt structure that exhibits neural synapse-like adaptive conductivity (i.e., synaptic plasticity) is presented. The neuromorphic memristive junction, formed at the interface between the Pt metal wire and the thermally annealed core-shell Nb–NbO wire, demonstrates 1000 times conductivity change with an effective continuum of resistance levels. The device can also be fully activated to display standard resistance switching between two states. In the subthreshold regime, the voltage flux applied through the ~400 nm thick NbO junction is shown to have a linear relationship to the charge produced within the device.

Especially for ion diffusion - one of the main processes found in electrochemical energy storage materials - crystallography can describe and evaluate the elementary steps for the hopping of mobile species from one crystallographic site to another. By translating this knowledge into parameters and search for similar numbers in other materials, promising compounds for future energy storage materials can be identified. Large crystal structure databases like the ICSD, CSD, and PCD have accumulated millions of measured crystal structures and thus represent valuable sources for future data mining and big-data approaches. In this work we want to present, on the one hand, crystallographic approaches based on geometric and crystal-chemical descriptors that can be easily applied to very large databases. On the other hand, we want to show methodologies based on ab initio and electronic modelling which can simulate the structure features more realistically, incorporating also dynamic processes.

Sunlight is the stimulus for green plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into a simple sugar. The sugar is then used as an energy source for other processes in the plant and as a building block for structural (fibrous) carbohydrates and nonstructural (energy storage) carbohydrates and lipids. Slight variations in sugar structures determine how they are arranged in polysaccharides, mainly starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose. Most of the structural carbohydrates, cellulose and hemicellulose, are deposited in plant cell walls in increasing amounts as plants mature.

A supercapacitor can regulate the fluctuations on the electrical grid on short time scales. Their mass-implementation requires the use of abundant materials, biological and organic synthetic materials are attractive because of atomic element abundancy and low-temperature synthetic processes. Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) coming from the forest industry is exploited as a three-dimensional template to control the transport of ions in an electrolyte-separator, with nanochannels filled of aqueous electrolyte. The nanochannels are defined by voids in the nanocomposite made of NFC and the proton transporting polymer polystyrene sulfonic acid PSSH. The ionic conductivity of NFC-PSSH composites (0.2 S cm–1 at 100% relative humidity) exceeds sea water in a material that is solid, feel dry to the finger, but filled of nanodomains of water. A paper-based supercapacitor made of NFC-PSSH electrolyte-separator sandwiched between two paper-based electrodes is demonstrated. Although modest specific capacitance (81.3 F g–1), power density (2040 W kg–1) and energy density (1016 Wh kg–1), this is the first conceptual demonstration of a supercapacitor based on cellulose in each part of the device; which motivates the search for using paper manufacturing as mass-production of energy-storage devices. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These anodes also play a crucial role in enhancing the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is one of the major bottlenecks in the conversion and storage of clean and sustainable energy using electrolyzers. Therefore, the prediction, development and test of active, cost-effective, and stable OER materials is one of the central challenges of modern electrocatalysis and electrochemical engineering. In this framework, this article will discuss some of the computational tools that can be used to understand the activity of existing OER catalysts and also provide guidelines for the rational design of new OER materials. We will also present some of the most active catalysts for the OER in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. We will show the tremendous effect that the catalysts’ crystal structure and the electrolyte’s pH have on the catalytic activity. In this regard, theoretically and experimentally understanding the catalyst-electrolyte synergy at the interface is challenging, but it can allow one to carefully select the optimal operating conditions (e.g., catalyst’s crystal structure, cations, anions, pH) to design efficient electrolyzers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hydropower, which is a renewable energy source, has been one of the main energy resources used to meet this demand growth. In West Africa, there exists a large potential for the harnessing of hydropower. Hydropower is able to provide cheap and continuous access to power supply, which helps to alleviate poverty in most West African countries since economic development is tied to the availability of energy supply. This chapter has reviewed the existing potentials of hydropower in West Africa, while looking closely at the potential viabilities of hydropower compared to the other renewable sources such as wind and solar. The chapter shows that the economics of hydropower generation is more feasible as compared to the other renewables. The flexibility and the storage capacity of hydroelectric power plants make them more efficient and economical in supporting the use of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar energy or wind energy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Through these coordinated actions, living organisms acquire energy and biosynthetic precursors to maintain cellular homeostasis and function. Metabolism relies on the breaking down of macromolecules to produce energy [catabolism] and/or intermediary metabolites that are then used to construct essential building blocks for macromolecule production [anabolism]. Overall, these metabolic processes are controlled by cellular energy status: when the energy released from catabolic processes exceeds the cellular demands the storage of metabolites in the form of lipids and glycogen takes place. These phenomena have been vastly associated with the genesis of metabolic disorders, such as obesity. In recent years, we have assisted to a rediscovery of metabolism through the identification of metabolic intermediaries that act as key players on differentiation, proliferation, and function of immune cells. This recent acknowledgement of the impact of metabolism in the overall immune response originated the ground-breaking field of immunometabolism. Here, we will provide a holistic view of metabolism highlighting the biochemical principles underlying its regulation.","Biosynthetic precursors; Energy; Homeostasis; Immunometabolism; Metabolic networks; Metabolic nodes; Regulation","glycogen; cell differentiation; homeostasis; human; lipid metabolism; metabolic disorder; metabolism; obesity; Cell Differentiation; Glycogen; Homeostasis; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066878701

Solar energy which is free and abundant in most parts of the world has proven to be an economical source of energy in many applications. Among the renewable energy technologies, the solar energy coupling with fuel cell technology will be the promising possibilities for the future green energy solutions. The new efficient photovoltaic array (PVA) has emerged as an alternative measure of renewable green power, energy conservation and demand-side management. However in photovoltaic power generation system the control problems arise due to large variances of output under different insulation. This problem can be overcome by hybrid photovoltaic generation system i.e. use of photovoltaic arrays with fuel cells and power storage such as battery bank.

There is a range of applications going from additives in polymers, nanocomposites, and lithium-batteries to hydrogen storage. The use of CNTs expands the limits of electronic, energy, and engineering, among other fields of science and technology. The manufacturing of products containing CNTs is now a reality that began with their discovery in 1991. Since then, multiple techniques for their mass production have been explored in order to maximize their potential applications. This chapter focuses on different aspects related to CNTs. It starts by presenting the description and features of CNTs. Then, it explains diverse routes to produce CNTs, the techniques for their characterization and, finally, their applications in rubbers. Concerning the synthesis of CNTs, diverse processes are detailed, such as arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in its three variants: CVD itself, floating catalyst CVD, and fluidized bed CVD. The choice of the best route depends on diverse factors such as the type of CNTs (single- or multiwalled), their quality, length and diameter, and type of substrate used, among others. The main characterization techniques used for the morphological and structural analysis of CNTs are explained.

MnFe2O4 is used as catalyst, as adsorbent for removing heavy metals in water, as ferrofluids, in biomedicine, in energy storage devices and others. Solution combustion synthesis was used for the preparation of nanosized MnFe2O4 with a mixture of two fuels – glycine and glycerol (0.75:0.25 reducing power ratio). The resulting material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As-prepared sample is single phase spinel with unit cell parameter 8.470 Å. After a thermal treatment in argon flow at 40 °C for 2 hours, the unit cell parameter increases to 8.488 Å. Additional thermal treatment at 400 °C in air resulted in a new diffraction pattern, indicative for structural transformation. Indexing the entire set of diffraction lines gave a solution with a good reliability factor within a rhombohedral space group (unit cell parameters a = 6 Å and c = 28.6 Å). Possible space groups were R3, R3m and R–3m. Preliminary structural data for the new phase are presented. The new structure is closely related to that of the spinel. It was found that the oxygen layer packing sequence remained unchanged, but the displacement of the oxygen positions resulted in lowering of the cubic symmetry to hexagonal. The arrangement of the cation positions also remains close to that of the spinel, alternating the Oh3 layers and T2O layers. The cation to anion ratio of the new phase is considered to be close to that of γ-Fe2O3 and is cation deficient. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.","MnFe2O4; Oxidation; Rhombohedral spinel-like phase",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060063676

In the first part, the emphasis is put mainly on the two main lines of research: experimental and numerical. In the second part, the main trends of research in this sector have been followed. An anatomical operation of more than 100 documents (published between 2006 and 2016), on the behavior of storage systems integrating Phase Change Materials (PCM), covering a large number of configurations treatment and their applications in thermal comfort of buildings area, has shown that the information published in this topic are very diverse and enormous, but in many cases are insufficient. The results show that, with suitable design, the PCM can contribute to the reduction of costs and achieve energy reductions in buildings, guaranteeing a comfortable interior environment. The evaluation of this multitude of documents gave the following remark: The effectiveness of any proposed approach to a numerical study is a concept with ambiguities, depending upon the method used, its precision, the problem to be modeled, the convergence criteria and the input parameters choice.

However, agricultural residues could be utilized as solid fuel by transforming them into biomass pellets, which would increase their bulk density. Furthermore, technology such as the torrefaction process could be applied in order to enhance the heating values of the biomass pellets. The effects of the torrefaction temperature and residence time (RT)on the moisture content (MC), density, volatile matter (VM), ash, fixed carbon (FC), heating value, mass yield (MY), and energy yield (EY) of selected agricultural residues, comprising corncobs/ cornhusks, rice straw, and sugarcane trash, after pelletization were studied. The MC of all the torrefied pellets was lower than 2%wt (wet basis), while the ash, FC, and heating value tended to increase with the increase of the temperature and RT for all types of residues. The density, VM, MY, and EY tended to decrease, probably because of the exothermic reaction occurrence, resulting in hemicellulose decomposition into a char-like solid product and volatiles, which oxygenated and hydrogenated the compounds. In conclusion, pelletization before torrefaction could be considered as the most appropriate approach for further development because a low temperature and short processing time are required, there is a reduced area for storage after production, and the quality of the product is high. © 2006 Institute of Research and Development, Suranaree University of Technology.","Biomass; Corncobs; Cornhusks; Pellets; Rice straw; Sugarcane trash; Torrefaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059642432

There has been developed a functional product, designed to help prevent the development of pathologies that are of production and alimentary origin among the workers of the mining industry, whose work is characterized by constant physical and mental strain, increased blood pressure, reduced aerobic fitness and physical performance of the body. The determination of the pasta formulation was carried out by experimental determination of proportions of possible contents of chicken meat and pumpkin seeds suspension using standard technological equipment and generators for ultrasonic intensification of technological processes. To establish the physicochemical parameters of the obtained product there were used the following methods: establishing the strength of pasta with the Stroganov device, the titrimetric method for the determination of protein content according to Kjeldahl method, the method of ion exchange chromatography for the determination of amino acid composition. It has been experimentally established that the proportion of the suspension of chicken meat and pumpkin seeds in the manufacture of pasta products while maintaining the required consumer indicators can make up to 35%. The resulting research product per 100 g of the mass contains: 18 g of protein, vitamins B, A, E, minerals (iron, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phospho-rus). Ultrasound dispersion provides a sealing effect that reduces porosity and water absorption. High temperature drying with ultrasound irradiation saves time, energy, increases strength, eliminates the increase of acidity, and microbial spoilage. There has been established the possibility of expansion of a functional products range at the expense of combinatorics of enriching additives from chicken meat and pumpkin seeds in the recipe of pasta. The use of ultrasound provides an increased amount of nutrients while maintaining the indicators that provide the opportunity for a long-term storage. The cost of production is competitive for the domestic market of Ukraine, which allows to count on the possibility that the mining industry will buy them for the centralised feeding of the workers. © 2018, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

Moreover, to support a long system lifetime and batteryless WSN nodes, a combination of harvested renewable energy and two layer-based energy storages (e.g., capacitors), working on a hysteresis comparator with two different thresholds, is integrated into a WSN node. However, this approach suffers from a penalty shutdown issue due to quickly decreasing voltage in the primary storage (PS) that directly powers the WSN node. This issue leads to the shutdown of a sensor node in a quite long period, even if there is still sufficient energy in the secondary storage (SS) that is responsible for charging the PS when the renewable sources are absent. In this paper, we propose two solutions to mitigate the penalty shutdown issue in a WSN node.

Usually with such technologies, the implementation of large-scale regulation services confronts high interruption cost, uncertainties in availability, and batteries&#x2019; degradation cost. This motivates us to explore an alternative solution by participating energy hubs with energy conversion technologies to adjust the conversion of natural gas into electricity if the electric grid calls for demand shaping and regulation services. To exploit the potential of energy hubs, we propose an auction for their participation in regulation services. The energy hubs&#x2019; interaction in the auction is modeled as a non-cooperative game with coupling constraints. To study the existence and uniqueness of the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) for such a game, we show that it admits a best response potential function, whose global minimum corresponds to the GNE. We also design a distributed algorithm to achieve that equilibrium. Simulations are performed to illustrate the convergence properties and scalability of the proposed algorithm. Results show that if a participant becomes an energy hub, its profit increases by 60% on average. The electric system operator also benefits from 31% payment reduction to the participants.

The authors suggest that extremophiles may be easily subjected to a long-term continuous cultivation processes, which considerably enhances overall productivity while reducing the energy demand in biopolymer production. Conversely, a range of challenges remain, including improving the metabolic capability of extremophiles, recycling of fermentation broth, various process engineering aspects, and adaptation of bioreactor materials and process controlling devices to conditions shortening their life span. Following this, the enzymes, regulators and genes involved in PHA biosynthesis are analyzed for their potential as an alternative to synthetic polymers. They are synthesized as intracellular carbon and energy storage compounds from over 300 species in the presence of excess carbon and under oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus limitation, or after pH shifts. This collection goes on to suggest PHA as a promising alternative for petrochemical compounds. The challenges of increasing economic feasibility in the global market, minimizing costs, and improving the polymer yield are reviewed. Additionally, recent research on structural variations of PHAs has been centered on the design, biosynthesis, and properties of biodegradable and biocompatible materials, which can be used for bioengineering. This collection also includes a focus on the roles of polyhydroxyesters and PHAs in the construction of tissue engineering scaffolds, which are used in bone, cartilage, ligament, skin, vascular tissues, neural tissues and skeletal muscles. Their exceptional properties, such as high surface-to-volume ratio, high porosity with very small pore size, and biodegradation have made them gain a lot of attention in this field. The biomedical applications of PHAs are explored, including in-vivo implants, tissue engineering, anticancer agents, drug delivery, biocontrol agents and memory enhancers, as their low acidity allows for minimal risk in usage. In order to enhance its applicability in various fields, the blends and nanocomposites of PHAs are studied and their potential challenges, applications and opportunities are addressed. After which, the industrial and agricultural applications are described, with specific focus on potential applications of PHAs in packaging. Other applications include moulded goods, paper coatings, non-woven fabrics, adhesives, films and performance additives. Recent advances in this area, by means of peer-reviewed literature and patents, are introduced and discussed.

Solid-state hydrogen storage as hydride compounds provides a prominent method regarding efficiency and safety. Transition complex hydrides such as Mg2CoH5 and Mg2FeH6 are attractive materials because of their high hydrogen storage density. Synthesis of these complex hydrides is not simple because of the lack of stable Mg2Fe and Mg2Co intermetallics. For this reason, a deeper knowledge of Mg-Co-H and Mg-Fe-H systems has been gained even before the synthesis of the pure hydride phases. Here, we discuss in detail major progress in synthesizing homoleptic Mg2CoH5 and Mg2FeH6 complex hydrides, the thermodynamic stability and kinetic properties of Mg-Co-H and Mg-Fe-H systems, and further advances in tuning them. Finally, main features in their practical applications as a hydrogen energy storage medium and future trends are highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The magnetic properties of Co-ferrites are due to the cation distribution among octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Such distribution can be controlled by the preparation method which in its turn depends on the particle size and morphology. Among different synthesis techniques, microwave induced combustion method is rapid and convenient. Methods: Co-Ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized through a reaction of a mixture of stoichiometric of Co-nitrate hexahydrate, Fe-nitrate nonahydrate, and urea. Different urea to metal nitrates ratio have been used. The mixture is dissolved in an appropriate amount of doubly distilled water then transferred to a commercial microwave oven operating at 800 W for 20 minutes. Results: Sample synthesized at low urea/metal nitrate ratio (1:1) shows undesirable mixed phases namely Co3 O4, Fe2 O3 together with CoFe2 O4. With increasing urea ratio, the detected diffraction peaks are well indexed to CoFe2 O4 phase and all other secondary phases are disappeared. It was found that the crystallite size increases with increasing the urea/metal nitrates ratio. The high resolution transmission electron microscope provides a further confirmation for the formation pure Co-ferrite phase. Additionally the magnetic properties such as saturation magnetization and coercivity are measured and found to depend on the urea/metal nitrates ratio. Conclusion: In this study, CoFe2 O4 nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated by microwave assisted combustion method. The effect of urea/metal nitrates ratio on the structure and magnetic properties is studied. The XRD results showed that a single CoFe2 O4 phase can be obtained at urea/metal nitrates ratio ≥ 2. The crystallite size was estimated to be in the range 10.33-23.29 nm. The studied system shows a high saturation magnetization of about 65 emu/g for the 13.13 nm sized particles. The critical size was found to be about 13 nm with the highest coercivity of about 1200 Oe. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cobalt ferrite; Combustion method; Magnetic properties; Metal oxides; Microwave-combustion method; Nanoparticles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057295303

Slow magnetic relaxation in a mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complex was first reported in 2003. The fact that these compounds present the highest relaxation energy barriers for the reversal of the magnetization and blocking temperatures up to date makes them the most studied family of SIMs. Their unquenched orbital moment and strong spin-orbit coupling promote anisotropic magnetic properties in a ligand field, allowing the occurrence of slow relaxation of the magnetization. In this chapter, a brief state of the art concerning this class of molecular magnets will be presented, followed by the reasons that led to the switch of strategy from large spins to large anisotropies that accompanied the arising of SIMs as the second generation of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). This advent arrived with the introduction of f elements, mainly lanthanides, associated with the notion of mononuclearity. Additionally, the electronic configuration of some Ln3+ ions offers advantages due to their very well-defined emission wavelengths that cover a large spectroscopic range. When linked to selected organic ligands, they can be useful in practical applications as bifunctional magnetic luminescent materials. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

If a content is cached as a chunk-based content, the requester has to download all the chunks of this content, thus, he may encounter a case wherein the consumed energy for obtaining this chunk-based content exceed the one for obtaining the same content as single-based content, if any. As the dissemination of a content as a single-based content can considerably impact the helper energy expenditure, the chunk-based caching may incurs additional energy burden owing to the limited battery capacity. So, in order to optimally trade-off between energy consumption and transmission delay, we propose a hybrid strategy wherein each content is cached simultaneously as single-based strategy and chunk-based strategy. We show through simulations that the proposed strategy outperforms these two strategies and achieves the trade-off. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Caching; Chunk-based; D2D; Energy","Energy utilization; Ubiquitous computing; Caching; Chunk-based; Device to device (D2D); Distributed caching; Distributed storage; Energy; Energy expenditure; Transmission delays; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056896398

It promises to offer to users cost-effective and on-demand decentralized services, in terms of computing, memory, storage, etc., without the need for large infrastructure investments. Moreover, with the growing number of data centers resources, much higher levels of energy are being consumed. Also, the increasing level of associated carbon dioxide is emitted in the air, which consequently, raises the costs. Considering that there is an extreme growth in demand for Data Centers cloud computing requiring high computational complexity, there is an utmost need to take sufficient measures to lower the risk of energy demand. Hence, efficient energy-aware techniques are required to assure proper performance with regards to Service Level Agreements (SLA).

It is well known that SCs can phagocyte and degrade apoptotic germ cells (AGC) resulting in increasing lipid content and ATP levels. A relationship between the regulation of lipid storage and of lipid oxidation in SC might be envisaged. The aim of this study was to analyze whether AGC and FA are able to simultaneously regulate molecular mechanisms involved in lipid storage and in FA oxidation in SC. The experimental model utilized in this study consisted in SC cultures obtained from 20-day-old rats that were co-cultured with AGC or treated with palmitic acid (PA, 500 μM) for 24 and 48 h. AGC and PA increase LD, triacylglycerol (TAG) content and mRNA levels of Plin1, Plin2, Plin3 (proteins involved in TAG storage). Simultaneously, AGC and PA rise the extent of FA oxidation and mRNA levels of Cpt1 and Lcad (proteins involved in FA degradation). Results also show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) transcriptional activity, transcription factor which participate in lipid metabolism regulation, increases by AGC and PA treatment in SC. Additionally, the presence of a PPARg antagonist decreases the upregulation of LD content and Plin1 expression. Similarly, the presence of a PPARb/d antagonist reduces the increase in FA oxidation and Cpt1 mRNA levels. Altogether these results suggest that AGC and FA, which probably generate PPAR ligands, regulate lipid storage and fatty acid utilization, contributing to the energy homeostasis in the seminiferous tubules. © 2018 Society for Reproduction and Fertility",,"adipophilin; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; lcad protein; mannose 6 phosphate receptor binding protein 1; messenger RNA; perilipin 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; protein; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adipophilin; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; fat droplet; long chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; mannose 6 phosphate receptor binding protein 1; palmitic acid; perilipin 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; Plin1 protein, rat; Plin2 protein, rat; Plin3 protein, rat; triacylglycerol; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell function; controlled study; DNA content; fatty acid oxidation; flow cytometry; gene control; gene expression; germ cell; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; nonhuman; phase contrast microscopy; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; Sertoli cell; upregulation; animal; cell communication; cell culture; coculture; drug effect; energy metabolism; genetics; male; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; Sertoli cell; signal transduction; spermatozoon; Sprague Dawley rat; Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Long-Chain; Animals; Apoptosis; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; Cell Communication; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Energy Metabolism; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitic Acid; Perilipin-1; Perilipin-2; Perilipin-3; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sertoli Cells; Signal Transduction; Spermatozoa; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056724004

Pumped storage units can enhance their operational flexibility by switching between different operation modes. They have limited capacity for adjustment when operated as generators and are non-adjustable when operated in the pump mode. However, the power ramps generated during the switching of operation modes are valuable for regulating the frequency and increasing the operational flexibility. In order to achieve sufficient performance, it is essential to have a method to determine the optimal switching time for the pumped storage units. However, there is no standard method to obtain the optimal switching time due to the complexities and non-linear characteristics of such a problem. In this paper, an enumeration based model predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed to determine the optimal switching time of a pumped storage unit to enhance its operational flexibility and facilitate frequency regulation. Furthermore, a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated computing method is proposed to solve the problem effectively and to make the MPC controller suitable for practical applications.

The algorithm uses fuzzy rules optimised by a genetic algorithm to control the flow of energy inside the system. The LMP battery is linked to a boost converter to insure the autonomy of the electrical vehicle, while the EDLC is linked to a back boost converter that provides the highly demanded energy in a short time and guarantees the temporarily energy storage when the vehicle is braking (no energy is demanded). The hybrid electrical vehicle is simulated in different driving cycles to analyse the behaviour of the LMP battery and the EDLC.

In SUAV dynamic modeling, we consider the influence of wind on SUAV kinematics. Aiming at the complexity of the long-endurance tracking, namely the long flight time and space spans, the influences of the wind, variations of temperature, air density and solar cell photovoltaic efficiency, and a finite battery capacity are considered in our modified SUAV energy model. Then, considering the mission flexibility, we design two types of energy management strategies that comprehensively utilize the solar energy, gravitational potential energy, and wind to address different situations. The proposed strategies can be divided into several stages in chronological order according to the solar irradiation conditions, electrical energy storage conditions, and relative motion relationships among the SUAV, target, and wind. We then design respective strategies for these stages. The core of our proposed energy management strategies is to design the corresponding objective functions in each stage and the switching conditions between adjacent stages. Finally, we verify our proposed strategies by comparison with the traditional 2D tracking strategy in a 24-hour target tracking mission, and the results show the validity of our proposed strategies.

These nodes are interconnected by lossy links. Therefore, they support low data rates. This leads to an unstable state with relatively low rates of packet delivery. In the beginning 2008, the Internet Engineering team (IETF) working team, named ROLL, investigates to use the existing routing protocol for LLNs, but they found that these protocols were not sufficiently appropriate for LLNs. Due to the important role of the LLNs in the Internet of Things (IoTs), ROLL standardizes a routing solution called IPv6 for LLNs. Therefore, ROLL began to design a new protocol based on IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks named (RPL). It is an IPv6 routing protocol specifically designed for low power and lossy networks (LLN) compliant with the 6LoWPAN protocol. RPL has gained a lot of maturities. It is attracting increasing interest in the research community. RPL is flexible in building the topology. It constructs a topology proactively. Due to the absence of a fully comprehensive review about RPL drive us to introduce this article. Furthermore, this article investigates the most related studies obtained about RPL routing protocol that concern to its implementation, performance, applications evaluation, and improvement. An open research challenges on the RPL design are pointed out. Finally, this survey can support researchers to further understand the RPL and participate to further improve it in the future research works. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","IETF; Internet of things; IPv6; Low power and lossy networks; ROLL; RPL routing protocol","Digital storage; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Network routing; Rolling; Routing protocols; Topology; IETF; Internet of thing (IoTs); IPv6; Low power and lossy network (LLN); Low power and lossy networks; Research challenges; Research communities; Rpl routing protocols; Internet protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054876026

Moreover, the present work is related to the effect of the presence of SO2 in the gas to treat on the CO2 absorption performances for several types of amine solvents (simple and blended solutions of MEA, MMEA, MDEA, AMP and PZ) considering a CO2 content in the flue gas between 20% and 60%. Absorption tests were performed in a laboratory gas-liquid contactor considering both CO2-loaded and unloaded solutions. It was shown that the presence of SO2 in the gas to treat lowers the CO2 absorption performances of the amine based solvents, contrarily to the SO2 absorption performances, staying quite high during the tests and confirming that this component is absorbed selectively relatively to CO2. Regarding the novel aspects deriving from the solvents screening, it was highlighted that PZ 10% leads to both high CO2 and SO2 absorption performances even in considerably CO2 loaded solution, while AMP 30% seems a good candidate to selectively absorb SO2 in the presence of CO2. © Copyright 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cement plants; Cements; Combustion; Flue gases; Flues; Gases; Solvents; Absorption performance; Absorption tests; Amine solvents; CO2 absorption; Gas-liquid contactors; Post-combustion; Regeneration process; Simultaneous absorption; Gas absorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054617102

The product, known as fast pyrolysis liquid (PL), has a higher energy density than solid biomass and is more easily transported and stored. The applications of PLs are limited due to a high water and oxygen content and limited storage stability. As such, upgrading technologies have been developed to broaden the application range of PLs. Catalytic hydrotreatment is such an attractive upgrading technology for PLs and leads to improved product properties like, among others, a higher thermal stability and energy density and, reduced oxygen and water content, etc. Catalytic hydrotreatment is typically carried out at elevated temperatures (250-400°C) and hydrogen pressures (100-200. bar) in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts. This chapter starts with a short overview of fast pyrolysis technology followed by the properties and molecular composition of PLs. The core of the chapter is dedicated to a description of the state of the art regarding the catalytic hydrotreatment of the PLS to improve the product properties and to make the products suitable as a transportation fuel or as a co-feed in existing oil refineries. Various length scales are considered, ranging from molecular aspects to process studies in a dedicated continuous set-up. Catalyst screening studies are provided and will be discussed in detail, both in the presence and absence of external solvents. Proposed molecular transformations are summarised, and their implications on both process and product properties will be discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Activity; Catalyst studies; Catalytic hydrotreatment; Process studies; Pyrolysis technology; Stability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054251373

The processing of mist moisture from the surrounding environment, which passes through the micro wind turbines situated in tubular channels and is being condensed in water tanks, situated inside the core of a skyscraper, becomes an advantage of the technical solution. Furthermore, soft facade envelopes are able to transform the shape of the facade of the skyscraper. The envelopes are hanged over console bars, whereas wind pressure is partially reduced by channels, situated inside the structure of the floor plates of the skyscraper.

At present, the statutory rate designed to be 7%. Despite the sympathetic image of the use of bio-components, it also has important disadvantages with relation to corrosion for underground steel storage tanks (USTs) which are uncoated and therefore vulnerable for corrosion. This paper describes the results from a current study in which historical data of 1,401 USTs were analyzed for average maximum pit depths over the years 2003 till 2016. Furthermore tank sludge and wall samples from two tanks were analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing to identify microorganisms, to test the hypothesis that MIC has played a role in the formation of the pitting corrosion defects in USTs. The results showed that since the addition of biodiesel the average pit depth increased. The microbial data showed that MIC was likely involved in the formation of the pits and that sampling location is extremely relevant for analysis of MIC. The data also revealed that analysis on the most common MIC suspected microorganisms like sulphate reducing bacteria might not be a sufficient target for USTs. © 2018 by NACE International.","Biodiesel; Corrosion; History data; Microbial influenced corrosion (MIC); Molecular microbiological methods (MMM); Underground storage tanks (USTs)","Biodiesel; Corrosion; Digital storage; Fuel storage; Microorganisms; Microwave integrated circuits; Pitting; Steel corrosion; Sulfur compounds; Tanks (containers); Energy and climate policies; History data; Microbial influenced corrosions; Microbiological methods; Next-generation sequencing; Steel storage tank; Sulphate reducing bacteria; Underground storage tanks; Underground corrosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053496772

Along the same line, the realization of a related elemental 2D material, borophene, is another breakthrough. To circumvent the stability issues of borophene, which is reported to have been synthesized on metallic substrates under extreme conditions, hydrogenation of borophene (otherwise called as borophane or hydrogen boride or boron hydride) has been a plausible solution, but only proposed computationally. A recent report (H. Nishino, T. Fujita, N. T. Cuong, S. Tominaka, M. Miyauchi, S. Iimura, A. Hirata, N. Umezawa, S. Okada, E. Nishibori, A. Fujino, T. Fujimori, S. Ito, J. Nakamura, H. Hosono and T. Kondo, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017, 139(39), 13761-13769) brings to fore its experimental realization. Our current study delves into the possibilities of employing this intriguing 2D hydrogen boride as anodes in Li/Na ion batteries. Using first-principles density functional theory methods, we computed relevant properties such as the ion (Li/Na) adsorption behavior, the possible pathways of ionic diffusion with the estimation of barriers as well as the theoretical specific capacities and average voltages to uniquely demonstrate that this material is of particular significance for battery applications. It is noted that the use of hydrogen boride leads to a high specific capacity of 861.78 mA h g-1 for Li ions, which is remarkably higher than the value reported in relation to its computationally predicted structure.

They are synthesized as intracellular carbon and energy storage compounds from over 300 species, mainly bacteria, in the presence of excess carbon and under oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus limitation, or after pH shifts. Although most bacteria accumulate PHAs under stress conditions, there are some of them that do not require nutrient limitation for PHA synthesis such as Alcaligenes latus, or recombinant E. coli. In the first case, PHAs are degraded and used for bacterial growth when a limiting nutrient is provided. Therefore, bacteria that produce PHAs have both biosynthetic and degrading enzymes. For PHAs biosynthesis three pathways have been elucidated so far. In pathway I, 3HB monomers are generated by the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the second pathway (II) the substrates are generated by β-oxidation of fatty acids, while in pathway III monomers are generated from structurally unrelated and simple carbon sources such as glucose, sucrose and fructose. Gene’s organization of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes also differs in PHAs producing bacteria. The key enzyme is PHA synthase and significant effort has been made to generate synthases with enhanced activity and substrate specificity. More than 150 monomers have been reported so far; their composition influences the physical properties and characteristics of the polymer, thus particular notice is given to the carbon source that will be used. Recombinant strains also provide an alternative way to produce PHAs with novel properties from inexpensive raw materials. The plethora of enzymes, regulators as well as their genes involved in PHAs biosynthesis will be discussed in details. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","PHA biosynthesis; PHA gene organization; PHA granules; Phaome; Phasins; Polyhydroxyalkanoates","Biochemistry; Biocompatibility; Biodegradable polymers; Biodegradation; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Fatty acids; Genes; Monomers; Nutrients; Substrates; Gene organization; PHA granules; Phaome; Phasins; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Biosynthesis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052397823

This system is used to supply, in an autonomous manner, continuous power to a load. When solar radiation is available, the PV modules are used to generate electrical energy to supply the needed energy to the load. The excess electrical energy is stored under the form of hydrogen energy by using an electrolysis system. In cases where the energy generated by the PV does not meet adequately the needs of the load, the fuel cell using the produced and stored hydrogen provides the complementary energy. The design and sizing method is based on energy balance equations. Long-term characteristics of the system components are assumed constant. The optimum choice of the system component sizes is based on economic analysis. To this end, HOMER software is used. The method is applied to meet the University of Chlef energy needs.

It is a representative category of structurally diverse intracellular biopolyesters accumulated by many bacteria as carbon and energy storage granules. PHA molecules are typically constituted by numerous (R)-hydroxy-fatty acid monomer units. Each monomer unit bears a side chain R group, which is usually either saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups, branched alkyl groups, and substituted alkyl groups, although these forms are less common. PHAs are homo-, co- and terpolymers, generally classified into short-chain-length PHAs (scl- PHAs) and medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) by the different number of carbons in their repeating units. The main polymer of the PHA family is the homopolymer Polyhydroxybutyrate P(3HB). The number of differences in PHA properties profile depends on the: i) variety of monomers, ii) constitutional isomerism, iii) wide range of molecular weights, and iv) physical and/or chemical modifications of their microstructures. Recent research on structural variations of PHAs has been directed towards the design, biosynthesis, and properties of biodegradable and biocompatible materials, which can be used for bioengineering of new optical and other smart chiral intermediates. Moreover, PHAs are exploited in a series of applications in the packaging and food industry, agriculture, medicine, pharmacy, and also as raw materials for synthetic chemistry, representing an interesting source for smaller molecules or chemicals. Therefore, due to their commercial interests, PHAs are a promising group of materials for future study related to synthetic mechanisms, monomer diversity, physiological roles, and controllable production. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Biopolyesters; Biopolymers; Chemical structure; Polyhydroxyalkanoates","Biochemistry; Biocompatibility; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Biosynthesis; Chain length; Chemical contamination; Chemical modification; Fatty acids; Medicine; Molecules; Monomers; Packaging materials; Structure (composition); Bio-polyesters; Chiral intermediates; Constitutional isomerism; Physiological roles; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Short chain lengths; Structural variations; Stereochemistry",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052390181

The first one is an ICS solar water heater based on symmetric CPC reflectors (ICS_SCPC), and the second one is an ICS solar water heater based on asymmetric reflectors (ICS_ACPC). ICS_ACPC is a new model which is designed to improve the optical performances of an existing system by increasing the quantity of absorbed energy. ICS_AFCPC consists of an integrated collector storage (ICS) solar water heater combined with an asymmetric compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) with two concentrating stages. The upper part contains two symmetrical parabolic sections with focal axes tilted at ±48° from the vertical plane. The lower part is constituted of three involute reflectors. Its cylindrical storage tank covers the triangle formed by the three involute part centers, and its geometric concentration is about 1:34. This design has a strong connection with a previous study, where an ICS system was designed and tested (Helal et al. 2011a). In this study, the ICS solar water heater based on symmetric CPC reflectors (ICS_SCPC) was modeled, realized, and experimentally tested. It consisted also of two concentrator stages: the first one, which was common to both systems, and the second one was a parabolic reflector placed in the exit aperture of the first stage. In both systems, the absorber of cylindrical design has a total stored water volume Vab = 100 l. A ray-tracing model was developed via a code written on Matlab to simulate the reflection of the solar radiation on the CPC reflectors at different angles of incidence and compute the absorbed solar radiation distribution on the absorber surface. The obtained results, when compared with the experimented model, showed a significant improvement in optical efficiency and the distribution of the absorbed energy regarding the angle of incidence. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","CPC reflectors; Integrated solar collector; Ray trace analysis","Concentration (process); MATLAB; Ray tracing; Reflection; Solar collectors; Solar water heaters; Trace analysis; Water heaters; Absorbed solar radiations; Angles of incidence; Comparative studies; Compound parabolic concentrator; Cylindrical storage tank; Integrated collector storage; Integrated solar collectors; Optical performance; Incident solar radiation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052376840

The two liquids are immiscible and chemically unreactive or slowly reactive. An emulsion is a thermodynamically unstable dispersed system. Instability is a result of the system’s tendency to reduce its free energy by separating the dispersed droplets into two liquid phases. Instability of an emulsion during storage is evinced by creaming, flocculation (reversible aggregation), and/or coalescence (irreversible aggregation). One major drawback of standard o/w emulsions as drug carriers is limited drug loading capacity and that they are suitable only for oil-soluble compounds. When drug encapsulation above 1% is required, a correspondingly larger oil phase (10 to 20%) is required to dissolve the compound. However, high oil content reduces emulsion stability, and the addition of a synthetic surfactant is necessary. Liposomes are stable lipoidal vehicles prepared in the absence of synthetic ionic or nonionic surfactants. In liposomes, drugs can be either encapsulated in the enclosed aqueous space or intercalated into the lipid bilayer. They are the optimal carrier for trapping water-soluble materials in their internal aqueous compartments. However, due to their relatively low content of lipid molecules, the loading capacity of liposomes for lipophilic compounds is low and limited to the phospholipid bilayer domain. This work was aimed to develop a carrier system which could provide high drug-trapping efficiencies mainly for hydrophobic compounds but in the absence of toxic surfactants. Our approach was to design a new lipid particle comprising an internal lipophilic core as in o/w emulsions surrounded not by a monolayer of phospholipids but by phospholipid bilayers as in liposomes, thus stabilizing the particles. We succeeded in developing this novel drug delivery technology and assigned the term “EmulsomeTM” to the new type of lipid assembly since they can be considered as intermediate particles or “hybrid” systems between o/w emulsions and liposomes. 1 Although the Emulsome technology was developed mainly as a drug delivery system,2 Emulsome particles can be very useful for nonmedical applications in agriculture and in cosmetic and food industries in areas where stable submicron fat particles are needed. © 1996 by CRC Press, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052167509

The curvature presented in the conical section of CNC materials affects the Pt binding stability. The role of Pt atoms as an active catalyst for H2 adsorption and dissociation has been investigated in perfect Pt-4CNC and defect Pt-v4CNC systems. Then, the spillover mechanism of dissociated hydrogen atoms in Pt-v4CNC is explored via two reaction steps: (i) H-migration from Pt to carbon atoms and (ii) H-diffusion via the C-C route throughout the CNC surface. Our results show that the presence of the hydrogen atom on the Pt catalyst can efficiently induce the H-diffusion process through the C-C surface, and the Pt-H bond significantly facilitates the H-migration from C-H bonds near to the active Pt catalyst to the adjacent carbon atom with an energy barrier &lt;0.5 eV under ambient conditions. Altogether, the theoretical results support the concept of the spillover mechanism as a key process for enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity of metal-decorated CNCs. These results improve our understanding about the hydrogen spillover mechanism and the catalytic reactions which are very important for the development of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials. © 2018 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052148565

Electricity storage is key to managing any excess electricity production and avoiding negative prices. However, this development takes place in a liberalized energy market, where network operators must act independently from production and supply. Establishing the purpose of electricity storage and where storage can or should be placed is crucial. The authors present the reasons for and the types of electricity storage available; analyse the EU legal framework ; identify potential obstacles; and present pros and cons for positioning storage in the electricity system.

In order to decarbonise the energy sector as well as the transportation sector, the fossil fuels need to be efficiently converted to hydrogen and the resulted CO2 to be captured and then used / stored. The Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) technologies are promising options of efficiently combating climate change (by significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions) as well as continuing of using the fossil fuels. This paper is assessing the key updated technical and economical performances of hydrogen production based on natural gas reforming with and without carbon capture. As illustrative examples, conventional steam reforming and autothermal reforming (using both oxygen and air) of natural gas were evaluated. The CO2 capture technology was based on pre-combustion capture configuration using gas-liquid absorption. As illustrative cases, Methyl-DiEthanol-Amine (MDEA) as a chemical solvent and Selexol™ as a physical solvent were assessed for their performances. The evaluated hydrogen production concepts have a capacity of 100,000 Nm3/h (corresponding to 300 MWth based on lower heating value) with a purity higher than 99.95 % (vol.). The paper presents in details the evaluated hydrogen production concepts based on natural gas reforming, modelling and simulation aspects, model validation, mass and energy integration issues as well as proposing an integrated methodology for quantification of key economic aspects. As the results show, the conventional steam reforming has higher energy utilisation factor (about 5 net percentage points) than the autothermal reforming cases. The carbon capture rate is about 65 - 70 % for the conventional steam reforming considered as an illustrative case. The economic indicators show better performances for conventional steam reforming in comparison to autothermal reforming in term of specific capital investment cost (about 12 - 24 % lower), operational and maintenance costs (about 7 % lower), hydrogen costs (about 5 - 10 % lower). Physical absorption is more energy and cost effective than chemical absorption as pre-combustion capture method.

Power-Tomethane - storing excess energy via chemical conversion as methane - is one of the most interesting technologies to reach this goal, as it bundles the advantages of large storage capacities, fast response time and use of existing infrastructure. First commercial plants have been realised, but alternative concepts are still heavily researched and in demonstration stage. As most are using complex process setups or achieving low methane product concentrations, process optimisation and simplification is needed, but information on this topic is scarce. To close this gap, a power-To-methane process consisting of catalytic methanation and membrane gas upgrading using biogas as carbon dioxide source was simulated in ASPEN Plus®. Four different process setups were modelled to assess influences of fermentation setup, recycling of membrane off-gas and multistage membrane gas separation as well as pressure and GHSV. Models were parameterised with experimental results obtained from a demonstration plant. It was shown that a process without off-gas recycling requires less energy but leads to hydrogen losses of up to 25 %. Preventing this loss by recycling the off-gas leads to an increase of specific energy demand for hydrogen storage by 17 % and relative membrane area by 11 % for the base case.

These furnaces are designed to use natural gas as fuel, but in most cases they use a mixture of waste gases known as refinery gases (RG), which molar composition varies depending on the process in which they are generated, in most cases with high content of propane, hydrogen, propylene, among others. This is done in most cases to save energy and reduce storage cost. However, this variation in molar composition also produces a change in calorific power that can be as high as 1,200 Btu/ft3, producing alterations in the combustion process, affecting efficiency and increasing pollutant emissions. In this work, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique is used to simulate the combustion process in a representative segment of a typical refinery furnace using RG as fuel with 3 different molar compositions. Comparative CFD 3D simulation cases are performed to study the effect of molar composition variability in the temperature and chemical species profiles inside the furnace. The obtained results show that high contents of gases like propane, propylene or hydrogen increase the calorific power and peak temperature inside the furnace, but temperature profile distribution is less uniform. The chemical species profiles inside the furnace show that there is an increase in CO when using mixture gases with low CH4 content, which indicates that a more detailed study regarding air excess and flow is needed. The results are very important because they can be used as a tool for decision-making regarding the convenience to use or not refinery waste gases as fuels in furnaces and to stablish a starting point for a detailed study about the improvement of furnaces operation and process safety.

Co-firing biomass with coal is an attractive alternative because it is an immediate and practical way to reduce coal usage and harmful emissions, requiring only minor modifications to the power plant. A multi-objective mixed integer non-linear programming model for a biomass co-firing network integrating biomass property considerations with investment, transportation and production planning is formulated and validated. A balance between the two conflicting objectives is achieved using a goal programming approach. Computational experiments reveal that biomass and coal blend ratios should be managed carefully to reach acceptable fuel properties. When improperly managed, it can negatively impact conversion yield and equipment life. Furthermore, less efficiency loss despite unsuitable feedstock properties encourage the model to use more biomass to replace coal because it will not negatively impact costs and would decrease pollutant emissions. Analysis also shows that pre-treatment facilities are prioritized depending on the effectiveness in improving properties that the biomass input violate the most based on power plant system requirements. Biomass seasonality as it impacts availability and quality are accounted for in purchase and storage planning, where purchases are done during periods when availability and quality is better, when low availability and quality are foreseen in succeeding periods, and the biomass are stored for future use. On the other hand, when quality and quantity of biomass does not experience significant seasonal changes, storage is avoided due to the damage it causes.

One of the challenging questions of utilizing renewable resources is its synchronization with the periodically varying demands. Only those methods can estimate the economic feasibility, which can explicitly take into account the pairing of demands with potential resources in multiple time horizons as well as the potential storage options. Moreover, waste treatment cannot be neglected in any long-term technology planning procedure. The P-graph framework provides appropriate formal and algorithmic basis for process synthesis, including structural modelling and model validation (Friedler et al., 1992), generation of alternative network structures (Friedler et al., 1995), determination of the optimal and N-best design alternatives (Friedler et al., 1996). By the help of the P-graph framework and its software implementation, i.e., the P-graph Studio developed at the University of Pannonia, process-network synthesis problems can be modelled and solved in general (Bertok et al., 2013), and optimization of multiperiod operation (Heckl et al., 2014), as well as multiperiod system design (Aviso et al., 2016) and waste treatment optimization (Friedler et al., 1994) in particular.

During infancy and adolescence, adipose tissue is growing by a combination of increase in fat cell size (to a lesser extent) and (above all) the number of these cells. In adults, fat cell number is constant over time in spite of a large turnover (about 10% of the fat cells per year) when body weight is stable. A decrease in body weight only changes fat cell size (becoming smaller), whereas an increase in body weight causes elevation of both fat cell size and number in adults. An important source of renewal of fat cells during the entire life span is the bone marrow. This is most apparent in obesity when ∼20% of all fat cells are derived from the bone marrow. Fat cell turnover is also important for the size of fat cells. Low turnover may cause large fat cells which, in turn, is linked to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. There is also a rapid turnover of fat cell lipids, which constitute a single active pool and are renewed about 6 times during the life span of individual fat cells. Overweight and obesity are associated with decreased lipid turnover due to high input in combination with low output of lipids from the fat cells. Low fat cell lipid turnover is associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Thus, changes in the turnover of fat cells and their lipid content are important for the development of adipose tissue mass and its cellularity (fat cell size and number) and, in turn, for metabolic disturbances. © 2018 Nestlé Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S.

In consecutive dehydration/rehydration cycles, reasonable cycle stability is found.

The former, he claimed, is never sufficient on its own: we always needed to also include power-operated infrastructures to make buildings livable. Few decades later, moved by the oil crises and contemporary pollution concerns, we began to measure building performance and livability by the scarcity of natural reserves of resources. The sense of scarcity became a major drive in development of technologies to measure and reduce energy use. Parallel to this development, massive structure and power-operated environments conflated in several ways. We can locate smart building development in this lineage of immixture of power-operated environment with massive structure. Rich data collection from sensors and logging of users actions permit to orchestrate, to a certain extent, the co-operation between buildings and their human users. The discourse on scarcity, however, still haunts the discipline. Scarcity of resources and our attempts to measure them have been a strong drive behind technological developments. This starts to change slowly, with the advances in renewable energy technologies and proliferation of communication networks. By moving away from the scarcity discourse and placing more value on abundance of information, I pertain to address the interplay between user agency and building automation. I discuss three cases of scarcity that can be read in a different key: energy, wireless communication and attention.

Image sequences are weighed and combined in order to present a pattern change in the thermal response of a tested composite structure. Reaction Injection Molding samples used and subjected to thermal energy to characterize their surface uniformity and any existing damage. A threshold value is used for the purpose of segmenting and separating damaged from undamaged areas in the tested composite structure. Gradient field analysis established the critical time at which the surface started to show damage and segmented the tested images into areas of concern. The resulting histograms cover four main regions of interest according to the gradient intensities as a function of time. Each region is divided into eight subsections according to the corresponding limit value, resulting in thirty two subsections. Correlation between region gradient field and its histogram resulted in uncovering of surface deformities as a function of surface area thermal storage. The process is modeled mathematically. © 2018 Mahmoud Zaki Iskandarani.","Edge detection; Gradient norm; Gray level mapping; Histogram equalization; Histogram specification; Information entropy; Segmentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050181385

Therefore, this work investigated the effect of propionylation of sisal reinforced fibre in the sisal/polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) biocomposite. Propionylation involved esterification substitution of propionic anhydride to hydroxyl group of sisal fibre, where ester group (COOR) of propionylated fibre was successfully observed by Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Then mechanical and thermal properties were evaluated and biodegradation characteristics were assessed. The tensile strength and modulus of propionylated sisal/PHBV biocomposite were greater than unmodified sisal/PHBV, which revealed better compatibility at the interface. In addition, propionate moieties of sisal fibre could induce crystalline formation of PHBV, as determined by an increase of crystalline phase. The higher decomposition temperature (Td) and activation energy (Ea) of 155 kJ·mol-1, determined by thermal gravimetric analyser (TGA), were strong confirmation of good thermal resistance of the propionylated sisal biocomposite. The storage modulus, as characterized by dynamic mechanical thermal analyser (DMTA), also revealed the improvement of stiffness. Bacterial growth tests evaluated the inhibition of bacterial growth on the PHBV biocomposites. It was clear that propionylation of sisal fibre decreased colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Escherichia coli (E.coli). © 2018 Chulalognkorn University.","Antimicrobial; PHBV; Sisal; Surface modification; Thermal properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049576509

Animals derived vitamins from plants and microorganisms. Vitaminoids are compounds with “vitamin-like” activity. Vitamins fall into two main groups: fat-soluble (e.g., A, D, E) and water-soluble (e.g., B, C, P) vitamins. Nutraceuticals include a number of substances ranging from natural diets, herbal products, biofortified crops, genetically modified, and processed food products. Nutraceuticals beyond basic nutrition provide health benefit, modulate immunity, and/or prevent and cure specific diseases. Functional foods are whole, fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that provide health benefits beyond the provision of essential nutrients and classified into several groups on the basis of food group, the diseases it prevents or alleviates, physiological effects, etc. Food additives are antioxidants, food preservatives, food coloring agents, flavoring agents, anti-infective agents, excipients, and other similar substances used in the processing or storage of foods or animal feed. Excipients have little or no therapeutic value, but contribute largely to the performance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and maintain the quality, efficacy, safety, etc., of the formulation and include solvents, diluting, suspending, and emulsifying agents as well as antioxidants, preservatives, pharmaceutical, coloring agents, flavoring agents, vehicles, excipients, ointment bases, etc. Proteins and peptides allow the development of antibodies and different fermentations, purification processes, and recombination technology produced potential protein drugs at acceptable cost which can be useful in various diseases through various routes like oral, transdermal, nasal, pulmonary, ocular, buccal, and rectal. Many protein pharmaceuticals are available for treating rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery thrombosis, multiple sclerosis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Papain, a plant enzyme, is very helpful for the prevention of atherosclerosis and diabetic heart disease. Natural anesthetics, e.g., cocaine, methyl salicylate, capsaicin, piperine, opium, etc., have been in use since antiquity.

However, food processing and storage generally reduce aroma intensity. Therefore, active packaging has been performed in order to preserve, replace or increase food aroma. Vanillin (vanilla-like) and 2-acetylpyrazine (pandan-like) are among the most popular aroma compounds used in food and beverage, especially ice cream, confectionary and bakery products. The objective of this study was to investigate quality changes during storage of 2-acetylpyrazine-(AF) and vanillin-releasing polypropylene films (VF) prepared by vacuum impregnation. The data collected from gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) showed that aroma content of AF was significantly lower than VF (p ≤ 0.05). Both films were kept at 35, 45 and 55 °C and the film qualities were evaluated after 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 days of storage. The results revealed that the concentrations of aroma in AF and VF decreased over time, especially at high storage temperature. Reduction of 2-acetylpyrazine followed second order kinetics, whereas reduction of vanillin followed first order kinetics. Aroma detection threshold was used as a critical limit to estimate the shelf-life. Aroma retention of AF was 27, 8 and 2 days, while those of VF were 98, 18 and 16 days at storage temperature of 35, 45 and 55°C, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) of 2-acetylpyrazine reduction calculated from Arrhenius equation was 132 kJ/mol and Ea of vanillin reduction was 65 kJ/mol. Decrease of aroma concentrations after storage were in agreement with the sensory results. Storage temperature and time also resulted in significant changes in film color (p ≤ 0.05). © 2018 Chiriotti Editori.

To this end, simulation data of a detailed simulation model, derived from measurement data of a fixed bed regenerator test rig, were investigated in order to determine the actual charging and discharging power of the storage in highly dynamic operation. The two formulations were derived from an original MILP storage model with fixed maximum charging and discharging power. The first proposed formulation adds linear constraints for charging and discharging power depending on the fill level.

The predicted operation for a test case of the original and the two proposed mixed integer linear formulations are compared with the achieved operation of the detailed simulation model.

Together with environmental issues (e.g. global warming) and energy security concerns, renewable energies are on the rise. As these are less predictable the importance of a cost effective and environmentally friendly energy storage and transportation system increases. A solution might be hydrogen (H2), as the gas has a high energy density and might be a future energy carrier. In a power-to-gas context electrical energy is used to produce H2 via water electrolysis. The gas can be stored and transported, most cost- and energy-efficient via pipelines. However, pipelines are capital intensive so the current natural gas-grid could be used to co-transport H2. According to national pipeline regulations low H2 concentrations are already possible (e.g. 4%(v/v) in Austria). While the injection is straightforward, the extraction is challenging. In previous work a process has been identified, experimentally validated and optimised via process simulation, that is able to extract H2 at fuel cell quality (99.97%(v/v) according to ISO 14687-2:2012). The previously gained knowledge is used in the current work to create a reduced model (combination of principal component analysis and trained artificial neural network). The model has a significantly increased performance compared to the whole process simulation. Therefore, it is computationally less expensive and can be easily implemented in further investigations like GIS based analysis and economic evaluations as done in ongoing work. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","artificial neural network; fuel cell hydrogen; future technology; hydrogen infrastructure; process simulation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049332951

However, production costs can be reduced by using wasted cooking oil (WCO). The objective of this paper is the development of a parametric algorithm for the technical and economic analysis of the implementation of a new biodiesel production plant by,alkali transesterification process using waste cooking oil (WCO) for small and medium scale facility. The computational tool determines the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) as economic indicators and the specification of the equipment, plant capacity and energy consumption as technical results for the feasibility analysis as function of the quantity of WCO to storage per month and WCO price. The methodology to estimate the costs involving the biodiesel plant was supported on the technical and economic studies presented in the literature in order to determine the percentage each factor such over the total capital investment cost. Factors such as maintenance, operation costs, acquisition and total equipment cost. The methodology determines the dimension of the equipment for each plant capacity: Storage tanks, flow rate of the centrifuges and dimension of column distillation for the purification of the co-product glycerol. The obtained results show IRR in a range of 9.81% to 35.89 % for plant capacity of processing 1 million to 3 million of WCO liters collected in Bogotá D.C (Colombia), respectively in a project period of 15 years. The NPV obtained was in the range US$ 5.71 million - US$ 89.68 million. The feasibility of this project is possible when WCO prices would be lower than US$ 0.2/liter and the volume of WCO collected upper to 720,000 liters/month.

Mass and energy integration aspects of natural gas conversion (conventional steam reforming, autothermal reforming and chemical looping), carbon capture unit by gas-liquid and gas-solid systems, ammonia production and associated heat recovery and their influence on the overall ammonia production performances are discussed in detail. The ammonia production concepts were modelled and simulated using a process flow modelling software (ChemCAD). The obtained simulation results were used to assess the overall technical and environmental indicators of the ammonia production plant. Three case scenarios with CO2 capture were considered for investigation. Industrial and experimental data were used to validate the models. The results show that the chemical looping system has significant advantages compared to the natural gas reforming technologies coupled with the gas-liquid absorption technology such as: lower specific fossil energy consumption (8.3 MWth/t NH3 vs. 9.6 - 9.9 MWth/t NH3), higher carbon capture rate (99.9 % vs. 60 – 90 %), lower specific CO2 emissions (7 kg/t NH3 vs. 230 - 900 kg/t NH3 for plants with CO2 capture based on gas-liquid absorption and about 2000 kg/t NH3 for plant without CO2 capture), lower plant complexity.

The carbon capture rate of the CO2 capture unit is higher than 90%. The evaluations used process flow modeling performed using ChemCAD process simulator, as well as, process integration techniques (e.g. thermal integration via pinch analysis) for quantification of mass &amp; energy balances of the overall process. The analysis is geared toward assessment of key technical and environmental indicators of flexible hydrogen and power co-generation based on DRM with CO2 capture such as: gross and net power output, hydrogen thermal output, cumulative energy efficiency, ancillary plant energy consumption, carbon capture rate, specific carbon dioxide emissions etc. As benchmark cases, conventional steam reforming and autothermal reforming, both equipped with CO2 capture using gas-liquid absorption, are used for comparison reason of DRM technology. Potential production of other energy carriers (e.g. synthetic fuels like methanol) by dry methane reforming with CO2 capture was also considered.

Torrefaction can be a well suitable procedure to improve the fuel properties of these fuels. In this study the combustion behavior of five widely available untreated and torrefied biomass fuels - forest residues (FR), sugar cane leaves (SCL), green waste (GW), winter wheat straw (ST) and sunflower husks (SFH) - were investigated by the application of a multi-step laboratory approach (chemical analyses, fuel indices and fixed-bed lab-scale reactor combustion tests). The investigations revealed that SFH (untreated and torrefied) can be recommended as a fuel directly applicable in grate furnaces (also without flue gas recirculation) because of the low slagging tendency, but high aerosol emission needs to be considered. Also FR, SCL and GW (untreated and torrefied) can be applied under consideration of the slagging tendency, whereas ST is not recommendable concerning its severe slagging tendency. However, for all fuels investigated the applicability in grate fired plants needs special considerations, since they do not behave like natural stem wood. Therefore, an appropriate validation by means of experimental investigations with a lab-scale combustion facility is highly recommended before using such fuels. The combustion tests reveal the measures which must be taken to ensure an undisturbed and continuous operation on grate furnaces. By execution of such combustion tests the advantages of torrefied material (e.g., higher calorific value, better storage feasibility, etc.) can be fully exploited.

The strategy is designed to be implemented in the power control system of the CS. The control proceeds depending on the integration of renewable energy sources by adopting an optimization algorithm, in order to minimize stress on existing power and to reduce the cost of consumed energy based on the electrical grid in standalone mode. This work explains in detail the approach via simulation results of a 15kW PV-Grid system connected with 40kWh lithium-ion battery and a load flow of five EVs. However, a power predictive model is described in this research, it is based on a real time monitoring of power demand and supply, where a reliable data communication between the CS and the plugged EV is achieved. Additionally, various parameters are involved in the approach to set the optimal operation mode of a charging process for instance, the instantaneous power of the PV array, the available energy in the battery storage buffer and the limited power the grid can offer. MPPT algorithm with the voltage source converters (VSC) and also the current control loop are all pillars to build the adopted power forecasting model.

Thereby, here, we report on a complete study of bimetallic clusters composed of cobalt and nickel with up to 7 atoms using ab initio methods in the GGA approach. We applied an unrestricted search method based on the tensor of inertia eigenvalues to find the most stable configurations of the clusters, obtaining a diverse set of structures with different geometric properties. We explored the effect of composition on the structural properties, the chemical stability, the magnetization and the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of the so-obtained systems. Our results indicate that the behavior of the clusters is mainly governed by the Co-Co interaction and to a lesser extent by the Co-Ni and Ni-Ni interactions. Furthermore, for a given cluster size the magnetic moment increases by 2 μB/Co-substitution plus 1 μB/Ni-substitution coming from the cobalt and nickel core d-states, while in some cases unpaired hybrid s-electrons can also give rise to itinerant magnetism. These features have been analyzed with the help of a Jellium model and have important consequences for the magnetism and the magnetic anisotropy of the clusters. The magnetic behavior and MAE present complex and intriguing landscapes, which suggests the possibility of finely controlling the magnetic states, by tuning the cluster composition, aiming at technical implementation in fields such as molecular magnetism or quantum computation. In particular, cases such as Co6Ni, Co4Ni3, CoNi6 Co2Ni5 and Co3Ni3 present high relative stability and enhanced magnetic moments (around 10 μB), what makes them promising candidates for applications such as subnanometer magnetic information storage. © the Owner Societies 2018.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049034762

The main focus of studies on hydrides has been so far the acceleration of kinetics for the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes at moderate temperatures, and the increase of the weight percentage of hydrogen. The hydrides characterized by relatively slow kinetics for the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes and by a high decomposition temperature are therefore of scarce relevance for hydrogen economy. However, selected hydrides have recently been suggested to find unique exciting applications in optoelectronics and as solid electrolytes for battery applications. Their use in optoelectronic devices depends on their stability with respect to doping, solubility of shallow donors and acceptors, and electrical as well as optical properties. In general, the hydrides are widely available in powder form, which is required for hydrogen storage and not preferable for electronic device technology. For the latter applications, crystalline or amorphous hydrides in solid/thin film forms are preferable. Moreover, the amphoteric behavior of hydrogen and its interaction with the environment are known to hinder the optimization of optoelectronic properties of hydrides from an experimental perspective. These are currently open problems and comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies are required to develop a further understanding. Classically, the chemical bonding in solids are classified as ionic, covalent, and metallic. However, the bonding in a real system is a combination of these three classes. The results of theoretical electronic-structure calculations can be readily used to study the nature of chemical bonds. In general, the distribution of electron bands in reciprocal space and the distribution of states in energy [the density of states (DOS)] provide insight on the bonding in a given material. By analyzing the DOS, decomposed according to crystal site and angular momenta, one can distinguish between ionic and covalent bonds in solid systems. The nature of the bonding can be analyzed using several other tools such as valence-charge density plot, charge-transfer plot, electron-localization function (ELF), crystal-orbital Hamilton population (COHP), Bader and Mulliken atomic charges that are derived from the electronic structure calculations. In this chapter we will describe the nature of the bonding in hydrides, and show how these affect the properties of these materials, focussing on application in the energy storage and in the transportation sector. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Chemical bonding; Electronic structure; Ionic conductors; Nano phase hydrides","Bond strength (chemical); Charge transfer; Crystal atomic structure; Electronic structure; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Ionic conduction; Motor transportation; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Semiconductor doping; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Chemical bondings; Crystal orbital Hamilton populations; Decomposition temperature; Electron localization function; Electronic structure calculations; Ionic conductor; Nano-phase; Optoelectronic properties; Hydrides",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048592669

Its medium electronegativity causes a large flexibility in terms of metal-ligand interactions, resulting in a vast variety of possible compositions, chemical bonding, crystal structures and physical properties. However, numerous unsolved problems remain on our way towards a sustainable, carbon free energy system based on renewable energy and on hydrogen as a future energy carrier. Thus, the authors present the structural details of alkali, alkali earth based selected tetra-boro hydrides. Selected hydrides have recently been suggested for applications in optoelectronics and as solid electrolytes for battery applications. Their use in optoelectronic devices depends on their stability with respect to doping, solubility of shallow donors and acceptors, electrical and optical properties.

Lastly, the book discusses metal hydrides obtaining in sintered electrodes of nickel-cadmium batteries with electrochemical methods by the way of electrolyte decomposition onto hydrogen and oxygen.

In such devices, metal hydrides fulfill the functions of both a cathode and the solid-state generator of working gas. Their advantages are high purity of gas injected (99.99 - 99.999%), along with the safety and compactness in storage. Hydrogen is injected (desorbed) locally under the influence of ion bombardment of metal hydride surface, which fact provides return coupling between the intensity of gas desorption and the parameters of gas discharge. The rate of sputtering for those materials by plasma ions significantly reduces as well as heat loads. Above effect is achieved due to the creation of protective gas target as a result of both the thermal decomposition of metal hydride and ion stimulated desorption. The feature of metal hydride cathode under the conditions of gas discharge is a decrease in the ionization potential of desorbed hydrogen by 0.3-0.5 eV due to the molecules desorption in the vibrationally/rotationally excited state. This permits a substantially increase in ionization efficiency and the formation of negative ions by the mechanism of dissociative attachment in plasma volume. However, hydrogen desorbed from metal hydride significantly changes the properties of the discharge. This is expressed, for example, in the fact that the plasma source based on Penning trap with metal hydride cathode appears to generate current-compensated ion beams with the ability to control the energy of the extracted ions.

The authors discuss load modeling, renewable distributed generation insertion, local control strategies and a general load flow method designed for balanced and unbalanced microgrids capable of operating connected to the main grid. Two types of primary control are discussed in this book: conventional power control for a residential fuel cell, and virtual synchronous generator control for a battery. The proposed method enables surplus/shortage power in a transient microgrid to be effectively and autonomously interchanged among clusters without using any tertiary control. Later, the authors aim to devise a solution for optimal dispatch of the energy resources in a microgrid being used to continue supplying critical loads during power outages. The goal is to maximize the number of loads served subject to the operational and technical constrains of the microgrid. This compilation includes a novel optimal fractional order general type-2 fuzzy logic proportional-integral-derivative (FOGT2FPID) controller book for the load frequency control of Shipboard MGs. Later, the Load Frequency Control Model is considered for its propensity to stabilize the frequency of the system in the presence of Distributed Generation, two Electric Vehicles as energy storage, and intermittent load and wind power profiles as uncertainties.

The goal of this work is to compare the gas infrastructures in China and the EU with respect to their ability to guarantee this infrastructural component of energy security in future. While the EU has high and long lasting dependence on natural gas, its consumption in not likely to grow much over time. Contrary to the EU, China has a huge plan to expand the natural gas share in its energy portfolio due to substitution of coal by gas, primarily because of environmental concern (high air pollution in cities).

The main sources of CO2 come from industries such as power generation. The current technology to remove CO2 effectively is carbon capture and storage or CCS especially absorption with aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solutions are monoethanolamine (MEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). They have some disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. A new solvent such as 3-amino-1-propanol (AP) has been designed to be used as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal. This solvent should provide the absorption and cyclic capacities close or higher than the commercial ones. The objective of this research is to measure the CO2 absorption in a 4 M aqueous solution of AP at the temperature from 303.15 K to 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa and the absorption results of CO2 in AP solution are compared with that of aqueous solution of MEA. From the experiment, the results present that AP at 4 M provides the performance relatively close to that of MEA. The cyclic capacities of AP are relatively lower than that of MEA for 26.83 and 2.73 % for CO2 partial pressure at 15 and 100 kPa. The absorption capacity of AP is higher when CO2 partial pressure increases and reduces as temperature increases. AP can be considered as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal at high CO2 partial pressure. Other properties like kinetics, mass transfer, energy penalty for solvent regeneration as well as other criteria have to be investigated for AP before it can be used for commercial purposes.

Hexavalent uranium [U(VI)] is the most abandoned radioactive waste discharged from nuclear fuel processing, electricity generation power plants, radioisotope manufacturing plants. Improper disposal or storage of U(VI) containing waste may poses a threat to aquatic systems and related ecological systems. Treatment of U(VI) containing effluents from these industrial activities requires the reduction of highly mobile and radiotoxic U(VI) to tetravalent U(IV) which readily forms the hydroxide precipitate [U(OH)4(s)] under neutral pH conditions. Processes employing biofilm and fixed-film systems for treatment of wastewater are considered more robust than planktonic culture systems in the presence of high toxicity, and therefore, are preferred in the treatment of toxic liquid waste. In this study U(VI) reduction is investigated using a fixed-film reactor inoculated with U(VI) reducing bacteria isolated from tailing dump soil collected from an abandoned uranium mine in South Africa. The fixed-film bioreactor was operated as a continuous flow reactor under oxygen stressed conditions without the addition of external organic carbon source. The results from this study showed that the fixed-bed bioreactor was able to achieve >90 % U(VI) removal efficiency at U(VI) concentration of up to 85 mg/L, concentration which is higher than that observed at the study site. This demonstrates the feasibility of the fixed-bed bioreactor in continuously removing U(VI) in aqueous solutions without the need of introducing external organic carbon source and without re-seeding the bioreactor. The bioremediation technology proposed in this study significantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the biofilm processes in treating process effluent streams and U(VI) contaminated sites as part of the pump-and treat.

The best conditions for the long-term storage of BCC are in a dry, non-heated environment. This is confirmed by powder X-ray analysis. Under humid conditions sample material transforms into vaterite-type calcium carbonate, while under a dry heating process it dehydrates and dehydroxylates to calcite-type calcium carbonate. Under ambient humidity and temperature conditions the dehydrated modification does not convert back to BCC or calcite-type calcium carbonate, but also transforms to the vaterite-type calcium carbonate. High-quality scanning electron microscopy images of a rapidly converted vaterite-type calcium carbonate reveal imperfect pseudomorphs of vaterite after the platy BCC. Literature data reported the chemical formula of BCC as a sesquihydrate. The observed and calculated weight losses are close to the calculated value for a monohydrate, which leads to the corrected chemical formula of BCC as Ca3(CO3)2(OH)2·H2O or 2CaCO3Ca(OH)2·H2O. Structure solution and Rietveld refinement (Rwp =11.2%) based on powder X-ray patterns reveal the hitherto unknown atomic arrangement. It crystallizes to a monoclinic lattice with space group Pc (no. 7); the cell parameters of the pseudo-orthorhombic cell are a = 8.6552(2), b = 6.5529(2), c = 7.0801(2)Å, β = 90.059(4)°, V= 401.56(2)Å3, Z=2 and ρcalc = 2.417g·cm-3. The structure model of BCC consists of three edge-sharing Ca-polyhedra interconnected by two CO3 groups. Based on bond-valence calculation two oxygen positions can be attributed to hydroxyl groups, one oxygen position represents a water molecule. The main structural motif is a chain of edge-sharing Ca-O2(OH)4 octahedra running parallel to the c-axis. The structure exhibits similarities to those of vaterite, portlandite and hydromagnesite. © 2018 E.Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung.","Basic calcium carbonate; BCC; Calcium carbonate hydroxide hydrate; Carbonation; CCHH; Crystal structure; PCC; Powder X-ray diffractometry; Precipitated calcium carbonate; Synthesis; Vaterite","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal structure; Digital storage; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Hydrated lime; Hydrates; Hydration; Magnesite; Molecules; Oxygen; Precipitation (chemical); Rietveld refinement; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); X ray diffraction analysis; X rays; Calcium carbonate hydroxide hydrate; CCHH; Diffractometry; Precipitated calcium carbonate; Vaterite; Carbonation; calcium carbonate; crystal structure; physicochemical property; precipitation (chemistry); vaterite; X-ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047079362

Along the height of the building two residential floors are followed by one or two floors, made of the second type of containers, which represent refrigeration chambers, used for cultivation and storage of soft fruits and vegetables. Each chamber is divided in two parts. The first part of the chambers is used for cultivation of soft fruit and vegetables, whereas the second part represents a storage space with positive temperature (2-12°С).

An estimated 10%-20% of the total grain produced in that region is lost before the food reaches consumers. This loss is valued in billions of dollars a year and could meet the annual calorie needs of 48 million people. PHL also waste labor, land, water, fertilizer and energy, and generate unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions, when resources are used to produce, process, and transport food that will not reach consumers. Losses occur during post-harvest activities, such as drying, storing, and transporting grain. PHL can be quantitative (e.g., bags of grain break and spill, or pests eat the grain) and qualitative (e.g., loss in nutritional value due to spoilage). A number of causes of PHL will be exacerbated by hotter average temperatures, greater rainfall variability, and more frequent extreme weather events. These factors are compounded by inadequate post-harvest handling practices and inadequate facilities and infrastructure. PHL can be reduced by investing in cold and dry storage, rural roads, rural and wholesale market facilities, and processing facilities. Training of farmers on proper practices and use of strategies such as hermetically sealed bags can reduce PHL. © 2018 Environment for Development (EfD) Initiative.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046928395

The thermosyphon envelope consists of a polyamide composite with carbon based high thermal conductive micro-, nanofilaments and nanoparticles to increase its effective thermal conductivity up to 11 W/(m?C). Rectangular capillary mini grooves inside the evaporator and condenser of thermosyphon are used as a mean of heat transfer enhancement. The tested working fluid is R600. Thermosyphon evaporator and condenser are similar in design, have a long service life. In this paper three different methods (transient, quasi-stationary, and stationary) have been used to determine the thermophysical properties of polymer composites used as an envelope of thermosyphon, which make it possible to design a wide range of new heat transfer equipment. The results obtained contribute to establish the viability of using polymer thermosyphons for ground heat sinks (solar energy storage), gas-liquid heat exchanger applications involving seawater and other corrosive fluids, efficient cooling of superconductive magnets impregnated with epoxy/carbon composites to prevent wire movement, enhance stability, and diminish heat generation. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

VPPs are formed by the integration of heterogeneous systems, organizations and entities which collaborate to ensure optimal generation, distribution, storage, and sale of energy in the energy market. The collaborative nature of VPPs gives the semblance of collaborative business ecosystem, constituted of a mix of highly interdependent relationship among stakeholders. The systematic literature review methodology is used to summarize research evidence of emerging convergence between the Collaborative Networks (CN) and VPP domains. It is observed that, various strategic and dynamic collaborative alliances are formed within a VPP which are similar to various CN organizational forms like: Virtual Breeding Environments (VBE), grasping opportunity driven-networks etc. CN principles like: virtual organization creation, operation and dissolution, negotiation, broker services, etc., are also found.

Here we introduce a simple but powerful characterization method based on equivalent circuit analysis to explore the consequences of these imperfections on the charging and discharging properties of microsupercapacitors. Under voltage control, an asymmetric behavior of the voltammetry emerges upon charging and discharging, a part of the storage being hidden from the external circuit. Under current control, the capacitance is dependent on the magnitude and symmetry of applied current.

Measured average load factor in on-road tests was 60-70%. Dynamometer tests at 100% load factor utilized drive cycles derived from on-road speed data. A ""diesel equivalent mileage"" of actual LPG mileage, deemed indicative of LPG ""fuel energy conversion efficiency"" relative to diesel, was calculated (based solely on fuel heating values and densities) for comparing actual mileage from both fuels. The LPG actual mileage in both on-road and laboratory tests was lower than diesel mileage. In on-road tests, the LPG actual mileage was lower than diesel actual mileage by about the same percentage LPG heating value was lower than diesel's per liter of fuel. The LPG diesel equivalent mileage was also about the same as diesel actual mileage so that fuel conversion efficiencies of both jeepney types were deemed similar. In chassis dynamometer tests at 100% load factor, the LPG diesel equivalent mileage was lower than diesel actual mileage. This implied that in addition to the effect of lesser LPG heating value per liter, the LPG jeepneys had lower energy conversion efficiencies than diesel at load factors higher than experienced in the on-road tests. Optimization of the LPG jeepney via tuning and/or powertrain configuration is suggested especially if deployed at higher load factors. The amount of financial incentives, e.g. fuel pricing, to promote LPG jeepneys should take into account its comparable on-road fuel conversion efficiency to diesel and generally accepted better emissions. © 2018 SAE International.

Increasing greenhouse gas emissions level and the need for energy security has prompted increasing research into alternative fuels for diesel engines. Biodiesel is the most popular amongst the alternatives for diesel fuel as it is biodegradable, renewable and can be produced domestically from vegetable oils. In recent years, hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) has also gained popularity due to some of its advantages over biodiesel such as higher cetane number, lower deposit formation, storage stability etc. HVO is a renewable, paraffinic biobased alternative fuel for diesel engines similar to biodiesel. Unlike biodiesel, the production process for HVO involves hydrogen as catalyst instead of methanol which removes oxygen content from vegetable oil. A modified 6-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine (modified for operation with single cylinder) was used for studying particle number emission characteristics for HVO fuel. The investigation was performed for varying fuel injection pressure at various engine operating loads (6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 bar IMEP). Five rail pressures were chosen from 800 to 2000 bar at a step of 300 bar. The results show that increase in rail pressure tends to increase nucleation mode particle number concentration (quantify the increase) while increase in engine load results in higher total particle number concentration. No significant differences were observed in soot and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission for HVO compared to mineral diesel. The fraction of emitted particles in the nucleation mode was observed to increase with increasing fuel injection pressure. © 2018 SAE International.

However, the procedure is prone to different weaknesses both on security (disclosure of identities) and performances (complexity) aspects. This paper proposes an IMS-AKA+ protocol that addresses effectively user’s identities protection by using a key-less cryptography. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the authentication process complexity due to the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Simulations were carried out for the IMS-AKA+ protocol and the original IMS-AKA protocol.

Nowadays, it is widely accepted that integrating vRESs is highly needed to solve a multitude of global concerns such as meeting an increasing demand for electricity, enhancing energy security, reducing heavy dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and the overall carbon footprint of power production. As a result, the scale of vRES development has been steadily increasing in many electric distribution networks. The favorable agreements of states to curb greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, along with other technical, socio-economic and structural factors, is expected to further accelerate the integration of renewables in electric distribution networks. Many states are now embarking on ambitious “clean” energy development targets. Distributed generations (DGs) are especially attracting a lot of attention nowadays, and planners and policy makers seem to favor more on a distributed power generation to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the future. And, the role of traditionally centralized power production regime is expected to slowly diminish in future grids. This means that existing electric distribution networks should be readied to effectively handle the increasing penetration of DGs, vRESs in particular, because such systems are not principally designed for this purpose. It is because of all this that regulators often set a maximum RES penetration limit (often in the order of 20%) which is one of the main factors that impede further development of the much-needed vRESs. The main challenge is posed by the high-level variability as well as partial unpredictability of vRESs which, along with traditional sources of uncertainty, leads to several technical problems and increases operational risk in the system. This is further exacerbated by the increased uncertainty posed by the continuously changing and new forms of energy consumption such as power-to-X and electric vehicles. All these make operation and planning of distribution networks more intricate. Therefore, there is a growing need to transform existing systems so that they are equipped with adequate flexibility mechanisms (options) that are capable of alleviating the aforementioned challenges and effectively managing inherent technical risk. To this end, the main focus of this chapter is on the optimal management of distribution networks featuring such flexibility options and vRESs. This analysis is supported by numerical results from a standard network system. For this, a reasonably accurate mathematical optimization model is developed, which is based on a linearized AC network model. The results and analysis in this book chapter have policy implications that are important to optimally design ad operate future grids, featuring large-scale variable energy resources. In general, based on the analysis results, distribution networks can go 100% renewable if various flexibility options are adequately deployed and operated in a more efficient manner. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Demand response; Electric distribution networks; Energy storage systems; Flexibility options; Mixed integer linear programming; Network reconfiguration; Stochastic programing; Variable renewable energy sources",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045259907

The implementation of photovoltaics for the study mainly focused on the use of PV system as a grid-tied element which served as the primary power supply for small appliance loads during loaded operation with the grid providing the backup supply in the case that the PV system failed to provide sufficient power. Such was the case when (a) sunlight is not sufficient to energize the load, (b) the energy storage unit, which is the battery, had insufficient charge, or (c) the current generated by the PV modules is less than the current through the load. These factors were monitored through the monitoring and control system elements of the design which also performed the necessary supply switching for the conditions of the system while also monitoring the energy consumed from the grid and energy delivered back to the grid. Through the system created, power generated by the PV modules was delivered to the load or fed to the grid, and load was shifted back to the grid, as necessary. The responses of the relay were the most suggestive of the effective implementation of the design. The responses recorded were of high accuracy and high precision in nature as tested for dependence through analysis of binary data by comparing the occurrence of expected outcome and actual observed outcome. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

This paper studied the workability of super capacitor as lone substitute to Li-ion batteries for electric tricycles and charging it by means of power from an alternative source that is solar panel. Specifically, this study is aimed to determine the power needed by super capacitor to fully charge, the time of its full charging, and the distance run by electric tricycle. The electric tricycle is assembled using electric bicycle mounted with a passenger side car. The solar panel is mounted on a support which houses charge controller and other accessories. The super capacitor used has a rating of 48 V, 165 F, modular type while the solar panel is rated 100 W. Various tests were conducted such as distance test and charging time test. From test results, the super capacitor employed in this work requires 68 W of solar panel power to become fully charged in more than 6 minutes. The electric tricycle with a fully-charged super capacitor can run up to 600 meters with driver and passenger load of not more than 118 kgs. A remarkable short average charging time, accounted by its high power density, validates that super capacitors are good storage medium for harvesting power from sporadic energy sources. On the other hand, the result for short distance travelled conveys that super capacitors are said to be suitable only for vehicle transportation requiring short distances such as point-to-point transport services. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

For these colloidal length scales thermal and gravitational energies are often comparable and therefore it is worthwhile to study the sedimentation phase behavior of these systems. For a multicomponent system this is possible through a theoretical construct known as a stacking diagram, which constitutes a set of all possible stacking sequences of phases in a sedimentation column, and uses as input the bulk phase diagram of the system in the chemical potential plane.

We start by estimating price and income elasticities of gasoline consumption using historical data for the period 1994-2010. Our estimates of price elasticity range between −1.433 and −0.151, while income elasticity range between 0.179 and 1.801. These results are similar with findings in other developing countries. We then establish a dynamic regression model for forecasting gasoline consumption. Usual statistical performance measures are used to validate the model. Results suggest that price, gross domestic product and income are significant drivers of gasoline consumption in Cameroon. Projected results show that gasoline consumption will increase by over 7% yearly, reaching 1078 504 m3 by 2020. Following these findings, we recommend energy policies in Cameroon to prioritize the discovery of new oil fields, expand and modernize refining capacities to increase production, and improve storage capacities of petroleum products by at least 2020. © 2018, Econjournals.

They exhibit great potential in power system operations: maintaining the load balance and improving power system security. This paper investigates the impact of linear and nonlinear energy resources on security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) solution with different contingencies as a time-varying optimization problem. Linear ESSs are prominent in the literature on SCED. However, most of the previous studies do not take into account the impact of ESSs' nonlinear characteristic as highlighted in this paper. Therefore, the SCED problem should be discussed as a time-varying optimization problem. A new procedure is presented to handle time-varying optimization problems by finding the switching points and generator response equations. Not only this paper highlights the limitations of linear ESS characteristic and the effectiveness of using nonlinear characteristic of ESS in SCED solutions; illustrated on modified IEEE 6-bus and 14-bus systems, but also different optimization methods are used to validate the proposed procedure. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.","Energy storage systems; Nonlinear energy resources; Optimization; Renewable energy sources; Security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF); Security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043485484

The biggest challenge of the solar energy is the intermittency of the energy produced. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is unpredictable and the generated power from large PV system can be affected by clouds, dust, or other factors. These situations lead to challenges in stabilizing the production of large PV system. This intermittency is a concern for large-scale grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system which require stable and reliable energy production all the time. The importance of energy storage system (ESS) as a solution to stabilize the effects of solar intermittency and as an energy buffer for a grid-connected PV system. Batteries energy storage system (BESS) can potentially solve this intermittency by storing energy and inject power into the grid when needed. Integrating large number of lithium- ion batteries with PV system in large-scale grid will control the energy flow from PV system and make sure to produce stable energy as required. This paper investigates an energy management mechanism for large-scale grid connected photovoltaic (PV) systems with lithium- ion batteries. The proposed system consists of a 1 MW PV system and 1 MW lithium-ion batteries connected to the grid by DC-DC converters and DC-AC inverters. MATLAB-SIMULINK is used to simulate the PV-batteries system under different circumstances of various irradiance and temperature levels. The proposed energy management strategy is verified by the results of simulation. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.","Batteries; Energy management; Large-scale; Photovoltaic (PV); Simulink",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043453191

A finite model of the considered SWPS is given and the limitations of the scalar control for such systems are detailed. The paper proposes to add a simple and accurate control stage to the low-cost scalar control based Standard Frequency Converter (SFC) in order to improve the SWPS performances. The synthesized control is simulated and its performances are compared to conventional SFC ones: the system response time is reduced, the system shutdowns caused by a partial shadowing are minimized and the global energy intake is increased.

To exploit solar energy continuously, we require a storage energy system. Phase Change Material (PCM) is used in this kind of systems in order to store a great amount of thermal energy. In fact, Latent heat storage in a PCM is very interesting because of its high-energy storage density and its isothermal behavior during the phase change process. Hence, heat accumulated during sunshine period, can be restituted to be used for air conditioning purposes in buildings. In this perspective, we propose in this work a numerical study based on an enthalpy formulation to investigate the solidification of a PCM in a heat exchanger with and without fins. This numerical approach gives simultaneously the temperature distributions in the PCM storage system and temporal propagation of the solidification front during the solidification of the PCM when it is exposed to a cold air flow.

An overview is given of amino acid and energy partitioning during growth in monogastric animals, in terms of causation and quantitatively based descriptors. Current knowledge is far from complete, and areas requiring new insights and a more in-depth understanding of causative mechanisms include voluntary food-intake control, dynamics of nutrient uptake, temporary post-prandial nutrient storage, relationships among nutrient intakes, protein turnover and maintenance-energy requirement, colonic amino acid uptake in poultry, bioavailability of amino acids other than lysine, diet effects on gut endogenous amino acid loss, inevitable amino acid catabolism, preferential amino acid catabolism, and diet, age and genotype effects on body protein synthesis and degradation.Journal compilation © CSIRO 2018.","amino acids; ATP; lysine; metabolism; modelling; nutrient utilisation.","amino acid; animal; bioavailability; energy use; environmental conditions; growth; metabolism; numerical model; nutrient use; prediction; protein; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042698914

There is growing evidence that the products and intermediates from lipolytic breakdown during the FA mobilization process also have fundamental regulatory functions affecting cell signaling, gene expression, metabolism, cell growth, cell death, and lipotoxicity. Regulation of ATGL is therefore vital for maintaining a defined balance between lipid storage and mobilization.

For a long time, it was simply seen as an energy storage organ that confers mechanical protection and heat insulation. However, an increasing number of studies demonstrate the complex role of adipose tissue in the systemic regulation of processes such as immunity and inflammation. Therefore, adipose tissue is currently considered a metabolic organ with varied features and potential action in different physio and pathological processes. In the particular case of the skin adipose depot, dermal white adipose tissue has been recently described as a contributor to a wide range of events including hair formation and cycle and cutaneous wound healing. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the role of adipose tissue and their components in skin homeostasis. Furthermore, a review on the approaches that have been followed to study these processes, not only in vitro but also in vivo, will be provided. Ultimately, adipose tissue engineering is presented as a valuable strategy to generate enhanced in vitro models in which the role of adipose tissue can be further unraveled. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Starch has been a strong driver for human development and is now the most important energy provider in the diet forcing the development of novel and valuable starch qualities for specific applications. Among the most important structures that can be targeted include starch phosphorylation chain transfer/branching generating chemically substituted and chain length-modified starches such as resistant and health-promoting high-amylose starch. Starch bioengineering has been employed for more than two decades and provided a number of high-value starch types. However, challenging problems include crop yield penalties and inefficient production of the desired product.

Here, an additional variable is added-the temperature. To obtain the temperature distribution in the fluid and solid phases that occupy the porous medium domain, we have to write and solve the energy balance equation, obviously with appropriate initial and boundary conditions, as well as with temperature-dependent constitutive relationships. This equation, with appropriate initial and boundary conditions are considered in this chapter. The assumption that underlies this chapter is that thermal equilibrium exists between all phases present at point in the porous medium domain. The presentation in Chaps. 5, 6, and 7, focused on flow and transport under isothermal conditions. Under non-isothermal conditions, all constitutive relations involve also temperature an additional variable, and the complete model should also include the energy balance equation. The solute transport models considered in Chap. 7, may now involve exogenic and endogenic reactions. Within a porous medium domain, thermal energy may be transported by four mechanisms: (1) Advection by a fluid (or fluids) moving in the void space, (2) conduction in all solid and fluid phases (overlooking advection in a deformable solid), (3) mass diffusion in the fluid phases, and (4) thermal dispersion in the fluid phase(s). All these modes of energy transport are discussed in this chapter. The effects of natural thermal gradients, produced by solar radiation at ground surface, on water and water vapor movement, as well as on the chemical and biological behavior in the subsurface, may serve as examples of interest to soil scientists. In dealing with contaminated groundwater, a number of remediation techniques are associated with heating the soil, and injection of steam. Other interesting cases that require knowledge of heat and mass transport in porous media are the storage of energy in aquifers, or in the unsaturated zone, the production of geothermal energy, the disposal of CO 2 in deep geological formations, the geological storage of high-level nuclear waste, and the thermally enhanced production of petroleum. Finally, in the chemical industry, most processes that take place in reactors occur under non-isothermal conditions. Because of its importance, we have added an appendix (App. A) that presents and discusses modeling of phenomena of transport that take place in chemical reactors. Coupling between the transport of mass and heat is also due to the fact that both the fluid’s density and its viscosity are temperature dependent. Most partitioning and equilibrium coefficients, discussed in Chaps. 6 and 7, are strongly temperature dependent. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041327470

The most common solution is to build a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit. However, this still needs improvement with very low energy produced indoor. Thus, aiming to reduce the power consumption of the conventional MPPT system, this study implemented a power down system that turns off idle blocks; hence, improving the performance of the conventional MPPT circuit. From several MPPT techniques, this study implemented the Fractional Open Circuit Voltage Method (FOCV), which has a lower cost and simple circuitry, neglecting the use of a microcontroller. Conventional FOCV-based MPPT systems are composed of a sampling circuit that sets the maximum power point voltage (VMPP) from the sampled open circuit voltage (VOC); and a comparator which assures that the accurate VMPP is stored at the output. From the simulation results, the conventional MPPT consumed a power of 324μW from the PV cell, which is higher than the 255μW consumed by this system. Therefore, the implementation of a power down system saved 21.2% more power than that of the conventional FOCV-based MPPT system. The size of the overall layout implemented in 65nm CMOS technology is 70.955 μm x 34.09 μm.","Fractional open circuit voltage; Indoor light energy harvesting; Maximum power point tracking; Photovoltaic cell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041205798

The employed system consists of a number of lead acid storage batteries, a set of photovoltaic (PV) panels, a charge controller, DC/AC inverter and an electrical load. The system also employs a monitoring unit (MU) that consists of voltage and current sensors and data acquisition cards. The MU was specially developed to monitor energy system performance parameters; such as PV voltage and current, battery voltage, battery charging and discharging currents and inverter current. The monitoring unit is controlled through a specially developed, LABVIEW® based, computer program. In the study, the effect of battery SOC on charging and charging efficiency was investigated. Also, the effect of battery's loading conditions on its useful charge was investigated. Finally, the effect of battery SOC and supported load on battery performance was investigated. Results of the study showed battery's SOC had a minimal effect on charging efficiency. It also showed that higher discharge current (load requirements) leads to significant decrease in energy system performance caused by decrease of battery discharge efficiency by up to 50%. On the other hand, low batteries SOC proved to have insignificant effect on meeting load demand. The results emphasize the importance of proper selection of batteries size as well as characteristics including cost, to match load requirements, as those would highly affect renewable energy system's performance and feasibility. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Battery; Battery efficiency; Battery SOC; PV; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041196626

In order to support fault tolerance in WSNs, the authors propose a new scheme which incorporates a link quality estimation algorithm and a congestion detection mechanism to enable nodes that present high quality links to be chosen for routing in a non-congested area in case of faults.

The random nature of solar energy is one of the main obstacles that encounter the designer to design an effective PVPS. Thus, an optimal and effective sizing approach is essential to ensure satisfactory performance. In this paper, a technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method integrated with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is proposed to optimally size PVPS based on techno-economic aspects. The loss of load probability (LLP) and excess water volume are considered as technical criteria, whereas the life cycle cost (LCC) is represented as an economic criteria to size the system. The hybrid AHP-TOPSIS sorts the PVPS configurations from the best to worst based on predefined weights for each criteria. The optimal configuration is found 5 PV modules and 4 PV strings are connected in series and parallel, respectively with 79 m3 as a maximum capacity of storage tank. The performance of system is tested based on the proposed optimal configuration over a year using hourly meteorological data. The results show that the proposed system offers high reliability throughout the year with LLP, LCC, and deficit water volume around 0.0004, 10524.9 USD, and 4.4629 m3, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Life cycle cost; Loss of load probability; Multi-criteria decision making; Photovoltaic water pumping system","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric load loss; Hierarchical systems; Life cycle; Meteorology; Photovoltaic cells; Pumping plants; Pumps; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Life cycle costs (LCC); Lifecycle costs; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Performance of systems; Photovoltaic water pumping; Technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution methods (TOPSIS); Loss of load probability; analytical hierarchy process; cost analysis; decision making; design; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; probability; pumping; size; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037341085

To exploit solar energy continuously, we require a storage energy system. Phase Change Material (PCM) is used in this kind of systems in order to store a great amount of thermal energy. In fact, Latent heat storage in a PCM is very interesting because of its high-energy storage density and its isothermal behavior during the phase change process. Hence, heat accumulated during sunshine period can be restituted to be used for air conditioning purposes in buildings. This work concerns the solidification in the presence of the natural convection of a rectangular phase change material exposed to a cold air flow along the conducting side walls. With this intention, the first stage includes the presentation of a numerical model based on the conservation equations, treated by finite volume method (two-dimensional model) coupled to an enthalpy formulation (source terms).

The temporally and geographically fragmented availability of woody biomass makes it particularly relevant to find cost-effective solutions for biomass production, storage and transportation up to the consumption facility. This paper addresses tactical decisions related with optimal allocation of wood chips from forest residues at forest sites to terminals and power plants. The emphasis is on a “hot-system” with synchronized chipping and chips transportation at the roadside. Thus, decisions related with the assignment of chippers to forest sites are also considered. We extend existing studies by considering the impact of the wood chips energy content variation in the logistics planning. This is a key issue in biomass-for-bioenergy supply chains. The higher the moisture content of wood chips, the lower its net caloric value and therefore, a larger amount of chips is needed to meet the contracted demand. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to solve this problem to optimality. Results of applying the model in a biomass supply chain case in Finland are presented. Results suggest that a 20% improvement in the supplier profit can be obtained with the proposed approach when compared with a baseline situation that relies on empirical estimates for a fixed and known moisture content in the end of an obliged storage age. © 2017","Biomass supply chain planning; Energy content; Forest residues; Mathematical programming; Moisture content; Synchronization of chipping and transportation","Cost effectiveness; Forestry; Integer programming; Mathematical programming; Moisture; Moisture determination; Supply chains; Wood products; Biomass productions; Biomass supply chain; Cost-effective solutions; Economic importance; Energy content; Forest residue; Mixed integer programming model; Storage and transportations; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; demand analysis; energy budget; energy planning; moisture content; plant residue; power plant; roadside environment; supply chain management; woody plant; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035808352

The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference resulted in a global agreement on net zero CO2 emissions shortly after the middle of the twenty-first century, which will lead to a collapse of fossil fuel demand. The focus of the study is to define a cost optimal 100% renewable energy system in Iran by 2030 using an hourly resolution model. The optimal sets of renewable energy technologies, least-cost energy supply, mix of capacities and operation modes were calculated and the role of storage technologies was examined. Two scenarios have been evaluated in this study: a country-wide scenario and an integrated scenario. In the country-wide scenario, renewable energy generation and energy storage technologies cover the country’s power sector electricity demand. In the integrated scenario, the renewable energy generated was able to fulfil both the electricity demand of the power sector and the substantial electricity demand for water desalination and synthesis of industrial gas. By adding sector integration, the total levelized cost of electricity decreased from 45.3 to 40.3 €/MWh. The levelized cost of electricity of 40.3 €/MWh in the integrated scenario is quite cost-effective and beneficial in comparison with other low-carbon but high-cost alternatives such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy.

This chapter will cover the history and current state of the art in CCS, as well as explore some of the complementary technologies. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"carbon emission; carbon sequestration; energy resource; environmental technology; power generation; project assessment; renewable resource; Canada; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034638578

However, memristive crossbar arrays have great difficulty distinguishing logical states because of sneak path currents. The row grounding technique eliminates the sneak path effect, allowing reliable sampling of the memristor state. In this paper, we analyze the row grounding technique and propose several methods and constraints for the design of memristive crossbar arrays. When the row grounding technique is used for these arrays, our analysis shows that increasing the number of rows can help reduce read latency and energy, in contrast to the case of capacitive memory arrays. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis proposed in this paper. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Robust heterogeneous catalysts are needed for this reaction to proceed at relevant levels. Ni/MgO is a promising catalyst in terms of activity and stability. Although several microscale catalyst studies exist, there is a lack of knowledge on catalyst performance and reactor control at larger scale for carbon dioxide methanation at ambient pressure and a technically relevant stoichiometric H2:CO2 (4:1) feed. Two catalysts with a loading of 11 and 17 wt.% nickel were prepared by wet impregnation, producing a Ni/MgO solid solution with a cubic lattice. Controlled increase (‘scanning experiment’) of the catalyst temperature to 500 °C for the highly exothermic CO2 methanation was compared to steady-state experiments. Scanning and steady-state experiments yield comparable results in terms of carbon dioxide conversion and methane selectivity, whereas scanning experiments lead to considerable time saving. At a moderate temperature of 325 °C and a feed flow consisting of H2:CO2:N2 = 4:1:5 at a flow rate of 250 cm3STPmin−1, CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity near thermodynamic equilibrium are achievable. The long-term stability of Ni/MgO (17 wt.% Ni) at 330 °C was proven during reactor operation for several days. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium oxide catalyst; Methanation; Nickel catalyst; Power-to-gas","Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Energy resources; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Magnesium compounds; Methanation; Methane; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Renewable energy resources; Scanning; Carbon dioxide conversions; Catalyst temperature; Chemical hydrogen storage; Controlled heating rates; Fixed bed tubular reactors; Heterogeneous catalyst; Nickel catalyst; Thermodynamic equilibria; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033606085

In future systems, variable renewable energy sources (wind and solar) are expected to provide a significant fraction of the electricity supply, increasing the requirement for variation management compared with today's situation. This paper investigates the impacts of measures designed to increase the competitiveness of coal-fired power plants in future energy systems, which are facing restrictions related to CO2 emissions and variable operation as a consequence of high penetration levels of wind and solar power. We investigate the cost-optimal compositions of three regional electricity generation systems with different conditions for generation using renewables with a linear cost-minimizing investment model. The model is applied in two energy policy scenarios: one with a tight cap on CO2 emissions, and one with a stringent requirement for generation from renewables. In a system with a stringent requirement for electricity generation from renewables but without a CO2 cap, coal-based technologies with improved cycling properties provide variation management, given that the development of measures for ensuring improved flexibility continues and reaches full-scale implementation at moderate cost. The effects of improved cycling properties on the system composition are especially relevant for regions with moderate potential for wind and solar generation, in that they reduce wind curtailment and improve the underlying conditions for investments in solar power. In the system with a tight CO2 cap, only coal-based technologies with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and co-firing of biomass are feasible. Increasing the share of biomass in co-firing technologies to achieve negative CO2 emissions increases the competitiveness of these technologies to a greater extent than if simply the cycling properties are improved. A larger co-firing fraction reduces the total system costs, since it facilitates the provision of low-cost flexibility by Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) plants, and it is especially important in regions where nuclear power is otherwise cost-competitive, as low-cost flexibility stimulates investments in wind and solar power at the expense of nuclear power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity system modelling; Investment model; Thermal cycling; Variable generation","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal storage; Competition; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermal cycling; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Coal-fired power generators; Electricity system; Electricity-generation system; Investment models; Natural gas combined cycle plants; Variable generations; Variable renewable energies; Investments; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; competitiveness; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; emission control; energy policy; future prospect; investment; modeling; renewable resource; solar power; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032930206

However, climate change could be mitigated using “carbon capture and storage” (CCS) methods. CO2 separation by physical adsorption is a promising technology to achieve CO2 capture with minimum energy costs. Mg-MOF-74 is a distinguished adsorbent amongst porous materials owing to its high CO2 uptake under flue gas conditions. In this study, a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) process composed of five steps (pressurization, feed, rinse, blowdown, and purge) for separating CO2 from a CO2/N2 mixture using Mg-MOF-74 was mathematically modeled. Two- and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed using a user-defined-function (UDF, written in C) linked to the ANSYS Fluent program. The models have been validated against published pressure swing adsorption experimental data. The regeneration (blowdown and purge) time has been tuned to explore the performance improvement for the VPSA process. The key optimum performance indices for VPSA in terms of CO2 purity, recovery, productivity, and process power consumption were found to be 95.3%, 94.8%, 0.50 kg_CO2 h−1 kg_MOF−1, and 68.71 kW h tonne_CO2−1, respectively. The corresponding operating carbon capture cost has been evaluated as $6.87 tonne_CO2−1 for a 500-MW post-combustion power plant. These CO2 productivity and power consumption performances represent a significant enhancement in CO2 separation using physical adsorption technology compared to those reported in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Carbon capture; Carbon-dioxide; CFD; Mg-MOF-74; Separation; VPSA","Adsorption; C (programming language); Carbon capture; Climate change; Computational fluid dynamics; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fossil fuels; Gas adsorption; Global warming; Magnesium compounds; Mixtures; Porous materials; Productivity; Separation; Minimum energy costs; Optimum performance; Physical adsorption; Pressure swing adsorption; Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics; User Defined Functions; Vacuum pressure swing adsorptions; VPSA; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; fossil fuel; performance assessment; power plant; pressure effect; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032731463

In recent years, intermittent feeding (IF) has become increasingly interesting because it has been shown to better condition the digester microbiology for overloading events. Additionally, IF is required when AD facilities move toward being active players in grid balancing via on-demand delivery and storage of green energy (i.e., power-to-gas). In this study, six laboratory-scale IF digesters were operated at 34, 37, and 40°C in a 300-day experiment to determine the impact of temperature on methane yield and long-term stability at typical conditions for conventional WWTP sludge digestion. The results show that IF led to no significant differences in methane yield observed among tested temperatures at an organic loading rate of 3 kg VS m-3 days-1 and a hydraulic retention time of 16 days. However, in an on-demand energy-delivery scenario, increased temperature could be interesting because of significantly increased methane production in the first hours following feeding. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Anaerobic digestion; Energy optimization; Intermittent feeding; Mesophilic; Primary sludge; Temperature","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Feeding; Methane; Pulp digesters; Reaction rates; Temperature; Wastewater treatment; Energy optimization; Hydraulic retention time; Impact of temperatures; Increased temperature; Mesophilic; Organic loading rates; Primary sludge; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; energy efficiency; experimental study; feeding; methane; microbiology; operations technology; optimization; reaction rate; temperature effect; wastewater treatment plant; yield response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032637746

However, if it is uneconomical or not feasible to augment a sufficient capacity, the demand might exceed the available capacity. This mandates the system operator to shed the load in order to maintain security of the system. With the advent of advanced smart metering infrastructure, communication between system operator and end-use customers makes it possible to adjust/curtail/shift the demand with respect to the state of the system. The response of the demand commonly termed as demand response (DR) can be attained either by incentive-based or price-based. With the help of DR, the renewable energy generation capacity can be increased by tuning the demand to match the variable and unpredictable power from renewable generation. It can also bring other benefits such as peak shaving, hosting capacity enhancement, and generation cost reduction. Furthermore, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electric water heater can also be used as distributed storage resources to contribute to ancillary services, such as frequency/voltage regulation, peak-shaving power or help to integrate fluctuating renewable resources. All these DR modes of operation need conventional regulatory frameworks and market design for capitalizing the available resources. Therefore, the objective of the study is to discuss the DR classification and their control strategies, DR role in microgrids and integration of renewable energy resources.

Hydropower regulation in many northern rivers increase winter stream flow and temperatures, and reduce ice formation and surface ice cover. From a background review of knowledge about e.g. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) winter survival strategies, we explore responses to hydropower impacts as a basis for adaptive management, mitigating strategies, and future research. Winter intensity and duration, hydrologic conditions and channel characteristics drive complex ice processes which become more complex and pervasive in smaller, high-gradient streams. Stream ice formation may be divided into the dynamic period ‘freeze-up’ in early winter with sub-surface ice, more stable ‘mid-winter’ with surface ice, and the ecologically challenging ‘ice break-up’ in winter-spring with potential mechanical ice runs and scouring. The characteristics of periods vary depending on climate and hydropower regulation. In reaches downstream of power-plant outlets water temperature may increase and reduce surface ice formation. The mid-winter period destabilize or become absent. In bypass reaches flows decrease and facilitate freezing and ice production. Knowledge about longitudinal water temperature changes is limited. Hydro-peaked systems may aggravate high-low flow effects. A basic winter survival strategy in salmon and trout is energy storage, but also reduced metabolism, tolerance and starvation effected by quiescence. Energy storage may depend on local conditions, but there is little indication of adaptation to local thermal climates. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity is important. The main behavioural strategy is risk-reducing sheltering in the substratum or deep areas, and nocturnal activity. Local movements between daytime refuges and nighttime slow-current activity areas are usually limited to meters. Larger fish may move more and aggregate in restricted suitable deep-slow refuge habitats such as pools and deep glides. Fish cope with ordinary thermal ice phenomena, and do not appear to become trapped in ice. Surface ice may reduce fish metabolism, but other factors, e.g. availability of substrate shelter, may override this effect. Mechanical ice break-ups and less surface ice may reduce survival. An adaptive mitigating strategy may be higher regulated flows in winter which increase rearing and/or resting habitat and survival, but studies are few and knowledge is limited. However, higher regulated flows also affect temperature regime. Low flows increase ice formation, reduce and fragment available habitat, and may reduce egg and fish survival. Influx of ground water may mitigate these impacts, as will stabilize minimum flows. Sudden drops in regulated water discharge should be avoided. Fish may strand, in particular at low temperatures in the daytime when fish are less mobile and seek shelter. The challenging winter season is understudied, and important management considerations and future research areas for better adaptive management are suggested. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Regulation impacts; Salmon; Streams; Trout; Winter ecology","adaptation; adaptive management; bypass; discharge; habitat availability; habitat type; ice cover; metabolism; nocturnal activity; phenotypic plasticity; salmonid; seasonal variation; stream; streamflow; survival; water temperature; winter; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031750016

Various carbon capture technologies can be applied to reduce the CO2 emissions from the polluting process industries. This paper is presenting, through various illustrative coal-based examples, the carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies used to reduce the carbon footprint of the overall processes. The evaluations were focused on the conceptual design and the technical &amp; environmental assessment of CCUS technologies with potential applications in power generation, iron &amp; steel, cement and chemicals (including captured CO2 utilisation for production of various chemicals e.g. methanol, substitute natural gas, synthetic fuel). Two reactive gas-liquid and gas-solid methods were evaluated through illustrative examples. The first evaluated CO2 capture option is based on gas-liquid absorption using chemical solvents (alkanolamines). The second capture option is based on calcium looping system. The carbon capture rate is set to 90%. Various coal-based processes were considered as illustrative examples e.g. combustion, gasification, cement production, integrated steel mill, coal to chemicals etc. The proposed conceptual designs were simulated; the mass &amp; energy balances as well as the thermal integration tools were used to quantify the key technical and environmental performance indicators. The assessments show that CCUS technologies have significant advantages in reducing the environmental impact of energy-intensive industrial applications and simultaneously to produce useful products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Calcium looping; Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies; Energy-intensive industrial applications; Gas-liquid absorption; Poly-generation systems","Alkanolamines; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Cements; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal storage; Conceptual design; Energy conversion; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas absorption; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Indicators (chemical); Industrial emissions; Liquids; Natural gas substitutes; Natural gasoline plants; Synthetic fuels; Calcium looping; Energy conversion systems; Environmental assessment; Environmental performance indicators; Gas liquid absorption; Integrated steel mills; Poly-generation; Substitute natural gas; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030538028

The pore texture of these N-doped CXs ranged from micro-mesoporous to micro-macroporous depending on the initial pH of the precursors solution. For different pH values, while the specific surface area varied slightly from 500 to 600 m2 g−1, the total void volume changed from 0.6 to 1.6 cm3 g−1. Furthermore, N-doped CXs showed a wide interval of average pore diameters ranging from 19 to 1200 nm. The nitrogen amount in N-doped CXs varied from 4 to 11 wt. % and XPS analysis showed that nitrogen was mainly incorporated into the carbon network as pyridine or quaternary nitrogen groups. These results indicate that this doping approach is suitable to tune the pore texture, pore size and chemical composition by adjusting the initial pH value or the amount of nitrogen precursor.

Many publications addressing the issue thus far, propose changes of consumer behaviour as the solution to fighting food waste. This article explores the possible contribution of technology, in particular, improvements in storage conditions in household refrigerators towards combating food waste. An optimized refrigerator design better serving its purpose of food preservation can theoretically reduce food waste due to quality loss and spoilage. In the current market, the functionality of refrigeration appliances is only indirectly determined by the quality of food preservation. Actual demand is driven by habits, available physical space, perception of size needed, price and –identified as a main driver in several market surveys– the EU's energy label rating. As a result, 85% of consumers choose an appliance that, apart from the freezer compartment, only has one compartment for perishable fresh food (typically at 4 °C). This article argues that the 4 °C is a compromise: The real optimal preservation temperature, depending on the type and condition of the fresh food products, lies between −1 °C and +17 °C. At those optimal temperatures the ‘shelf life’ can be increased by a factor of two to three and thus the chance of food spoilage can be significantly reduced. Subsequently, the article tries to quantify the EU-wide potential impact of optimised household refrigeration, as much as current data availability allows. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Food preservation; Food storage; Food waste; Refrigeration; Resource efficiency; Sustainability","Commerce; Digital storage; Food microbiology; Food preservation; Food products; Food storage; Labels; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Sustainable development; Food spoilage; Food waste; Household refrigerators; Market surveys; Optimal temperature; Potential impacts; Resource efficiencies; Storage condition; Spoilage; European Union; food waste; household survey; optimization; storage; sustainability; waste technology; Article; feeding behavior; food intake; food preservation; food quality; food spoilage; food storage; food waste; household; human; market; refrigeration; shelf life; temperature; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030467935

When operating in remote locations, the nodes of wireless sensor networks are typically power supplied by an energy production and management system, comprising low-power renewable energy sources, a power electronic converter, and a battery-based energy storage unit. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for optimally designing the energy production and processing system of a wireless sensor network node simultaneously at both the renewable power-supply system level and the power converter circuit level, through a unified design process. The impact of the objective function type on the power-supply design is also investigated in this paper. Design optimization and experimental results are presented, which demonstrate that the optimized power-supply structures derived by applying the proposed optimization technique exhibit lower cost of generated energy compared to partially optimized or totally nonoptimized structures and by that reduce the cost of the overall wireless sensor network node. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","DC-DC power conversion; Genetic algorithms (GAs); Renewable energy sources (RES); Sizing optimization; Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Genetic algorithms; Inductance; Low power electronics; Natural resources; Optimization; Power converters; Power supply circuits; Renewable energy resources; Sensor nodes; Solar cells; Static random access storage; Timing circuits; Dc-dc power conversion; MOS-FET; Power supply; Renewable energy source; Sizing optimization; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030309100

Various alternatives have been proposed in literature, some of which require the use of high-energy treatments to facilitate their redispersion after drying, while others may be inadequate when applied to food and pharmaceutical applications. The present work examines a new approach that involves using poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a capping agent to redisperse CNFs. Different CNF to PVA ratios were used, and redispersed samples were analyzed in terms of their morphological, physicochemical and rheological properties to assess changes occurring during processing.

This means a plethora of objects (e.g. smart cameras, wearables, environmental sensors, home appliances, and vehicles) are ‘connected’ and generating massive amounts of data. The collection, integration, processing and analytics of these data enable the realisation of smart cities, infrastructures and services for enhancing the quality of life of humans. Nowadays, existing IoT architectures are highly centralised and heavily rely on transferring data processing, analytics, and decision-making processes to cloud solutions. This approach of managing and processing data at the cloud may lead to inefficiencies in terms of latency, network traffic management, computational processing, and power consumption. Furthermore, in many applications, such as health monitoring and emergency response services, which require low latency, delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. The idea of allowing data processing closer to where data is generated, with techniques such as data fusion, trending of data, and some decision making, can help reduce the amount of data sent to the cloud, reducing network traffic, bandwidth and energy consumption. Also, a more agile response, closer to real-time, will be achieved, which is necessary in applications such as smart health, security and traffic control for smart cities. Therefore, this chapter presents a review of the more developed paradigms aimed to bring computational, storage and control capabilities closer to where data is generated in the IoT: fog and edge computing, contrasted with the cloud computing paradigm. Also an overview of some practical use cases is presented to exemplify each of these paradigms and their main differences. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Cloud computing; Distributed processing; Edge computing; Fog computing; Internet of things",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030111497

Dispatch models are applied to derive hourly prices for the market region of Austria and Germany for increasing installed capacities of photovoltaic. These prices are used to calculate potential revenues for storage systems. Results show that the effect of increased feed in from photovoltaic depends on the penetration level. For low shares of photovoltaic in total electricity generation decreasing revenues and price variances are observed because of high correlations between demand peaks and solar radiation. The minimum of revenues for storage plants is reached at around 5% PV penetration level. For higher shares revenues start to increase significantly and are expected to be higher than initial revenues for penetration levels >10%. Considering current shares of photovoltaic in Germany and Austria (year 2016) it is estimated that the effect of photovoltaic on price variance is around the observed minimum and price spreads can be expected to rise again with higher PV penetration. With respect to investment incentives results show that although storage options can support the integration of high shares of intermittent renewables, short term needs and consequently electricity price signals might be low. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity prices; Integration of renewables; Photovoltaic; Storage plants","Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Solar power generation; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Installed capacity; Integration of renewables; Intermittent renewables; Investment incentives; Photovoltaic; Storage plants; Photovoltaic effects; correlation; electricity generation; energy market; investment incentive; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar radiation; Austria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029594676

Moreover, some challenges can follow the transition from a traditional grid into a smart grid. In this context, “public attitude” and “public acceptance” are major components to make more radical scenarios about the feasible implementation of smart grid technologies and successful integration of renewable energy sources. This paper presents unique survey results of public attitudes towards smart grids, smart meters, renewable energy and environment in Qatar using a representative panel from Qatar University community. It contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of electricity consumers’ perception and behavior about the possible deployment of smart grid applications. It also aims to create data about public attitudes to inform policy makers, the business community and other stakeholders for decision-making by introducing institutional and regulatory changes, and modifying the relationship between consumers, the government and utilities. The main conclusions can be used as a basis for sustainable energy planning, and awareness campaigns formulation in order to enhance public acceptance regarding renewable energy projects and smart grid technologies. However, the results are a first attempt to elicit public views and will need to be extended to the larger community in Qatar and repeated at regular basis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Public acceptance; Renewable energy sources; Smart grid technologies; Survey","Carbon; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Surveying; Surveys; Electricity consumers; Integration of renewable energies; Public acceptance; Renewable energy projects; Renewable energy source; Smart grid applications; Smart Grid technologies; Sustainable energy planning; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029485840

In this study a passivity based approach is shown considering that the decoupling law improves some results found in literature in which only a state feedback decoupling law is implemented. The passivity based decoupling law is obtained by selecting an appropriate storage function and then the α and β functions for the passivity based controller are obtained to yield the optimal system performance so the decoupled system response is similar to the coupled system. One of the advantages of the passivity based decoupling is the energy considerations in the design of the decoupling law, so this approach provides an efficient strategy to be implemented in the design of different kinds of controllers where the difference of the response between the decoupled and coupled Lagrangian system is not significant. The Lagrangian system studied in this work is highly coupled considering that most of the mechanical systems and robots have a strong coupling due to the kinematic and dynamic model obtained by the Euler-Lagrange formulation. It is proved by experiments that the theoretical results shown in this study provide optimal results. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Decoupling; Lagrangian systems; Passivity based control",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029484861

However, transportation and storage of wastes to WWTP may be the bottleneck for the successful implementation of this technology. In case of wet wastes and wastewater it is possible to reduce their volume and as a result the transportation and storage cost by using a drying process. During this study, the optimization of biogas production from sewage sludge (SS) was attempted by co-digesting with a dried mixture of food waste, cheese whey and olive mill wastewater (FCO). A series of laboratory experiments were performed in continuously-operating reactors at 37 °C, fed with thermal dried mixtures of FCO at concentrations of 3%, 5% and 7%. The overall process was designed with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 days. FCO addition can boost biogas yields if the mixture exceeds 3% (v/v) concentration in the feed. Any further increase of 5% FCO causes a small increase in biogas production. The reactor treating the sewage sludge produced 287 ml CH4/Lreactor/d before the addition of FCO and 815 ml CH4/Lreactor/d (5% v/v in the feed). The extra FCO-COD added (7% FCO v/v) to the feed did not have a negative effect on reactor performance, but seemed to have the same results. In all cases, the estimated biodegradability of mixtures was over 80%, while the VS removal was 22% for the maximum biomethane production (5% v/v). Moreover, co-digestion improved biogas production by 1.2–2.7 times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic co-digestion; Cheese whey; Food waste; Olive mill wastewater; Pre-treatment","Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradability; Biogas; Mixtures; Sewage sludge; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic co-digestion; Cheese whey; Food waste; Olive mill wastewaters; Pre-Treatment; Sludge digestion; biogas; methane; biofuel; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; biogas; food; gas production; sewage; sludge; solid waste; wastewater treatment plant; anaerobic digestion; Article; biodegradability; cheese; cheese whey; concentration (parameters); controlled study; food waste; hydraulic retention time; limit of quantitation; olive mill wastewater; priority journal; process optimization; retention time; sludge; waste water; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; cheese; olive tree; sewage; whey; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Cheese; Methane; Olea; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Whey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028331869

The heat rejected by the thermoelectric generator is utilized to heat the water in the collector. This system consists of two concentric cylinders, thermoelectric generator, two mirrors and heat exchanger. The main concept of this system is to provide electric power and self-storage of hot water without the need for any connecting pipe or storage tank of useful hot water. A prototype is constructed and a steady-state mathematical model of the collector is presented in details to describe the system thermal behavior and has been simulated using Microsoft office and goal seek tool to find the temperature of the thermoelectric generator.

Changes in viscoelastic properties were studied as a function of radiation dose and temperature using the dynamic mechanical analysis in the temperature range from 10 to 240 °C at frequency of 0.5 Hz. The samples of material under the investigation were irradiated in the presence of air, at room temperature, using the 5 meV electron beam in the dose range from 50 to 300 kGy, with the maximum beam power of 50 W. The experimental results have shown that an increase in the radiation dose leads to an increase in the storage modulus and a corresponding decrease in the damping factor. With increasing radiation dose, the curing process of tested rubber blend begins and ends at lower temperatures, with a higher initial and final storage modulus and a lower initial damping factor, whereas the radiation dose has almost no impact on the final value of damping factor. The unified regression model describing analytically the dependence of all monitored properties of tested rubber blend on radiation dose with a high level of reliability was found as well using the multi-parametric fitting technique by a trust region algorithm of a nonlinear least-squares method. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Activation energy; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Relaxation transitions; Thermoplastic polyurethane",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024476603

This article assesses the production cost of electrofuels through: (i) a literature review, focusing on which steps that have the largest impact as well as the greatest uncertainty; (ii) a more comprehensive review, including the costs and efficiencies for the separate production steps, and (iii) calculations to compare the production costs of the different fuel options in a harmonized way, including a sensitivity analysis of the parameters with the greatest impact on the total electrofuel production cost. The assessment covers: methane, methanol, dimethyl ether, diesel, and gasoline. The literature review showed large differences among the studies and a broad range of production cost estimates (10–3500 €2015/MWhfuel), which is first and foremost as a result of how authors have handled technology matureness, installation costs, and external factors. Our calculations result in productions costs in the range of 200–280 €2015/MWhfuel in 2015 and 160–210 €2015/MWhfuel in 2030 using base cost assumptions from the literature review. Compared to biofuels, these estimates are in the upper range or above. Our results also show that the choice of energy carrier is not as critical for the electrofuels production cost as technological choices and external factors. Instead the two most important factors affecting the production cost of all electrofuels are the capital cost of the electrolyser and the electricity price, i.e., the hydrogen production cost. The capacity factor of the unit and the life span of the electrolyser are also important parameters affecting that production cost. In order to determine if electrofuels are a cost-effective future transport fuel relative to alternatives other than biofuels, the costs for distribution, propulsion, and storage systems need to be considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cost assessment; Electrofuels; Electrolysers; Fuel synthesis; Power-to-gas; Synthetic fuels","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Cost estimating; Costs; Fuel storage; Fuels; Hydrogen production; Produced Water; Sensitivity analysis; Synthetic fuels; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon-based fuels; Cost assessment; Electricity prices; Electrofuels; Electrolysers; Hydrogen production costs; Installation costs; Literature reviews; Cost benefit analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020863777
