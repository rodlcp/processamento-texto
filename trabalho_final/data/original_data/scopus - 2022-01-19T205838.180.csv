Due to such complex nature of multiple supplies and demands, the previously developed control strategies were not suitable, and it is a challenge to develop an appropriate control strategy for the SOFC-GT CCHP system. Therefore, a new approach, called multi-supply-multi-demand (MSMD) control strategy, is proposed in this paper. The MSMD control includes two core algorithms: rolling optimization (RO) and feedback correction (FC). RO is used to determine the operation of energy supply equipment units based on the forecasting weather and loading information of the next 24 h. FC is applied for continual mitigation in case any difference between the actual and predicted energy demands. In the SOFC-GT CCHP system with energy storages for building application, the effectiveness of the MSMD control strategy was tested. It was found that RO could determine the operating schedules of the related equipment units at lower primary energy consumption than the conventional mean, while FC could effectively rectify the prediction errors incurred from the real-time loading conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Combined cooling; Feedback correction; Heating and power; Multi-supply-multi-demand; Rolling optimization; Solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine","Combustion; Cooling; Energy utilization; Equipment; Feedback; Fuel cells; Gas turbines; Heating; Weather forecasting; Combined cooling; Feed-back correction; Heating and power; Multi-supply-multi-demand; Rolling optimization; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035120630

At the same time, they can be considered not only challenges but also opportunities in terms of land use and energy management. Middle-mountain water reservoirs could be also used as new elements of a sustainable and flexible energy system. However, until now – as far as the authors know – no research examined the possibility of pumped hydroelectric energy storage for areas with the above-mentioned characteristics. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap with developing an adaptable, geographical information system-based methodology and implement it in a study area where the previously mentioned conditions are highly observable. In the course of the work, three different model versions were mapped. With applying the methodology in a sample area covering 1324 km2, the analysis leads to the conclusion that at least 1590 MWh and at most 1700 MWh worth of electricity could be stored theoretically in the total of 15 upper reservoirs. The average reservoir surface could be 7.85 ha, which is a rather low value considering existing pumped storage practices, which would greatly facilitate integrating the new bodies of water into the landscape and natural ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","GIS; Intermittent energy sources; Middle-mountain areas; Small-scale pumped-hydro energy storage; Storage potential; Surface recultivation","Electric energy storage; Land use; Landforms; Reservoirs (water); Intermittent energy source; Middle mountains; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Recultivation; Storage potential; Geographic information systems; electricity generation; energy resource; GIS; hydroelectric power; land use change; mining; mountain region; reservoir; storage; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034655834

Work in Finland has resulted in what is referred to as “the ÅA route”, involving stepwise carbonation of serpentinite rock. Magnesium is extracted and converted into magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), which is carbonated in a pressurised fluidised bed (PFB) reactor at elevated pressure and temperature. The combined operation of a water-shift reaction and carbonation of Mg(OH)2 is addressed in this paper for (coal) gasification syngas and, in more detail, blast furnace top gas. Water produced during the carbonation step can drive the water-gas shift reaction. HSC and Aspen Plus are used for thermodynamic equilibrium product gas and solid products composition analysis. Optimal process conditions appear to be 400–450 °C, at a pressure of 40 bar or higher, for acceptable degrees of conversion. This is partly the result of the water-gas shift reaction equilibrium moving to the CO side at higher temperatures, besides increased calcination of Mg(OH)2 to much less reactive MgO. An energy requirement assessment for blast furnace top gas processing shows that power input requirements may be more than compensated for by waste heat. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 sequestration; Magnesium silicate; Mineralisation; Water-gas shift reaction","Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical shift; Fluidized beds; Gases; Magnesia; Magnesite; Mineralogy; Oxide minerals; Silicate minerals; Waste heat; CO2 sequestration; Composition analysis; Magnesium silicates; Mineral sequestration; Mineralisation; Thermodynamic equilibria; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Water shift reaction; Water gas shift; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate rock; chemical reaction; high temperature; mineralization; pressure effect; serpentine; temperature effect; underground storage; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018329529

This study also creates a strategy that can maximise the use of renewable energy, e.g. photovoltaic, the wind turbine with battery storage and minimise the utilisation of the utility grid for electricity usage in the industry. This is devised by modelling a discrete state-space model of the hybrid power system for a given industry application. The system design is implemented within a real-time electricity pricing environment that is integrated with renewable energy to optimally meet the demand according to a specific performance of the consumer. The emphasis of this approach is on its capacity to supply optimal power to the demand side by selecting the appropriate source; and its robustness against uncertainties. The results show that MPC design for hybrid power system not only optimises the energy flow but also improves the overall process of energy management. It was also observed that the optimal solution minimises the delay cost of energy demand from the utility grid according to a given reference from the consumer for the specified tuning parameter values of the performance index. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Smart power grids; State space methods; Wind turbines; Discrete state space; Electricity pricing; Hybrid power systems; Industry applications; Performance indices; Renewable energies; Use of renewable energies; Wind-battery systems; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037693414

Most research has aimed at developing scalable, environmentally friendly and cheap procedures to produce defect-free graphene that can be used in a variety of applications such as mechanical properties enhancement and energy storage. Top-down graphene production approaches (from graphite) in liquid, which include high-shear mixing and sonication, were recently scaled up. Nevertheless, their production yields have remained low (<5%) due to the need for stabilization of the graphene in dispersion (supernatant), while the precipitate has usually not been considered as graphene product. In this study, we focus on the liquid-based approach of sonication, from lab to industrial scale, in an attempt to improve the graphene yield. Unlike previous studies, we explore and characterize the product both in the supernatant and in the precipitate. We found that above a certain critical energy all graphite flakes were exfoliated into graphene sheets in an exfoliation-fragmentation mechanism described by a thermogravimetric signature. Remarkably, we discovered that other top-down approaches, namely, shear mixing and ball milling, have similar thermogravimetric signatures, indicating not only that they proceed by the same mechanism but also that they are capable of the same high yield, findings that fundamentally challenge existing knowledge about liquid-based methods of graphene production. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Ball milling; Graphite; Liquids; Mixing; Fragmentation mechanism; High-shear mixing; Industrial scale; Mechanical properties enhancements; Production approach; Production yield; Thermo-gravimetric; Top down approaches; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038215209

Generally, the use of strong security mechanisms demand intensive use of limited resource, particularly memory storage and energy to provide defense services against malicious attacks. Risks detection in WSNs rely upon the behavior of every single sensor node in the system, and in the case of abnormal node behavior, the system protects the travelling packets on the network via a high level of security mechanisms such as a trusted key management algorithm. In this paper, we compare existing schemes and present a new hybrid security scheme suitable for maritime coastal environment–based WSNs. This scheme tackles the issues of memory storage of encryption keys based on a trusted node configuration, called a leader node, which works as a trusted third party for both the node joining and the node revoke processes.

Current research describes the formation of oil-in-water (O/W) diazinon nanoemulsions using synthetic and natural additives by adopting a high-energy (ultrasound) emulsification method. The diazinon nanoemulsions were spontaneously formed by adding dropwise a mixture of diazinon, solvent and co-solvent in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant (tween or lecithin) with continuous stirring. The nanoemulsions were then formed by ultra-sonication. The effects of three levels of active ingredient, solvent, co-solvent, surfactant, sonication time and sonication cycle and power were performed by Minitab software to design the experiment. Effects of these factors on droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), viscosity and pH of nanoemulsions were investigated. The results of the modeling showed that the experimental data could be adequately adapted in a second-order polynomial model with a multiple regression coefficient r2 of 0.821 for the prediction of particle size, PDI and viscosity. The long-term and thermodynamic stability of the prepared nanoemulsions were tested. The droplet size and morphology of the nanoemulsions were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On this basis, a water-insoluble insecticide diazinon was incorporated into 26 optimized nanoemulsion systems to demonstrate potential applications in pest control. The results of DLS and TEM measurements showed that most of prepared nanoemulsions had an almost monodisperse droplet size distribution (PDI &lt; 200 nm). Incorporation of diazinon had no significant effect on the size and stability of the nanoemulsions and the formulated nanoemulsion remained stable after four months of storage. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Diazinon; droplet size; modeling; oil in water; pesticide nanoemulsion; ultrasonic emulsification","Digital storage; Drops; Dynamic light scattering; Emulsification; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Light scattering; Models; Particle size; Polydispersity; Solutions; Solvents; Surface active agents; Thermodynamic stability; Transmission electron microscopy; Viscosity; Diazinon; Droplet sizes; Nanoemulsion; Oil-in-water; Ultrasonic emulsification; Sonication; additive; aqueous solution; diazinon; droplet; emulsion; experimental study; functional role; oil spill; optimization; performance assessment; solvent; surfactant; thermodynamics; ultrasonics; viscosity; dimpylate; nanocomposite; phosphatidylcholine; solvent; surfactant; water; chemical model; chemistry; emulsion; particle size; pH; photon correlation spectroscopy; thermodynamics; transmission electron microscopy; ultrasound; Diazinon; Dynamic Light Scattering; Emulsions; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lecithins; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Models, Chemical; Nanocomposites; Particle Size; Solvents; Sonication; Surface-Active Agents; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033381415

The purpose of the study was to establish optimum operating conditions for the recovery of valuable products, e.g., sulfur and precipitated calcium carbonate, from waste gypsum, hence, offer an attractive solution to the gypsum waste problem. The paper presents results on thermal studies of waste gypsum in a tube furnace and its validation using the Mintek Pyrosim model. Gypsum was homogeneously mixed with coal and the reduction experiments conducted. The following findings were made: (i) reduction of waste gypsum is an endothermic reaction since, ΔH values were greater than 0 (ΔH > 0) when the reduction temperature was increased from 25 to 1200°C, (ii) energy requirement is dependent on temperature and gypsum to coal ratio. Gypsum to calcium sulfide conversion of 83.5 and 83.8% was obtained at the optimum temperature range of 1100–1200°C and gypsum to calcium sulfide conversion of 85.4% was obtained at the optimum coal to gypsum mole ratio of 2.1:1, (iii) excess coal gave a lower conversion, and (iv) the predicted data using Mintek Pyrosim were found to be similar to the experimental data. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Calcium sulfide; coal; gypsum; Pyrosim Mintek","Calcium carbonate; Coal; Desalination; Digital storage; Groundwater; Ion exchange; Lime; Sulfur compounds; Calcium sulfide; Endothermic reactions; Engineering communications; Ion exchange process; Optimum operating conditions; Precipitated calcium carbonate; Pyrosim Mintek; Reduction temperatures; Gypsum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032027956

What are the missing gaps for fossil fuel in order to obtain clean fuels, and how can those gaps identify and resolve the environmental issue by using fossil fuel as an energy source? Recent Findings: The findings indicate that fossil fuel will remain the major source of energy and transportation fuels, which can be effectively refined using catalytic refining processes along with the CO2 capturing and storage techniques in order to reduce global warming. Summary: Sustainable development refers to basic information about the social, economic, and environment aspects of human activity. Among the main driving elements of sustainability are the progress made in technology and the utilization of energy resources. Worldwide, the use of renewable energy sources may increase but has moderate progress. Thus, the fossil fuels are playing a vital role in the energy world but require efficient refining processes to produce high-quality clean fuels for transportation as well as energy production. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Economic sustainability; Fossil fuel; Greenhouse gas; Renewable energy; Social responsibility; Sustainable energy","Fuel storage; Global warming; Refining; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Energy productions; Environmental issues; Human development index; Middle East and North Africa; Oil and natural gas; Source of energy; Storage technique; Use of renewable energies; Fossil fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054682064

It can be deduced that the octahedral site has higher energetic stability absorption for the hydrogen atoms compared to the bridge and tetrahedral sites in the TiCo and TiNi alloys. The absorption energy at octahedral site is found to be 2.37eV for TiCo and 2.32eV for TiNi. Hydrogen absorption expands and brittles the host alloy. Hydrogen storage in more than one site in the host alloy is found to be energetically stable and can be formed.

A promising solution could be related to the use of aluminum or its alloys to reduce water to form hydrogen when needed. The aluminum–water reaction is thermodynamically favorable, but does not proceed due to the passivation of the aluminum surface by the protective aluminum oxide layer, which prevents water molecules from coming into direct contact with metal particles. Herein, the surface of aluminum particles was modified by using a low-temperature plasma-activation approach. Such a modification induces a hydrophilicity effect and the modified aluminum powder sinks instantly in water, whereas unmodified powder floats on the top of the water. The plasma-based activation technology is also discussed in detail. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by using SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and XRD. BET surface area analyses were also performed. The elemental composition on the nanoscale level and formation of polar groups were experimentally investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Amounts of oxygen/hydrogen were measured by using the inert-gas fusion method. Tests show that hydrogen production starts after 1 min of aluminum powder immersion into slightly alkaline water and continues for up to 20 min.

A series of numerical modelling scenarios was used to assess the effect of NCG (non-condensable gases) reinjection on energy recovery, understand permanent trapping, and forecast potential NCG breakthrough into production wells. Although the gas species from geothermal systems typically have moderate solubility in water, formation of gas phases at lower pressures and/or the shallow subsurface requires careful consideration of the injection rate and composition of NCG. Possible fluid paths and distribution of gas components were investigated to estimate the NCG storage capability of a reservoir, and evaluate the potential risk of the reinjected NCG growing into fingers that may lead to an early breakthrough or potential leakage to the ground surface. Modified versions of benchmark geothermal reinjection models were constructed with initial conditions of a liquid-dominated geothermal system.

However, the large number of spheres used in the storage applications pushes the researchers to neglecting the natural convection effect inside spheres. Consequently, they cannot observe the real thermal interaction effect between spheres. The objective of this work is to carry out a computational study on the thermal behavior of two adjacent different PCMs inside aluminum spherical capsules and taking into account the natural convection effect inside the spheres. Water is used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) at constant inlet temperature. The study shows that for the HTF inlet velocity lower than 10-5m/s, the thermal interaction between two adjacent different PCMs cannot be neglected. However, the thermal interaction appears more clearly in the discharging mode. The thermal interaction can accelerate the discharging of one of the PCMs by reducing the discharging of the other one. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adjacent spherical capsules; charging; different phase change materials; discharging; Thermal behavior; thermal interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033458104

Metal-organic framework (MOF) MOFs has recently been developed with the primary objective of CO2 capture from flue gases with minimum energy penalties. MIL-101(Cr) holds the supreme importance amongst such types of MOFs owing to its extraordinary thermal and hydro stability. In this study, a novel composite composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) incorporated in a MIL-101(Cr) framework has been synthesized using a molecular-level mixing process in order to enhance the thermal properties of the base framework as well as augment the CO2 adsorption capacity and separation. The synthesized and activated MWCNT/MIL-101(Cr) composites have been characterized for degree of crystallinity, microstructure, thermal stability, and CO2 and N2 equilibrium adsorption capacity. Actual dynamic behavior of adsorption breakthrough tests have been conducted under ambient conditions (297 K and 101.325 kPa) to address the real adsorptive behavior and to quantify the level of the CO2 adsorption capacity and breakpoint enhancements. Results demonstrate that a substantial improvement in the CO2 adsorption capacity and breakpoint over pristine MIL-101(Cr) is achievable with the 2 wt% MWCNT/MIL-101(Cr) composite with measured optimal enhancements of about 35.94% and 32.11%, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption; Breakthrough; Capture; Carbon; Characterization; MIL-101(Cr); MWCNT","Adsorption; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Chromium compounds; Crystalline materials; Global warming; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Yarn; Adsorption breakthroughs; Breakthrough; Capture; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Degree of crystallinity; Equilibrium adsorption capacity; MIL-101(Cr); MWCNT; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032859192

Existing indicators that assess the performance of CO2 utilization options often provide an incomplete perspective and are unsuitable to compare different utilization options with different functionality (e.g. plastics and fuels). This study introduces a new performance indicator for CO2 utilization options: Specific Primary Energy Consumption per unit of Fossil feedstock Replaced (SPECFER). This indicator, expressed in MJ/MJ, provides a proxy for the energy efficiency of which CO2 conversion options can replace fossil feedstock required in conventional processes. Three CO2 utilization case studies (CO2 based methanol, polyols and dimethyl ether) are used to show the application and effectiveness of the SPECFER indicator. Among the case studies, only CO2 conversion into polyol appears particularly efficient (SPECFER of 0.05 MJ/MJ), while the other options are not (SPECFER of &gt; 1 MJ/MJ). The paper shows that the SPECFER indicator adds key insights compared to conventional indicators to the effectiveness of CO2 utilization options and is a promising indicator complementary to CO2 emissions reduction or life cycle greenhouse gas reduction potential. The SPECFER thus improves the understanding of the performance of CO2 utilization and enables the possibility to distinctly compare different CO2 converting utilization technologies.","CO2 utilisation; Comparative assessment; Energy performance; Indicator development","Alcohols; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedstocks; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; CO2 utilisation; Comparative assessment; Energy performance; Greenhouse gas abatements; Greenhouse gas reductions; Indicator development; Performance indicators; Primary energy consumption; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032858018

The customers connected to the power distribution network suffer from these perturbations, to solve this problem custom power device is used which is called dynamic voltage restorer. This paper describes DVR principle and voltage restoration which will be connected to the 15 KV real autonomous networks in small village of south Algeria. Moreover, optimal energy capacity for the proposed devices based on Meta heuristic methods is presented. The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) has newly established to protect the industrial facilities from voltage sags and other voltage disturbances. The compensation ability of DVR depends primarily on the maximum voltage injection aptitude and the amount of stored available within the restorer. A detailed procedure to design the optimal system is presented by using SOS algorithm based Advancement compensation (PAC) policy in order to improve the voltage property of the device. The planed approach employs Symbiotic Organism Search technique to search for optimal value of phase advancement angle equivalent to minimum power injection from the energy storage element such as a capacitor or battery and its results have been compared to the conventional DVR techniques. According to the achieved results and detailed analysis, The corresponding values of optimized energy are 13,278 W-h, 20.847 W-h and optimums phase advanced angles found 131.762°, 115.536° for 17% and 40% voltage sag happened through electrical distribution network.

This enquiry is crucial for South Africa which has experienced significant strain in meeting its domestic energy demand. This has occurred alongside increases in international tourists, adding to the pressure on already strained resources. This paper tests hypotheses on drivers of energy consumption in hotels using a novel panel dataset which presents daily consumption data for 22 hotels across South Africa. Findings from various specifications of the Dynamic Random Effects Model suggest that the number of rooms in a hotel, the services and facilities offered, and climatic conditions are strong drivers of consumption. While the role of occupancy could not be robustly ascertained due to severe data limitations, findings indicate that price regulation plays a significant role in curtailing electricity consumption, even in high-end hotels. Results further suggest that in the design of guidelines for energy efficiency in South African hotels, the energy consumption of the facilities and services offered should be the first point of call, and the strenuous impact of extreme weather conditions on energy consumption needs to be factored in at the phase of building design and construction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic random effects; Energy consumption; Hotels; Panel data; Tourism","Architectural design; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Random processes; Statistical tests; Electricity-consumption; Energy consumption in hotels; Extreme weather conditions; Panel data; Panel data analysis; Random effects; Random effects model; Tourism; Hotels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030713760

An experimental study was carried out using two identical test cavities submitted to Casablanca weather. Thermal performance such as the roof surface temperatures and heat flux densities, through the envelope, have been studied. The results indicated that, compared with reference room (without PCM), the thermal storage allows solar radiation to be stored and released up to 6-7 h after solar irradiation; this has effects on both the reduction of daily temperature swings (up to 2 °C) and heat flux (more than 88%).

An $LC$-type series resonant DAB converter based on a switch-controlled-inductor (SCI) is proposed to mitigate the loss arising from hard switching under wide-range variations in output voltage and current. Zero-voltage switching is achieved at the primary side (high voltage), while at the secondary side (low voltage), zero-current switching is preferred to reduce excessive ringing due to circulating current and switching loss. In order to achieve reduced conduction loss, a nominal operating point is chosen where the root-mean-square resonant tank current is the minimum. To validate the proposed topology and modulation scheme, an $LC$-type series resonant DAB converter based on SCI operating at 100 kHz is designed to interface a 400-V dc bus to a supercapacitor-based energy storage. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology for charging/discharging a supercapacitor with an output voltage variation of between 10 and 48 V and a maximum rated power of 480 W.

The proposed PC&EM technique provides improved cost effectiveness and exploitation of the ERS capability, by adjusting the elevator power requirements with the ERS power capability through cabin speed regulation within predefined limits. The proposed control system can be easily installed without requiring modifications in the elevator motor drive, and thus, it can be easily applied to any existing elevator applications. Also, an experimental procedure is proposed in order to online determine and periodically fine-tune the parameters of the suggested PC&EM controller.

The objective of this study was to examine if stem material could be used to establish field miscanthus crops. Field trials were established to investigate the optimum sowing time for miscanthus stem segments. In two planting seasons, stem segments of miscanthus were cut in September, October or March and either planted immediately or placed in cold storage. These stem segments of 1.8 m length were planted horizontally underneath the ground at a depth of 100 mm. In a separate set of experiments conducted under control conditions, stem segments were harvested each month and placed in a growth cabinet for sixty days. Basal stem pieces of 650 mm length were harvested from a rhizome crop established in 1994 and 2010 and these stems were either stripped of leaves or left with leaves attached to the stem. The growth cabinet experiments showed that the age of the mother crop or leaf removal had no effect on shoot or root formation but that both root and shoot formation were at a maximum in September and decreased thereafter. Establishment rates, average height, stem numbers and biomass yield in the field trials was maximised through a September harvest and planting date in both trial years (P < 0.0001). Treatments which were stored exhibited reduced or no establishment. There was a residual effect of treatment in the second growing season (P < 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to identify proteins associated with CI tolerance in HW pre-treated tomato cv. Imperial. We used a comparative proteomic analysis between HW-treated (42 °C, 5 min) and non-treated fruit after cold storage (0, 10, and 20 days at 5 °C) and ripening (7 days at 21 °C); as well as real-time PCR to analyze the expression of genes encoding some selected proteins. Thirteen proteins were differentially expressed after 20 days of cold storage and 13 after the subsequent ripening period; polypeptides showing greater accumulation in HW-treated fruit included small heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes (thioredoxin peroxidase 1, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase), plant defense proteins (PR-10 and remorin 1) and RNA-binding chaperone protein (GR-RBP). In addition, non-treated fruit showed higher expression of enzymes involved in detoxification, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism, suggesting a low cellular efficiency in energy production due to severe structural damage. The hot water-induced chilling tolerance in tomato fruit appears to be related with the prevention of protein denaturation, activation of the antioxidant and defense systems, and the potential regulation of cold sensitive genes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chilling tolerance; Hot water; Proteomics; Tomato",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027398087

We successfully synthesized SnS/C hybrid electrodes using a solution-based carbon precursor coating with subsequent carbonization strategy. Our data showed that the ultrathin carbon shell was critical to the cycling stability of the SnS electrodes. As a result, the as-prepared binder-free SnS/C electrodes showed excellent performance as sodium ion battery anodes. Specifically, the SnS/C anodes delivered a reversible capacity as high as 792 mAh·g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA·g−1. They also had superior rate capability (431 mAh·g−1 at 3,000 mA·g−1) and stable long-term cycling performance under a high current density (345 mAh·g−1 after 500 cycles at 3 A·g−1). Our approach opens up a new route to synthesize SnS-based hybrid materials at low temperatures for energy storage and other applications. Our process will be particularly useful for chalcogenide matrix materials that are sensitive to high temperatures during solution synthesis.

Ibn Sina B.P. 765 Agdal, Rabat, Morocco","An induction furnace is an electric furnace in which ferrous metal scrap and fluxes (e.g. silica, limestone) are melted using an electromagnetic field to produce steel or cast iron. This metallurgical process is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of wastes called slags, which are composed mainly of a non-metallic part as well as a small metallic part. At the end of the melting process the slags layer is removed from the furnace top, then it is air-cooled and stored prior to discharge. While blast furnace slags (BFS), electric arc furnace slags (EAFS), and ladle furnace slags (LFS) were characterized in earlier works for thermal energy storage up to 1000 °C, the induction furnace slags (IFS) have never been investigated for this application. Thus the aim of this paper is the thermophysical and chemical characterization of IFS to be used as high-temperature thermal energy storage materials (around 1000 °C) in packed bed TES system. Chemical investigation of this metallurgical waste was conducted using: Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Their thermal heat capacity was measured using Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), while their bulk density was determined using the pycnometer method. It was found that they have a good specific heat capacity (Cp ≈ 700 J/kg °C) and a good bulk density (ρ ≈ 2583 kg/m3). The thermal stability of the IFS was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from room temperature up to 1000 °C; Three cycles of heating/cooling were applied on the IFS and their thermal stability was proved at the end of the first cycle. The obtained results suggest that IFS are good candidate materials for high-temperature thermal energy storage application (up to 1000 °C). © 2017","Concentrated solar power; High-temperature thermal energy storage; Induction furnace slags; Packed bed TES system","Blast furnaces; Cast iron; Characterization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electric arcs; Electric discharges; Electric furnaces; Electromagnetic fields; Energy storage; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Induction heating; Infrared spectroscopy; Iron scrap; Metallurgy; Metals; Packed beds; Scanning electron microscopy; Scrap metal; Solar energy; Specific heat; Steel scrap; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray spectroscopy; Chemical characterization; Concentrated solar power; Electric arc furnace slags; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; High temperature thermal energy storages; Induction furnace; Metallurgical process; Modulated differential scanning calorimetry; Slags",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026490619

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of large amount of sensors equipped with radio frequency capabilities. In WSNs, data routing algorithms can be classified based on the network architecture into flat, direct, and hierarchal algorithms. In hierarchal (clustering) protocols, network is divided into sub-networks in which a node acts as a cluster head, while the rest behave as member nodes. It is worth mentioning that the sensor nodes have limited processing, storage, bandwidth, and energy capabilities. Hence, providing energy-efficient clustering protocol is a substantial research subject for many researchers. Among proposed cluster-based protocols, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and threshold LEACH (T-LEACH), as well as modified threshold-based cluster head replacement (MT-CHR) protocols are of a great interest as of being energy optimized. In this article, we propose two protocols to cluster a WSN through taking advantage of the shortcomings of these protocols (i.e., LEACH, T-LEACH, and MT-CHR), namely centralized density- and threshold-based cluster head replacement (C-DTB-CHR) and C-DTB-CHR with adaptive data distribution (C-DTB-CHR-ADD) protocols that mainly aim at optimizing energy through minimizing the number of re-clustering operations, precluding cluster heads nodes premature death, deactivating some nodes located at dense areas from cluster’s participation, as well as reducing long-distance communications. In particular, in C-DTB-CHR protocol, some nodes belong to dense clusters are put in the sleeping mode based on a certain node active probability, thereby reducing the communications with the cluster heads and consequently prolonging the network lifetime. Moreover, the base station is concerned about setting up the required clusters and accordingly informing sensor nodes along with their corresponding active probability. C-DTB-CHR-ADD protocol provides more energy optimization through adaptive data distribution where direct and multi-hoping communications are possible. Interestingly, our simulation results show impressive improvements over what are closely related in the literature in relation to network lifetime, utilization, and network performance degradation period. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Activeness factor; Adaptive data distribution; Centralization; Sensor networks","Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Network architecture; Optimization; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Activeness factor; Centralization; Data distribution; Energy Efficient clustering; Long distance communication; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Minimizing the number of; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020744368

This is due to the large pressure variations that they experience as their state-of-charge changes when their energy capacity is large. The present work highlights an approach whereby the pressure fluctuations are absorbed by a larger external volume of compressed air. This system has been integrated into a novel floating platform for offshore applications. A thermodynamic model of the gas compression process is developed in order to observe temperature and pressure fluctuations. A brief parametric analysis is undertaken to illustrate the effect of critical system dimensions. This comprises the effect of the external volume with respect to the accumulator volume and the diameter of the umbilical connecting the two components. The system is also simulated in different climates to observe the interaction between the external seawater temperature and the internal gas thermodynamics. A full charge-discharge cycle is simulated and results indicate that around 95% of the energy can be recovered after being stored for a 24-h period. The operational efficiency for a stochastic energy input was also computed and found to be relatively high. Electrical round-trip efficiency was found to be comparable to adiabatic and near-isothermal CAES, but the system can be more advantageous when integrated into the generation-side. The key attribute is the minimization of pressure fluctuations, which results in minimal deviations from the equilibrium temperature. This reduces thermal losses to the surroundings and results in a highly efficient energy storage system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed air energy storage; Hydraulic accumulator; Isobaric; Offshore storage","Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Electric power transmission; Energy efficiency; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Pressure vessels; Stochastic systems; Temperature; Charge-discharge cycle; Energy storage systems; Equilibrium temperatures; Isobaric; Offshore applications; Operational efficiencies; Pressure fluctuation; Temperature and pressures; Hydraulic accumulators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019834581

After 24 hr at AP/RT, Requeijão presented microbial counts above 6.00 log CFU/g, while after HS, total aerobic mesophiles and Enterobacteriaceae growth was inhibited. For lactic acid bacteria and yeasts and molds, HS showed an additional microbial inactivation effect, decreasing approximately 1.5 and 3.5 log CFU/g, to values below the detection limit (<1.0 log CFU/g) during the 24 hr experiment. In the second storage experiment (10 days), HS allowed to achieve counts below the detection limit, maintaining them throughout the storage period, and also the physicochemical parameters were unaffected. Thus, HS results clearly point to Requeijão shelf-life extension compared to RF. Practical applications: Hyperbaric storage (HS) at room temperature (RT) is emerging as a new food preservation methodology that acts by microbial growth inhibition similarly to refrigeration. However, HS allows significant energetic costs reduction, since it only implies energy costs during compression/decompression phases (few minutes), and no additional energy is needed to control the temperature or to maintain the product under pressure for long periods as opposed to refrigeration. This is undoubtedly a great advantage for HS, since energy savings implied will greatly reduce costs throughout the storage period. As a consequence, HS also becomes an environmentally friendlier technology, with a carbon footprint estimated to be about 26-fold lower compared to refrigeration storage. This is one of the few studies concerning HS on solid foods and the first work that stored foods for longer storage periods (up to 10 days). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy conservation; Food preservation; Lactic acid; Refrigeration; Detection limits; Enterobacteriaceae; Lactic acid bacteria; Microbial growth; Microbial inactivation; Physicochemical parameters; Shelf life extensions; Storage periods; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019727091

Nanofibrillated cellulose was isolated from kraft pulp and treated with Pulpzyme HC 2500 enzyme prior to high-pressure homogenization in order to lower energy consumption. Three nanocomposite films were fabricated via the casting process: nanofibrillated cellulose, nanocellulose-PVA (NC-PVA) and nanocellulose-silica (NC-Si). Chemical characterization and crystallization were determined with FTIR. Thermal stability was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis. Morphological alterations were monitored with scanning electron microscopy. A universal testing machine and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis were used for determination of Young's and storage moduli. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity and electric modulus were evaluated using an impedance analyzer. Considerable alterations were seen under FTIR. Thermal stability was lower in NC-Si than in NC-PVA due to lower crystallinity. Higher Young's modulus and storage moduli were observed in NC-PVA than in NC-Si. NC-PVA exhibited a singular relaxation process, while a double relaxation process was seen in NC-Si.

With the integration of several microgrids in the modern power system, the balancing of sources of energy has become a major concern for electrical power engineers and researchers worldwide. New power systems require more flexibility in optimization and control design to ensure their ability to maintain the balance between generation and load of the system. The present paper discusses an optimal control design for minimization of the power flow in tie-lines and frequency deviations in the microgrid, which will lead to power balance between the generation and load demand of the system.

The storage unit consists of a shell-and-tube in which phase change material (PCM) occupied the shell space and the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows in the inner tube. The present study is motivated by the need to intensify heat transfer and accelerate melting process in LHSU. A mathematical model based on the conservation equations of energy in both HTF and PCM has been developed. The finite volume approach was used for the discretization of equations. The developed model has been validated by comparing the obtained numerical results with experimental, analytical, and numerical data found in literature. The effects of the pulsation frequency and amplitude, the Reynolds and Stefan numbers on the thermal performance and behavior of the LHSU were investigated. The parametric study showed that the pulsating parameters (frequency and amplitude) affect the thermal performance of the LHSU. The results reveal reduction in the melting time for low pulsating frequency (less than 0.052) and high pulsating amplitude. For pulsating amplitude of 6 and pulsating frequency of 0.01, a reduction up to 13% (at Reynolds number of 500 and Stefan number of 0.16) was obtained. The results also showed that the Reynolds and Stefan numbers strongly affect the heat transfer rate, and the low melting time is obtained for high Reynolds and Stefan numbers. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Digital storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Melting; Phase change materials; Reynolds number; Storage (materials); Conservation equations; Finite volume approach; Heat transfer rate; Latent heat storage units; Latent thermal energy storage unit; Pulsating frequencies; Pulsation frequency; Thermal Performance; Flow of fluids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018690377

The device is meant to provide energy to wireless autonomous monitoring systems in low frequency environments such as wind turbines of 30 kW with rotational speeds of between 50 and 150 rpm. These characteristics define the bandwidth of the rotational energy harvesting system (REH) and its physical dimensions. A versatile geometric configuration with two elastic beams and two heavy masses joined by a spring is proposed. A piezoelectric sheet is mounted on the primary beam while the REH is placed on a rotating hub with the gravitational force acting as a periodic source. This kind of double-beam system offers the possibility to modify the vibration characteristics of the harvester for achieving high power density. An analytical framework using the Lagrangian formulation is derived to describe the motion of the system and the voltage output as a function of rotation speed. Several sets of experiments were performed to characterize the system and to validate the assumed hypothesis. In the experimental setup, a wireless data acquisition system based on Arduino technology was implemented to avoid slip-ring mechanisms. The results show very good agreement between the theoretical and experimental tests. Moreover, the output power of a simple harvesting circuit, which serves as an energy storage device, yields values ranging 26–105 μW over the whole frequency range. This allows us to use the proposed device for the designed purpose, taking into account the power requirements of commercially available wireless transmitter systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Low frequency; Rotational energy haversting device; Wind turbines","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Rhenium compounds; Wind turbines; Geometric configurations; Lagrangian formulations; Low-frequency; Low-frequency environment; Rotational energy; Vibration characteristics; Wireless data acquisitions; Wireless transmitter system; Energy harvesting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032681517

The analytical expressions of these models were deduced exploiting the grand canonical ensemble in statistical physics by taking some simplifying hypotheses. Among these models an adequate model which presents a good correlation with the experimental curves has been selected. The physicochemical parameters intervening in the absorption-desorption processes and involved in the model expressions could be directly deduced from the experimental isotherms by numerical simulation. Six parameters of the model are adjusted, namely the numbers of hydrogen atoms per site n1 and n2, the receptor site densities N1m and N2m, and the energetic parameters P1 and P2. The behaviors of these parameters are discussed in relation with absorption and desorption processes to better understand and compare these phenomena. Thanks to the energetic parameters, we calculated the sorption energies which are typically ranged between 266 and 269.4 KJ/mol for absorption process and between 267 and 269.5 KJ/mol for desorption process comparable to usual chemical bond energies.

As one option for significant reductions in direct CO2 emissions from Helen's fleet, this paper presents case studies for different options regarding a multifuel CHP plant planned for Helsinki. The studied cases include coal firing, co-firing high proportion of forest residues with coal, applying post-combustion CCS for coal firing, and combination of CCS and biomass co-firing. The cases are compared in different market situations in terms of the operation and profitability of the plant portfolio. The results highlight the sensitivities of economic feasibility on different market prices. With the default values assumed, the co-firing case is about as profitable as coal firing solely at present price of CO2 allowances. If CO2 price increases, co-firing becomes the most feasible option until the combination of co-firing and CCS becomes the most feasible option if the price of CO2 allowance is high.

Its participation in insecticide resistance has also been outlined. Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is one of the major vectors of Chagas disease in South America; however, genomic data are scarce. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the nymph integument in order to identify which genes are expressed and their putative role. Using the 454 GS-FLX sequencing platform, we obtained approximately 144,620 reads from the integument tissue. These reads were assembled into 6,495 isotigs and 8,504 singletons. Based on BLAST similarity searches, about 8,000 transcripts were annotated with known genes, conserved domains, and/or Gene Ontology terms. The most abundant transcripts corresponded to transcription factors and nucleic acid metabolism, membrane receptors, cell signaling, and proteins related to cytoskeleton, transport, and cell energy processes, among others. More than 10% of the transcripts-encoded proteins putatively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and related components (fatty acid synthases, elongases, desaturases, fatty alcohol reductases), structural integument proteins, and the insecticide detoxification system (among them, cytochrome P450s, esterases, and glutathione transferases). Real-time qPCR assays were used to investigate their putative participation in the resistance mechanism. This preliminary study is the first transcriptome analysis of a triatomine integument, and together with prior biochemical information, will help further understandthe role of the integument in a wide array of mechanisms. © The Authors 2017.

A common design practice is to implement different energy storage technologies, usually batteries, for reducing the gap between energy generation and electric consumption. However, in communities with low incomes, it is not possible to use batteries due to the high capital costs. This work presents a new approach for providing simultaneously electricity and water using the fresh water extraction and storage for reducing the gaps between generation and consumption. The proposed approach is based on a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation, which accounts for the optimal selection of multiple combined heat and power technologies and the sizing of the water storage and pumping technologies. A multi-objective analysis is presented considering as objective functions the economic costs and environmental impact associated with the space used by the system and water consumption. A community in the mountains of Mexico is presented as case study.

In situ local probe measurements have been recently developed to understand the lithiation process and propose an effective remedy to the failure mechanisms. One of the most specific techniques, which is able to follow the phase changes in poorly crystallized electrode materials, makes use of Raman spectroscopy within the battery, i.e., in operando mode. Such an approach has been successful but is still limited by the rather signal-to-noise ratio of the spectroscopy. Herein, the operando Raman signal from the silicon anodes is enhanced by plasmonic nanoparticles following the known surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Coinage metals (Ag and Au) display a surface plasmon resonance in the visible and allow the SERS effect to take place. We have found that the as-prepared materials reach high specific capacities over 1000 mAh/g with stability over more than 1000 cycles at 1C rate and can be suitable to perform as anodes in LIB. Moreover, the incorporation of coinage metals enables SERS to take place specifically on the surface of silicon. Consequently, by using a specially designed Raman cell, it is possible to follow the processes in a silicon-coinage metal-based battery trough operando SERS measurements. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Energy storage; Galvanic replacement reaction; Li-ion battery; Operando; Raman spectroscopy; Silicon anode","Anodes; Coinage; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Energy storage; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Mints; Plasmons; Raman spectroscopy; Signal to noise ratio; Silicon; Silicon batteries; Substitution reactions; Surface plasmon resonance; Electrode material; Galvanic replacement reactions; High specific capacity; Operando; Plasmonic nanoparticle; Silicon anode; Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; Technological challenges; Lithium-ion batteries; gold nanoparticle; lithium ion; silica nanoparticle; silver nanoparticle; Article; controlled study; discharge charge cycle; electrochemical analysis; galvanic current; lithiation; operando plasmon enhanced Raman spectrometry; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; signal noise ratio; surface plasmon resonance; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033665488

The attractive features of spin-torque-transfer magnetic-RAM (STT-MRAM) make it a promising candidate for future on-chip cache memory. Two-bit multiple-level cell (MLC) STT-MRAMs suffer from higher write energy, performance overhead, and lower cell endurance when compared with single-level counterpart. These unwanted effects are mainly due to write operations known as two-step (TT) and hard transitions (HT). Here, the authors offer a solution to tackle write energy problem in MLC STT-MRAM by minimising the number of TT and HT transitions. By analysing real applications, it was observed that specific locations within a cache block undergo much more TT and HT transitions resulting in hot locations when compared with other ones (cold locations). These hot locations are more detrimental to the lifetime and reliability of MRAM device. In this work, the authors propose a simple and intuitive dynamic encoding scheme that eliminates all TT and HT at hot locations, hence reducing energy consumption and improving MLC STT-MRAM lifetime. Results on PARSEC benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach to potentially prolong MLC STT-MRAM lifetime. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Cache memory; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Location; Magnetic recording; Random access storage; Dynamic encoding; Multiple-level cells; Non-volatile memory; Real applications; Reducing energy consumption; Specific location; Spin torque transfer; State transitions; MRAM devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033445319

In this study, a research has been held using a computational method so as to explore the feasibility of this concept as well as to find the ideal configuration which provides the best energy storage ability. For this reason, various armchair and zigzag single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) are thoroughly examined. The proposed method uses three dimensional (3d) bar elements with two nodes of specific stiffness that simulate the interatomic interactions between carbon atoms. In addition, the influence of the non-bonded van der Waals (vdW) interatomic interactions between neighbor SWCNTs on mechanical performance has been investigated. A complete parametric study, concerning the type of the SWCNTs and their geometry, is performed in order to estimate the amount of the energy absorbed by SWCNT-springs. The numerical results concern the maximum strain energy and maximum strain energy density prior to buckling of a single SWCNT and bundles of SWCNTs arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The results of the present method are in good agreement with results found in the literature. The finding of the present study seems to encourage the future potential use of SWCNTs as mechanical energy storages and novel power macroscopic devices. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.","Buckling.; Carbon Nanotubes; CNT-Springs; Mechanical Energy Storage; Strain Energy Density",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032642541

As a part of the smart grids (SGs), microgrids (MGs) have been developed to exploit the full benefits from the integration of distributed energy resources, especially distributed renewable generation based on variable and intermittent sources, such as wind and solar. Nevertheless, meeting all these goal requires the implementation of innovative energy storage technologies integrated with high efficiency and very fast response electronic power conditioning systems to interface with the electrical grid.

Both galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed to study of electrochemical properties. The results showed that glasses containing sulfur (S) exhibited a high performance, such as specific capacitance, energy density and power density, compared with the S-free glass. These properties increased with increasing of S content. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the glasses containing S can be attributed to the partial substitution of oxygen (O) atoms by S atoms. Since the radius of S ion is higher than O ion, this substitution can significantly enlarge the size of Li-ion transfer pathway. Besides, S ion has better polarization ability than O ion, thus weakens the interaction between Li ions and glass network. Therefore, the addition of S into oxide glasses may be an effective way to improve the performance of electrochemical devices electrodes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DSC; Electrode materials; Energy storage devices; Lithium‑vanadium-phosphate glasses; Sulfur addition","Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Energy storage; Glass; Ions; Lithium; Sulfur; Vanadium; Electrochemical devices; Electrochemical performance; Electrode material; Galvanostatic charge/discharge; Partial substitution; Power densities; Specific capacitance; Vanadium phosphate glass; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030089971

Adult patients with metabolic myopathies typically present with exercise-induced pain, contractures or stiffness, fatigue, and myoglobinuria. Symptoms are related to energy failure. Purpose of review In this review, the current treatment options, including exercise therapy, dietary treatment, pharmacological supplementation, gene transcription, and enzyme replacement therapy, are described. Recent findings Recognition of the metabolic block in the metabolic myopathies has started the development of new therapeutic options. Enzyme replacement therapy with rGAA has revolutionized treatment of early onset Pompe disease. Supplements of riboflavin, carnitine, and sucrose show promise in patients with respectively riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, primary carnitine deficiency, and McArdle disease. Treatment with citric acid cycle intermediates supply by triheptanoin seems promising in patients with glucogenoses, and studies are ongoing in patients with McArdle disease. Summary Treatment of metabolic myopathies primarily relies on avoiding precipitating factors and dietary supplements that bypass the metabolic block. Only a few of the used supplements are validated, and further studies are needed to define efficacious treatments. Further potential treatment targets are molecular therapies aimed at enzyme correction, such as chaperone therapy, gene therapy, gene expression therapy, and enzyme replacement therapies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Diet therapy; Enzyme replacement therapy; Exercise therapy; Glycogenoses; Lipid metabolism disorders; Metabolic myopathies","aminoglycoside; carnitine; creatine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fibric acid derivative; glucose; glucosidase; medium chain triacylglycerol; pyridoxine; recombinant alfa glucosidase; recombinant enzyme; resveratrol; riboflavin; triheptanoin; ubidecarenone; unclassified drug; valproic acid; carbohydrate diet; carnitine deficiency; citric acid cycle; diet therapy; dietary supplement; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; endurance training; enzyme replacement; genetic transcription; glycogen storage disease type 2; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; ketogenic diet; kinesiotherapy; low fat diet; metabolic disorder; multiple acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; myopathy; nonhuman; onset age; pharmaceutical care; resistance training; Review; treatment planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029939540

However, Methanococcoides burtonii has a truncate glucokinase gene with a large deletion at the C-terminal, where the catalytic GXGD motif is located. Characterization of its phosphofructokinase annotated protein shows that is a bifunctional enzyme able to supply the absence of the glucokinase activity. Moreover, kinetic analyses of the phosphofructokinase annotated enzyme from, Methanohalobium evestigatum demonstrated that this enzyme is also bifunctional. The high conservation of the active site residues of all the enzymes from the order Methanosarcinales suggest that they should be bifunctional, as was previously reported for the ADP-dependent kinases from Methanococcales, highlighting the redundancy of the glucokinase activity in this archaeal group. The presence of active glycolytic enzymes would be important when glycogen storage of these organisms needs to be degraded to be used as energy source.

The Sm3+ content, optical properties, and crystal structure were investigated via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) upheld the presence of Sm grains and verified its percentage increase with the deposition power. VASE data were fitted using effective medium approximation method (EMA) to determine the Sm3+ volume fraction and mass thickness (MT). XRD study verified the Wurtzite hexagonal structure stability of ZnO and no crystal structure or phase distortion occurred. The band energy gap of the composite decreased with Sm: ZnO content. The roughness and thickness uniformity of the thin films were determined by the VASE study and were confirmed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM).

Therefore, the on-board energy is a crucial factor that needs to be further analyzed. In this work, different control strategies applied to a generic UAV propulsion system are considered and a lithium polymer battery dynamic model is included as the propulsion system energy source. Several simulations are carried out for each control strategy, and a quantitative evaluation of the influence of each control law over the actual energy consumed by the propulsion system is reported. This energy, which is delivery by the battery, is next compared against a well-known control-effort-based index. The results and analysis suggest that conclusions regarding energy savings based on control effort signals should be drawn carefully, because they do not directly represent the actual consumed energy. © 2017 ISA","Battery model; Control technique; Energy savings; Propulsion system; State of charge; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Aircraft control; Charging (batteries); Control theory; Energy conservation; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Propulsion; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Battery modeling; Control strategies; Control techniques; Electrical energy storages; Energy evaluation; Propulsion system; Quantitative evaluation; State of charge; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028512483

Its activation leads to increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity, thus contributing to a better energy homeostasis. Green tea extracts (GTEs) were shown to attenuate obesity and low-grade inflammation and to induce the lipolytic pathway in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed a high-fat diet. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the antiobesity effect of an extract from green tea leaves was associated with the activation of browning in the WAT and/or the inhibition of whitening in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in HF-diet induced obese mice. Mice were fed a control diet or an HF diet supplemented with or without 0.5% polyphenolic GTE for 8 weeks. GTE supplementation significantly reduced HF-induced adiposity (WAT and BAT) and HF-induced inflammation in WAT. Histological analysis revealed that GTE reduced the adipocyte size in the WAT and the lipid droplet size in the BAT. Markers of browning were induced in the WAT upon GTE treatment, whereas markers of HF-induced whitening were reduced in the BAT. These results suggest that browning activation in the WAT and whitening reduction in the BAT by the GTE could participate to the improvement of metabolic and inflammatory disorders mediated by GTE upon HF diet. Our study emphasizes the importance of using GTE as a nutritional tool to activate browning and to decrease fat storage in all adipose tissues, which attenuate obesity. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Brown adipose tissue; Browning; Green tea; High-fat diet; Obesity; Whitening","adiponectin; cyclooxygenase 2; sinecatechins; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; biological marker; fat droplet; plant extract; polyphenol; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; beige adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; cell size; controlled study; diet induced obesity; dietary intake; energy metabolism; fat mass; histology; lipid diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; plant leaf; tea; upregulation; weight gain; adipogenesis; animal; beige adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue; C57BL mouse; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; dietary supplement; food handling; germfree animal; immunology; metabolism; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology; plant leaf; randomization; white adipose tissue; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Beige; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Adiposity; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Biomarkers; Camellia sinensis; Cell Size; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Supplements; Food Handling; Lipid Droplets; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Polyphenols; Random Allocation; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028456149

In this work a thorough literature survey demonstrates that there is no consensus on an integrative solution for conveying pressure drop, therefore a large data base of conveying systems' operating points at dilute phase is established and analyzed. It includes measurements taken at our 52 mm bore laboratory pneumatic conveying line, as well as thousands of data points collected from the literature. Two modelling approaches are attempted – the first is frictional representation based on dimensional analysis, which presents linear dependency between the pressure drop and the superficial fluid velocity normalized by the minimum pressure velocity of the transport curve. It had also been found that the pressure drop increase rate has a strong dependency on the Archimedes number. The second approach is an energy balance between the power of the drag force applied to the particles and the additional power required to drive the fluid due to particle presence. Unlike the common expressions, a modification to the drag coefficient is suggested, which takes into account pipe turbulence and particle acceleration. The two presented models do not require pilot plant calibration, and an applicability of one of them to slurry transport is demonstrated.

Recently, the use of rocks as sensible heat storage materials in packed bed systems has been the main object of several research studies. Nevertheless, limited knowledge is available on the thermal behavior of rocks at high temperatures and their suitability is yet to be deeply studied. The present paper aims to investigate the potential of quartzite and flint rocks to be used as filler materials in a packed bed storage system with air as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). These siliceous rocks have been subjected to an experimental characterization in terms of the properties required in a sensible heat storage material. In fact, the geochemistry and structure of these rocks were identified and some mechanical characteristics were measured. The influence of temperature variation on thermal capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity was also analyzed. Besides, thermogravimetric analysis was performed up to 1000 °C, in order to check the thermal stability of rocks. In addition, 110 thermal cycles were achieved in a furnace up to 550 °C.

Nanofibrillated cellulose was isolated from Eucalyptus camaldulensis and prior to high-pressure homogenizing was pretreated with Celluclast enzyme in order to lower energy consumption. Three nanocomposite films were fabricated via the casting process: nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF), nanocellulose-PVA (CNF-P) and nanocellulose-silica (CNF-Si). Chemical characterization, crystallization and thermal stability were determined using FT-IR and TGA. Morphological alterations were monitored with SEM. The Young's and storage moduli of the nanocomposites were determined via a universal testing machine and DTMA. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity and electric modulus were evaluated using an impedance analyzer. The crystallinity values of the nanocomposites calculated from the FT-IR were in agreement with the TGA results, showing that the lowest crystallinity value was in the CNF-Si. The CNF-P displayed the highest tensile strength. At a high temperature interval, the storage modulus of the CNF-Si was greater than that of the CNF or CNF-P. The CNF-Si also exhibited a completed singular relaxation process, while the CNF and the CNF-P processes were uncompleted. Consequently, in terms of industrial applications, although the CNF-P composite had mechanical advantages, the CNF-Si composite displayed the best thermo-mechanical properties. © 2017","Electrical properties; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; PVA; Silica","cellulose derivative; nanocellulose; nanocomposite; nanofibrillated cellulose; polyvinyl alcohol; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; cellulase; cellulose; nanocomposite; nanofiber; polyvinyl alcohol; silicon dioxide; analyzer; Article; composite material; crystallization; electric potential; energy consumption; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; high temperature; impedance; infrared spectroscopy; morphology; physical chemistry; scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength; thermogravimetry; thermostability; Young modulus; chemistry; metabolism; temperature; Cellulase; Cellulose; Electric Impedance; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Silicon Dioxide; Temperature; Tensile Strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020706154

Initially, formulation regarding optimum selection of a power storage system for a home (in terms of storage capacity) is presented. Afterwards, the concept of sharing economy is inducted in the community by demonstrating PDH. PDH is composed of multiple small-scale battery ESSs (each owned by community users), which are connected together to form a unified-ESS. Proposed PDH offers a localized switching mechanism that takes decision of whether to buy electricity from utility or use unified-ESS. This decision is based on the price of electricity at ‘time of use’ and ‘state of charge’ of unified-ESS. In response to power use or share, electricity bills are created for individual smart homes by incrementing or decrementing respective submeters. There is no buying or selling of power from PDH; there is power sharing with the concept of ‘no profit, no loss’. The objective of the proposed PDH is to limit the purchase of electricity on ‘high priced’ hours from the utility. This not only benefits the utility at crucial hours but also provides effective use of power at the demand side. The proposed multi-agent system depicts the concept of sharing power economy within a community. Finally, the proposed model is analyzed analytically, considering on-peak, off-peak, and mid-level (mid-peak) prices of a real-time price signal during 24 h of a day. Results clearly show vital financial benefits of ‘sharing power economy’ for end users and efficient use of power within the smart community. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Most of the existing thermo-mechanical models focus on soil behaviour under monotonic thermal loading only, and they are not able to capture soil volume changes under thermal cycles. In this study, a constitutive model is proposed to simulate volume changes of saturated soil subjected to cyclic heating and cooling. Two surfaces are defined and used: a bounding surface and a memory surface. The bounding surface and memory surface are mainly controlled by the preconsolidation pressure (a function of plastic volumetric strain) and the maximum stress experienced by the soil, respectively. Under thermal cycles, the distance of the two surfaces and plastic modulus increase with an accumulation of plastic strain. By adopting the double surface concept, a new elastoplastic model is derived from an existing single bounding surface thermo-mechanical model. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results reveal that the proposed model is able to capture soil volume changes under thermal cycles well. The plastic strain accumulates under thermal cycles, but at a decreasing rate, until stabilization. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, NC-enabled wireless networks are susceptible to a severe security threat, known as data pollution attack, where a malicious node injects into the network polluted packets that prevent the destination nodes from decoding correctly. Due to recoding, occurred at the intermediate nodes, according to the core principle of NC, the polluted packets propagate quickly into other packets and corrupt bunches of legitimate packets leading to network resource waste. Hence, a lot of research effort has been devoted to schemes against data pollution attacks. Homomorphic MAC-based schemes are a promising solution against data pollution attacks. However, most of them are susceptible to a new type of pollution attack, called tag pollution attack, where an adversary node randomly modifies tags appended to the end of the transmitted packets. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient homomorphic message authentication code-based scheme, called HMAC, providing resistance against data pollution attacks and tag pollution attacks in NC-enabled wireless networks. Our proposed scheme makes use of three types of homomorphic tags (i.e., MACs, D-MACs and one signature) which are appended to the end of the coded packet. Our results show that the proposed HMAC scheme is more efficient compared to other competitive tag pollution immune schemes in terms of complexity, communication overhead and key storage overhead. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Data pollution attack; Network coding; Security; Tag pollution attack; Wireless networks","Codes (symbols); Complex networks; Computer crime; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Network security; Pollution; Wireless networks; Communication overheads; Destination nodes; Intermediate node; Message authentication codes; Pollution attack; Recent researches; Security; Security threats; Network coding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988350471

It has also been proposed that PHB accumulation improves bacterial stress resistance. Cupriavidus necator and its PHB non-accumulating mutant were employed to investigate the protective role of PHB under hypertonic conditions. The presence of PHB granules enhanced survival of the bacteria after exposure to hypertonic conditions. Surprisingly, when coping with such conditions, the bacteria did not utilize PHB to harvest carbon or energy, suggesting that, in the osmotic upshock of C. necator, the protective mechanism of PHB granules is not associated with their hydrolysis. The presence of PHB granules influenced the overall properties of the cells, since challenged PHB-free cells underwent massive plasmolysis accompanied by damage to the cell membrane and the leakage of cytoplasm content, while no such effects were observed in PHB containing bacteria. Moreover, PHB granules demonstrated “liquid-like” properties indicating that they can partially repair and stabilize cell membranes by plugging small gaps formed during plasmolysis. In addition, the level of dehydration and changes in intracellular pH in osmotically challenged cells were less pronounced for PHB-containing cultures, demonstrating the important role of PHB for bacterial survival under hyperosmotic conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cupriavidus necator; Hyperosmotic conditions; PHB; Plasmolysis; Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); Stress conditions","Bacteria; Cells; Granulation; Cupriavidus necator; Hyperosmotic conditions; Plasmolysis; Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; Stress condition; Cytology; carbon; hypertonic solution; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); 6-carboxyfluorescein; fluorescein derivative; hydroxybutyric acid; hypertonic solution; water; Article; bacterial cell; bacterial membrane; bacterial survival; bacterium mutant; carbon metabolism; cell pH; controlled study; Cupriavidus necator; cytoplasm; energy metabolism; hydrolysis; membrane damage; nonhuman; osmotic stress; plasmolysis; priority journal; cell granule; cryoelectron microscopy; crystallization; Cupriavidus necator; cytology; drug effects; fluorescence microscopy; metabolism; microbial viability; osmotic pressure; thermogravimetry; time factor; ultrastructure; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Crystallization; Cupriavidus necator; Cytoplasmic Granules; Fluoresceins; Hydroxybutyrates; Hypertonic Solutions; Microbial Viability; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Osmotic Pressure; Thermogravimetry; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025814322

Based on the quality and cost of these PCMs, two sources were identified: (i) hydrogenated gas-to-liquid (GTL) products such as heavy detergent feedstocks; and (ii) linear alpha olefins. Fractionation of a typical hydrogenated GTL mixture, containing C14 – C18 alkene and alkane hydrocarbons, has been experimentally conducted to produce five paraffinic PCMs with melting points between 3 and 28 °C. ChemCAD simulation has been proved to be a valid tool for predicting the behaviour of the GTL fractionation, including optimum experimental conditions and compositions of products. Also, hydrogenation of technical 1-octadecene was experimentally carried out in order to evaluate the quality of PCM produced from one of the available technical alpha-olefins. All PCMs produced in this work were analysed by gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector to determine their compositions and by differential scanning calorimetry to determine their latent heats. The results showed that the PCM with a melting temperature in the range 22 to 25 °C can be technically produced through hydrogenation of commercial 1-octadecene showing a higher latent heat compared to the PCM produced from fractionation of hydrogenated GTL mixture.

The proposed combined chemical looping is able to store and release energy from chemical looping combustion for heat generation and hydrogen production by steam-iron processes integrated in one reactor. The reactor contains two concentric chambers, which are both filled with iron-based material. In a first step, all material is reduced to the metallic form, thus ""charging"" the reactor. For the second step or ""discharging"", steam is fed to the inner chamber and air is fed to the outer chamber. The inner chamber is used for hydrogen production, and the external chamber is used for heat generation. In addition to iron, the external chamber contains a highly pyrophoric Ni-based layer at the air entry point to enable the startup of heat generation at room temperature.

However, the intermittent nature of RES and dynamic electricity prices require tools against uncertainty to protect the end-users from underutilizing their assets. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of Robust Optimization (RO) in maximizing the economic benefit of the owner of a home battery storage system in the presence of uncertainty in dynamic electricity prices. The advantage of the robust model is that it keeps its linear class, thus it is not too computationally intensive to be included in the control algorithm of a residential energy storage controller. In the usecase, the aggregating entity makes requests for flexibility and coordinates 100 such devices using a price signal, while the storage controller is doing dynamic electricity price arbitrage. The results indicated that the RO approach can be beneficial for a non-conservative agent in the case of low daily price fluctuations, while, in summer, when the price fluctuations are higher, uncertainty can be ignored. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power measurement; Optimization; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Battery storage system; Electricity prices; Intelligent software agent; Market participants; Renewable energy source; Residential energy; Robust optimisation; Robust optimization; Software agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032985764

Toward commercial applications, the enhancement of the performance and competitiveness of PV and ES systems requires the adoption of precise, but simple and low-cost manufacturing solutions, compatible with large-scale and high-throughput production lines. Photonic processes enable cost-efficient, noncontact, highly precise, and selective engineering of materials via photothermal, photochemical, or photophysical routes. Laser-based processes, in particular, provide access to a plethora of processing parameters that can be tuned with a remarkably high degree of precision to enable innovative processing routes that cannot be attained by conventional approaches. The focus here is on the application of advanced light-driven approaches for the fabrication, as well as the synthesis, of materials and components relevant to PV and ES systems.

The development of molecular solar thermal systems presents one approach to address these issues by tuning the isomerization reactions of photo/ thermoswitches. Here we show that the incorporation of photoswitches into macrocyclic structures is a particularly attractive solution for increasing the storage time. We present the synthesis and properties of a series of macrocycles incorporating two dihydroazulene (DHA) photoswitching subunits, bridged by linkers of varying chain length. Independent of ring size, all macrocycles exhibit stepwise, light-induced, ring-opening reactions (DHA-DHA to DHAVHF to VHF-VHF; VHF = vinylheptafulvene) with the first DHA undergoing isomerization with a similar efficiency as the uncyclized parent system while the second (DHA-VHF to VHF-VHF) is significantly slower. The energy-releasing, VHF-to-DHA, ring closures also occur in a stepwise manner and are systematically found to proceed slower in the more strained (smaller) cycles, but in all cases with a remarkably slow conversion of the second VHF to DHA. We managed to increase the half-life of the second VHF-to-DHA conversion from 65 to 202 h at room temperature by simply decreasing the ring size. A computational study reveals the smallest macrocycle to have the most energetic VHF-VHF state and hence highest energy density. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Isomerization; Isomers; Attractive solutions; Computational studies; Energy releasing; Isomerization reaction; Macrocyclic structure; Photo-switchable; Ring opening reaction; Solar thermal systems; Solar energy; azulene; macrocyclic compound; vinyl derivative; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; diastereoisomer; energy conversion; energy transfer; half life time; isomerization; light; photochemistry; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; ring closing metathesis; ring opening; room temperature; solar energy; storage; synthesis; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047490720

However, their widespread use is limited by the low energy storage density; thus, a high-surface-area porous carbon is urgently needed. Herein, a highly porous carbon with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area up to 3643 m2 g-1 has been synthesized by chemical activation of papayas for the first time. This sp2-bonded porous carbon has a continuous three-dimensional network of highly curved, atom-thick walls that form narrow mesopores of 2 ∼ 5 nm in width, which can be systematically tailored with varied activation levels. Two-electrode symmetric supercapacitors constructed by this porous carbon achieve energy density of 8.1 Wh kg-1 in aqueous electrolyte and 65.5 Wh kg-1 in ionic-liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, half-cells (versus Li or Na metal) using this porous carbon as ion sorption cathodes yield high specific capacity, e.g., 51.0 and 39.3 mAh g-1 in Li+ and Na+ based organic electrolyte.

Direct impacts are captured using sustainability indicators representing environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainability. Results show that introducing cascaded wood can increase carbon storage in wood products, employment and production costs. Energy use and GHG emissions increase as well, when the total industrial activity during the lifetime of wood increases. We conclude that cascade use can improve resource efficiency as it enables the use of wood multiple times before combustion; however, the amount of waste wood for energy generation decreases locally, and alternative sources of energy need to be identified. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon stock; Cascade use; particleboard; resource efficiency; sustainability impact assessment; ToSIA","Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Particle board; Social aspects; Waste incineration; Wood; Wood products; Alternative sources of energy; Carbon stocks; Particleboard production; Resource efficiencies; Sustainability impact assessment; Sustainability impacts; Sustainability indicators; ToSIA; Sustainable development; Employment; Finland; Particle Boards; Sustainable Forest Management; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026379912

Four transport cases, combining two transport delivery location scenarios (Czech storage and European transport hub) and two transport technology options (pipeline-based and train-based transport), are designed and evaluated. For the Czech storage case, the cost evaluation of the CO2 conditioning and transport results in costs of 10.5 and 18.3 €/tCO2 for the pipeline and train options respectively. In the European hub scenario, the CO2 conditioning and transport costs are estimated at 15.4 and 24.9 €/tCO2. These results clearly identify the pipeline transport options as the cost-optimal solutions for CO2 transport in both delivery location scenarios, due to the longer transport distances and higher conditioning costs involved for train-based export. Moreover, the comparison of transport delivery location scenarios also shows that if CO2 storage is not possible at the Czech storage location and the CO2 has to pass through the European hub, this would result in an increase of at least 4.9 €/tCO2, plus the additional transport and storage costs after the European hub stage. In addition, further assessments are performed to evaluate the impact of impurities in the CO2 streams from the capture plant on the CO2 conditioning and transport costs for the four combinations of transport scenarios and technology options. The results show that the impurities present in the CO2 streams lead to increases in CO2 conditioning and transport costs ranging from 1.6 to 11.4% (0.2–1.9 €/tCO2). However, the energy and cost impacts associated with the impurities are highly dependent on the transport technology and transport delivery location scenario considered. Furthermore, the process energy and cost performances of two alternative CO2 liquefaction processes, designed to reduce CO2 losses through the purged gas, are also evaluated. These two alternative processes result in higher CO2 conditioning cost than the base case process, which suggests that reducing the CO2 losses compared to the base case would not be a good strategy, unless high costs (70–110 €/tCO2) were spent to capture the CO2 that is purged. Finally, the potential of train-based transport is evaluated beyond the four cases considered by comparing the CO2 conditioning and transport costs of pipeline and train transports as a function of the distance for different train conditioning cost scenarios and different project economic valuation periods. The results show that train-based transport could potentially be a cost-optimal alternative to pipeline-based transport for medium to long distances especially in cases where the additional conditioning costs of train-based transport compared to pipeline are limited, or in cases of financial risk-averse decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); CO2 transport; Lignite-fired IGCC; Pipeline transport; Techno-economic comparison; Train-based transport","Carbon; Carbon capture; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Costs; Economic analysis; Lignite; Location; Pipelines; Transportation; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2 transport; Pipeline transport; Techno-economic comparisons; Train-based transport; Carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; lignite; liquefaction; pipeline; power plant; transport process; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032934212

Due to the complex natural structure and fabric of clay and non-clay minerals associated with high in situ stresses, high temperatures, and the practical difficulties in the replication of the field stress and temperature conditions in the lab testing facilities, swell potential from the macro and micro investigations does not provide reliable and universally applicable results. In this study, a comprehensive molecular-level simulation-based volume change constitutive model has been developed for clay minerals incorporating the effects of cation exchange capacity, density, water content, in situ stress state, temperature, exchangeable-cations type and proportion, pore fluids, and the dissolved salts. The molecular simulations were performed using molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Comparing the model predictions with the results of the lab tests, the model has been proven to be quite precise in the prediction of the swell potential of these strata under various overburden pressures and temperatures. There is several fold increase in swelling of clay samples at 80 °C as compared to the equivalent specimen tested at 25 °C. The effect of higher temperature is lesser at lower initial water content (higher density) while at higher water content (lower density) the structure has been found to be more vulnerable at higher temperatures. About 100 times higher confining pressure results in the same swell at 80 °C as in its counterpart specimen at 25 °C, the corresponding swell increase factor in case of 50 °C specimens is about 45. A sharp increase in swelling with a drop in in situ pressure emphasizes the probability of higher swell as a result of an accidental reduction in in situ pressure such as the higher concentration of nuclear reactions. In this study, the cohesive energy density (CED) was found to be highly sensitive to various volume change variables, such as water content, density, CEC, type, and percentage of exchangeable and non-exchangeable cations. Contrary to all the previous models, CED-based model developed in this study is universal in nature and can be adopted for any case with minimal basic material input parameters. The good agreement found between the predicted and real values for the swell potential of the undisturbed samples suggests that the model presented here can effectively be used for the assessment of the swelling potential of shale/clay deposits to be used as buffers to the nuclear waste storage. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Clay; Nano-level modeling; Nuclear waste; Shale","cation exchange capacity; clay mineral; confining pressure; in situ stress; modeling; numerical model; radioactive waste; repository; shale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031717112

This research is performed to investigate the characteristics of optimum magnetic anisotropy of Barium-ferrite as HDD media using HAMR technology. Barium-ferrite is chosen to be evaluated because of its strong magnetic anisotropy which potentially used as high-density storage media. The researched magnetic anisotropy of the material has a range of (1.0-4.5)×106 erg/cm3 which performed using two schemes, which are RBW and MRDP schemes. RBW scheme is used to investigate the appropriate anisotropy material to be used as HDD media. The feasibility of anisotropy to use is observed from the thermal stability level, shown by the value of energy barrier which is higher than 70 kBT. On the other hand, MRDP scheme is used to estimate the required magnitude of the writing magnetic field to reverse the magnetization of the material when being stimulated with the thermal field. It is found that Barium-ferrite with magnetic anisotropy ranging from (1.00-3.75)×106 erg/cm3 has excellent thermal stability, suitable to be used as HDD media.

Furthermore pumped storage hydropower is ranked as the most reliable and efficient storage technology for electricity. The energy carrier water is also the most commonly-used thermal storage medium due to its high specific heat capacity. In a study, the combination of electrical and thermal energy storage in a pumped storage power station is investigated in order to cover two energy-intensive sectors with the economical double use of water as an energy medium. With this double application the energy output compared to separate storage usage can be considerably increased. Underground power stations are independent of topography, so this storage concept can be used for district heating supply. One possible vision is to stor solar energy into the water reservoir of a pumped storage power station in the summer months and transfer it in the high-demand winter months. In order that pumped storage power stations can keep functioning at high and seasonally fluctuating water temperatures and simultaneously store thermal energy efficiently, some adaptations of the structures and the pressure tunnel layout are necessary.

A decreasing share of dispatchable generation technologies in electricity generation and an increasing need for short-term flexibility means that the added value of alternative short-term flexibility providers, such as electricity storage, becomes important. This paper studies the way in which alternative flexible resources, here storage technologies, generate added value by running various set-ups of a power system planning model with different levels of operational detail. Firstly, this allows to identify the different roles flexible technologies play in power system operation, and the subsequent impact on power system planning. Secondly, this allows to determine the importance of operational detail in power system planning models to accurately assess the value of flexibility. Results show that storage technologies have the technical ability to provide firm capacity, smoothen the residual load curve, manage the impact of hourly dispatch constraints and provide reserve capacity. Nevertheless, the extent to which this is translated into investment depends on how cost-effectively a technology can offer these services. Results further show that to fully capture the added value of flexibility providers high operational detail is needed in planning models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity storage; Flexibility; Power system operation; Power system planning; Renewable energy","Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity storages; Flexibility; Power system operations; Power system planning; Renewable energies; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029489923

To achieve this, an oxidization and reduction process is used to developed single/few-layers and separate them without changing their structure. Graphene oxide has potential applications in many areas, e.g., electronics, magnetic, catalysis, and energy storage, because of its high charge-carrier mobility and high specific surface area. This study investigates the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene oxide (GO), and nitrogen functionalised graphene oxide (GO-Nx). GO is prepared using chemical process and hence functionalized with nitrogen precursors. GO and GO-Nx are characterised using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Nitrogen functionalized GO become more graphitic in structure as observed from Raman spectroscopy and N 1s XPS spectrum that turn into higher magnetization observed from M-H hysteresis loops. The electronic density of states of GO-Nx is significantly higher than as compared to the GO as a result the magnetic properties also enhanced on GO-Nx. Our experimental results thus provide new evidences to control the magnetic and electronic properties of GO and GO-Nx for different electronic and magnetic device applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Graphene oxide; Nitrogen functionalized graphene oxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027989298

It uses refurbished lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries that are disposed from electric vehicles (EVs) as they can hold up to 80% of their initial rated capacity. This system is aimed at prolonging the usable life of li-ion EV batteries by reusing them for energy storage. However, the high value of the internal resistance of refurbished batteries generates more heat and consequently accelerates further their aging process as their operating temperature plays a vital role on their reliability, lifespan, safety and performance. Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) must keep the operating temperature of the battery pack between −10 °C and 40 °C in order to achieve good performances and long lifespan. Active BTMS consumes energy from the pack and reduces its available capacity. In order to reduce this adverse impact, this paper presents a novel approach that takes advantage of the non-uniform surface distribution of li-ion battery cell, which results from complex reactions inside the cell. First, li-ion hotspots were identified and found next to the positive and negative tabs. Then, thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are mounted next to the tabs and in the center of the li-ion battery. A control circuit is designed to turn on and off TECs in order to reduce the parasitic power feeding the proposed system, referred to as modular battery thermal management system (MBTMS). Experimental results show the performance of the MBTMS under normal conditions, such as an ambient temperature of 25 °C and a discharge rate of C/1 to 2C, and under extreme conditions, such as 40 °C and 3C discharge rate. Finally, its performance is compared against a compatible BTMS based on forced air flow. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Battery thermal management system (BTMS); Lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery; Thermoelectric coolers (TECs)","Battery management systems; Cooling systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Heat resistance; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Restoration; Smart power grids; Storage management; Temperature; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric refrigeration; Battery thermal managements; Design and implementations; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage systems; Lithium iron phosphates; Operating temperature; Surface distributions; Thermoelectric cooler; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027852237

Detailed biochemical analyses and monitoring of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism were performed in Yarrowia lipolytica and Umbelopsis isabellina, which are often used as model oleaginous microorganisms. It was found that during the early oleaginous phase, the carbon source (glucose) was channeled to lipid accumulation, but also to polysaccharide biosynthesis. However, during transition from the early to the late oleaginous phase, glucose was exclusively converted to lipids, while in U. isabellina, but not in Y. lipolytica, an additional conversion of cellular polysaccharides into lipids was observed. After glucose depletion in the growth medium, cellular storage material was degraded either for generating maintenance energy or for supporting further microbial growth, depending on the availability of essential nutrients in the growth medium. We demonstrated that in both microorganisms, reserve lipids were exclusively used as an intra-cellular carbon source in order to generate energy for maintenance purpose. When cellular storage material degradation was related to new cell mass production, a bioconversion of lipids into new lipid-free material, consisting of polysaccharides and proteins, was observed in Y. lipolytica, while new lipid-free material in U. isabellina was richer in proteins. Lipid and polysaccharide remodeling may occur in some cases in both microorganisms. This study revealed some new biochemical features of oleaginous microorganisms that may be crucial for the design of new biotechnological processes, such as the production of bio-molecules of industrial, technological, and medical interest. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism; Lipid and polysaccharide biosynthesis and degradation; Oleaginous microorganisms","Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbon; Enzymes; Glucose; Lipids; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Physiology; Polysaccharides; Storage (materials); Biochemical analysis; Biochemical mechanisms; Biotechnological process; Carbon metabolism; Generating maintenances; Material degradation; Oleaginous microorganisms; Umbelopsis isabellina; Biodegradation; carbon; glucose; lipid; polysaccharide; biochemical composition; biodegradation; biotechnology; carbon; enzyme; enzyme activity; fungus; glucose; lipid; metabolism; microbial activity; microorganism; monitoring; polysaccharide; yeast; Article; biotransformation; carbohydrate metabolism; carbohydrate synthesis; carbon source; controlled study; culture medium; degradation; energy resource; fungus growth; lipid storage; nonhuman; nutrient; Umbelopsis isabellina; Yarrowia lipolytica; chemistry; fungus; lipid metabolism; metabolism; pH; Yarrowia; Umbelopsis isabellina; Yarrowia lipolytica; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Culture Media; Fungi; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lipid Metabolism; Yarrowia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027345324

However, their poor capacity retention limits their practical use. Herein, sulfur-loaded activated carbon was used as the cathode of LSB. The functionalized carbon fiber paper (CFP) containing carboxyl and amide groups was used as an interlayer of LSB. With these designs of the LSB, it can provide excellent charge storage performance with high capacity retention. The LSB using ethylenediamine (EDA)-functionalized CFP interlayer exhibits an outstanding initial discharge capacity of 1800 mAh g−1 and 1472 mAh g−1 after the stable SEI formation with ca. 92% capacity retention and low degradation rate of 0.046% per cycle after 200 cycles at 1C.

For this purpose, heterostructures of ZrO2 coupled with BiVO4, Ag3PO4, SrTiO3 and WO3 monolayers are designed to examine their potential applications in hydrogen production and degradation of pollutants using density functional theory (DFT) + U method for the first time. The results revealed that the calculated band gaps of the heterostructures are reduced compared to the pure ZrO2, which favour redshift absorption. A type-I band alignment is attained for the BiVO4/ZrO2, Ag3PO4/ZrO2 and WO3/ZrO2 heterostructures. More importantly, a type-II staggered band alignment formed in the SrTiO3/ZrO2 heterostructure restrained the charge recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers, as well as enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In particular, suitable band alignment of SrTiO3/ZrO2 with enough driving forces for charge carrier transfer show overall water splitting and degradation of pollutant in which SrTiO3 acted as charge separation centre. Furthermore, h+, [Figure presented] and [Figure presented] radicals played a major role in the photocatalysis process of the SrTiO3/ZrO2 heterostructure. These results reveal that the ZrO2 acts as an oxidation site so that better access of electron acceptor to the interface is a significant factor that improves the photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/ZrO2 heterostructure towards H2 evolution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Band alignment; DFT + U method; Photocatalysis; Solar energy conversion; Tetragonal ZrO2","Alignment; Catalysis; Charge carriers; Density functional theory; Hydrogen production; Monolayers; Photocatalysis; Pollution; Solar energy; Strontium titanates; Water pollution; Water treatment; Band alignments; Charge carrier transfer; Degradation of pollutants; Environmental remediation; Photocatalysis process; Photocatalytic activities; Photoinduced charge carriers; Tetragonal ZrO2; Heterojunctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026265903

Powering jet injection using a controllable actuator, such as a moving-coil permanent magnet motor, offers many advantages, but to date has required large and heavy injection systems to provide the required power and control bandwidth. In order to minimize the size of the injection system, we developed a scaling model for jet injection systems powered by permanent magnet motors, giving the optimal actuator mass as a function of jet velocity, injection volume, motor efficiency, and energy storage density. We combined this model with an existing electromagnetic model to confirm the predicted scaling relationships and find optimal actuator designs. On this basis, we designed an injection system for 50 μ L volumes, including a compact power amplifier and control system, and verified its performance by performing injections into pig skin. The total mass of the injector system was 578 g, with a 178 g handpiece. This model illustrates fundamental relationships that govern the design of any jet-production device powered by linear electric motors for jet injection or other applications. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Actuators; biomedical electronics; design optimization; drug delivery; electromechanical systems","Actuators; Drug delivery; Electric motors; Energy storage; Magnets; Permanent magnets; Power amplifiers; Power control; Skin; Biomedical electronics; Design optimization; Drugs; Electromechanical systems; Permanent magnet motor; Solid model; Magnetic actuators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023634664

But, there is a serious challenge existing with solar energy. That is to storing it for usage when required. Redox capacitors have been identified as a good energy storage device and this study is based on fabricating a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and employing a redox capacitor to store solar energy produced by the DSSC. DSSC was fabricated using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with an optimized composition. Redox capacitor was based on a GPE and two identical conducting polymer electrodes. Main reason for selecting a GPE for the DSSC and the redox capacitor is that most of the research work has been carried out with liquid electrolytes and they have undergone adverse effects including short life time, leakage and spilling. Open circuit potential, short circuit current density, fill factor and efficiency of DSSC were found out as 0.68 V, 0.00033 A cm−2, 0.24 and 0.05% respectively. Redox capacitor was charged by the DSSC for 722 s and discharged galvanostatically. Within 36 s, it was possible to discharge the redox capacitor completely. The stability of the integrated device was satisfactory.

This article addresses the formulation of three models that optimize control of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in an experimental room, which are coupled with two thermal models of the indoor temperature. Electricity is supplied by the grid and a photovoltaic system with batteries. The primary objective is to maximize users comfort while minimizing cost constrained to: thermal comfort; variable electricity price; and available electricity in batteries that are charged by a PV system. Three models are developed: (i) dynamic programming with simplified thermal model (STM), (ii) genetic algorithm with STM, and (iii) genetic algorithm with EnergyPlus. The genetic algorithm model that uses EnergyPlus to simulate indoor temperature generally achieves higher convergence to the optimal value, which also is the one that uses more electricity from the PV system to operate the HVAC. The dynamic programming performs better than the genetic algorithm (both coupled with STM). However, it is limited by the fact that uses STM, which is a less accurate model to simulate indoor temperature especially because it is not considering thermal inertia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Dynamic programming; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; PV production; Storage; Thermal comfort","Air conditioning; Climate control; Costs; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Space heating; Thermal comfort; Thermography (temperature measurement); Demand response; Electricity demands; Electricity prices; Indoor temperature; Intelligent decisions; Photovoltaic systems; Primary objective; Ventilation and air conditioning; Dynamic programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022342302

For antimicrobial activity, agar disc diffusion method with E. coli as the model microorganism was used. NEs were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Both DLS and TEM gave parallel results and mean particle size were found as ∼ 100 nm for 6:4 (CO: CNO) oil phase composition. These NEs also showed high physical stability during one-month storage. NEs were also prepared by using two high-energy homogenization methods: microfluidization and ultrasonication.

State-of-the-art TES for interior items such as tiles and furnishings require the material matrix to transfer heat rapidly between the adjacent PCM and the indoors. TES developers offer a large number of PCM composites, in which, however, the high thermal conductivity counterbalances the PCM volume capacity and material form-stability above the PCM melting point. Herein, we report a novel aluminium matrix with open ultrathin (mainly, below 150 nm) pores and the developed surface area (~7 m2 g-1) that solves the dilemma. The porous (22–46 vol%) aluminium matrix results from the compacted aluminium nanoflakes reactively (1 min at 873K in N2) sintered with the aid of oxidation of the nanoflake protector, stearic acid. The preparation method leads to partial transformation of the pores and an increase of the specific surface area. In the PCM fraction range, the prepared composite has the thermal conductivity in the range of 10–60 W m-1K-1. The effects of the PCM volume fraction on the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are described. As an example, we have considered an affordable organic PCM such as coconut oil that can readily cling to the Al2O3-filmed surface of the material pores through the hydroxyl functionalities. With the use of vacuum infiltration, heated (373 K) coconut oil deeply penetrates the matrix pores. The PCM composite has shown the excellent form stability in terms of the coconut oil mass loss (below 1.5 wt%) at an elevated temperature of 318 K for over 1000 h. Applied internally, this kind of TES composite can rapidly and efficiently transfer a considerable amount of heat energy within a large building area and regulate the indoor temperature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy efficiency; Form-stability; Phase change composite; Porous aluminium composite; Smart buildings; Thermal energy storage","Aluminum; Building materials; Cooling systems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heat storage; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Phase change materials; Specific heat; Thermal energy; Vegetable oils; Aluminium composites; Form stabilities; Form stable phase change material; High thermal conductivity; Hydroxyl functionality; Partial transformation; Phase Change; Room-temperature control; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019875468

Due to its highly perishable characteristic, milk is processed into more stable milk products such as cheese, yoghurt, and butter and milk powder. Among them, milk powder is distinctive for its longer shelf life and can be stored at ambient temperature. The other advantages of milk powder are less volume requirement during its transportation and higher selling price. Therefore, it is widely used in many food products such as ice cream, bakery products, and sausages. According to a recent study on the statistics from Food and Agriculture Organization, world production of whole dried milk was 3,597,015 tonnes in 2014: Oceania 36.5%, Americas 36.1% and Europe 24.1% of the World production. Milk powder production is a process that requires high energy, especially for evaporation. Recently, reducing energy use has been gaining importance by increasing energy and exergy efficiency. Conventional energy analysis is performed based on the First Law of Thermodynamics. Unlike from the First Law, the Second Law or exergy analysis (defined as useful work) has appeared in the literature, while this analysis not only assesses quantity but also quality of energy. In this study, exergy analysis of a milk powder production system, mainly includes 3 processes (pasteurization, evaporation and spray drying) which will be presented. The aim of the study is to apply a thermodynamic analysis including comprehensive exergy analysis by using different performance parameters such as exergy efficiency, improvement potential rate, sustainability index, relative irreversibility and exergetic factor for the milk powder production system. As a result, exergetic efficiencies of the system components were found in the range of 9–83%.

The paper studied the possibility of using sources of renewable energy in combination with current diesel power plant on the island to meet the electrical load demand. There are two renewable energy sources used in this study, solar and wind energy. This study aimed to design and evaluate hybrid solar/wind/diesel/battery system in terms of cost and pollution. By using HOMER software, many simulation analyses have been proposed to find and optimize different technologies that contain wind turbine, solar photovoltaic, and diesel in combination with storage batteries for electrical generation. Four different hybrid power systems were proposed, diesel generators only, wind/diesel/battery, PV/diesel/battery, and PV/wind/diesel/battery. The analysis of the results shows that around 75 % could reduce the cost of energy by using PV/wind/diesel hybrid power system. Also, the greenhouse emission could be reduced by around 25 % compared with these by using diesel generators system that currently utilize in the Masirah Island. The solar/wind/diesel hybrid system is techno-economically viable for Masirah Island. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cost of energy; Diesel; Hybrid power system; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Wind","design; diesel; electrical power; electricity generation; equipment component; optimization; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; wind turbine; Janub ash Sharqiyah; Masirah Island; Oman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976383894

The Mediterranean region is among the most arid regions in the world and hosts more than the half of the world’s water-poor population. The situation is more severe in the southern shore of the Mediterranean, in particular, the Maghreb countries. In this region, water resources are very limited and polluted and most countries rely on groundwater yet overexploited. On the other hand, several factors, including rapid economic growth, expanding populations and changing climate, are driving up demand for water. This pushes forward the Maghreb countries to more and more rely on non-conventional and costly water resources such as wastewater treatment and desalination. Obviously, this bears a heavy burden on the economic growth within these countries. In this paper, rationalizing the virtual water trade and enhancing desalination using renewable energy are presented as two promising options to bridging the Maghreb’s water gap. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Renewable energy; Virtual water; Water shortages; Water-energy nexus","arid region; climate change; demand analysis; desalination; economic growth; exploitation; renewable resource; wastewater treatment; water resource; water storage; Maghreb; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973604775

Essential work of fracture (EWF) analysis was conducted to analyze the effect of chain extender loading level on the fractural properties of composites. Three different wt% levels of chain extender were used (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%). Results of EWF analysis revealed that 1.0 wt% PBO addition made a great contribution to the fracture energy of the composites. In addition to this, tensile test results showed that while 1.0 wt% PBO addition resulted in a significant increase in tensile strain of composites, 2.0 wt% PBO addition resulted in a significant increase in tensile strength. Dynamic mechanical analysis test results indicated that 2.0 wt% PBO added composites exhibited the highest storage modulus and the lowest tan delta peak height.

However, the effect of its crystallographic phase on charge storage performances and mechanisms is not yet clear. Herein, MnO2-based supercapacitors with different structures including nanospheres, nanorods, nanotubes, and nanosheets have been fabricated and investigated. Among such structures, δ-MnO2 nanosheets exhibit the highest specific capacitance of 194.3 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 when compared with other phases and shapes.

Thus, storing of solar energy is important. One of the popular methods of heat storage is use of phase change materials (PCMs) which have large thermal energy storage capacity. In this study, the heat storage tank in a domestic solar water heating system was chosen as control volume. The experiments were performed in the province of Elazıg, Turkey, in November when solar radiation was weak due to cloudy sky. The heat storage tank of the system was modified to fill PCM between insulation and hot water part. A few PCMs which are Potassium Fluoride, Lithium Metaborate Dihydrate, Strontium Hydroxide Octahydrate, Barium Hydroxide Octahydrate, Aluminum Ammonium Sulfate, and Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate were analyzed to proper operating conditions using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and the best PCM was obtained with the Aluminum Ammonium Sulfate and Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate mixture. Thus, eutectic PCM was obtained and used in a heat storage tank of the solar water heating system. Energy and exergy analysis of heat storage tank was performed with and without the PCM.

In the European Union (EU), electric motors and the drive systems are estimated to account for about 70% of all industrial electricity consumption. Therefore, mandatory applications accrue from the legislation of governments or unions like the EU for customs and market surveillance or eco-design requirements. The mandatory applications and the global market size find out the necessity of efficiency measurement. There are several compliance and precompliance efficiency test methods in the literature. The compliance tests should execute reliable, accurate, and reproducible results. The purpose of this paper is to define a simple field method that will be used for measuring and determining in-service efficiency at industrial conditions. The proposed method in this paper is an inexpensive and easy method that would help to energy managers and engineers to make correct decision in replacing inefficient motors with efficient and new ones. In this paper, a novel induction motor-efficiency model function has been proposed based on the International Electrotechnical Commission 60034-2-1 standard equations, and a new field test procedure has been used in efficiency estimation. The new efficiency model function variables and constants are determined from the regression analysis, which depends on 86 tests of 437 different load points' efficiency data. Furthermore, the proposed field test procedure, equations, and compliance test methods are tested on a sample motor in laboratory, and the results are compared to each other. © 2017 IEEE.","Efficiency measurement; Energy efficiency; Energy measurement; Induction motors; Standards; Testing","Commerce; Digital storage; Electric losses; Electric motors; Electric power measurement; Electric power utilization; Estimation; Induction motors; International trade; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Standards; Testing; Efficiency measurement; Electricity-consumption; Europe; IEC standards; Induction motor efficiency; Industrial conditions; International Electrotechnical Commission; Loss measurement; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030635279

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a longitudinal qualitative study starting in 2011 with a project-based network learning course with 15 SME wind farm suppliers and follow-up interviews with 10 SMEs and continued with interviews conducted with 20 individual enterprises within operation and maintenance conducted in 2014-2015. Findings: The findings reveal challenges as well as opportunities for innovation collaboration between larger enterprises and SMEs to contribute to the innovation and competitiveness of the offshore wind farm sector. A glass ceiling is revealed for demand-driven positions if the SME does not possess rare and specific valuable knowledge. There are opportunities revealed in general for supplier-driven positions if SME suppliers can collaborate and develop interesting solutions for larger enterprises. If SMEs succeed in either of these aims, the SMEs have an opportunity to attain partner-driven collaboration. However, challenges are present according to the understanding of the different organisational approaches in SMEs and larger enterprises and in the different business approaches. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to the offshore wind energy sector. Further research is needed for verification of the findings in other energy sectors.

Better data, more distributed and dynamic resources, and improvements in supporting infrastructure represent an opportunity for an electric system to operate more reliably with less environmental impact and through competitive markets that yield economically efficient rates. The twentieth-century framework for regulating grid operations advanced last year, when the Supreme Court upheld Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 745 and the Commission's authority to pay demand response as much as generation for comparable benefits to the grid. However, the Court also upheld Order 745's net benefits test, which says that demand response is only comparable to generation when it lowers wholesale rates. This Note argues that the net benefits test is a flawed indicator of when demand response is comparably valuable to generation. Moreover, it contravenes the rationale for the Commission's market-based rates authority by focusing on whether rates are low, rather than efficient. This matters because it could unnecessarily limit competition in wholesale markets between traditional generation and non-conventional, demand-side and storage resources, and disproportionately prioritize the interests of market buyers. As an alternative, this Note proposes that the Commission leverage grid-edge data and technology to better define and differentiate between demand resources, and take steps to address externalities. This would promote more efficient market operations, facilitate a just and reasonable balance among the modern electric system's diverse interests, and ensure that demand response receives equal compensation when it maximizes societal value, rather than minimizes cost.

Despite tremendous advancement made in high-capacity flow posolyte, lithium metal has been dominantly exploited as a nonflowable counter electrode in reported lithium-based RFBs to date due to the lack of efficient and high-capacity flow negolyte. Here, we report a silicon-carbon nanocomposite semi-solid negolyte, achieving a high reversible capacity (&gt;1200 mAh g-1) and stable cycle life (&gt;100 cycles). A facile process of incipient wetness impregnation followed by polymerization/carbonization is developed to synthesize monodispersed Si-C nanocomposite with ultrathin graphitic carbon coating. Exploiting Si-C nanocomposite as the negolyte effectively suppresses the volume change of Si particles and enhances the electrical conductivity of the negolyte.

At low nanofiller concentration, the valuable properties of polymers are preserved and the feasibility of the composite is promoted. In this work, an organically modified clay (OMC) was utilized to alter the structure and consequently the electrical resistivity of carbon nanotubes (CNT)/polypropylene (PP) composite. As a result of OMC incorporation, the electrical percolation threshold concentration (EPTC) was reduced from 1.0 wt% CNT for the CNT/PP composite to 0.5 wt% CNT for the CNT:OMC/PP composite, corresponding to 50% reduction in the amount of CNT. The macro-dispersion analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the dispersion of CNT in the CNT/PP and CNT:OMC/PP composites. However, the processing behavior analysis showed a significant decrease in mixing torque and consequently mixing energy due to the addition of OMC. The decrease in mixing torque and/or mixing energy decreases the destruction of CNT aspect ratio. In addition, the DSC analysis showed a decrease in composite crystallinity due to OMC addition. This finding reveals a thinner insulating crystalline layer at the surface of CNT particles and consequently higher electrical conductivity. Based on these experimental findings, it can be speculated that the addition of OMC promoted the conductivity of the composite by decreasing the mixing shear stress and/or polymer crystallinity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanotubes; Electrical properties; Hybrid composites; Microstructures; Nanocomposite","Aspect ratio; Carbon; Compounding (chemical); Dispersions; Electric conductivity; Electric properties; Microstructure; Mixing; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Polymers; Shear stress; Solvents; Yarn; Dispersion analysis; Electrical conductivity; Electrical percolation threshold; Electrically conductive polymers; Hybrid composites; Polymer crystallinity; Polymer nanocomposite; Research challenges; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020808796

Global population increase puts a lot of stress on current water desalination plants to meet the rising demand for freshwater and requires an increase in capacity. Conventional desalination plants are powered by fossil fuels and hence are a major cause of climate change as well as being unsustainable in the long term. There is a need to develop a sustainable desalination process, which does not contribute to climate change and is also economically competitive. Coupling solar thermal energy with the multi-effect distillation (MED) process is one of the most promising alternatives. This paper reviews extensively research on coupling solar thermal energy with MED from a technical and economic point of view. The MED process is discussed, the most suitable solar collectors are presented and various plant configurations are critically analyzed. The review highlighted the advances in knowledge obtained from experimental and modeling research studies. In addition, the main challenges in solar-driven MED such as storage, adaptability issues and cost are discussed. The review also provides general remarks about the literature and research gaps that should be addressed in the future. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

For conventional generation technologies, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a well-known metric. In the context of electricity storage however, such LCOE-like metrics are only limitedly applicable as the finite energy storage capacity can limit the charge and discharge scheduling decisions of the storage operator. In addition, the “fuel”, i.e., charged electricity, and “generated electricity”, i.e., discharged electricity, is one and the same commodity which provides the opportunity to use an adapted levelized cost metric. This work analyzes three different levelized cost metrics and their application to electricity storage units used for electric energy arbitrage. The strengths and shortcomings of these storage cost metrics are analyzed in order to determine how they can be applied correctly. This analysis results in the following recommendations. First, it is recommended to use a levelized cost metric in combination with an analysis of a representative price profile upon which the storage operator will act. This allows a more accurate estimation of the number of charging and discharging hours and the associated charging cost and discharging revenue, given the energy storage capacity constraints of the storage unit. Second, when a number of different representative price profiles, hence with different charging costs, is available, it is recommended to use a cost metric which is independent of the charging cost as this single metric can be compared to each price profile, thereby facilitating the interpretation of the results. The results and conclusions from this work provide a framework on how to use levelized cost metrics in the context of electricity storage. Such metrics may help policy makers and investors in prioritizing energy storage investment decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Discharge price; Levelized cost metric; Operational profit; Price spread; Storage investor","Costs; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Financial markets; Investments; Charge and discharge; Conventional generation; Electric energy arbitrages; Energy storage capacity; Investment decisions; Levelized cost of electricities; Levelized costs; Price spread; Cost benefit analysis; cost analysis; electricity generation; price dynamics; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033389959

In this paper, melting of n-eicosane as a PCM inside two orientations of triangular containers is investigated numerically. The one storage cavity is a lower-base container (LBC) and the other is the upper-base container (UBC). The heat is supplied on one side while the other two sides are thermally insulated. The parametric study analyzes the effects of the temperature of a hot wall, the size of the container, and subcooling parameter on the melting process inside two orientations of the cavity. The simulated results unfold that melting rate and the resulting acceleration in charging time is higher in the UBC than that in the LBC. The hot-wall temperature and the size of the container have significant effects on the melt fraction and melting rate.

However, their commercial utilisation is limited by their finite shelf life, both in storage and in formulations. Thus, efficient storage in the formulation of EPNs is essential so as to attain success in integrated insect pest management strategies. This paper reviews the latest information that is available on EPN storage, formulation, quality and application methods, coupled with improvement strategies for the effective control of insects. Nematode survival mechanisms investigated were heat and cold tolerance, desiccation, osmotic stress, hypoxia and energy reserves, among others, in storage, field or formulations. Their influence on the formulation of EPNs is also discussed. © Entomological Society of Southern Africa.","above-ground application; formulation; Galleria mellonella; Heterorhabditis; shelf life; Steinernema; survival; virulence.",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031097062

The use of Electrochemical Quartz-Crystal Microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D) was shown to be extremely advantageous to distinguish between the effectively viscoelastic and rigid states of LFP and LFP/PVdF electrodes, respectively, based already on the raw EQCM-D (i.e. recording resonant frequency and resonance width changes of the electrode on multiple overtone orders). The approach that we developed for testing composite battery and supercapacitor electrodes is quite general, and includes mechanical characterizations of the electrodes in air, in contact with liquids and electrolyte solutions, and most importantly, during combined electrochemical and mechanical characterization of battery electrodes subjected to Li-ions insertion/extraction. A new theory of hydrodynamic admittance of porous semispherical bumps has been developed and successfully applied for the characterization of rigid porous LFP/PVdF composite electrode in its both intercalated and deintercalated states. We show that the extended Voight-type viscoelastic model describes quantitatively the intercalated and deintercalated states of LFP electrode coating containing soft Mg(OH)2 binder.

The selective β3-adrenergic agonist, CL316243 (1 mg/kg/d, i.p.) caused a greater increase in metabolic rate in EP4-knockout mice. CL316243 fragmented the unilocular lipid droplet into multilocular lipid vacuoles and increased mitochondrial biogenesis and its activity. These changes were amplified in mice with EP4 deficiency and were selectively seen in subcutaneous WAT. The expression of fat-specific protein (FSP)-27, a protein that promotes fusion of triglycerides and formation of unilocular lipid droplets were diminished, whereas the expression of phosphorylated AMPK, the upstream regulator of FSP27, was enhanced in EP4-deficient mice. The present study showed that EP4 acts as a negative regulator of WAT remodeling, it tightly coordinates rates of triglyceride storage in lipid droplets and mitochondrial respiratory function in subcutaneous white adipocytes through the phosphorylated AMPK-FSP27 signaling axis. Thus, deletion of EP4 increases mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in WAT, and fat mass loss ensues in mice. © FASEB.","CL316243; FSP27; Mitochondrial biogenesis; Phosphorylation AMPK; WAT remodeling","5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; adenylate kinase; fat droplet; fat specific protein 27; messenger RNA; mitochondrial protein; prostaglandin E receptor 4; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; 1,3 dioxolane derivative; disodium (R,R)-5-(2-((2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)-amino)propyl)-1,3-benzodioxole-2,3-dicarboxylate; lipid; prostaglandin E receptor 4; Ptger4 protein, mouse; Ucp1 protein, mouse; uncoupling protein 1; AMPK signaling; animal tissue; Article; beta adrenergic stimulation; cell vacuole; controlled study; fat mass; gene expression; metabolic rate; mitochondrial biogenesis; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; subcutaneous white adipose tissue; white adipocyte; animal; chemistry; drug effects; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; mitochondrion; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; subcutaneous fat; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Dioxoles; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipids; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria; Oxidation-Reduction; Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype; Subcutaneous Fat; Uncoupling Protein 1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028928075

Previously, we showed that MC-SFAs prevent body fat accumulation, despite weight gain. Here, we aim to explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of MC-SFAs on body fat gain.Methods:The DairyHealth study examined the long-Term effects of milk protein and milk fat with a low or high content of MC-SFA. In this 12 week, randomized, double-blind, diet intervention study, participants consumed 60 g milk protein (whey or casein) and 63 g milk fat (high MC-SFA or low MC-SFA) daily in a two by two factorial design. We used microarrays to measure whole genome gene expression changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue in a subpopulation of 12 participants, 6 in the low MC-SFA+casein group and 6 in the high MC-SFA+casein group. Gene expression of several genes that were found to be changed by MC-SFAs was confirmed in the full study population using qPCR.Results:High MC-SFA resulted in an upregulation of gene expression related to citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, and a downregulation of gene expression related to complement system and inflammation.Conclusions:We hypothesize that the beneficial effects of MC-SFAs on prevention of fat accumulation are mediated via increased gene expression related to energy metabolism in the adipose tissue. Decreases in inflammation-related gene expression may have beneficial effects in relation to cardiometabolic diseases. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"casein; milk fat; milk protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; STAT6 protein; fatty acid; milk protein; abdominal obesity; ACOX1 gene; adult; Article; body fat; citric acid cycle; complement system; controlled study; diet therapy; DLAT gene; double blind procedure; down regulation; energy metabolism; female; gene; gene expression; human; human tissue; IDH3B gene; IKBKB gene; inflammation; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; NFKB1 gene; oxidative phosphorylation; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein interaction; randomized controlled trial; SDHB gene; SLC25A10 gene; subcutaneous fat; upregulation; weight change; whey; abdominal obesity; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; caloric intake; chemistry; energy metabolism; gene expression; intra-abdominal fat; metabolism; physiology; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Caseins; Double-Blind Method; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Milk Proteins; Obesity, Abdominal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028818790

The method is in line with the provisions of the Greek grid code for non-interconnected islands regarding the operation of HPSs. The goal of the HPS producer is to construct a single energy offer/bid for the total daily production/absorption, which maximizes his profits in the day-ahead market and minimizes any imbalance penalties during real-time operation. To this purpose, a two-stage stochastic bilevel optimization model is formulated, where the uncertainty lies in the wind power production of both the WFs belonging to the hybrid producer (internal WFs-IWFs) and the WFs belonging to other independent producers (WFs external to the HPS-EWFs). The upper level of the proposed bilevel model represents the hybrid producer's profit maximization, while the lower level represents the system operator's (SO) market clearing problem. This stochastic bilevel model is finally converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model in order to be tractable. Finally, simulation results from two test cases are thoroughly discussed and useful conclusions are drawn. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Hybrid power stations; insular power systems; MPEC; profit maximization; pumped-hydro storage; wind energy","Commerce; Electric power system interconnection; Integer programming; Optimization; Profitability; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Bi-level optimization models; Daily production; Hybrid power stations; Mixed integer linear programming model; MPEC; Profit maximization; Real-time operation; Wind power production; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028814603

The potential use of bambusurils in energy-storage systems and in processes related to ion-channel diseases are undoubtedly examples of emerging applications. Their multifaceted properties are, so far, very little explored and recent efforts have set the basis for a better understanding of the binding behavior of bambusuril derivatives, able to form stable complexes with various anionic molecules. This review focuses on the key advances pertaining to bambusurils, including structural variations, methods of synthesis and corresponding physical and chemical properties. The main factors affecting the stability and structure of the respective inclusion complexes are outlined. Challenges regarding computational approaches for predicting properties of these host-guest systems are also discussed. Computational insight is particularly valuable to improve and fine-tune the conformation and ion affinity of bambusurils, being crucial to reinforce anion recognition properties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anion receptors; Bambusurils; Host-guest systems; Supramolecular chemistry","Supramolecular chemistry; Anion receptor; Bambusurils; Computational approach; Emerging applications; Energy storage systems; Host-guest system; Physical and chemical properties; Structural variations; Ions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025159030

In this paper we show an approach to quantify the heat fluxes into a groundwater body differentiating between near surface soil temperatures under grass, forest, asphalt, agriculture and surface water bodies and heat fluxes from subsurface structures like heated basements or sewage pipes. Based on observed time series of near surface soil temperatures we establish individual parameters (e.g. shift, moving average) of a simple empirical function that relates air temperature to soil temperature. This procedure is useful since air temperature time series are readily available and the complex energy flux processes at the soil atmosphere interface do not need to be described in detail. To quantify the heat flux from heated subsurface structures that have lesser depths to the groundwater table the 1D heat conduction module SoilTemp is developed. Based on soil temperature time series observed at different depths in a research lysimeter heat conduction and heat storage capacity values are calibrated disregarding their dependence on the water content. With SoilTemp the strong interaction between time series of groundwater temperature and groundwater level, near surface soil temperatures and the basement temperatures in heated buildings could be evaluated showing the dynamic nature of thermal gradients. The heat fluxes from urban areas are calculated considering the land use patterns within a spatial unit by mixing the heat fluxes from basements with those under grass and asphalt. The heat fluxes from sewage pipes and of sewage leakage are shown to be negligible for evaluated pipe diameters and sewage discharges. The developed methodology will allow to parameterize the upper boundary of heat transport models and to differentiate between the heat fluxes from different surface usages and their dynamics into the subsurface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater heat transport; Groundwater temperature; Near surface soil temperatures; SoilTemp; Subsurface heat flux","Aquifers; Asphalt; Buildings; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Heat conduction; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Land use; Sewage; Soils; Surface waters; Temperature; Time series; Empirical functions; Groundwater temperatures; Heat storage capacity; Heat transport; Heat transport model; Near surfaces; SoilTemp; Subsurface structures; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; air-soil interaction; aquifer; asphalt; energy flux; grass; groundwater; groundwater-surface water interaction; heat flux; land use; soil temperature; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; temperature gradient; thermal conductivity; time series; urban area; water level; water temperature; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025082689

The two species displayed distinct differential seasonal patterns of lipid partitioning when collected from their natural habitat at times when species-specific maxima and minima in total fatty acids (TFA) concentrations occurred. F. serratus contained highest levels of TFA (40.07 mg g− 1 DW) and triacylglycerols (TAG) (26.83 mg g− 1 DW) during summer (July), in association with lowest levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 30.2% of TFA) and pigments (1.44 mg g− 1 DW chlorophyll a). In P. palmata, high levels of TFA (13.00 mg g− 1 DW) were observed during spring (May), with high levels of polar lipids (10.00 mg g− 1 DW) rich in PUFA (52.3% of TFA), and high levels of pigments (1.25 mg g− 1 DW chlorophyll a and 10.88 mg g− 1 DW phycoerythrin). The results suggest that summer-acclimated F. serratus diverted excess energy into storage lipids (TAG), while P. palmata was more sensitive and susceptible to degradation of its chloroplast membranes, resulting in a decrease in TFA, PUFA-rich polar lipids and pigments, and a release of FFA. The ability to accumulate TAG may be a key factor allowing acclimation to environmental stressors for F. serratus, a species with broader vertical distribution than P. palmata which is restricted to low-intertidal and upper subtidal shores in western Ireland. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acclimation; Fatty acids; Lipids; Macroalgae; PUFA; Seasonal variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023643064

It is organized in two parts: (1) the first part covers the morpho-structural characterization of nanocomposites and paper sheets (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray) and explores some properties of the papers sheets (photocatalytic activity, wettability, barrier properties); (2) in the second part, the comparative efficiency of papers in the bread storage is discussed in terms of acidity, nutritional parameters (total fat, proteins and carbohydrates) and yeasts and molds charge. Morpho-structural investigations revealed a heterogeneous distribution of nanocomposites in the cellulose network as single particles or agglomerates. The higher content of active agents in the P–Ag–TiO2–Z positively affects the hydrophobicity, roughness, photocatalytic activity, opacity and water vapor permeability the most as compared to P–P (plain paper), P–TiO2 and P–Ag–TiO2. The free channels inside the zeolite structure result in the poorest barrier properties against air and grease of P–Ag–TiO2–Z and the highest food simulants–paper contact angles. Packaging tests indicate P–Ag–TiO2 as the most effective in the preservation of nutritional compounds in the bread. In return, P–Ag–TiO2–Z prolongs the microbiological safety of bread in terms of yeasts and molds content for 10 days at 20 °C and 12 days at 4 °C, 2 days longer than the second-ranked P–Ag–TiO2. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Active cellulose papers; Ag; Bread packaging; Nanocomposites; TiO2; Zeolite","Cellulose; Characterization; Electron microscopy; Food products; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mechanical permeability; Molds; Nanocomposites; Packaging; Paper; Photocatalysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Yeast; Zeolites; Active cellulose; Comparative efficiencies; Energy dispersive x-ray; Heterogeneous distributions; Photocatalytic activities; Structural characterization; Structural investigation; Water vapor permeability; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021842756

O. Kuntze] can be processed into different products such as black tea, green tea and oolong tea. Black tea is the mostly consumed worldwide among these products. Black tea production is achieved by a series of processing steps namely withering, rolling, fermentation, drying, sieving and packaging. Rolling is one of the most important steps in the production as it ensures uniform maceration of tea leaves and promotes oxidation reactions catalysed by phenol oxidase enzymes during the fermentation process. The rolling of tea leaves is generally performed by either Crushing-Tearing-Curling (CTC), rotorvane or Orthodox methods. However, in Turkey, rolling is also performed using a combination of rotorvane and orthodox which is called the “ÇAYKUR” method. The rolling method provides a unique taste and flavours. Thus, this study was conducted to compare volatile constituents of the black teas produced by the above rolling methods and to determine the volatiles during the 6-month storage period. Some specific compounds such as 2,6-nonadienal, 3-hexen-2-one and dodecanal for ÇAYKUR, 2,5-octanedione for Orthodox and methylpyrazine for CTC were identified to differentiate the rolling system. This study also showed that a few compounds can be used as markers of storage. The number and amounts of volatiles, especially compounds with a high molecular weight, increased by storage. In addition, the flavour quality of the teas was evaluated by the Wickremasinghe–Yamanishi ratio (WYR), Mahanta ratio (MR) and Owuor Flavour Index.

Solar desalination can be used to produce fresh water from brackish water to supply isolated, low-density, population areas located in southern Algeria where solar energy and underground saline water are abundant. This article aims to improve the yield of a solar still by improving absorber performance through the use of an added inner heat storage system. To do this, we tested covering the absorber surface with layers of blackened sponge. The resultant heat storage is used to keep the operating temperature of the absorber high enough to produce distilled water when solar irradiance is low or during night time. Four small-scale solar powered distillation pilot units were set up and operated. The experiments carried out in the “Process Engineering Laboratory of Ouargla University” studied the effect of sponge thickness on the productivity of the solar still. The results obtained showed that a 0.5 cm sponge thickness increased the yield by 57.77% i.e. 58%, relative to the baseline case (i.e. with no blackened sponge added). In contrast, asponge thickness of 1.0 cm resulted in a yield improvement of only 23.03%, whereas a sponge thickness of 1.5 cm resulted in a decreased yield of 29.95% i.e. 30% (relative to the baseline case). © 2017","Desalination; Single slope basin still; Solar energy; Sponge; Storage medium","Desalination; Distillation; Heat storage; Laboratories; Saline water; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Engineering laboratories; Heat storage systems; Operating temperature; Single slopes; Solar desalination; Sponge; Storage medium; Yield Improvement; Solar absorbers; absorption; baseline conditions; brackish water; desalination; drinking water; irradiation; performance assessment; solar power; water supply; water treatment plant",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020261587

Ten days of storage at 50MPa resulted in a microbial growth evolution similar to RF, while at 75/100MPa were observed microbial load reductions on endogenous and inoculated microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua, whose counts were reduced to below the detection limit of 1.00 log CFU/mL), resulting in a shelf-life extension compared to RF. The physicochemical parameters remained stable at 75MPa when compared to the initial raw juice, except for browning degree that increased 1.72-fold, whilst at 100MPa were observed higher colour variations, attributed to a lycopene content decrease (25%), as well as reductions on peroxidase residual activity (16.8%) after 10days, while both polyphenol oxidase and pectin methylesterase residual activities were similar to RF. These outcomes hint HS as a reliable alternative to RF as a new food preservation methodology, allowing energy savings and shelf-life extension of food products. This is the first paper studying the effect of HS on inoculated microorganisms and on a broad number of physicochemical parameters and on endogenous enzymatic activities, for a preservation length surpassing the shelf-life by RF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Enzymes; Hyperbaric storage; Refrigeration; Shelf-life; Watermelon juice","Atmospheric pressure; Energy conservation; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Food products; Food storage; Microorganisms; Refrigeration; Enzymatic activities; Pectin methylesterase; Physicochemical parameters; Polyphenol oxidase; Shelf life; Shelf life extensions; Storage condition; Watermelon juices; Food preservation; carboxylesterase; catechol oxidase; enzyme; pectinesterase; peroxidase; bacterial load; Citrullus; cold; comparative study; Escherichia coli; food control; food preservation; food storage; fruit and vegetable juice; growth, development and aging; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; Listeria; microbiology; procedures; time factor; Bacterial Load; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Catechol Oxidase; Citrullus; Cold Temperature; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Food Microbiology; Food Preservation; Food Storage; Fruit and Vegetable Juices; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Listeria; Peroxidase; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019916227

The nonmonetary time value represents the accumulated time that a deferrable device has been staying in the system to provide operational support without affecting customer satisfaction. The time value pricing avoids impractically estimating the cost for a delayed or interrupted service but still achieves effective load shaping as demonstrated by the IEEE 4-bus distribution test system implementation. Marginal values from the optimal schedule are expressed in terms of the time value, which can be reconciled to the annualized investment cost savings for distributed energy resource pricing purpose.

Choosing the optimal storage material remains a great challenge. From the literature, it is understood that the natural rock is a good suitable material for TES in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. However, not much work has been published on the behavior of rock and its suitability for TES. This paper evaluates the potential of rocks as candidate materials for use in high temperature thermal storage. On one hand, we provide literatures on sensible heat storage (SHS) materials and works carried out on packed rock beds, and on the other hand, experimental tests are conducted and data are analyzed and discussed in order to choose the best rocks among fifty two varieties.

Furthermore, Sertoli cells can oxidize fatty acids, a metabolic process that is assumed to fulfill their own energy requirements. Fatty acids are stored as triacylglycerides within lipid droplets. The regulation of fatty acid storage in conjunction with the regulation of lactate production may thus be relevant to seminiferous tubule physiology. Our aim is to evaluate a possible means of regulation by the PPARγ activation of lipid droplet formation and lactate production. Sertoli cell cultures obtained from 20-day-old rats were incubated with Rosiglitazone (10 μM), a PPARγ activator, for various periods of time (6, 12, 24 and 48 h). Increased triacylglycerides levels and lipid droplet content were observed, accompanied by a rise in the expression of genes for proteins involved in fatty acid storage, such as the fatty acid transporter Cd36, glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferases 1 and 3, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and perilipins 1, 2 and 3, all proteins that participate in lipid droplet formation and stabilization. However, PPARγ activation increased lactate production, accompanied by an augmentation in glucose uptake and Glut2 expression. These results taken together suggest that PPARγ activation in Sertoli cells participates in the regulation of lipid storage and lactate production thereby ensuring simultaneously the energetic metabolism for the Sertoli and germ cells. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Lactate; Lipid droplets; Perilipins; PPARγ; Sertoli cells","adipophilin; CD36 antigen; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; fat droplet; fatty acid transporter; glucose transporter 2; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase 1; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase 3; lactic acid; mannose 6 phosphate receptor binding protein 1; perilipin 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; fat droplet; glucose; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; acid secretion; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; controlled study; culture medium; energy metabolism; gene expression; glucose transport; Glut2 gene; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; Sertoli cell; animal; biological model; biosynthesis; cytology; drug effect; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; Sertoli cell; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Glucose; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactic Acid; Lipid Droplets; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Models, Biological; PPAR gamma; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Rosiglitazone; Sertoli Cells; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018851768

A Mn thickness gradient film superimposed on a homogenous Zn layer was successfully prepared using the thermal co-evaporation technique. Heat treatment of the sandwich structure leads to oxide formation, whereas, the composition and structure of the resulting oxides is a function of the overlying Mn-film thickness. Studies of morphology, composition, topography and surface potential of the metallic as well as of the oxide film have been performed. All results show a strongly dependent correlation to the thickness of the Mn film. Two main nanostructures of the oxide film were obtained – nanoneedles and nanowalls. Based on these findings, oxide growth mechanisms are proposed. Thus, it is possible to create a certain composition and structure of an oxide solely by applying a distinct amount of the upper metallic layer. The most important specific oxides formed were Mn3O4, ZnMn2O4, MnO, and ZnO. Regarding the energy storage, these materials are important for further development and capability improvement of these devices. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effect of homogenization methods in terms of rotor–stator (RSH) and ultrasonic (UH) were also examined on MEVOP along storage period. The physical and chemical properties of MEVOP obtained either RSH or UH showed that water activity, tapped density, Carr index (flowability), caking degree, surface oil content, peroxide value (PV) and free fatty acid (FFA) significantly increased, while bulk density, microencapsulation efficiency (ME), total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity significantly decreased during storage at 4, 25 and 60 °C. However, as the particle size of MEVOPs stored at 4 °C decreased along storage time, particle size of samples stored at 25 and 60 °C increased due to increase in surface oil content and particle–particle cohesion. The MEVOPs stored 4 and 25 °C had higher particle density compared to the sample stored at 60 °C during storage. Rapid changes in antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of MEVOP were also determined during storage with increased storage temperature.

Neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and circumventricular organs express MR, which mediate selectively the action of aldosterone on salt appetite, sympathetic outflow and volume regulation. The MR-containing NTS neurons innervate limbic-forebrain circuits enabling aldosterone to also modulate reciprocally arousal, motivation, fear and reward. MR expressed in abundance in this limbic-forebrain circuitry, is target of cortisol and corticosterone in modulation of appraisal processes, memory performance and selection of coping strategy. Complementary to this role of limbic MR is the action mediated by the lower affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which promote subsequently memory storage of the experience and facilitate behavioral adaptation. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that an imbalance between MR- and GR-mediated actions compromises resilience and adaptation to stress. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aldosterone; Brain; Corticosterone; Cortisol; Glucocorticoid receptors; Mineralocorticoid receptors; Salt appetite; Stress","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; corticosterone; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; hydrocortisone; mineralocorticoid receptor; progesterone; mineralocorticoid receptor; adaptation; behavior; brain function; cardiovascular function; chronic stress; coping behavior; electrolyte balance; energy metabolism; human; nerve excitability; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; Review; sodium appetite; sodium balance; solitary tract nucleus; steroid binding; adaptation; animal; brain; mental stress; metabolism; physiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Brain; Humans; Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; Stress, Psychological; Water-Electrolyte Balance",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010985278

Glucocorticoids, the main regulators of energy balance and response to stress, have been associated with the development of metabolic disturbances. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of fructose overconsumption and/or chronic stress on glucocorticoid signalization and lipid metabolism in female rat adipose tissue. Methods: We examined the effects of fructose-enriched diet and chronic unpredictable stress, separately and in combination, on glucocorticoid signaling in terms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD1)-catalyzed corticosterone regeneration, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) intracellular distribution, hormone binding and transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase) and lipogenesis (lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of adult female rats. Additionally, the nuclear level of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was analyzed. Results: The combination of stress and fructose-enriched diet led to an elevation in HSD1 expression and intracellular corticosterone concentration, whereas GR nuclear accumulation was enhanced after separate treatments. Furthermore, fructose was shown to induce the expression of all examined lipogenic genes and nuclear accumulation of PPARγ, thereby stimulating adipogenesis, while stress upregulated HSL, reducing the adipose tissue mass regardless of fructose consumption. Conclusions: Prolonged overconsumption of fructose and chronic exposure to stress promote opposite effects on lipid metabolism in the VAT of adult female rats and suggest that these effects could be mediated by glucocorticoids. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chronic unpredictable stress; Female rats; Fructose; Glucocorticoid receptor; Lipid metabolism; Visceral adipose tissue","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; corticosterone; fatty acid synthase; fructose; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; lipoprotein lipase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); sterol regulatory element binding protein; triacylglycerol lipase; 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; cholesterol esterase; corticosterone; fatty acid synthase; fructose; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; lipoprotein lipase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP); adipocyte; adipogenesis; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; caloric intake; cellular distribution; chronic unpredictable stress; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; energy consumption; female; hormone binding; intraperitoneal fat; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; morphometry; nonhuman; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; steroid binding; sugar intake; transcription regulation; upregulation; animal; diet; disease model; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; intra-abdominal fat; lipid metabolism; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; physiological stress; physiology; Wistar rat; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Animals; Corticosterone; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Acid Synthases; Female; Fructose; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucocorticoids; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoprotein Lipase; Obesity; Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (ATP); PPAR gamma; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Sterol Esterase; Stress, Physiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975318801

This problem can be solved out by ensuring low-voltage ride-through capability of wind power plants, through a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The purpose of this study is to reveal that the system can be recovered well by inserting a STATCOM with energy storage to a bus where a double-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm has been connected, so the bus voltage is maintained within desired limits during a fault. Moreover, a supercapacitor is used as an energy storage element. Modeling of the DFIG and STATCOM along with the nonlinear supercapacitor was carried out in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. The behaviors of the system under three- and two-phase faults have been compared with and without STATCOM-supercapacitor, by observing the parameters of DFIG output voltage, active power, speed, electrical torque variations, and d–q axis stator current variations. It was found that the system became stable in a short time when the STATCOM-supercapacitor was incorporated into the full-order modeled DFIG. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM); Supercapacitor; Symmetric and asymmetric fault","Capacitors; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Electric power factor correction; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Static synchronous compensators; Wind power; Double fed induction generator; Doubly fed induction generators; Electrical torques; Low-voltage ride-through; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Static synchronous compensator STATCOM; Storage elements; Super capacitor; Asynchronous generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957597384

However, a less explored possibility is to use, in addition, the internal cavity. Here we explore, through classical molecular dynamics, the possibility of boring channels across the hNP wall by collision with solid Pd nanoprojectiles at high velocities, as well as their resilience to maintain their spherical geometry. We choose a stable hNP with an inner diameter of 13 nm and an outer diameter of 15 nm. The projectiles are Pd NPs of 1.5, 2.4, and 3.0 nm, respectively. We consider collision speeds between 3 and 15 km/s, with an impact parameter between 0 to 7 nm. Four different regimes, as a function of kinetic energy and impact parameter of the projectile, are found. For low speeds, the projectile is not able to penetrate the target and only creates surface craters. For a narrow range of intermediate speeds, the projectile enters the target, but the hNP shell is able to self-heal, either totally or partially. For large speeds, the projectile penetrates the target without altering its spherical hollow geometry, but for even larger speeds, the hNP collapses into a solid structure. The specific threshold speed for each regime depends on the mass and speed of the projectile. In all noncollapsing cases, the results show a linear relationship between projectile kinetic energy and crater or perforation size. We also studied its behavior when the hNP suffers successive collisions, finding that it keeps its hollow shape but forms faceted structures, such as nanoframes or hollow cuboctahedron nanoparticles. All of our results suggest that Pd hNPs, with adequate combinations of external radius and thickness are very robust, can withstand hypervelocity impacts and that channels can be opened to allow molecules to reach the internal cavity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Hydrogen storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Molecular dynamics; Nanoparticles; Projectiles; Classical molecular dynamics; Faceted structures; Hollow nanoparticles; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hypervelocity impacts; Linear relationships; Palladium nanoparticles; Spherical geometries; Speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028299404

Li4Ti5O12 was synthesized by solid-state reaction at a high temperature and time (950 °C, 24 h) and the resulting material was post-treated with a ball milling process at different times. Additional samples were prepared with a post-calcination after and adding graphite carbon previously to the longer applied ball-milling time. All the obtained materials were structurally and morphologically characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. To study the effect of ball milling time on the lithium-ion storage capacity, electrochemical experiments of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and rate capability experiments were performed. The application of high-energy milling showed that the obtained specific capacity increased with particle size reduction as long as the crystallinity degree of the LTO material remained high. The Li-ion diffusion coefficient for each material was obtained, as well as its specific resistivity and the intrinsic rate constant for the electrochemical process. It was possible to observe that the ball-milling treatment producing improvements in the charge storage capacity leads also to improvements in mass transport and electrical conduction, although not necessarily produce better electrochemical kinetic behavior.

Efforts have been made to make vehicle engine efficient and introducing hybridized vehicles with the aim of reducing emissions and less fuel dependency. In essence of this, trends of solar electric cars in different countries have been reviewed. Feasibility analysis is done by doing fuel cost analysis of two cases, i.e., simple hybrid vehicle and hybrid vehicle equipped with solar module and increased battery energy storage capacity for a specific round trip distance between two cities, i.e., Rawalpindi and Islamabad in comparison with feasibility of third case, i.e., proposed solar electric car model. The solar module selection along with desired number of batteries with charging and discharging time and motor power required to carry five persons weight (70 kg each) is calculated for third case. Moreover, total carbon dioxide emission analysis has been carried out from car material production to its assembly, manufacturing solar module and nickel metal hydride battery for each case. The annual carbon dioxide emitted from fuel in first two cases relative to electric outlet in third case for specific distance has been analyzed. On large scale, emission analyses for hundred cars of each case have been done at 100 km distance. From calculations, it is revealed that overall emissions in third case on large scale and from its material production, assembly, solar module and batteries manufacturing perspective are comparatively less than other cases. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Batteries; Energy; Gasoline-electric vehicle; Sun energy","Carbon dioxide; Electric batteries; Fuel storage; Fuels; Global warming; Hydrides; Manufacture; Model automobiles; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Secondary batteries; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Vehicles; Battery energy storage; Comparative studies; Contemporary issues; Energy; Feasibility analysis; Reducing emissions; Sun energies; Various technologies; Hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; cost analysis; electric vehicle; energy budget; environmental economics; environmental issue; equipment; feasibility study; manufacturing; solar power; Islamabad [Pakistan]; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Rawalpindi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024377640

The basic idea of digital ECG signal processing is to extract heartbeat frequencies, which are found to be normal in the range between 50 and 200 beats per min. The extracted heartbeat frequency is found to be irregular if the rate increases or decreases and serves as evidence for a diagnosis of a complex physiological condition. A lot of noise can be generated from the environment, including the electrical energy supply (50 or 60 Hz), breathing, physical movement, muscles etc. We experimented with several digital band pass filters including the finite response filter, Butterworth filter and a filter implementing the digital wavelet transformation. Classical programming of a digital wavelet transformation includes a lot of operations, which increase the algorithm complexity and, therefore, cannot be recommended for smartphones or other mobile devices, due to their limited resources, such as battery life, storage capacity, and processing power. In order to realize a solution that will run on a smartphone and wearable ECG sensor, we faced a challenge to enable a sufficient quality of service and develop an efficient algorithm that will preserve the mobile phone resources. We implemented a new improved wavelet filter, which uses a circular buffer and, when compared with the classical solution, it reduces the number of memory accesses and instructions that transfer values between data arrays. This algorithm is a highly efficient solution for a smartphone (mobile device) since it decreases the processing time 15–20 times and also saves battery life. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DSP; ECG; Filtering; Wavelet","Bandpass filters; Butterworth filters; Cellular telephone systems; Computational complexity; Digital devices; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electrocardiography; Filtration; Mobile devices; Quality of service; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Smartphones; Wavelet transforms; Wearable sensors; Algorithm complexity; Classical programming; Electrical energy supply; Electrocardiogram signal; Finite response filters; Physiological condition; Wavelet; Wearable ecg sensors; Biomedical signal processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021175208

In addition, under pulse experiments, fast switching time of 1 μs, good 107 cycling endurance and retention performance at 150 °C, was demonstrated. The confinement of the switching effect into the HfO2-y film, which has the highest oxygen content and deeper oxygen vacancy energy levels compared with the adjusting two layers of TiO2-x which act as two series resistances, can explain the low switching energy. The gradual modulation of the resistance permits also the manifestation of long-term potentiation synaptic plasticity, induced by the application of a train of pulses with different repetition intervals. A quantitative model was applied in order to reproduce the analog SET/RESET responses of the trilayer configuration and highlight the role of the local distribution of oxygen vacancies.

Specifically, iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) has been widely considered as an anode material for water oxidation. Recently, major advances were made in improving Fe2O3 catalysis through surface coverage with material overlayers. In order to understand how material overlayers improve performance, we perform Density Functional Theory + U (DFT + U) calculations to model water oxidation catalysis on Fe2O3 partially covered with Ga2O3. We find that Ga2O3 overlayer shows no improvement in the calculated overpotential required for water oxidation on Fe2O3. This result suggests that Ga2O3 overlayer does not alter the catalytic reaction steps directly, but may be involved in other mechanisms related to charge transport and recombination that improve overall performance.

A glow curve measured at 1 °C/s from samples irradiated to 1 Gy following annealing at 700 and 900 °C shows a high intensity peak at 163 °C and seven secondary peaks of weaker intensity at 43, 73, 100, 195, 280, 329 and 370 °C. Comparing the position of the peaks in the annealed samples with those in an un-annealed one, it is observed that the peak at 100 °C appears only after annealing at and above 700 °C. Kinetic analysis of this annealing-induced peak was carried out using the initial rise, whole glow peak, peak shape, curve fitting and variable heating rate methods. The order of kinetics of the peak was determined as first order using various methods including the Tm-Tstop technique and the dependence of Tm on irradiation dose. The activation energy of the peak is about 1.01 eV and the frequency factor of the order of 1012 s−1. The peak was found to be affected by thermal quenching in analysis based on change of peak intensity with heating rate. The activation energy of thermal quenching was evaluated as 1.06 ± 0.08 eV. We speculate that the annealing-induced peak is due to formation of a new electron trap after destruction of the F22+(2 Mg) centre when the sample is annealed at 700 °C. The annealing-induced peak fades with storage between irradiation and measurement. It was also concluded that electrons from traps corresponding to secondary peaks get re-trapped at the main electron trap. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Annealing; Fading; Glow curve; Thermal quenching; Thermoluminescence; α-Al2O3:C,Mg","Activation energy; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Curve fitting; Electron traps; Heating rate; Irradiation; Quenching; Single crystals; Thermoluminescence; Annealed samples; Fading; Frequency factors; Glow curve; Order of kinetics; Thermal quenching; Thermoluminescence peaks; Variable heating rates; Annealing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019905997

This system is mainly designed for places where the utility grid is available, but for various reasons any excess electrical energy cannot be put back onto the grid through buyback programs. In traditional hybrid or grid-tied PV systems with battery backup, the electrical energy from the PV and the grid are tied at the inverter output. However, in SMaRTI this tying up is carried out at multiple distribution points in the system, giving SMaRTI an opportunity to optimize the PV output more efficiently. By using SMaRTI, not only one can utilize up to 98% of electrical energy generated by PV system but also the cost of ownership is reduced by more than 40% over a ten years period. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Efficient electrical energy usage; Fine-grained energy distribution; Hybrid renewable energy system; Smart switch; Solar PV optimization","Renewable energy resources; Electrical energy; Energy distributions; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Smart switch; Solar PVs; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019868388

The two IGCC carbon capture cases use calcium-based CO2 sorbents and iron-based oxygen carriers and they are compared, in term of technical performance (e.g. net power output, energy efficiency, carbon capture rate, CO2 emissions) and environmental performance, to the benchmark case without CO2 capture. The gasification-based power plants produce 440–610 MWe net power with a carbon capture rate higher than 90%. The system boundaries considered in the LCA are: (i) integrated gasification combined cycle with CO2 capture, (ii) raw materials extraction and transport and (iii) carbon dioxide compression, transport and storage. Several environmental impact categories were calculated and compared within the LCA framework. The most significant environmental indicators were: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP fossil). The best value for GWP, 338.73 kg CO2 equivalents/MWh, was obtained for iron-based chemical looping case. The best value for EP was obtained for the calcium-looping case (1461.97 kg PO4 3− equivalents/MWh).

Six scenarios were evaluated, which included the production of biochar from agricultural and forestry residual biomass pyrolyzed at 300, 400, and 500 °C, using a functional unit of 1 t of produced biochar. Modeling of the system and evaluation of impacts were performed using SimaPro selecting impact categories of climate change, human toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and fossil depletion. According to the results, the climate change impact category presented the greatest relative importance in the life cycle of biochar, with greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 2.74 t CO2 eq t−1 biochar when the biochar applied to soil is produced from forestry residual biomass at 500 °C. In relation to hotspots in the life cycle of biochar, transportation was the only stage identified that contributes environmental loads to the system, in contrast, carbon storage, natural gas avoided and urea avoided generate environmental benefits. Carbon storage in biochar is the main hotspot in the system associated to climate change, while the avoided use of natural gas and urea have great influence on fossil depletion, freshwater eutrophication, and human toxicity categories. These categories are highly sensible to allocation methodology options and the assumptions associated to the system boundaries expansion. This finding requires a comprehensive justification and to guarantee the data quality when the system expansion is considered in a LCA study of a biochar-soil system, including energy balance and syngas use, as well as, avoided urea estimation.

As opposed to the existing literature, our model includes a dual technology energy storage system, acting in two different markets. We introduce a mathematical formulation for this model applied to two Dutch electricity markets. Adopting optimal control approach with the goal to maximize the yearly benefit, we show that the dual energy storage system can be profitable already when the same buying/selling strategies are adopted for the working days and weekends. We show that the profitability (slightly) increases with different buying/selling strategies for the weekdays and weekends. Finally, we demonstrate how the yearly benefit varies with size and efficiency of the devices chosen and market prices. © 2017","Electricity markets; Energy storage systems; Optimal control; Optimization; Renewable energy sources integration","Commerce; Natural resources; Optimization; Power markets; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Dual energy; Energy markets; Energy storage systems; Market price; Mathematical formulation; Optimal controls; Renewable energy source; Variable renewable energies; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019383049

Through galvanostatic cycling, we demonstrate that poly-NRs offer excellent capacity retention over 750 cycles. The capacity retention from the 50th to the 750th cycle was an impressive 94 %, retaining a capacity of approximately 120 mAh g−1 after 750 cycles.

An increase of Ag content has an effect on the decrease of the storage modulus (E′) and the indentation hardness (HIT). The highest values HIT = 51.9 GPa and E′ = 270.6 GPa were measured on a sample with 0 at% Ag. The lowest values HIT = 26.0 GPa and E′ = 180.2 GPa were measured on a sample of 9.3 at% Ag. Film adhesion was studied using the scratch test and was up to 20.8 N for the highest Ag concentration. The contact angle (CA) measurements for water showed that the CA of Ag-DLC films was higher (78°-98°) that of DLC film (77°). The surface free energy of DLC and of Ag-DLC was about 40 mJ·m− 2. Antibacterial properties were studied using gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The antibacterial effects increased with the Ag concentration and were ~ 99.9% after 24 h for the layers with the highest silver content (9.3 at%). Our results demonstrate that the Ag-doped DLC films are potentially useful biomaterials having both good mechanical properties and antimicrobial characteristics.

Nanocomposite films of different weight ratios of Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan (0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) were fabricated using casting technique. The optical properties of colloidal Fe2O3 NPs and Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan nanocomposite films were recorded using UV–visible spectrophotometer. As the ratio of Fe2O3 NPs to chitosan increases from 0 to 30%, the energy band gap of Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan films decreases from 3.16 to 2.11 eV. This decrease is due to quantum confinement effect. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films as a function of sweeping temperature were measured using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. An enhancement in storage modulus, stiffness and glass transition temperature (Tg) has been observed as the ratio of Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan increases. Tg of Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan nanocomposite film shifts towards higher temperature side with respect to pure chitosan film from 152.1 to 166.3 °C as the ratio of Fe2O3 NPs/chitosan increases from 0 to 30 wt%.

In this paper, we study existing state of the art memories, discuss a conventional memory system and propose a novel hardware mechanism for heterogeneous multi-core memory system called Pattern Aware Memory System (PAMS). The PAMS supports static and dynamic data structures using descriptors and specialized scratchpad memory. In order to prove the proposed memory system, we implemented and tested it on real-prototype and simulator environments. The benchmarking results on real-prototype hardware show that PAMS achieves a maximum speedup of 12.83x and 1.23x for static and dynamic data structures respectively. When compared to the Baseline System, the PAMS consumes up to 4.8 times less program memory for static and dynamic data structures respectively. The PAMS consumes 4.6% and 1.6 times less dynamic power and energy respectively.

T2 relaxation was measured at 24 h post mortem (p.m.) and again after 9 days of chilled storage. NMR measurements from day 1 p.m. were limited in predicting day-9 purge (|r| = 0.37–0.52). The root mean square error of linear regression (RMSD) for measuring day-9 purge using the relaxation time of intra-myofibrillar water (T21) measured on day 1 p.m. (r = −0.46) was 1.31% (range: 1.15–7.69% purge), corresponding to ±2.62% (2 × RMSD) prediction error of purge with 95% probability. This indicated that for purge production rate, the distribution and mobility of water in meat on day 1 p.m. may be of little relevance. Further tests were conducted to explain this poor predictability, by taking NMR measurements of water mobility and distribution made on the same meat sample (taken at 96 h p.m.) every day, during a 9-day storage period. By analyzing the T21 and T22 domains every day, it was revealed that during the first 5-day of storage, water (86%) moved from intra-myofibrillar space to extra-myofibrillar space. However, this movement did not result in detectable drip. A major liquid loss followed between days 6 and 7 and ceased day 8. This complexity of the water movement between domains during storage may explain the poor predictability of day-9 purge using NMR measurements from day 1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Meat structure; NMR; Porcine longissimus dorsi muscles; Purge; Storage; Water holding capacity","Energy storage; Forecasting; Mean square error; Meats; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Purging; Chilled storage; Distribution and mobility; NMR measurements; Porcine longissimus dorsi; Prediction errors; Production rates; Root mean square errors; Water holding capacity; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015696268

Beta-pinene was used as a model volatile compound. Avrami's equation mathematical model was equipped to describe the correlation between release rate and storage time. In general, volatile's retention in the dried powder was considerably affected by the storage conditions along with the wall material characteristics (e.g. protein/polysaccharide ratio, presence of reticulating agents, i.e. glycerol and tannic acid) as a greater rate of release was observed at high relative humidity (RH) and temperature values and low biopolymer addition levels. Moreover, the Arrhenius activation energy Ea was reduced by increasing RH from 0 to 54% while it got either positive or negative values indicating that the release of β-pinene was either related or not to temperature. Rehydration of dried powders in high humidity air conditions and the induced reduction of their effective surface area may account for the decrease of β-pinene retention.

Reconstitution potentials were determined at 30 and 100 °C using gravimetric methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS for the best fit model equations (Peleg, GAB, Oswin, and Langmuir). The rehydration ratios of the freeze dried soups ranged from 1.00 to 9.11 g absorbed water/g dry matter. Soups were optimally reconstituted at 30 °C for 30 min and at 100 °C for 5 min. The equilibrium moisture contents of freeze dried soups ranged from 8.84 to 27.50%. The GAB model was the best estimator for predicting the monolayer moisture contents of the soups, which ranged from 7.87 to 9.82% (dry basis), and were within the acceptable limit of 10% dry basis for good storage stability. Practical applications: Traditionally, soups are generally reheated several times in the day to prevent spoilage, while in modern homes, most soups are kept under frozen condition to preserve them and to avoid nutritional loses which can arise as a result of periodical heating once used, but these methods of soup preservation had been shown to lead to losses of nutrients. Development of shelf stable soups that requires little energy to preserve them for considerable length of time is desirable. Freeze drying (FD) is a gentle technique, which retains the nutritional and sensory properties of food products and their final products can be reconstituted easily by simple addition of liquid.

Follow-on effects on forest carbon stocks, land use, and fuel markets are not assessed. Sensitivity analysis addresses landfill carbon storage and biodegradation rates, atmospheric emissions controls, displaced fuel types, and two alternative carbon accounting methods commonly used for waste management LCAs. Base-case carbon accounting considers emissions and uptakes of all biogenic and fossil carbon compounds, including biogenic carbon dioxide. Base-case results show that recycling options (recycling into reconstituted wood products or into wood pulp for papermaking) rank better than all burning or burying options for overall monetized score as well as for climate impacts, except that wood substitution for coal in industrial boilers is slightly better than recycling for the climate. Wood substitution for natural gas boiler fuel has the highest environmental impacts. Sensitivity analysis shows the overall monetized score rankings for recycling options to be robust except for the carbon accounting method, for which all options are highly sensitive. Under one of the alternative methods, wood substitution for coal boiler fuel and landfill options with high methane capture efficiency are the best for the overall score; recycling options are next to the worst.

The viscoelasticity is considered within three time regimes: (1) short time regime for milliseconds to seconds time scale which corresponds to sub-cellular level; (2) middle time regime for several tens of seconds to several minutes time scale which corresponds to cellular level; and (3) long time regime for several tens of minutes to several hours time scale which corresponds to supra-cellular level. Short and middle time regimes have been successfully elaborated in the literature, whereas long time viscoelasticity remains unclear. Long time regime accounts for collective cell migration. Collective cell migration could induce uncorrelated motility which has an impact to energy storage and dissipation during cell surface rearrangement. Uncorrelated motility influences: (1) volume fraction of migrating cells, (2) distribution of migrating cells, (3) shapes of migrating cell groups.

Before the batch tests, the samples were stored at different temperatures achievable on biogas plants applying trigeneration strategy (−18°C, +3°C, +18°C and +35°C). Specific methane production from intensively planted grasses was relatively high (0.33–0.41 m3/kg VS) compared to extensively planted grasses (0.20–0.33 m3/kg VS). VSs removal efficiency reached 59.8–68.8% for intensively planted grasses and 34.6–56.5% for extensively planted grasses. Freezing the intensively planted grasses at −18°C proved to be an effective thermal pretreatment leading to high biogas production (0.61 m3/kg total solid (TS)), high representation of methane (64.0%) in biogas and good VSs removal efficiency (68.8%).

Besides, the expression of steroid hormone receptors was analyzed. Female rats fed with CAF from weaning increased their energy intake, body weight, and fat depots, but did not develop metabolic syndrome. The increase in energy intake was related to an orexigenic signal of paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMN) nuclei, given principally by upregulation of AgRP and NPY. This was mildly counteracted by the arcuate nucleus, with decreased AgRP expression and increased POMC and kisspeptin expression. CAF altered the transcription of neurosteroidogenic enzymes in PVN and VMN, and epigenetic mechanisms associated with differential promoter methylation were involved.

The extraction yield of GM was approximately 45% for all products. Higher GM (95%) and lower starch (3%) contents were obtained for GM25. GM25 showed higher apparent and intrinsic viscosity, storage and loss modulus and lower activation energy than GM55 and GM85. The addition of different salts and sugars did not affect viscosity due to the non-polyelectrolyte behavior of GM. Gel behavior of purified samples appeared at pH 9.

We defined a modelling framework for calculation of the carbon pools and fluxes along the forest energy and wood product supply chains over 200 years for three forest management alternatives (FMA): 1) a traditionally managed European beech forest, as a business-as-usual case, 2) an energy poplar plantation, and 3) a set-aside forest left unmanaged for long-term storage of carbon. We calculated the cumulative net carbon emissions (CCE) and carbon parity times (CPT) of the managed forests relative to the unmanaged forest. Energy poplar generally had the lowest CCE when using coal as the reference fossil fuel. With natural gas as the reference fossil fuel, the CCE of the business-as-usual and the energy poplar was nearly equal, with the unmanaged forest having the highest CCE after 40 years. CPTs ranged from 0 to 156 years, depending on the applied model assumptions. CCE and CPT were especially sensitive to the reference fossil fuel, material alternatives to wood, forest growth rates for the three FMAs, and energy conversion efficiencies. Assumptions about the long-term steady-state levels of carbon stored in the unmanaged forest had a limited effect on CCE after 200 years. Analyses also showed that CPT was not a robust measure for ranking of carbon mitigation benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Carbon emissions; Carbon parity time; Forest carbon storage; Sensitivity analyses","carbon; coal; fossil fuel; natural gas; bioenergy; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; emission control; forest management; fossil fuel; growth rate; natural gas; sensitivity analysis; set-aside; wood; alternative energy; Article; atmosphere; beech; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; carbon utilization; combustion; energy; energy conversion; energy yield; forest management; fossil energy; monoculture; plantation; sensitivity analysis; wood; atmosphere; environmental protection; forest; Fagus sylvatica; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Fossil Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016029291

With increased commercial activity in the marine sector, the importance of accurate wave parameter relationship determination has become increasingly apparent. The outputs of many numerical models and buoy datasets do not include all requisite wave parameters, and a typical approach is to use a constant conversion factor or relationship based on defined spectra such as the Bretschneider or the joint North Sea wave observation project (JONSWAP) spectrum to determine these parameters. Given that relationships between wave parameters vary significantly over both hourly and seasonal and annual timescales, the currently employed methods are lacking, as subtleties are missed by the simpler approach. This paper addresses the determination of wave parameter relationships using a machine learning (ML)-based model, identifying and selecting the optimal method for the conversion of wave parameters (Te, T01) in coastal Irish Waters. This approach is then validated at two sites on the West coast of Ireland. The aim is to highlight the utility of ML in approximating the relationship between wave parameters; using both buoy and modelled data, and mapping the predicted outcomes for a wave energy converter based on a variety of ML and measure correlate predict approaches. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Learning systems; Constant conversion factors; Machine learning approaches; Marine sector; Measure-correlate-predict; Optimal methods; Time-scales; Wave energy converters; Wave parameters; Wave energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029598438

Members of the CCS community see the technology’s realization as being dependent on traversing a range of “barriers”, such as public fears and resistance that exacerbate struggles for policy support. Community-supported training venues prime recruits for practical interventions that target these barriers. Events also uphold necessary interpretive flexibilities that support heterogeneous advocacy coalition with at times diverging interests in energy transitions. The concept of expert-advocates, experts primed for interventions across technical-social systems, is proposed as a new analytic aid for future studies of socially reflexive expert communities. © 2016 ICCR Foundation.","advocacy coalitions; carbon capture and storage; energy transitions; epistemic communities; expert-advocates; technical-social systems","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; future prospect; policy approach; recruitment (employment); skilled labor; training; waste technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980340148

The distribution system in this paper refers to the cost and standard criteria of Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). The existing system is 22-kV voltage level includes 115/22 kV substation, the 45-km. distribution feeder, 1 photovoltaic plant and 8 load points with mixed customer types. The technical problem often occurred in 22-kV distribution feeders is the power demand exceeds the line thermal limit in short time (1-4 hour per day) every day. Following PEA’s standard and criteria, distribution network owners (DNO) has 2 choices to solve this problem; taking the risk of fault or reinforce feeders. Nowadays, energy storage technologies play the interested role in smart grid era. It illustrates from the analysis that BESS can solve this problem and postpone the time of system reinforcement such as construction of the new distribution line with worthy investment.

In order to mitigate these problems a suitable scheme is required to reschedule the flexible loads based on incentives for the end users for changing their demand from their day-ahead optimized demand pattern. This paper proposes a three-layer architecture of intelligent agents for scheduling of flexible loads which implies a demand bidding strategy. A real case study is considered from Nordpool spot prices for four different seasons of the year to show case the rationality of the study. Two flexible loads, Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Storage Space Heating (SSH) are considered in this scenario, while other loads are assumed non-flexible. Analysis of energy cost based on flexibility indices of loads is studied, which shows that flexibility of loads not only supports the power network capacity in congestion situation but it also benefits the consumers with cost effective use of energy. From aggregator’s perspective, the system resources are utilized optimally hence reducing the need for running extra generators and the spikes at the cheap price hours are mitigated. From the results, it is noted that the proposed bidding scheme has benefited the households up to 60% of the energy cost saving by participating in the demand response. The number of times each household wins a bid depends on the flexibility of loads and in this particular simulation scenario most of the households are able to win the bids 2 times in a day. © 2017 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Agent architecture; Demand bidding; Demand response; Electric vehicles; Flexible loads; Smart grid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036509215

According to the EU Action Plan, the highest potential of energy savings (27-30% until 2020) will be applied to the existing buildings. Under the circumstances of environmental issues, research on the use of secondary energy resources is of great interest, being a concern in the context of sustainable development. The aim of the present paper is to accumulate knowledge on how a drain water heat recovery unit using a heat pipe heat exchanger performs under different drain water flow profile scenarios. Researching how the intermittent behaviour of the drain water influences the performance for this type of system is important because it gives insight on how the system will perform in a real life situation. In this paper the authors investigated the performance of a heat recovery unit, from drain water heat recovery. Investigation of the heat recovery unit performance shows that the heat pipe has the capability to recover more than 30% of the available heat in the drain water, at the flow rates investigated (0.3 0.5 m3/hour). The application of the presented solution shows that a heat recovery system of this type has the possibility to recover a large portion of the available heat if it has been achieved in those buildings where the hot water consumption is higher (housing complexes, university campus, hotels, swimming pool, sport and leisure, hospital/healthcare, restaurants, laundry, pharmaceutical manufacturing). © 2017, Gh.

The particular case of energy harvesting on road pavements is a very recent area of research, with different technologies having been developed for this purpose. However, none of them have presented high conversion efficiency rates nor technical or economic viability. Looking at other renewable energy technologies, the inclusion of not only electrical but also in some cases mechanical energy storage units has led to an increase in global efficiency and, consequently, economic viability. This paper deals with the technical study of the integration of mechanical energy storage systems in a road pavement energy harvesting hydraulic device with mechanical actuation in order to evaluate the impact on global efficiency.

Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) is a promising candidate to be the universal storage device. The Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) is the cornerstone of the NV-MRAM technology. The MTJ can be based on Spin Transfer Torque (STT) switching which is considered as a hot topic for academic and industrial researchers the last decade. Moreover, the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) based MTJ has recently been considered as an interesting device offering an increased reliability thanks to independent write and read paths. Since both MTJ devices (STT and SHE) seem to develop the data storage market, it is crucial to compare their capability when integrated with advanced CMOS processes in terms of transistor sizing and performance. Based on the state of the art, we supposed that it is possible to reach a mature magnetic processes that would enable to fabricate small junctions. Simulation results have been driven with 28 nm CMOS process. We showed that at that CMOS node, it is possible to furnish the required writing current with equitable size of transistors and so achieving high density MRAMs. At 28 nm node, the minimum transistor size can be used by the STT device. Although it is not the case for the SHE device, it achieves a remarkable gain in term of energy which is 5x better compared with the STT technology. Results are promising for high performance and high density hybrid magnetic/CMOS integrated circuits (ICs). © 2017, Virtual Institute of Physics of the Foundation Horia Hulubei.

TRNSYS software is used to find out useful energy collected through parabolic trough collectors and heat storage in pressurized hot water storage system. Life cycle savings (LCS) using HFO prices of two different periods i.e. May, 2014 (higher HFO price) and Feb., 2016 (lower HFO price) are calculated and compared. Effect of change in HFO price on LCS is also presented. Integration of higher pressure FWH with solar energy is found more feasible in terms of LCS as compared to lower pressure FWH.

This research evaluated the storing effect on the activities of soluble peroxidase and ionic and covalently bound peroxidases in P. vulgaris SA029 material and to study the kinetics of thermal inactivation of soluble peroxidase in this matrix. The newly harvested grains were divided into three lots, one was analyzed immediately and the other two were stored for 120 days under different conditions: 5 °C/34% RH and 37 °C/75% RH. To determine the inactivation kinetics the flour of grains (adjusted to 17 and 24% moisture) was heated in the range of temperature from 75 to 95 °C for periods of 1 to 32 min and then it was proceeded to determine the residual activity of the peroxidase. The soluble and ionic peroxidase enzyme fractions had a significant decrease in their activities, 75 and 65%, respectively during storing at 37 °C/75% RH, it remained without significant changes in stored grains at 5 °C/34% RH. Moreover, the inactivation of the enzyme followed biphasic first-order kinetics with a heat-labile moiety and another heat resistant, and was highly dependent on the moisture content and the heating temperature, since it was almost completely inactivated in the first few minutes under the treatment of high humidity and temperature. The storage of P. vulgaris SA029 material beans at high temperature and high relative humidity for 4 months decreased the activity of the soluble and ionic fractions of the peroxidase enzyme, which could favor the bean hardening. © 2017, Universidad del Zulia.

There is a growing demand on consuming vitamin-fortified foods due to the increasing awareness of consumers to common life-treating diseases. People may not take the required daily intake (RDI) amount of these vitamins due to the limited natural sources, malnutrition facts, and loss of their chemical stability during food production, storage, and transportation. Protective encapsulation technologies are required during food fortification to prevent vitamins from degradation and enhance their bioavailability in human gastrointestinal system. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions are described as promising delivery systems by the researchers to encapsulate and stabilize lipophilic vitamins and thus enhance their bioavailability. This review covers the challenges in production methods and factors affecting the stability of lipophilic vitamins and nanoemulsion delivery systems as well and the most recent studies on bioavailability evaluation of vitamins A, D, E encapsulated in oil-in-water nanoemulsions. Practical applications: Food fortification with essential micronutrients, such as vitamins A, D, and E contributes to human health by providing the intake of sufficient amounts to prevent diseases (e.g., osteoporosis, osteomalacia, suppressed immune system, cancer, loss of vision, cardiovascular diseases) treating the quality of the life and the survival. Lipid-based nanoemulsion delivery systems can be used to encapsulate these lipophilic vitamins to increase their solubility, stability, and bioavailability, and also they provide an advantage as to be fortified in aqueous-based food/beverages rather than only lipid-based formulations. Staple foods and beverages, such as orange juice, milk, cheese, and bread, could be fortified with stabilized vitamin enriched nanoemulsions, so that human can get greater benefit from these micronutrients. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions are consisted of a lipophilic core (oil phase) where lipophilic bioactive compound is entrapped and hydrophilic shell (aqueous phase), and an amphiphilic interfacial layer composed of the emulsifier/surfactant. Nanoemulsions produced by both low- and high-energy methods are promising delivery systems to encapsulate and stabilize the lipophilic vitamins during food fortification and enhance their bioavailability.

However, little is known on their capability for trophic upgrading of food quality (essential fatty acids). Therefore, Platychelipus littoralis copepods were subjected to famine (3 days) and subsequent refeeding (6 days) on high (Thalassiosira weissflogii) and low (Dunaliella tertiolecta) quality food at 4, 15 and 24 °C, and their resilience for recovery of structural and storage fatty acids was determined. Additionally, stable isotope probing of fatty acids gave insight into the copepods’ ability to synthesize ARA (20:4ω6), EPA (20:5ω3) and DHA (22:6ω3) from low quality food under different temperatures. High intra-specific variability (among copepod replicates) in fatty acid composition and 13C enrichment was observed when copepods were exposed to heat (24 °C) and food quality stress, and operated therefore as an indicator of environmental stress. Synthesis of the essential fatty acids ARA, EPA and DHA from dietary precursors increased with temperature. However, despite the capability for synthesis, no fatty acid accumulation was observed, which suggested substantial fatty acid turnover, especially under heat stress. Moreover, synthesis rates were not sufficient to restore the ω3 pools and ensure survival, at least for the duration of the experiment. Therefore, the question rises whether copepods of this local P. littoralis population will be able to cope with the reduced dietary supply of essential ω3 fatty acids, as predicted under global warming, given that the physiological need for these essential compounds likely increases with temperature. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"benthos; bioaccumulation; crustacean; diatom; environmental stress; experimental study; famine; fatty acid; food quality; physiological response; primary production; stable isotope; starvation; Copepoda; Dunaliella tertiolecta; Harpacticoida; Platychelipus littoralis; Thalassiosira weissflogii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021241440

Comparative analyses were undertaken with cells grown photoheterotrophically under sulphur-replete or sulphur-depleted conditions. The Y67A Rubisco mutant, which has previously demonstrated a pronounced reduction in Rubisco levels and higher hydrogen production rates than the wild type, also shows the following divergences in photosynthetic phenotype and lipid allocation: (i) low Fv/Fm (maximum photochemical efficiency), (ii) low effective quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII), (iii) low effectiveness at protection against high light intensities, (iv) a higher level of total lipids per pigment and (v) changes in the relative proportions of different fatty acids, with a marked decrease in unsaturated fatty acids (FAs). The most abundant thylakoid membrane lipid, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, decreased in amount, while the neutral lipid/polar lipid ratio increased in the mutant. The low amount and activity of the mutated Rubisco Y67A enzyme seems to have an adverse effect on photosynthesis and causes changes in carbon allocation in terms of membrane fatty acid composition and storage lipid accumulation.

A number of previous studies in the field of demand side management deal with price based load control to balance the power grid. However, inadequate attention has been paid to comfort and profitability issues of end users. Therefore, insufficient solutions towards profitability and comfort issues may be a serious barrier to demand response. The aim of our paper is to analyse the performance and feasibility of electricity price based control models for thermal storages in households taking into account aspects of comfort. We simulated and compared existing control models and our models. The influence of different models and volatility of the real-time electricity price on the energy cost and electricity consumption of studied loads (i.e. water heater, freezer) have been estimated. While the cost and electricity reduction calculations do not take into account comfort issues, a performance calculation methodology has been developed. The performance is ensured when by minimized temperature change, as compared to maximum comfort settings, the cost reduction/electricity saving is maximized. The control models showing the best performance (incl. electricity or cost savings) under different comfort situations are described. © 2017","Demand response; Energy management; Load management; Temperature control; Thermal storage","Cost reduction; Costs; Electric load management; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Heat storage; Heating; Profitability; Temperature control; Control model; Demand response; Electricity prices; Electricity-consumption; Feasibility analysis; Performance calculation; Temperature changes; Thermal storage; Power quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018346267

Because of the need to simplify hydrological models, parameters are often included to help with modelling hydrological processes. Generally the parameters of lumped, semi or distributed hydrological models depend on the values estimated at a gauged location, generally at outlet of the catchment (mostly using discharge). In this approach it is hard to judge how well a model represents internal catchment processes of the hydrological cycle as well as also ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment. The purpose of the paper is to assess, and potentially improve, the ability of a physically-based semi-distributed hydrological model, TopNet, using a spatially and temporally detailed set of field measurements of catchment responses to diverse weather conditions. The TopNet rainfall-runoff model was applied to the Waipara catchment located in the South Island of New Zealand. Observations from field experiments were compared with the simulation results of uncalibrated TopNet model. The total amount of simulated runoff showed reasonable agreement with observations. However, the model overestimated baseflow and underestimated surface flow. The results show that soil moisture variation within the catchment is well represented by the model. However, comparison of the observed water balance with model results show that there is a deficiency in the calculation of evapotranspiration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Catchment process; Experimental catchment; Model structure; Spatial-temporal dynamics; TopNet","Catchments; Digital storage; Hydrology; Model structures; Soil moisture; Distributed hydrological model; Experimental catchments; Hydrological modelling; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Semi distributed hydrological models; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial temporals; TopNet; Runoff; baseflow; catchment; comparative study; experimental study; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; model test; runoff; software; spatiotemporal analysis; water budget; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; South Island; Waipara River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018327677

However, a significant percentage is still rejected and burned for energy production, despite containing valuable molecules for materials processing and with important biological activities. Herein, the optimization of the extraction process to obtain these molecules, using mild solvents and conditions, is described within a biorefinery perspective. The extracts were obtained by direct contact solvent extractions with water, ethanol and its mixtures for different time and temperatures, and evaluated for chemical composition, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant properties [by DPPH radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays]. The results showed that the extraction process is accelerated and higher yields are achieved with the increase in temperature without chemical degradation or compromising the antioxidant capacity. For all solvents, at reflux temperature, more than 90% of the extractable material is obtained within 6 h (80% within 1 h). The highest TPC and antioxidant capacity are observed for the extracts obtained with mixtures of water and ethanol of similar volumes. The antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays was found to be proportional to the extract TPC, while ORAC is favored for higher percentages of ethanol on the extracting solvent. The main constituents of these extracts are the ellagitannins, vescalagin, castalagin and β-O-ethylvescalagin, along with other phenolic acids (mainly ellagic and gallic acids) and various flavonols. The extracts stability was monitored up to 1 year of storage with neither reduction in the antioxidant capacity nor chemical degradation. These results show that extracts with strong antioxidant potential and high content of bioactive molecules can be obtained from the processing of waste streams. Cork is a sustainable forest product and the development of new fields of application contributes toward a zero waste cycle for a complete material biorefinery. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Antioxidants; Bioactivity; Biological materials; Chemical stability; Degradation; Ethanol; Mixtures; Molecules; Organic solvents; Refining; Solvents; Antioxidant potential; Antioxidant properties; Chemical compositions; Extraction conditions; Ferric reducing antioxidant power; Oxygen radical absorbance capacities; Total phenolic content; Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacities; Extraction; Antioxidants; Chemical Composition; Extraction; Optimization; Quercus Suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017183753

Layered double hydroxides and particularly LDH-containing hybrids are emerging as potential nano-sized adsorbents for water treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated LDH-containing hybrids as promising multifunctional materials for potential utilization in various applications such as, photo-catalysis, energy storage, nanocomposites and water purification. This article reviews the recent applications of LDH-containing hybrids as adsorbents for water remediation. The maximum adsorption capacities of various toxic heavy metals and dyes on different LDH hybrids were reported as 483mg/g for Pb2+, 95mg/g for Cd2+, 181mg/g for Cu2+, 649mg/g for Cr6+, 180mg/g As5+, 813mg/g for Hg2+, 450 for Ag+, 277mg/g for U6+, 1062mg/g for methyl orange, 185mg/g for methylene blue, and 1250mg/g for Congo red, which is comparatively higher than other commercial adsorbents. This review discusses the adsorption performance of manifold LDH-containing hybrids for treating various pollutants such as heavy metals and dyes. The mechanisms of interaction of LDH-containing hybrids with pollutants and the influence of key adsorption parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dose and temperature have been comprehensively discussed. Moreover, the regeneration potential and reuse of spent LDH-containing hybrids and its toxicity effects have also been reviewed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Adsorption mechanism; Hybrid; Layered double hydroxides; Water treatment","Adsorbents; Adsorption; Aromatic compounds; Azo dyes; Dyes; Heavy metals; Pollution; Wastewater treatment; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption mechanism; Adsorption parameters; Adsorption performance; Hybrid; Industrial development; Layered double hydroxides; Multi-functional materials; Water treatment; adsorption; hydroxide; industrial development; remediation; wastewater treatment; water treatment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017135928

Electric utilities have been using switching devices in distribution networks mainly to improve network reliability considering sustained interruptions. Temporary interruptions have been relegated to second place. However in modern societies appliances with electronic components are becoming more sensitive to temporary interruptions. Because of this, reliability indexes like the Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index (MAIFI) that considers temporary interruptions are receiving more attention by electric utilities. The integration of storage systems into the multiobjective planning of distribution networks is proposed in this paper, to improve the reliability index MAIFI. This approach considers the optimization of storage systems integrated in a problem with multiple objective functions. The reliability index MAIFI is the first objective function, minimized by optimally choosing the size and location of battery banks in the distribution network.

The optimal annealing temperature, duration of carbonization and physical constraint from CNFs are identified as the critical parameters that enable the formation of atomic scale, amorphous FeOx particles. The FeOx/CNF composite electrodes present exceptional cyclic stability for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1: an excellent capacity of 717 mAh g−1 with capacity retention (CR) of ~96% for LIBs, and 277 mAh g−1 with CR of almost 100% for SIBs. The ultrafine size and amorphous state of FeOx particles are upheld even after 500 cycles, offering solid evidence for excellent reversibility of the electrodes. Reversible conversion between the amorphous FeOx phase and Fe nanocrystals during charge/discharge reactions are identified as the principal energy storage mechanisms for both batteries. Interestingly, the Fe particles formed after discharge in SIBs are generally larger in size but much smaller in molar amount than in LIBs, which may partly account for the lower specific capacity of SIBs given the same electrode material and the same testing condition. These findings not only enrich our understanding of energy storage behaviors of iron oxide anodes, but also offer a potential strategy to improve the cyclic stability of electrodes made from other transition metal oxides that suffer from large volume changes and poor electrical conductivities. © 2017","Carbon nanofiber; Electrospinning; FeOx; Lithium ion battery; Sodium ion battery","Anodes; Atoms; Carbon nanofibers; Carbonization; Electric discharges; Electrospinning; Energy storage; Iron oxides; Metal ions; Sodium-ion batteries; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Capacity retention; Composite electrode; Electrical conductivity; Electrode material; FeOx; Physical constraints; Specific capacities; Testing conditions; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016451640

Multivariate analysis of the hyperspectral data show that freezing history can clearly be determined on samples in the frozen state and to some degree on samples in the thawed state. Analysis of the data shows a less clear distinction between methods of thawing. Measurement on samples after a year of storage still showed the ability to classify samples based on their freezing history.

The field emission scanning electron microscopy has been used to analyze the surface morphologies of 1,5-PDAN-coated PGE by CV (PGE/1,5-PDAN(CV)) and CA (PGE/1,5-PDAN(CA)). Electrochemical measurements have been performed to evaluate usability of the electrodes for supercapacitors using CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge and repeating chronopotentiometry (RCP) methods in 1.0 M HClO4.

The conservation of pure populations of this species is important for production diversification and biodiversity preservation. In this way, the zootechnological development for seed hatchery production is extremely important. Broodstock conditioning is a key step in the process of rearing bivalves in a hatchery. Many factors regulate the reproductive cycle, being food one of the most important ones. To evaluate the effect of different diets on C. angulata reproductive performance, broodstock were conditioned with different food regimes formulated fundamentally by flagellates (Diet 1 – Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis galbana clone T-ISO; Diet 2 – P. lutheri, T-ISO and Skeletonema costatum) and constituted fundamentally by diatoms (Diet 3 – S. costatum and Chaetoceros calcitrans; Diet 4 – P. lutheri, S. costatum and C. calcitrans). During conditioning, samples of oysters were collected to evaluate condition index, gonadal development and biochemical composition. At the end of the conditioning period, oysters were induced to spawn to evaluate reproductive output (fecundity, fertilization rate and D-larvae development). The diets had an impact on the gametogenesis process, energy storage and reproductive output performance, being the best results those obtained in broodstock fed with the diatoms-predominant diets. However, those fed with diets majority flagellates had an unsuccessful performance.

Most of these are thyristor based SMES, employing proportional type controllers. In this paper, a supervisory adaptive model predictive control scheme (AMPC) is proposed for a voltage source converter based relatively small rating SMES for LFC application. The reference power command for the SMES is derived from the AMPC in such a manner that it effectively handles the operational constraints of the SMES system. A representative first-order system emulating the inner loop dynamics of the SMES chopper system, is tuned offline via genetic algorithm (GA) and is used to derive dynamic constraints for the cost function in AMPC. The effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated through simulations.

The current work focused on the introduction of oxygen moieties onto the walls of MWCNTs by five different reagents and investigating the associated physicochemical properties. Oxygen-containing groups were introduced onto MWCNTs using an ultrasound water-bath treatment with HNO3, HCl, H2O2 or HCl/HNO3 solution. Physicochemical properties were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman, thermal gravimetric analysis, textural characteristics, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The study focus was mainly on linking the physicochemical properties of oxygen-functionalised MWCNTs and suitability in electrochemical capacitors using group one sulfates. From the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy KBr pellet protocol, peaks at 3400, 2370 and 1170 cm−1 suggest oxygen-containing functionalities on MWCNTs. HNO3 treatment introduced highest oxygen-containing moieties and achieved highest specific capacitance in Li2SO4 and Na2SO4 electrolytes of 36.200 F g−1 (77 times better than pristine) and 45.100 F g−1 (2.5 times enhancement), respectively. For K2SO4, it was 33.600 F g−1 (4.9 times better) with HNO3/HCl-treated samples. Oxygen-functionalised MWCNTs displayed both pseudo and electrochemical double-layer mechanism of enhanced charge storage and cycle stability in group one sulfates electrolytes. The dominating charge storage mechanism was pseudo, and Na2SO4 was the best electrolyte amongst the three group one sulfates investigated. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

This cross-subsidy springs from the fact that the NEM customers receive a one-for-one credit for the energy they export to the grid against their time-diversified energy consumption that is imported from the grid. Even though such practices are appealing due to their relatively simple form, it is shown that this one-for-one credit exchange may entail additional losses-related costs to the ones recovered from NEM customers through their net billing processes. Subsequently, a different net billing scheme is examined, bearing in mind the limitations of the existing metering infrastructure at the distribution level, in order to assess the effect of alternative practices on this hidden cross-subsidy. Both practices are applied on a real system that benefits from prosumers and storsumers. For the scope of this work, the authors label storsumers as retail grid-connected customers that exhibit increased energy controllability over their net demand profiles, owing to the pairing of their photovoltaic systems with energy storage devices. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Billing schemes; Cross subsidy; Distribution levels; Energy distributions; Grid-connected; Net energy; Photovoltaic systems; Real systems; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021901225

This results in prohibitively high electricity costs, increasing operational costs. Recently, researchers proposed using energy storage devices (ESDs) in datacenters to reduce their maximum power demand. ESDs enable datacenters to set smaller power budgets because they can provide additional energy when the demand is expected to be higher than this budget. This paper leverages a detailed survey of previous studies and analyzes the economical feasibility of this methodology from three different perspectives. We first compare different ESDs based on their ability to manage datacenter peak power. Then, we demonstrate that peak shaving benefits might differ due to datacenter usage and ownership. Finally, we analyze the option where datacenters participate in electric utility programs with their ESDs to obtain additional savings.

Given the recent developments in the synthesis and hydrogen desorption approaches, here presented detailed comparison study of three AlH3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-) is aimed to explain and potentially guide the improvements in applicability of these materials. We use electronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) to address stability and bonding in α-, β- and γ-AlH3. For better understanding of stability of various polymorphs, formation enthalpy of α′-AlH3 is also addressed. Electronic properties (electronic density distribution, density of states, band structure and Bader's charge) are calculated using both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) for exchange-correlation, as well as additional Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson functional (TBmBJ) for exchange. Study shows interesting correlation of electronic structure and bond strength, not observed in previously reported studies of alanes, and presents results obtained using TBmBJ method applied on β- and γ-alanes. Band gaps, calculated using TBmBJ, are increased up to 96% as compared to the GGA-PBE values. Due to the lack of experimental data, strong conclusion on the applicability of TBmBJ for alanes cannot be made, although good agreement to G0W0 value and overestimation of GW value is seen in case of α-AlH3. Band structure calculations lead to conclusions on electron mobility and other types of application beside hydrogen storage, while based on Bader's theory we compare bonding in all investigated polymorphs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AlH3; Band gap; Charge analysis; Electronic properties; Hydrogen storage","Band structure; Chemical bonds; Digital storage; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Storage (materials); AlH3; Band structure calculation; Charge analysis; Electronic density distribution; Electronic structure calculations; Electronics applications; Generalized gradient approximations; Perdew-burke-ernzerhof; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017004036

However, FPGA lookup tables introduce significant area and power overheads, making it difficult to use FPGA devices in environments with tight cost and power constraints. This is the case for datacenter servers, where a modestly-sized FPGA cannot accommodate the large number of diverse accelerators that datacenter applications need.This paper introduces DRAF, an architecture for bit-level reconfigurable logic that uses DRAM subarrays to implement dense lookup tables. DRAF overlaps DRAM operations with routing latency to minimize the impact of DRAM latency. It also supports multiple configuration contexts that can be used to quickly switch between different accelerators. Overall, DRAF trades off some performance of FPGAs for significant gains in area and power. DRAF improves area density by 10x over FPGAs and power consumption by 3x, enabling DRAF to satisfy demanding applications within strict power and cost constraints. While accelerators mapped to DRAF are 2-3x slower than those in FPGAs, they still deliver a 13x speedup and an 11x reduction in power consumption over a Xeon core for a wide range of datacenter tasks.

In this study, a transient numerical simulation of a solar power plant was developed by using direct steam generation (DSG) technology. In this system, condensate water from a Rankine cycle is pumped directly to solar parabolic trough collectors. The pressurized water is heated and evaporated before being superheated inside the solar collectors and directed back to the steam turbines, where the Rankine cycle is a reheated-regenerative cycle. The plant performance with saturated steam production is compared with the performance of a superheated plant. A mathematical model of each system component is presented, with the solar power cycle modeled by the TRNSYS-17 simulation program. Annual transient performance, including plant power and efficiency, is presented for both plants. As expected, the power of the superheated plant outperforms the saturated plant by approximately 45%, whereas the efficiency decreases by approximately 10%. Furthermore, the power of such plants is considerably improved under the weather of Makkah, 22.4°N, and it is approximately 40 MW for both the spring and autumn seasons. The annual generated energy is approximately 8062 MWh. The levelized electricity cost (LEC) was estimated for both the DSG and the corresponding synthetic oil plants.

In this study, a porous, zeolite-like aluminophosphate with LTA (Linde Type A) topology is inspected as an energy-storage material. The study is motivated by the material's high predicted pore volume. According to sorption and calorimetric tests, the aluminophosphate outperforms all other zeolite-like and metal-organic porous materials tested so far. It adsorbs water in an extremely narrow relative-pressure interval (0.10 &lt; p/p0 &lt; 0.15) and exhibits superior water uptake (0.42 g g−1) and energy-storage capacity (527 kW h m−3). It also shows remarkable cycling stability; after 40 cycles of adsorption/desorption its capacity drops by less than 2%. Desorption temperature for this material, which is one of crucial parameters in applications, is lower from desorption temperatures of other tested materials by 10–15 °C. Furthermore, its heat-pump performance is very high, allowing efficient cooling in demanding conditions (with cooling power up to 350 kW h m−3 even at 30 °C temperature difference between evaporator and environment). On the microscopic scale, sorption mechanism in AlPO4-LTA is elucidated by X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, and first-principles calculations. In this aluminophosphate, energy is stored predominately in hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules within the pores. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, excellent dielectric properties with a very low tanδ ≈ 0.017–0.079 at 1 kHz, high ε′ ≈ 5.5 × 103–3.5 × 104 and good dielectric-temperature stability with a temperature coefficient, Δε′(T)/ε′RT &lt; ± 15%, over a wide temperature range (e.g., Δε′(200 °C)/ε′RT = 6.26%) were simultaneously achieved in heat-treated Ga3 + and Ta5 + co-doped TiO2 (GTTO) ceramics. Both ε′ and tanδ were nearly independent of DC bias up to 40 V. Notably, extremely large total-resistivity values of the insulating components were achieved (106–1010 Ω·cm) over the temperature range of 20–150 °C. These excellent electrical parameters are extremely hard to simultaneously realize in most giant dielectric materials. According to a first-principles study, there is a rather small coupling between 2Ta diamond and 2GaVo triangular shapes. Therefore, improvement of dielectric permittivity comes from insulating layers.

On the other hand, with phase change materials the temperature of the material does not have to change due to the latent heat storage possibilities. A buffer tank with two pipe coils filled with phase change materials is investigated with the aim to reduce the storage volume.

The hourly electricity demand of the house was estimated by carrying out a detailed survey of the life style and daily habits of the household. No algorithm of any kind was used for the estimation of the energy demand with the exception of relating the lighting requirement to the daylight hours and the heating and cooling requirements to the seasonal weather changes. The developed method estimates the annual demand with an overall error of 8.68%. The net grid dependency and the feasibility of the PV-BES system was calculated for different combinations of PV and BES system sizes. It was found that when the maximum available roof area is used for PV installation and when the BES system size is increased, it is possible to achieve almost zero net grid dependency, and it is estimated that houses that are in regions with more abundant solar radiation and/ or with lower annual electricity consumption, can reach zero net grid dependency. However, the feasibility indicator, which is the payback period, turned out to be no less than 25 years in any of the scenarios. The reasons for the infeasibility are the high prices of PV and BES systems as well as the current restriction in the regulations in Turkey, which prevents BES system owners from participating in unlicensed energy generation schemes and selling excess electricity back to the grid. In order to overcome this situation, regulations should be updated to allow BES system owners to benefit from feed-in-tariff schemes, thereby increasing the popularity of both PV and BES usage in Turkey. © 2017, College Publishing.

Light exposure secures short and robust sprouts for mechanical planting. In 2014–2015, different pre-sprouting treatments were investigated, including different daily durations of light exposure during 6 to 12 weeks at 10 °C in controlled environments. The effects on sprout growth, early growth vigour and field performance in four cultivars were assessed in the greenhouse and in the field. Results indicated that the light treatments involving 8, 16 and 24 h light exposure per day all strongly inhibited sprout growth, with only minor differences between treatments. Compared to untreated tubers, within all cultivars, emergence and early plant growth was clearly and similarly accelerated by all light treatments. At harvest, cultivars were differently affected by the pre-sprouting treatments with regard to haulm senescence (greenness), tuber DM and total yield, and the latest cultivars seemed to benefit more from green-sprouting than the earliest. Different daily durations of light exposure during green-sprouting had a largely similar impact on seed tuber performance in all cultivars. Dark-sprouted tubers (de-sprouted before planting) performed largely similar to control tubers from 4 °C storage.

Meteorological data (such as: global solar radiation, Wind speed, Wind direction, air temperature and relative humid-ity) was measured at Ouled Fares site in Chlef, between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2015. The monthly average global solar radiation measured at the Ouled Fares site during this period ranged from 2.387 kWh/m2/d to 7.322 kWh/m2/d. The monthly average Wind speeds ranged between 1.328 m/s and 3.404 m/s. The objective of this study was the optimization of a hybrid Photovoltaic-Wind-Diesel power system. Simulation software HOMER was used to find out if the hybrid system performed comparably in terms of technical and economic feasibility to a conventional system connected to the grid. The study found that the Photovoltaic-Diesel-Battery system was the most economic power system, it produced 30,472 kWh/y with COE 0.224 $/kWh. The proposed system comprised of 20 kW of PV panels, one Diesel generating 2.5 kW rated power and 36 batteries of nominal capacity 4 kWh. It was noted that 96% (29,144 kWh/y) of energy was produced by the Photovoltaic generator and 4% (1,328 kWh/y) was produced by the generator, which worked 586 h/y with a consumption of 449 L/y. The Diesel price of 0.70 US$ per liter was considered fixed and without fluctuations. The hybrid system was able to meet energy requirements (load of 19,781 kWh/y) of the village with 15.1% energy in excess (4,593 kWh/y). The proposed system avoided over 28.39 kg/y of CO2 less emissions for the local atmosphere of the site and would save 22.59 barrel/y of fossil fuel. Moreover, the comparison showed that the autonomous hybrid system is the best choice compared to the conventional grid connection with COE 0.047$/kWh when the connection distance exceeds 1.35 km. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

In the present study, we hypothesize that leptin is also present in various organs of the fresh water prawns, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The existence and distribution of a leptin-like peptide in prawn tissues were verified by using Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical detection (ID) using primary antibody against human leptin. With WB, a leptin-like peptide, having a molecular weight of 15 kDa, was detected in the brain, thoracic ganglia, abdominal ganglia, parts of the gastro-intestinal tract, hepatopancreas, adipocytes and gonads. By ID, leptin immunoreactivity (leptin-ir) was detected in the brain, thoracic ganglia and intersegmental commissural nerve fibers of abdominal ganglia. In the gastrointestinal tract, there was intense leptin-ir in the apical part of the epithelial cells of the cardiac and pyloric parts of the stomach. In the midgut and hindgut, the leptin-ir was detected in epithelial cells and basal cells located near the basal lamina of the epithelium. In addition, there was leptin-ir in the Restzellen cells in the hepatopancreas which produce digestive enzymes. In the ovary, the strong intensity of a leptin-ir was detected in the cytoplasm of middle to late stage oocytes, whereas no positive staining was detected in follicular cells. An intense leptin-ir was detected in spermatocytes and sustentacular cells in the seminiferous tubules in the testes of small and orange claw males. Taken together, the detection of the leptin-ir in several organs implicates the existence of a leptin-like peptide in various organs of the freshwater prawn; and like in vertebrates this peptide may be an important hormonal factor in controlling feeding and reproductive process. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Central nervous system; Freshwater prawn; Gastrointestinal tract; Leptin; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; Ovary; Testis","leptin; leptin; abdominal ganglion; adipocyte; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cytoplasm; digestive system; epithelium cell; female; gonad; hepatopancreas; hindgut; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; male; midgut; molecular weight; nonhuman; spermatocyte; stomach; thoracic ganglion; Western blotting; animal; central nervous system; digestive system; gonad; metabolism; Palaemonidae; staining; tissue distribution; Animals; Blotting, Western; Central Nervous System; Digestive System; Female; Gonads; Immunohistochemistry; Leptin; Male; Palaemonidae; Staining and Labeling; Tissue Distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020714143

But speed of CAM comes at the cost of various disadvantages, such as high latency, low storage density, and low architectural scalability. In addition, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are used in many applications because of its advantages, do not have hard IPs for CAM. Since FPGAs have embedded IPs for random-access memories (RAMs), several RAM-based CAM architectures on FPGAs are available in the literature. However, these architectures are especially targeted for ternary CAMs, not for BiCAMs; thus, the available RAM-based CAMs may not be fully beneficial for BiCAMs in terms of architectural design. Since modern FPGAs are enriched with logical resources, why not to configure them to design BiCAM on FPGA? This letter presents a logic-based high performance BiCAM architecture (LH-CAM) using Xilinx FPGA. The proposed CAM is composed of CAM words and associated comparators. A sample of LH-CAM of size 64 × 36 is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA.

At these sites, groundwater is contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. In this project various pilot set-ups were tested as a non-invasive technique to remove chlorinated ethenes from contaminated groundwater by integrating a UV reactor into the ATES system. It was demonstrated that per- and trichloro ethenes (PCE and TCE) can be photolyzed by LP UV-lamps up to 10-20% at a relatively high dose of 500 mJ/cm2. However, the photolysis of cis-dichloro ethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) was limited to maximum 5%. In addition, it was found that, during the photolysis trans-DCE may be formed, which usually is not observed in biodegradation pathways of chloroethenes. As the groundwater composition at a certain location may show significant variations in time (concentration differences of a factor 2-3 were no exception during the various experiments) it is important to adjust the system to the range of concentrations that can be expected. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Magnesite and water vapour can form nesquehonite or lansfordite via reaction (R1) and (R2): MgCO3 + 3H2O(g) ↔ MgCO3·3H2O δH = -1.0 MJ/kg MgCO3·3H2O, T=298K (R1) MgCO3 + 5H2O(g) ↔MgCO3·5H2O δH = -1.41 MJ/kg MgCO3·5H2O, T=298K (R2) Compared to other chemical sorption compounds, its advantages are low operating temperatures while they can act as a fire retardant. Experimental data is presented on the reactivity of the dehydration at various temperatures. The rate of dehydration of the nesquehonite is sufficient at low temperatures such as 50 °C and the reaction is about 90 % completed after 120 minutes. Magnesite reaches partial re-hydration to about 37% conversion after 24 hours. For better contact between reagents, mixtures with silica gel were used. A too large amount of water vapour, causing condensation of the water, appears to make the reactions irreversible.

The objective of this study to assess the effects of Low Carbon Society (LCS) on the Thai and Sri Lankan power systems, in terms of CO2 mitigation, and energy security and other techno-economic results, such as marginal abatement costs. This study models the power sectors using a bottom-up optimization model called AIM/Enduse. The crux of the analyses is carried out using scenarios. Along with the LCS scenario, this study also considers a LCS scenario without the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and has two separate scenarios with emission taxes of 50 USD/t-CO2 and 100 USD/t-CO2 on the power generation. Results show that there is a cumulative mitigation of 1.4 Gt-CO2 in the LCS scenario during 2010–2050, when compared to the BAU case for Thailand. Also, the effectiveness of the LCS scenario without CCS, known as the LCS/CCS scenario, is considerably reduced in the Thai power sector. The LCS scenario also has higher energy security, and better economic benefits. The LCS scenario in the Sri Lankan (SL) power sector has a cumulative mitigation of 166 Mt-CO2. The reduction in effectiveness of the LCS/CCS scenario in SL is not as drastic as the Thai power sector. The need of CCS for Sri Lanka is much reduced. The Marginal Abatement Costs (MAC) show that CCS technology plays a vital part in the Thai power sector and helps reduce the average abatement cost. This holds true in the case of the Sri Lankan power sector as well, yet not to the extent of the Thai case. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement cost; AIM/Enduse; Energy security; Low emission; Power sector","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Energy policy; Energy security; Optimization; Abatement costs; AIM/Enduse; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Environmental aspects; Low emission; Marginal abatement costs; Optimization modeling; Power sector; Carbon capture; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; energy use; environmental assessment; power generation; Sri Lanka; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019579229

For low-temperature cool-down, Sunflower Oil shows the best performance with the lowest heat loss factor due its larger thermal mass as a result of its larger density. The best stratification distribution is obtained with Shell Thermia B which has the lowest density. For medium-temperature cool-down cycles, Sunflower Oil shows the best overall thermal performance with less heat losses due to its larger thermal mass which slows the rate of natural convection.

An analysis was made to determine whether the solar collectors’ fluid thermal inertia has an impact on the storage tank water temperature. Three different working fluids have been considered. The results showed that for the entire 2-day period in which simulations have been conducted, differences between the useful energy delivered to the storage tank water in the case with mass flow rate adjusted depending on the incident solar radiation and the cases with constant mass flow rate were approximately 1 kWh in summer and 0.72 kWh in winter.

By contrast, diversifying into the green energy path has the potential to close the gap between the black and green path, step-by-step.

He concludes that despite new initiatives having been taken to close the gap between Statoil's fossil and renewable energy paths within offshore wind and carbon capture and storage, as well as the new and upcoming gas projects in the company's portfolio, the company is highly path-dependent on the black carbon path and is prolonging its corporate strategy towards increased oil and gas investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Company strategies; Energy transitions; Path dependence; Renewable energy; Statoil",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018559483

In this work, the building composite PCM was prepared by impregnation of n-heneicosane (HE) as an organic PCM into bentonite (BNT) clay. The chemical, morphological, and thermal characterizations of the developed BNT/HE composite PCM was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry (TG) analysis techniques. The SEM and FT-IR results showed that the HE was well incorporated into the pores of the BNT and had good compatibility with the components of the composites. The DSC analysis results showed that the composite including 36% HE by mass had a melting temperature of 38.32°C and solidification temperature of 38.34°C; in addition, the composite also can store latent heat of 96.23 J/g and release latent heat of 94.16 J/g. The TG analysis demonstrated that the developed composite PCM had good thermal durability. The thermal cycling test confirmed that the composite had good long-term thermal reliability and chemical stability. The laboratory-scale thermoregulation performance test revealed that the BNT/HE composite PCM wallboard had the effect of decreasing the indoor temperature of the building cell for a considerable period.

Here, previously identified three black poplar genotypes having contrasting response to drought were subjected to gradual soil water depletion in a pot trial to identify their physiological, morphological and antioxidation related adaptations. We also performed a microarray based transcriptome analyses on the leaves of genotypes by using Affymetrix poplar Genome Array containing 56,000 transcripts. Phenotypic analyses of each genotype confirmed their differential adaptations to drought that could be classified as drought escape, avoidance and tolerance. Comparative transcriptomic analysis indicated highly divergent gene expression patterns among the genotypes in response to drought and post drought re-watering (PDR). We identified 10641, 3824 and 9411 transcripts exclusively regulated in drought escape, avoidance and tolerant genotypes, respectively. The key genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, lipid metabolism, generation of precursor metabolites/energy, protein folding, redox homeostasis, secondary metabolic process and cell wall component biogenesis, were affected by drought stresses in the leaves of these genotypes. Transcript isoforms showed increased expression specificity in the genes coding for bark storage proteins and small heat shock proteins in drought tolerant genotype. On the other hand, drought-avoiding genotype specifically induced the transcripts annotated to the genes functional in secondary metabolite production that linked to enhanced leaf water content and growth performance under drought stress. Transcriptome profiling of drought escape genotype indicated specific regulation of the genes functional in programmed cell death and leaf senescence. Specific upregulation of GTP cyclohydrolase II and transcription factors (WRKY and ERFs) in only this genotype were associated to ROS dependent signalling pathways and gene regulation network responsible in induction of many degrading enzymes acting on cell wall carbohydrates, fatty acids and proteins under drought stress. Our findings provide new insights into the transcriptome dynamics and components of regulatory network associated with drought adaptation strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Black poplar; Drought; Drought adaptation strategies; Microarray","plant protein; water; drought; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype; metabolism; physiology; Populus; protein microarray; Droughts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genotype; Plant Proteins; Populus; Protein Array Analysis; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016603256

In this report, we present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the in situ growth of titanium oxide quantum dots in polyaniline host via water vapor flow diffusion as an easily adaptable route to prepare other ceramic-polymer nanocomposites. The main relevance of this method is the possibility to prepare ceramic quantum dots from alkoxide precursors using water vapor flow into any hydrophobic polymer host and to achieve good homogeneity and size-control. In addition, we perform full characterization by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, small angle X-ray scattering, thermogravimetric and calorimetric analyses, confocal Raman microscopy and impedance spectroscopy analyses. The presence of the polymer host and interparticle Coulomb repulsive interactions was evaluated as an influence for the formation of ~3–8 nm equally-sized quantum dots independently of the concentration. The polyaniline polaron population showed an increase for the quantum dots diluted regime and the suppression at the concentrated regime, ascribed to the formation of chemical bonds at the interface, which was confirmed by theoretical simulations.

At 20 °C, the BET-monolayer moisture was observed as 0.044 g/g dry-solids, and decreased with the increase of temperature. Un-freezable water was found as 0.26 g/g sample and the maximal-freeze-concentration temperature (Tm′) was observed as −34.5 °C. The freezing point and solids-melting peak were modeled by Chen's and Flory-Huggins models, respectively. Browning of banana stored at different moisture and temperature (i.e. at different micro-regions) were measured as a function of storage time and modeled with first order reaction kinetics. The variation of reaction rate constant was analyzed based on the glass transition, water activity and macro-micro region concepts. At a specific moisture content, reaction rate constant showed a shift (i.e. sample containing freezable water) or change in slope (i.e. sample containing un-freezable water), when plotted as a function of temperature.

The diatomite was treated with ultrasound at various periods of time. The diatomite treated with ultrasound for 60 min (DA-60) was the optimum condition providing the highest surface area without structural degradation. The melting point and latent heat of the paraffin/DA-60 composite PCM were 59 °C and 45.90 J g−1, respectively. The obtained form-stable PCM had good thermal reliability after 500 cycles of thermal cycling test. The thermal performance of PCM was tested by incorporating the paraffin/DA-60 composite PCM into gypsum board. The results showed that the gypsum board containing the paraffin/DA-60 composite PCM had better thermal energy absorption and release characteristics than those of the control sample. The incorporation of paraffin/DA-60 composite PCM into suitable building materials could thus considerably reduce the energy consumption of cooling system in buildings. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Diatomite; Form-stable phase change material; Thermal energy storage; Ultrasonic treatment","Characterization; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Gypsum; Heat storage; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Ultrasonics; Diatomite; Form stable phase change material; Release characteristics; Structural degradation; Thermal cycling test; Thermal Performance; Thermal reliability; Ultrasonic treatments; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007478342

Rapid Viscosity Analyser (RVA) profiles illustrated significant increase in batter viscosity attributable to OE (p &lt; 0.05). However, the maximum increase was observed at 8% replacement with a viscosity of 2607cP. Shearing effect on the cooked batters at 50 °C was determined using Brookfield rotational viscometer. Profiles indicated increase in shear stress (SS) as a function of shear rate (SR), confirming a pseudo-plastic behaviour of the blends (n &lt; 1). Consistency index (K) and flow behaviour index (n) of the power law model were evaluated. The high K (3.6) was recorded at 8% OE corroborated the RVA viscosity data. However, the least n (0.24) reflected the highest pseudo-plasticity value of the batter.

This paper deals with the modeling and control of a hybrid system integrating a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) in variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) and batteries as energy storage system (BESS). Moreover a new supervisory control system for the optimal management and robust operation of a VSWT and a BESS is described and evaluated by simulation under wind speed variation and grid demand changes. In this way, the proposed coordinated controller has three subsystems (generator side, BESS side and grid side converters). The main function of the first one is to extract the maximum wind power through controlling the rotational speed of the PMSG, for this a maximum power point tracking algorithm based on fuzzy logic control and a second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC) theory is designed. The task of the second one is to maintain the required direct current (DC) link voltage level of the PMSG through a bidirectional DC/DC converter, whereas in the last, a (SOSMC) is investigated to achieve smooth regulation of grid active and reactive powers quantities, which provides better results in terms of attenuation of the harmonics present in the grid courant compared with the conventional first-order sliding controller.

The work presented here describes the development of a new protocol towards the synthesis and functionalization of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photo-/thermoswitch. The key step is a facile condensation reaction using a functionalized tropone derivative, and the new synthetic method was employed in the regioselective preparation of a novel dimethyl-substituted DHA photoswitch. This compound presents the first accessible derivative with alkyl groups on the seven-membered ring of the system ― at positions C5 and C7. From experimental and theoretical kinetics studies on the thermal VHF-to-DHA electrocyclic reaction, the influence of the electron-donating methyl groups was elucidated. In addition, we subjected a small selection of 4,8a-dialkylated compounds to a computational study to elucidate how steric interactions can alter the relative DHA–VHF stabilities. The synthetic methodology offers access to novel DHA scaffolds and substitution patterns, which in turn can lead to systems that can help to address broader questions concerning the potential applicability of the DHA/VHF system in the context of solar-thermal energy-storage systems or other photochromic applications. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Because the surface area of a human body is limited to 2 m2, the key challenge in this field is how to realize a high areal capacitance for SCs, while achieving rapid charging, good capacitive retention, flexibility, and waterproofing. To address this challenge, low-cost materials are used including multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and metallic textiles to fabricate composite fabric electrodes, in which MWCNT and RGO are alternatively vacuum-filtrated directly onto Ni-coated cotton fabrics. The composite fabric electrodes display typical electrical double layer capacitor behavior, and reach an ultrahigh areal capacitance up to 6.2 F cm−2 at a high areal current density of 20 mA cm−2. All-solid-state fabric-type SC devices made with the composite fabric electrodes and water-repellent treatment can reach record-breaking performance of 2.7 F cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2 at the first charge–discharge cycle, 3.2 F cm−2 after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles, zero capacitive decay after 10 000 bending tests, and 10 h continuous underwater operation.

Materials such as CaCu3Ti4O12, displaying the giant dielectric permittivity due to extrinsic Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization effect, have previously been reported. Ferroelectric materials possessing intrinsic ionic polarization due to a phase transition to the polar state have also been indicated to possess a high tunability of the dielectric permittivity by dc electric field. Here, a class of the giant-permittivity materials based on SrTiO3 ceramics doped with up to 1% of yttrium and their processing concept, which yields the dielectric permittivity up to ∼209,000 at 10 kHz for nitrogen sintering atmosphere, and the relative tunability up to ∼74% under 20 kV cm−1 for oxygen sintering atmosphere, is reported. The high tunability is proved to be due to polar clusters created at low temperatures by off-central Y3+ ions on Sr2+ sites.

An aggregated storage capacity of multiple EVs is more meaningful for a distribution grid. Commercial car parks at metropolitan cities and parking lots (PLs) of hospitals, shopping centres, universities etc. are the potential areas that can be organised for these purposes. This study presents a distributed storage capacity formulation of an EV PL that can be used in distribution system reliability improvement. The storage capacity was determined by sequential Monte-Carlo simulations. Real car arrival-departure data provided by the PL authority of Istanbul, technical parameters (SoC of the batteries, battery capacity of EVs, charging and discharging rates), and some side-specific probabilistic parameters (driver behaviour, mean transportation distance etc.) were used for realistic model development. Special attention was given to some critical time periods when the storage support was more crucial for the utility grid. Moreover, future expectations for city urban planning and for travel behaviour of the community were also included in the model. Finally, impacts of several important parameters on the storage capacity of the PL were determined through sensitivity analysis. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Electric batteries; Energy storage; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Secondary batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; System-on-chip; Distributed energy storages; Distributed storage; Distribution grid; Distribution system reliability; Energy storage capacity; Metropolitan cities; Sequential Monte Carlo simulation; Transportation distance; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028566906

A novel technology for combined production of these resources and safe long-term storage of carbon dioxide is based on the injection of carbon dioxide injection into in situ methane hydrate-filled sediments. This will lead to an exchange of the in situ methane hydrate over to carbon dioxide-dominated hydrate and a simultaneous release of methane gas. Recent theoretical and experimental results indicate that the conversion from natural gas hydrate to carbon dioxide hydrate and mixed carbon dioxide/methane hydrate follows two primary mechanisms. Direct solid state transformation is possible, but very slow. The dominating mechanism involves formation of a new hydrate from injected carbon dioxide and associated dissociation of the in situ natural gas hydrate by the released heat. Nitrogen is frequently added in order to increase gas permeability and to reduce blocking due to new hydrate formation, and will as such also reduce the relative impact of the fast mechanism on the conversion rates. In addition to carbon dioxide also other sour gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, may follow the carbon dioxide from the sour gas removal process. Hydrogen sulfide is a very aggressive hydrate former. It is abundant in various amounts in thermogenic hydrocarbon systems. In this work we investigate the sensitivity of possible additions of hydrogen sulfide in carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixtures, and how the ability to form new hydrate changes with the additions of hydrogen sulfide. This analysis is applied to four case studies: (1) Bjørnøya gas hydrate basin, (2) the Nankai field in Japan, (3) the Hikurangi Margin in New Zealand, and (4) a gas hydrate basin in South-West Taiwan. The hydrate saturations found in these fields vary over a range from 25-80%. Pressures range from 4-22.6 MPa and temperatures from 275.15-292.77 K. For all these ranges of conditions, even 1% H2S will substantially increase the ability to form new hydrate from an injected CO2/N2 mixture containing H2S. Except for the most shallow of the reservoirs (Bjørnøya) 1% H2S results in formation of a new hydrate for all concentrations of CO2 in N2 above 1%. Implementation of results from this work into a reservoir simulator is a natural follow-up which can shed light on the macroscopic consequences in term of possible local blocking of the flow due to content of H2S. The mass transport, mass balances, and energy balances in a reservoir simulator are also needed for a more detailed evaluation on how the content of H2S and CO2 changes over time and location in the reservoir due to various processes in addition to hydrate formation. H2S and CO2 dissolves significantly in pore water, and also adsorbs well on various sediment minerals. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Desulfurization; Gas permeability; Gases; Hydration; Hydrogen sulfide; Methane; Mixtures; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Nitrogen; Offshore gas wells; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sediments; Sour gas; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Thermodynamic stability; Carbon dioxide hydrates; Carbon dioxide injection; Hydrate saturation; Long-term storage; Macroscopic consequences; Reservoir simulator; Solid state transformations; Thermogenic hydrocarbons; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020911937

However, little information is available about propagation of this species from seeds. Thus, we aimed to investigate the basic seed biology of this species and to facilitate its propagation and conservation. Effects of light and temperature on seed germination were studied. Morphology of seed germination and embryo: seed ratio were recorded. Seed predation percentages, initial moisture content and nutrient content were determined and optimum storage conditions identified. The highest germination percentage was in light/dark at 25 ˚C. In two trials, of 38.66 and 31.66 % of the seeds were predated. Total energy value of seeds was higher than that of Cocos nucifera, a common known polycarpic palm. Seeds of C. umbraculifera have morphophysiological dormancy as evidence by embryo growth prior to radicle emergence and the relatively long time (42-49 days) taken for completion of germination. Low predation percentage and slow germination rate indicate that the predator satiation hypothesis is not sufficient to describe the evolution and existence of monocarpy in C. umbraculifera. Decreased viability during dry storage at ambient room conditions and a moisture content of 16 ± 3 % indicate that seeds have intermediate storage behaviour. Storage in open polythene bags at 8 ˚C is suggested as the best storage condition for C. umbraculifera seeds. © 2017, College of Life Science.

The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as ‘end consumers’ of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studiesRotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate adaptation; Coastal cities; Floating urbanization; Land scarcity; Resilience; Water-food-energy nexus","Algae; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Mathematical transformations; Oils and fats; Urban growth; Water quality; Climate adaptation; Coastal cities; Floating urbanization; Land scarcity; Resilience; Nutrients",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016570919

The response time for the BESS is as low as one second, which is faster than the current accepted practice of a conventional generator with governor control. Using PJM&#x2019;s performance template gives an average performance score of 93% while the storage is providing AGC. However, because the storage system only charges when there is sufficient wind energy and spent significant time in maintenance mode, the 29-day performance average is only 65%. The battery was able to carry out some mode of AGC for 64% of the test period. When energy costs and battery degradation are considered, utilizing the battery costs USD19,000 over the 29-day period, whereas the potential income from AGC, charging only with wind power, was USD9,037. This 29-day demonstration shows that batteries have fast response and can perform AGC, but within a wind farm AGC is unlikely to be suitable without changes in the tariff schemes.

The price of crude oil is highly influenced by the fluctuations in supply–demand gap and global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays an important role in the global oil supply and demand. The oil price volatility depends on the combined effects of invariant and variable factors. Invariant factors include feedstock prices, exploration costs, drilling costs, chemical composition of oil, production costs, distribution costs, marketing costs, and packaging and storage costs, while the variable factors include global economic activity, level of production, level of consumption, exchange value of the US dollar ($), current supply and demand, geopolitical reasons, weather-related developments, and political events. Supply factors have played a more important role than demand factors in driving the 50% drop in the oil price between mid 2014 and early 2015. This paper aims to review the historical change in the crude oil prices, control limits of the OPEC annual price per barrel from 2003 to 2015, and factors affecting the oil price volatility. As a result of the review, a mean and standard deviation for the last 13 years (2003–2015) was estimated by setting an upper limit (US $ 128.63 per barrel) with ambition that this will support the oil-producing nations in gaining large cash surplus in their fiscal budget. Similarly, a lower control limit can be set at US $ 16.97. However, this will cause a direct loss to crude oil exporters, but the impacts vary from one oil-producing country to another country. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Crude oil; crude oil price; oil price volatility; oil supply and demand; OPEC","Budget control; Crude oil; Economics; Energy resources; Chemical compositions; Crude oil prices; Global economic activity; Mean and standard deviations; Oil price volatility; Oil producing countries; Oil supplies; OPEC; Costs",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017270835

CLC is an innovative concept and an attractive option to capture CO2 with a significantly lower energy penalty than other carbon-capture technologies. The principal idea behind CLC is to split the combustion process into two separate steps (redox reactions) carried out in two separate reactors: an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, by introducing a suitable metal oxide which acts as an oxygen carrier (OC) that circulates between the two reactors. In this study, an Aspen Plus model was developed by employing the conservation of mass and energy for all components of the CLC system. In the analysis, equilibrium-based thermodynamic reactions with no OC deactivation were considered. The model was employed to investigate the effect of various key operating parameters such as air, fuel, and OC mass flow rates, operating pressure, and waste heat recovery on the performance of a natural gas-fired power plant with multistage CLC. The results of these parameters on the plant's thermal and exergetic efficiencies are presented. Based on the lower heating value, the analysis shows a thermal efficiency gain of more than 6 percentage points for CLC-integrated natural gas power plants compared to similar power plants with pre- or post-combustion CO2 capture technologies.

Detecting the changes occurring in the frequency spectrum of the EAF voltages fast and accurately has crucial importance to eliminate the undesired effects of harmonics and interharmonics using advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters, synchronous static compensators, energy storage systems, etc. The aim of the research work presented here is to reduce the spectral leakage effects experienced by Fourier analysis based methods by estimating the spectral model parameters using nonlinear least squares. The Fourier spectrum of the signal is used as a priori information; however, the proposed model does not suffer from the spectral leakage problems encountered by the Fourier analysis based methods in case of fundamental frequency variation, which frequently occurs in the existence of EAF plants in an electrical system. Moreover, the proposed model permits frequency detection at a much higher resolution than the Fourier analysis based methods. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic and field data and it has been shown that it is able to detect frequency components and the corresponding amplitudes and phases of harmonics and interharmonics with high accuracy for EAF plants. © 2017 IEEE.","Electric arc furnace (EAF); harmonics; interharmonics; nonlinear least squares estimation; power quality (PQ)","Digital storage; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Furnaces; Harmonic analysis; Least squares approximations; Electric arc furnace; Electrical arc furnaces; Energy storage systems; Fundamental frequencies; harmonics; Harmonics and interharmonics; Inter-harmonics; Non-linear least squares; Electric furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028047154

The TEI was constructed with the same dimensions as a commercial egg incubator (CEI), which was made to the required dimensions for hatching 24 eggs per period of 21 days. The TEI was designed with 2 operating modes of heat sources: a thermoelectric (TE) module used for daytime operation and a TES containing phase-change materials (PCM) which supplied heat to the TEI for nighttime operation. The PV panels were designed to be the primary energy source for generating 360 W of electricity, which was supplied to heat sources of TEI according to the energy load for providing fertile chicken eggs (24 eggs/hatching). The incubating temperature and relative humidity (RH) inside the TEI-TES were controlled under optimum environmental conditions for hatching (36-39°C and 60-80% RH) to stimulate embryonic growth. As a result, the TEI-TES achieved and maintained an optimum incubating temperature in the range of 36.7-38.8°C and the correct RH of 66±0.2 % in the warm weather of Thailand over the incubating period of 21 days. The TEI-TES was able to maintain optimum environmental conditions for chicken-egg hatching, and its performance was comparable to that of the CEI. The working mechanisms of the TE module and TES are also discussed. The results show that the TEI-TES with PV panels as the primary energy source is suitable for use in remote areas which have no on-grid electricity supply. © 2017 by Maejo University, San Sai, Chiang Mai, 50290 Thailand.","Egg incubator; Hatching; Thermal energy storage; Thermoelectrics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026656452

This scenario has become commonplace for the past few years due to the increasing frequency and strength of typhoons and aggravated by climate change. To get the most out of the rainwater potential energy, the system discussed here was equipped with a control system to regulate the amount of water driving the turbine in order to match the amount of energy absorbed by the battery and any connected active load at any given time. The design and construction of the control system is based on a 16-Vac turbine-generator set whose output is feed to a regulated power supply that delivers 14.0 Vdc. The regulated voltage is then used to charge a battery and/or drive active loads directly. The result is a system that can supply moderate electrical power and at the same time manage itself to control charging voltage, charging current and availability of rainwater.

In Tanzania, many welding activities like construction and laying the huge pipelines for gas and water transportation and distribution as well construction of storage tanks are performed. The objects are working under high pressure and therefore, it is important to produce the weld beads with high quality. Industrial radiography uses ionizing radiation to view objects in a way that cannot be seen otherwise. The method has grown out of engineering, and is a major element of non-destructive testing (NDT) to inspect materials for hidden flaws. The radiation caused by these facilities is very dangerous however, with the use of new technologies and proper protection, risks of injury and death associated with radiation can be greatly reduced. Applying different works conducted by other researchers, this paper gives the general overview on the use of radiation devices, effects of ionizing radiations, the consequences of misusing the devices and the safety precautions taken. It highlights the efforts taken by Tanzania Atomic Energy Commission (TAEC) on registration of radiation devices. Further, it presents the challenges faced during the weld joints inspections. It has been shown that, out of 470 registered facilities until 2010, the registered industrial radiography owned by companies executing welding works were 4 (1%). Also, it has been revealed that the people around the weld joints inspection area are exposed to ionizing radiation. Lack of awareness is one of the contributing factors. The paper recommends to abide with protective measures when using radiation devices. © 2017 IAEME.","Ionizing Radiation; NDT; Radiation Devices Register; Radiographic Inspection; Safety; TAEC; Weld defects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019627650

The results show that the strategies of monetization do not have a significant effect on the design and they do not result in an incentive for biogas consumption.

The high reactivity of plasma allows rapid and low temperature conversion of hydroxides into monometallic, bimetallic, or even more complex nanostructured phosphides. These same phosphides are much more difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. Further, we present a general strategy for significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of monometallic phosphides by substituting extrinsic metal atoms. Using NiCoP as a demonstration, we show that the Co substitution into Ni2P not only effectively alters the electronic structure and improves the intrinsic reactivity and electrical conductivity, but also stabilizes Ni species when used as supercapacitor electrode materials. As a result, the NiCoP nanosheet electrodes achieve high electrochemical activity and good stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

The formations of fillers in the NR matrix were investigated from the morphology during vulcanization, the Payne effect, and filler dispersion. Furthermore, the wetting ability was estimated based on temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR). It was found that the NR-CNT composite showed higher interfacial energy than the NR-CCB composite. This improved the arrangement of CNT in the CNT/CCB hybrid filled NR vulcanizates. Also, a significant increase was found in the optimal conductivity of the hybrid composites with 5 phr CNT and 7.5 phr CCB. This might be attributed to high electron tunneling when the CNT encapsulates are bridged by CCB aggregates. The CNT/CCB combination significantly reduced the inter-particle gaps from ∼6 to ∼2 nm, giving very low percolation threshold concentration at which three-dimensional filler networks form. In addition, statistical analysis by ANOVA revealed that the filler type and loading are the principal factors contributing to the relative conductivity of composites, both below and above the percolation threshold. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanotubes; Conductive carbon black; Natural rubber; Percolation threshold","Carbon black; Electron tunneling; Fillers; Nanotubes; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Rubber; Solvents; Stress relaxation; Yarn; Conductive carbon blacks; Electrical conductivity; Filler dispersion; Hybrid composites; Natural rubber composites; Percolation thresholds; Principal factors; Temperature scanning stress relaxations; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016821962

The aim of this study was to analyse the combined effects of osmotic dehydration (OD) and ohmic heating (OH) with a pulsed vacuum (PV) on polyphenol retention during the stored refrigeration of apple cubes. Treatments were performed using a 65°Brix sucrose solution at 30, 40 or 50 °C for 120 min, and then, samples were stored for 28 days at 5 °C. OH provides an electric field of 13 V cm−1, and a pulsed vacuum was applied for 5 min at the beginning of the process. The results indicated that a lower temperature process (30–40 °C) resulted in the retention of more polyphenol compounds after treatment than a higher temperature process (50 °C). Nevertheless, during refrigerated storage, we observed that 50 °C preserved these compounds better due to polyphenol oxidase inactivation. PVOD/OH treatment at 50 °C was determined to be the best retention of polyphenols from the fresh apple for dehydrating apples. © 2017 Institute of Food Science and Technology","Apples; ohmic heating; osmotic dehydration; polyphenols; storage; vacuum pulse","Dehydration; Electric fields; Energy storage; Fruits; Joule heating; Osmosis; Apples; Lower temperatures; Osmotic dehydration; Polyphenol content; Polyphenol oxidase; Polyphenols; Refrigerated storages; Vacuum pulse; Food storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016746562

Data from simultaneous high frequency monitoring of the lake-water temperature profile can be used as additional information for calculating these fluxes more accurately, if the large random fluctuations of such data could be overcome. This challenge can be achieved using an algorithm that filters out the natural noise of both the surface fluxes calculation (“model”) and the monitoring data (“measurement”), such as the Kalman Filter (KF). The KF uses statistics of the uncertainty in the dynamics of the heat balance model and the measurements, and improves the calculated heat storage estimate. The KF algorithm was applied for studying the energy balance at the surface of Lake Kinneret, Israel. We tested its operation using different algorithms, in light of seasonal variations associated with meteorological and lake temperature conditions. Typically, during the spring and summer the uncertainty of the heat storage data result in low Kalman Gain, K, whereas during calm lake conditions, in the autumn, the gain was high. Using only data already measured in “the past” and the current measurement, the KF is more suitable for cases where information regarding surface fluxes is required online than other filters (such as a moving average), which need data from “the future.” © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013052747

Fundamental studies revealed numerous synthesis routes which can adjust material characteristics as specific surface area, pore volume, pore size or morphology and elemental composition. The indirect synthesis or hard template method was developed first. An extensive collection of template materials exist, which can be impregnated with carbon precursors to provide various hard templated mesoporous carbons with a precise control of mesoporosity and pore geometry. However, the more recent direct method or soft template method offers some specific advantages. By using the organic-organic self-assembly between polymerizable precursors and block copolymer surfactants as structure directing agents it is possible to obtain tunable morphology and surface properties, mechanical stability and reduce the number of synthesis steps, thereby decreasing synthesis cost and complexity. Applied studies valorize this wide variety of mesoporous carbons. Fine-tuning material characteristics as surface area, pore volume, pore size, morphology, chemical composition or possible post-modification or nanoparticle doping give rise to applications in catalysis, electrochemistry, energy storage, separation or adsorption. In adsorption, mesoporous carbons are considered as a new family of adsorbents challenging the well-known activated carbon by introducing the advantage of increasing pore size. This allows mesoporous carbons to adsorb larger molecules and enhance the adsorption kinetics. In this review we present the most recent achievements and advances in the synthesis of soft templated mesoporous carbons, with focus on pore size control, and their potential as a new family of carbon adsorbents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Activated carbon; Adsorption; Block copolymers; Chemical modification; Mechanical stability; Morphology; Organic pollutants; Pore size; Self assembly; Tuning; Block copolymer surfactant; Chemical compositions; Elemental compositions; Material characteristics; Organic organic self assemblies; Soft template methods; Structure directing agents; Tunable morphologies; Mesoporous materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012964446

It was demonstrated that the threshold for space charge accumulation is about 20 kV/mm and the absence of deep traps in the titania-filler modified elastomer leads to fast space charge depletion.

As in all vertebrates, sperm is produced as the end product of the process of spermatogenesis, and regarding teleost the spermatozoa lack an acrosome in almost all species and motility is activated as a response to osmolarity and ion content of the aquatic medium where the sperm is released. In this context, mitochondria possess a fundamental role for fish spermatozoa motility and integrity, hence, fertilizing potential; they are the energy supplier that allows flagellar movement and their dysfunction could play a main role in structural and functional damage to the spermatozoa. The ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation provides not only energy for cell activities, which includes Na+/K+ ATPase pump, endocytosis, protein synthesis and many other cell processes; but also produces reactive oxygen species, that under mitochondrial dysfunction causes oxidative stress. The assessment of mitochondrial function (e.g. through measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential) as well as ATP content (mostly supplied by mitochondrial respiration) can be useful as quality markers of fish spermatozoa. Also quantification of ROS and antioxidant status, strongly influenced by mitochondria, are used as complementary measurements. There is much information about sperm mitochondria and their function but studies of these aspects on fish reproduction are still required for applications in aquaculture. The real role of fish sperm mitochondria under short and long term storage and in vitro manipulation is not fully understood yet.

The diagnosis of FHL is based on anamnestic, clinical, and clinicopathologic findings, associated with diagnostic imaging of the liver, and cytology, or histological examination of liver biopsies.

We applied the principle of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to plan trajectories that respect the aircraft’s limits, and react on disturbances and environmental changes in real-time. However, thanks to judicious problem formulations, our algorithm optimizes—in each time step—the whole horizon of the landing trajectory, and settles a dynamic compromise between the different touchdown requirements. Furthermore, the algorithm is powered by a novel method that utilizes slip maneuvers to achieve adequate energy control notwithstanding the absence of specialized drag control devices. Thus, precise touchdown point is attained even in the presence of strong wind shear and large initial errors. All design parameters are optimized off-line over a wide spectrum of conditions using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Monte-Carlo simulation of the optimized design shows excellent landing performance and high success rate on both flat and sloping terrains. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Autolanding; Emergency landing; Genetic algorithm; Nonlinear model predictive control; Slip maneuvers; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned air vehicles","Fixed wings; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Landing; Magnetic disk storage; Model predictive control; Monte Carlo methods; Motion planning; Nonlinear systems; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Auto-landing; Emergency landing; Nonlinear model predictive control; Slip maneuvers; Trajectory optimization; Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs); Aircraft control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446489

We find that all the tested DFT functionals yield equilibrium geometries in good agreement with higher level CCSD/cc-pVDZ calculations and that the basis set had little influence on the geometries of the photoswitch. We found a negligible difference in the thermal contribution to the Gibbs free energy between the tested functionals, indicating that the largest source of error when calculating storage free energies originates from errors in the calculated single point energies. It was found that ωB97X-D and M06-2X performed decently for predicting storage energies. While B3LYP-D3BJ and PBE0 generally underestimated the storage energy compared to CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 results. Therefore, we tested if domain based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) provided an improvement over density functional theory methods for the single point energies. We observed that the DLPNO-CCSD(T) storage energies were in better agreement with CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 results than the DFT results. The DLPNO-CCSD(T) results already converged at cc-pVTZ quality basis set, making it possible to perform accurate estimates of the thermochemical properties in a time frame that makes the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method feasible for routine calculations on the photoswitch.

Prior to this, the solar under floor heating system was designed via a parametric study conducted by means of dynamic simulations for the solar collectors area and inclination, the storage tank, the piping materials, the pumps mass flow rates, the temperature regulation and the thickness of the active slab. Moreover, two configurations with or without thermal storage were compared. The Hammam was monitored via air temperature and humidity measurements as well as IR thermography. Good agreement between simulation and experimental results was found with 94% of the discrepancies less than 1 °C. Numerical results show that the system without thermal storage allows the Hammam's operative temperature to reach the desired one. The latter ranges between 30 °C and 37 °C for sunny days in winter, while the system with thermal storage leads to at least 10 °C operative temperature lower compared to system without thermal storage. In addition, the thermal storage system allows having quasi-constant floor temperature that depends on the storage volume, as it avoids large day/night temperature fluctuations thanks to its thermal inertia. Nevertheless, the solar floor heating system configuration with storage tank does not achieve the desired floor surface temperature of the Hammam. Furthermore, it was stated that the best configuration, which leads to an operative temperature of around 35 °C inside the Hammam, is that with cross-linked polyethylene serpentine tubes (PEX) inserted in a concrete slab of 5 cm thickness, 4 m2 water solar collectors with 80 kg h−1 mass flow rate and temperature regulation difference of 5 °C. On the other hand, the studied solar floor heating system exhibits high to excellent energy performance depending on the use of the Hammam and auxiliary heating is almost not needed for a rational use. Furthermore, the economic feasibility of the solar floor heating system of the Hammam indicates that the annual heating energy consumption is reduced by at least 72%. Moreover, the annual energy savings are about 950 MAD (around 97 USD) and 690 MAD (around 70 USD) respectively compared to the electric and gas heating systems. The payback period of the solar system is then around 6 and 8 years respectively. Over the lifetime of the solar system, which is assumed to be 15 years, its cumulative reduction of the CO2 emissions is up to 10 tons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic simulation; Economic study; Energy savings; Hammam; Monitoring; Solar energy; Underfloor heating","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Concrete slabs; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Floors; Gas heating; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Mass transfer; Monitoring; Polyethylenes; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar system; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Temperature control; Crosslinked polyethylene; Economic study; Floor surface temperature; Hammam; Heating energy consumption; Numerical and experimental study; Temperature fluctuation; Underfloor heating; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014035177

This simulation-based study investigates how economic model predictive control (E-MPC) schemes for space heating operation can utilize the thermal mass in an existing multi-story apartment block and eight retrofit scenarios to provide DR. The performance of the E-MPC scheme was evaluated in terms of its ability to enable end-user cost savings, reduce CO2 emissions and to perform load shift of the heating demand compared to a conventional PI controller. Two E-MPC approaches were considered: centralized E-MPC where inter-zonal effects were considered and decentralized E-MPC that neglected heat transfer between adjacent apartments. The E-MPC schemes led to increasing cost savings (up to approx. 6%) and reduced CO2 emissions (up to approx. 3%) as a function of increasing energy efficiency of the retrofit scenarios. The absolute amount of shifted power from peak load periods was rather consistent (approx. 2 kWh/m2 heated net area) across all retrofit scenarios compared to the existing building.

This objective can be achieved by connecting energy storage systems (ESSs) to the network; the correct size and location of these ESSs cause enhancing of the system reliability. This paper proposes an efficient methodology based on the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to determine the optimal size and location of ESSs in a distribution network so as to minimize the total annual cost of system comprising the cost of energy not supplied (ENS), the ESSs' investment costs and operating costs. The proposed methodology is applied to two radial distribution systems, a 30-bus, 11-kV system and a 69-bus, 12.6-kV system. The results obtained via the proposed GWO are compared to those obtained via classical approaches, dynamic programming (DP), and meta-heuristic algorithms (PSO). In the case of a 30-bus network, the total cost is saved by 14.12% from the base case, network without ESSs; and, in the case of a 69-bus system, the cost is saved by 39.03%. Additionally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms are programmed and their results are compared with those obtained via the proposed GWO. The obtained locations and sizes of ESSs encourage the usage of the proposed methodology due to its ease and efficiency in solving the optimization problem under study. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","distribution network; energy storage system; ESS optimal allocation and sizing; Grey Wolf Optimizer","Costs; Data storage equipment; Dynamic programming; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Investments; Location; Operating costs; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reliability; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimal allocation; Optimization problems; Optimizers; Radial distribution systems; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016124998

In this study, in order to satisfy the main objective of Riam Jerawi Reservoir, where the energy of 6 MW should be provided every month, a linear optimization model is applied for three objective functions such as maximizing total energy, maximizing minimum energy and minimizing energy shortage. In addition, a simulation model is also presented for comparison purpose particularly to emphasize some disadvantages of using this model. The results show that the optimum energy can be achieved by applying this optimization model where the continuity of reservoir volume is also satisfied.

The concept of inertial coupling electromechanical system is an interesting topic from the control theory point of view and its universe of applications. This is because, for stabilisation proposes, the complete model of electromechanical system significantly reduces higher frequency functions in their dynamics caused by high gain controllers. Here, the system stabilisation is achieved by applying nonlinear time-varying controllers. The reason to use a time-varying controller is to give some learning or adaptation in the control process. Moreover, to get a good result for the closed-loop system, the structure of a storage function is based on the classical quadratic function in addition to quadratic function of system total energy. So, the main goal of this paper is obtain a controller that guarantees that the system state error arrives near the required equilibrium in exponential form. Hence, the Ultimate Uniform Bounded-Stability of the system trajectories of desired equilibrium is concluded.

In this growing market, solar thermal power plants offer a centralized, potentially load following electricity production. To serve this need, the integration of thermal energy storage systems is essential. The Moving Bed Heat Exchanger MBHX storage concept for CSP systems using sensible heat transfer medium aims at using a low cost solid storage media. This concept requires intermediate bulk cycles to transfer heat between the solar field and the storage material (the bulk). Heat Transfer Fluids (HTF) such as synthetic oils (mobiltherm 603) are typically used. In this work, granular materials such as sand and rocks are studied to present an additional HTF to represent an efficient and cost-effective alternative. Low cost solid particulates can store and transport heat at temperatures over 1000°C. For the purpose of heat recovery, a moving bed heat exchanger (MBHX) is applied and tested. In this study, the dense granular mass is gravity-driven through a heat exchanger. The performance of the MBHX with the utilization of Sand, Basalt, and a Mixture of Sand and Basalt as a granular material was experimentally investigated.

Especially in Hungary, where energy storage is yet an unsolved problem. The limited ability of wind forecast means that the delivered power of the wind farms cannot be predicted with sufficient accuracy. This work focuses on the improvement of wind power forecast precision by using different statistical methods. In the first part of the paper, simple BIAS correction approaches and more complex ensemble based methods are applied to improve the power prediction for the whole country. The second part of the work focuses on enhancement of the wind power forecast of a single wind farm. While mostly only wind speed is taken into consideration for the calculation of the generated power, it is shown that air density is also an important factor in the equations.

The work that underlies this research paper fall into the category of ""Green by IT"" aiming to reduce the environmental impact of operations using IT and by efficient resource usage management.

A modified Co film was obtained potentiostatically and was then potentiodynamically treated with KOH solution to form Co(OH)2. Co-Co(OH)2 coatings were obtained and were dominated by Co(OH)2 at the oxidized side, whereas Co dominant Co-Co(OH)2 occurred at the reduced side (-1.1 V). As OH- ions were able to diffuse into (out of) the film during oxidation (reduction) and did not react with the Cu current collector, the Co-Co(OH)2 electrode can be used as an anode material in energy storage devices. Although the specific capacitance of the electrodes varied depending on thickness, the redox reaction between the modified electrode and KOH electrolyte remained the same consisting of a surfacecontrolled and diffusion-controlled mechanism which had a desirable fast charge and discharge property. Capacity values remained constant after 250 cycles as the film evolved. Overall capacity retention was 84% for the film after 450 scans. A specific capacitance of 549 F g-1 was obtained for the Co-Co(OH)2 composite electrode in 6 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 73% of capacitance was retained when the scan rate was increased to 100 mV s-1. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Alkaline treatment; Anode material; Coating; Composite electrode; Copper current collector","Anodes; Capacitance; Coatings; Electric current collectors; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Potassium hydroxide; Redox reactions; Storage (materials); Alkaline treatment; Anode material; Capacity retention; Composite electrode; Current collector; Diffusion controlled mechanism; Modified electrodes; Specific capacitance; Cobalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018957134

An understanding of the processes controlling water and heat fluxes in green roofs under site-specific climatic conditions is needed to optimize their benefits. The hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics of substrates and vegetation layers are the primary controlling factors determining water and heat fluxes on green roofs. We characterized the physical, hydrodynamic, and thermal properties of five green roof substrates. We performed coupled heat and water transport numerical simulations to assess the impact of these properties on the hydraulic and thermal performance of a hypothetical roof system. The five substrates showed a large capacity to store and transport water, while their ability to conduct heat was similar to other green roof substrates. Under unsaturated conditions, water retention, storage capacity, and organic matter (OM) content of the substrates controlled the hydraulic and thermal response of each substrate. Our simulation results show that the substrate with the best capacity to store water and to reduce the heat flux through the substrate layer was composed of perlite and peat and had large OM content (30.7%) and saturated water content (0.757 cm3 cm−3). This substrate outperformed the others, probably due to its low thermal conductivity and its large pore space. The dynamic modeling presented in this study can represent the complexity of the processes that are occurring in green roof substrates, and thus it is a tool that can be used to design the configuration of a green roof. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Fluid dynamics; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Porous materials; Process control; Roofs; Thermal conductivity; Vegetation; Climatic conditions; Controlling factors; Green roof substrates; Low thermal conductivity; Thermal characteristics; Thermal Performance; Unsaturated condition; Water and heat fluxes; Substrates; building; heat flux; heat transfer; hydrodynamics; porous medium; roof; substrate; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018797598

Paraffin wax constitutes a popular PCM due to its chemical stability (as an alkane) and considerable latent heat; however, paraffin’s thermal performance (e.g. thermal conductivity) has posed consistently as a problem in its further realization as a PCM. To address this, an experimental study is conducted in order to determine the effect of adding Fe3O4nanoparticles on paraffin thermal performances. The metallic nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation method and added in 1-10 wt. % ratios to paraffin. Thermal behaviour in terms of melting and solidification temperatures/ enthalpies and specific heat capacities of solid and liquid paraffin composites was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, the activation energies of Fe3O4nanoparticle/PCM were estimated using Kissinger method. Results show a modification of the activation energy of solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions for the nanocomposites compared to pristine paraffin and a latent heat enhancement for the 5 wt.% Fe3O4loading, while the melting temperature range remained the same. The presented results make the Fe3O4nanoparticle a good candidate to be used for thermal behaviour improvement of thermal energy storage applications. © 2017, Inst Materials Physics.

Different forms of amaranth grains were added to spelt bread formulation: native amaranth flour and flour from popped amaranth, including their scalded and non-scalded variants. Native amaranth flour (both scalded and non-scalded) gave loaves with the highest volume and contributed to significantly softer crumb but not in comparison to the control bread. Crumb resilience did not show significant differences among the breads but there were differences in the crumb stress relaxation parameters which indicated certain influence on the crumb viscoelastic properties. During storage, all samples developed firmer and less elastic crumbs. Drying loss and staling degree significantly increased with increased storage time. The staling rate was the highest in the bread with non-scalded amaranth flours (native and flour from popped amaranth). The changes in the crumb textural and elastic properties caused by staling turned significant after six days of storage. In general, inclusion of different forms of amaranth flour did not alter the staling of breads and they exerted similar behaviour during storage. © 2017 The Author(s).","amaranth; Composite bread; spelt; staling; staling; storage; stress relaxation; texture","Energy storage; Food products; Grain (agricultural product); Stress relaxation; Textures; Viscoelasticity; amaranth; Elastic properties; Properties of composites; spelt; staling; Staling of bread; Stress relaxation parameter; Viscoelastic properties; Food storage; starch; analysis; bread; classification; flour; food grain; food handling; food preservation; food quality; nutritional value; procedures; wheat; Bread; Edible Grain; Flour; Food Handling; Food Preservation; Food Quality; Food Technology; Nutritive Value; Starch; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018339642

In this framework, active management of residential loads can play an important role to optimize the usage of end-use energy resources while minimizing energy cost. This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the integrated usage of multiple residential energy resources (local generation, shiftable loads, thermostatically controlled loads, and storage systems) considering a large set of management strategies. Customized solution encoding and operators are developed for different groups of loads. The multiobjective model considers as objective functions the minimization of the energy cost and the minimization of end-user's dissatisfaction associated with management strategies. Results have shown that significant savings can be achieved mainly through demand response actions implemented over thermostatically controlled loads. Savings are also dependent on the end-user's preferences and degree of willingness to accept automated control. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Demand response; energy management systems (EMSs); evolutionary algorithms (EAs); load management; smart grids","Costs; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Evolutionary algorithms; Housing; Smart power grids; Demand response; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Management strategies; Multi-objective modeling; Multiobjective management; Smart grid; Thermostatically controlled loads; Willingness to accept; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018182287

During its prolonged reproductive period (from February to December), ovigerous females are exposed to seasonal variation in environmental factors (e.g. temperature and food availability), with higher levels of these environmental parameters during summer and lower in winter, and must adjust their biochemistry to ensure their own survival and that of their embryos. The aim of this study was to analyse seasonal changes in the biochemical composition of ovigerous females and their eggs. The data show that the content of lipids, proteins and organic matter in the hepatopancreases of females was significantly higher in winter than in summer. Similarly, the lipid content of the eggs was significantly higher in winter than in summer, yet the protein content of the eggs had the opposite pattern with greater values found in summer. Consistent with the ‘reproductive energetic model’, the initial and final energy produced by the hepatopancreas showed significant seasonal variations, whereas female investment in egg production (in absolute values) did not show significant seasonal differences. The seasonal differences observed in the biochemistry, organic matter and energy content of the female hepatopancreases may be related to the storage of energy for growth and reproduction. Furthermore, the seasonal variation in the content of lipids, proteins and energy in eggs is likely related to embryogenesis and larval hatching in function with environmental conditions. Seasonal variation in the biochemical composition of P. monodon has direct effects on the marine food web and also upon fisheries. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","crustaceans; environmental conditions; fishery; Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem; lipid; protein; reproduction","biochemical composition; environmental conditions; fishery; lipid; lobster; marine ecosystem; protein; reproduction; seasonal variation; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast); Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Galatheidae; Monodon; Pleuroncodes monodon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017361740

Partitioned cache architecture is being used to ease the problem by providing an isolated execution environment for each thread. Although simple to implement and use, this method may be sub-optimal with respect to both energy consumption and performance since it prevents taking advantage of information shared across threads for both instructions and data. This work presents a new cache architecture termed SPACE (Semi-Partitioned CachE) that makes it possible to leverage information sharing, yielding in turn a tighter WCET. The SPACE architecture together with our new WCET algorithm can be used to maintain the predictability of the execution time of the parallel threads while reducing the overall energy consumption of the system. The new proposed cache architecture was implemented using Verilog and deployed on a Xilinx MicroBlaze multi-core design for testing, validation and measurements.

The severe energy crises in Pakistan during the last decade has decreased the interest in drying of farm produce which is resulting huge postharvest losses due to product spoilage and nonavailability of storage facilities. This study has been carried out for the performance evaluation of newly developed hybrid solar dryer for the drying of onion, ginger and cabbage under local climatic conditions. The hybrid solar dryer has a total cross-sectional area of 0.122 m2 out of which 34% is the collector while 64% is drying section. The dryer uses solar energy for drying during daytime while assisted with backup source during night for continuous product drying. The average initial moisture content of ginger, onion and cabbage batches was measured to be 88.45, 55.76 and 72.51%, respectively, while the final moisture content after drying was 10.27, 15.69 and 15.02%, respectively. The result also shows that the initial high moisture content of the products was removed in early hours of sunshine without any expense of primary energy cost. However, the remaining small amount of hygroscopic moisture was removed using backup energy source but with lower costs as compared with conventional drying. The final moisture content was achieved between 10 and 16 h for all batches of the onion, ginger and cabbage. On an average, greater than 70% moisture of the products was removed on the expense of solar energy. The overall average efficiency of the dryer was found to be 42.79%. Practical Applications: The agro-climatic conditions of Pakistan are ranging from tropical to temperate, thus, allowing to grow 40 different kind of vegetables and 21 type of fruits. Due to lack of processing facilities, the farmers have to sell their products at very low prices. Moreover, nearly 40–50% amount of perishable products are spoiled all over the world due to lack of farm gate processing facilities. In this research, the experiments have been conducted on onion, ginger and cabbage and successful results were obtained for all the products. In the conventional solar dryer, the major problem faced was to maintain the drying rate at uniform level but these types of dryer gave unsatisfactory results during the adverse weather conditions when the solar radiation are not in the limit to dry the products. Additionally, in winter, when the day time duration is comparatively shorter and solar dryer were not capable to dry the product in a single day. The objective of the hybrid solar dryer was to use the solar energy as a primary heat source during the favorable environmental conditions and the backup system is only taken into circuit when the solar system is not capable to maintain the desired drying rate. So, this type of dryer, not only maintain the drying rate but also vanishes the inversion rate of the perishables and hence ensures the quality of the dried products. So this hybrid feature built in the dryer is more attractive option for the farming community to dry their products without any harmful effects on the products. The hybrid solar dryer is demand base technology and will find a place in the manufacturing circle to transfer this technology to the end users, stakeholders and farming community for on-farm processing of variety of perishable products for value addition. Furthermore, using hybrid solar dryer does not cause any kind of environmental pollution. On the contrary, solar dryers can help the rural and farming community to improve their living standard by earning profit through drying their on-farm perishable and agro-products while, at the same time, protecting their environment. At the same time the use of solar dryers on a large scale could be beneficial to reduce carbon emissions and the associated global warming issues. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",,"Agriculture; Carbon; Costs; Dryers (equipment); Energy policy; Environmental impact; Food additives; Global warming; Moisture; Moisture determination; Solar dryers; Solar energy; Average efficiencies; Backup energy sources; Environmental conditions; Environmental pollutions; Final moisture content; High moisture contents; Initial Moisture Content; Processing facilities; Drying",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014622823

Three operating regions from the initial data analysis are under the combinator diagram noted to capture the shape of these regions by the proposed data analytics. The data analytics consists of implementing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to classify the most frequent operating regions of the main engine. Furthermore, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm calculates the parameters of GMMs. This approach, also named data clustering algorithm, facilitates an iterative process for capturing the operating regions of the main engine (i.e., in the combinatory diagram) with the respective mean and covariance matrices. Hence, these data analytics can monitor ship performance and navigation conditions with respect to engine operating regions as a part of the SEEMP.

When these plants were decommissioned and dismantled, the filters which mostly contained solid uranium fluoride and uranium oxyfluoride compounds and compressor ring dust, were broken into pieces, put into metal drums, and stored. This waste contains enriched uranium and can't be disposed of at the current disposal site (Vaalputs), which only accepts low and intermediate level waste. Initial attempts, directly after removal from the enrichment plants, to decontaminate these filters using various aqueous solutions, were unsuccessful probably because of the known non-wettability of PTFE surfaces. However, recent attempts to leach the absorbed enriched uranium were successful. This resulted in a study to determine the effect of mainly α-irradiation from the enriched uranium on the morphology of PTFE. A Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP), a general purpose radiation transport code modelling the interaction of radiation with materials that simulate nuclear processes, was used to determine the rate of PTFE radiolysis. The results confirmed that the dose rate received from mainly the α-particles (97%) during the storage period had caused significant structural damage to the PTFE depending on the enrichment grade and the amount of uranium on the filters. To confirm the modelling data, analytical techniques, including micro X-ray tomography, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction were used to study the morphology changes in the PTFE structure of the research samples. Experimental results indicated that the crystallinity increased while the molecular weight of the PTFE decreased. This could be attributed to the radiation induced degradation of the PTFE by the absorbed enriched uranium. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation; Dose rate; Enriched uranium; MCNP; Polytetrafluoroethylene; α-irradiation","Degradation; Digital storage; Gas plants; Irradiation; Leaching; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Radiation; Radiation chemistry; Radioactive waste disposal; Solutions; Thermogravimetric analysis; Uranium; Uranium compounds; Waste disposal; X ray diffraction; Dose rate; Enriched uranium; Intermediate level wastes; MCNP; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Radiation transport codes; Radiation-induced degradation; Uranium enrichment plants; Radioactive wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008147249

In this research, we study the path planning problem for these DCs while optimizing their counts and their total traveled distances. As the total collected load on a given DC route cannot exceed its storage capacity, it is important to decide on the size of the exchanged data-packets (images, videos, etc.) and the sequence of the targeted data sources to be visited. We propose a hybrid heuristic approach for public data delivery in smart-city settings. In this approach, public vehicles are utilized as DCs that read/collect data from numerously distributed Access Points (APs) and relay it back to a central processing base-station in the city. We also introduce a cost-based fitness function for DCs election in the smart-city paradigm.

BCAT2 and BCKDH expression and activity are modified during adipogenesis and altered in adipose tissues of mice with genetic or diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about how these modifications and alterations affect the intracellular metabolic fate of BCAAs during adipogenesis, in adipocytes from mice fed a control or high-fat diet or in C2C12 myotubes. Here, we demonstrate that BCAAs are mainly incorporated into proteins during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation. However, they are oxidized and incorporated into lipids during the late days of differentiation. Conversely, 92% and 97% of BCAA were oxidized, 1.6% and 6% were used for protein synthesis and 1.2% and 1.5% were incorporated into lipids in adipocytes from epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively. All three pathways were decreased in adipocytes from mice fed a high-fat diet. In C2C12 myotubes, leucine is mainly used for protein synthesis and palmitate is incorporated into lipids. Interestingly, leucine decreased both palmitate oxidation and its incorporation to lipids and proteins; and palmitate increased leucine oxidation and decreased its incorporation to lipids and proteins in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that BCAA metabolic fate differs between the early and late stages of adipocyte differentiation and in adipocytes from mice fed a control or high-fat diet; and that leucine affects the metabolic fate of palmitate and vice versa in C2C12 myotubes.

It suffers, however, from the low resistance difference between the bistable states of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). Variability on MTJ resistance and access transistors makes reliable read-out even more challenging. This triggered the use of complementary cells for low level caches needing high performance. This paper, focusing on the lower level caches, shows an improved 3T 2MTJ cell with a ground grid and a novel three transistor read and write operation to improve area density, sense margin, write performance, and write energy consumption. Despite the cell's three transistors, the improved array configuration reduces the cell area by 22% as compared with the 2T 2MTJ cell, making it only 55% larger than a 1T 1MTJ cell. The novel mismatch tolerant read operation uses all three transistors and increases the sense margin by up to 88%. The novel variation resilient write operation also uses all three transistors and takes advantage of the inherent MTJ characteristics and complementary operation of the cell. This increases the write performance by 2times and reduces the write energy by 3times compared with the 2T 2MTJ cell and by 1.5times compared with the 1T 1MTJ cell. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Cache memory; circuit stability; fin field effect transistor (finFET); magnetic memory; nonvolatile memory","Cache memory; Cytology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Field effect transistors; Magnetic devices; Magnetic recording; MRAM devices; Random access storage; Static random access storage; Transistors; Tunnel junctions; Array configurations; Energy efficient; Fin field effect transistors; Magnetic tunnel junction; Magnetoresistance random access memory; Spin transfer torque; Static random access memory; Write operations; Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003583675

However, even in buildings with the same level of yearly generation and consumption the mismatch between the demand and photovoltaic generation profiles leads to large power flows between the household and the grid. Such situation creates problems to the electrical grid management and can be a source of economic losses to the end-user. This paper presents an energy storage system designed in the context of residential buildings with photovoltaic generation. The objective of such system is to increase the matching between the local generation and consumption, as well as to decease the energy bill, using lithium-ion batteries as a storage device. Such system was modelled and simulated using real data of solar radiation and energy consumption from a typical residential household in Coimbra (Portugal). The results show that the designed system was able to reduce the energy sent to and consumed from the grid in 76% and in 78.3%, respectively, as well as the energy bill in 87.2%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery management system; Energy storage; Photovoltaic energy; Residential buildings; Zero-energy buildings","Battery management systems; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Housing; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Losses; Solar power generation; Virtual storage; Electrical grids; Energy storage systems; Energy targets; Photovoltaic energy; Photovoltaic generation; Residential building; Solar photovoltaic generations; Zero energy building (ZEB); Buildings; building; demand analysis; economic activity; energy use; equipment component; photovoltaic system; power generation; residential location; solar power; solar radiation; Coimbra [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998812278

Soil temperature data are critical for different research interests such as ecology, biology, technique processes, forestry, agriculture, energy, food sector, ground heat exchanger applications, thermal energy storage applications, and so forth. This investigation gives information related to the prediction of soil temperature's dependence with depth and time especially for shallow geothermal applications. Soil temperature values depend on a great deal of varied parameters such as thermal conductivity, short term climatic conditions and moisture content. The main issue is that despite these temperatures are extremely important values, they can not be obtained in a short time. Due to this reason, we study a mathematical model related to the prediction of soil temperature. Within this context, 81 cities and their approximately 300.000 data, both, monthly air and soil temperatures between 1960 and 2015 were studied and finally seven regions in Turkey were investigated and final average soil temperature values were achieved. Measured data taken from the Izmir State Meteorological Station, and predicted soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm were analyzed for each region in Turkey according to data obtained fifty years ago. Finally, at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm and 100 cm, the maximum average percentage errors in Turkey were 16%, 14.8%, 13.5%, 14.4%, 13.9% respectively. In conclusion, we evaluate the relationship between ambient air temperatures and soil temperatures in terms of depths from 5 to 3000 cm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Geothermal energy; Renewable energy; Shallow depth geothermal resources; Soil temperature; Temperature variations","Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Food storage; Forecasting; Forestry; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Heat storage; Soils; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Ambient air temperature; Geothermal applications; Geothermal resources; Ground heat exchangers; Meteorological station; Renewable energies; Soil temperature; Temperature variation; Thermal processing (foods)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997719866

In this paper, a new method for optimally sizing of HESS based on a statistical approach is proposed. This approach aims to exploit the capacity distribution of hybrid supercapacitor-battery system in an autonomous PV/Wind power generation system. This hybridization, of both slow and fast dynamics, aims to eliminate the power peaks caused by the load consumption. For the power distribution for all coordinated components of the storage system, a frequency management control and a hysteresis strategy are used in order to accomplish two goals: firstly, to delimit this exchanged power for not exceeding the maximum value and, secondly, to keep the States Of Charge (SOC) of the batteries-supercapacitors in a suitable range. Moreover, statistical analysis of several cumulative levels was performed to examine their contribution on the HESS optimal sizing. The obtained results prove that the integration of supercapacitor takes advantage of the complementary characteristics of the batteries, improves the exchanged power flow, extends the battery life cycle and affects on storage system sizing through accommodate the fast power fluctuations. © 2016","Capacity distributions; Frequency management; Hybrid energy storage system (HESS); Optimal sizing; Probability distributions","Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Life cycle; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Capacity distribution; Complementary characteristics; Frequency management; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Optimal sizing; Power generation systems; Probability distributions; distribution system; energy planning; hysteresis; life cycle analysis; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; storage structure; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996644247

Their enthalpy and heat capacity were measured in a quasistatic regime by adiabatic scanning calorimetry and show, within a certain temperature range, a single distinct jump and peak, respectively. We present a microscopic development from which the jumps and peaks can be accurately fitted and that could be analogously applied even to other PCMs. In addition, we determine the baseline and excess part of the heat capacity and thus the latent heat associated with the phase change. The development is based on the observation that PCMs often have polycrystalline structure, being composed of many single-crystalline grains. The enthalpy and heat capacity measured in experiments are therefore interpreted as superpositions of many contributions that come from the individual grains. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Averaging; Enthalpy jump; Heat capacity peak; Phase change","Enthalpy; Heat storage; Specific heat; Thermal energy; Adiabatic scanning calorimetry; Averaging; Individual grains; Phase Change; Polycrystalline structure; Quasi-static regime; Single-crystalline; Temperature range; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995704432

Data from the study would be used by the Philippine Department of Energy to formulate and implement alternative fuel programs for public transport. On-road fuel consumption, load factor, and GPS speed data from selected in-use LPG and diesel jeepneys plying a chosen urban route were gathered to develop corresponding drive cycles for chassis dynamometer testing at 100% load factor were conducted to estimate an upper limit for fuel consumption. Measured on-road diesel jeepney mileage was about 6.7 km/liter at 63.5% load factor while that for LPG jeepney was 3.8-4.2 km/liter at 59.8% load factor. Drive cycle tests yielded 5.2 km/liter for diesel and 2.6-3.1 km/liter for LPG. Constant-speed (20-40-60 km/hr) tests at 100% load factor gave a range of 11.5-8.1 km/liter for diesel and 3.0-1.8 km/liter for LPG. The lower LPG jeepney mileage is attributed to LPG's lesser heating value per liter than diesel, possible non-optimal vehicle and powertrain configuration and tuning, and differences in drive cycles.

Moreover, additional customer benefits have to be generated in order to increase customer acceptance of zero-emission technologies. Actually high costs, reduced driving ranges and lack of infrastructures are some aggregative facts for end-customer acceptance thus also for a broad market launch. Plug-in hybrids as intermediate step towards zero-emission vehicles are meanwhile in series production with partly ""zero-emission"" operation mode and are well accepted by customers. The project partners HyCentA Research GmbH, Magna Steyr Engineering AG &amp; Co KG, Proton Motor Fuel Cell GmbH and the Vienna University of Technology, Institute for Powertrains and Automotive Technology, have developed a hydrogen-powered zero-emission vehicle within a national funded research project. The combustion engine of an existing range extender shuttle van was substituted by a 25 kW proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell system. In addition, the battery capacity was reduced due to weight, size and costs reasons. Approaches for the complete vehicle integration of the fuel cell range extender and the 70 MPa hydrogen storage system are presented. The high voltage architecture was newly developed and the thermal management has been re-designed. A two circuit coolant system fulfills the wide range of component demands with the possibility of fuel cell waste heat usage for cabin heating. Influences of the operation strategy on the energy and cost efficiency of the vehicle are shown and the optimization potentials will be outlined. The adaptive energy management algorithm and its influence on the fuel efficiency and driving range will be presented. Overall, the vehicle setup combines the advantages of the battery and the fuel cell technology to compensate shortcomings like refueling duration, driving range and dynamic operation. © 2017 SAE International.",,"Air pollution; Automotive fuels; Cell engineering; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen storage; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sales; Secondary batteries; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Automotive technology; Energy management algorithms; Fuel cell technologies; Hydrogen storage system; Optimization potential; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems; University of technologies; Zero emission vehicles; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018411079

Because of advantages over other geometries, these structures are interesting for biomedical applications, such as magnetic hyperthermia cancer therapy, where the heat released during magnetic reversal is used to destroy tumors. For example, the tubular geometry provides two independent functional surfaces that may be selectively manipulated and also gives a storage cavity. Owing to their large surface to weight ratio and low mass density, MNTs are not decanted by gravity. We calculated magnetic phase diagrams, energy barriers, nucleation fields, and the amount of dissipated heat and specific absorption rate for magnetite nanotubes.

PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental) analysis of the CCS alternatives (Fossil based, Improved process, Renewable based) is investigated in detail and the alternatives are also compared with the uncontrolled CO2 release using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods. Life cycle inventory data is set up and analysed with four life cycle impact assessment methods. In order to conclude the comparison of CCS and the uncontrolled release of CO2 a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is also applied with Multi Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) method. Our results show that applying process improvement and renewable energy sources (e.g., biogas) for absorbent regeneration result in a CCS technology of much smaller environmental and social impacts, and therefore the CCS technology becomes more favorable than the uncontrolled release. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; Impact evaluation; Life Cycle Assessment; Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis; PESTLE","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Decision theory; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Impact evaluation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle inventory datum; Multi-attribute value theories; Multi-criteria decision analysis; PESTLE; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013757885

One promising field is the application of thermochemical redox systems in combination with concentrated solar power (CSP). There, reactions of metal oxides are in the focus of research, because they allow for an increase in the process temperature. The reaction system CuO/Cu2O has been reported as a suitable candidate for TCES. For proper development and modeling of combined CSP-TCES processes, reliable kinetic data are necessary. This work studies the reduction of CuO and the oxidation of Cu2O under isothermal and isokinetic conditions. The reactions are analyzed using a simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor. The reaction behavior shows significant differences between both analyses. To develop kinetic models, the non-parametric kinetic (NPK) approach is used. This model-free approach is expanded by the Arrhenius correlation to increase the applicable temperature range of the models. The resulting models are evaluated and compared. Furthermore, the cycle stability of the system over 20 cycles is assessed for a small sample mass in the STA and a large sample mass in the fixed-bed reactor. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical reactors; Copper oxides; Digital storage; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Redox reactions; Solar energy; System stability; Thermoanalysis; Arrhenius correlation; Concentrated solar power; Energy utilization efficiency; Focus of researches; Kinetic investigations; Non-parametric kinetic; Simultaneous thermal analysis; Thermochemical energy storage; Kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017635943

Hence, this approach can potentially be used to circumvent recrystallization issues that other amorphous formulation approaches are facing during storage. In this study, the feasibility of microwave irradiation to prepare amorphous solid dispersions (glass solutions) in situ was investigated. Indomethacin (IND) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K12 (PVP) were tableted at a 1:2 (w/w) ratio. In order to study the influence of moisture content and energy input on the degree of amorphization, tablet formulations were stored at different relative humidity (32, 43 and 54% RH) and subsequently microwaved using nine different power-time combinations up to a maximum energy input of 90 kJ. XRPD results showed that up to 80% (w/w) of IND could be amorphized within the tablet. mDSC measurements revealed that with increasing microwaving power and time, the fractions of crystalline IND and amorphous PVP reduced, whereas the amount of in situ formed IND-PVP glass solution increased. Intrinsic dissolution showed that the dissolution rate of the microwaved solid dispersion was similar to that of a quench cooled, fully amorphous glass solution even though the microwaved samples contained residual crystalline IND. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amorphization; Glass solution; In situ; Microwave radiation; Recrystallization; Tablet","glass; indometacin; povidone; drug carrier; glass; indometacin; poly(N-vinylpyrrolidine); polyvinyl derivative; pyrrolidine derivative; solution and solubility; tablet; amorphization; Article; chemical reaction; crystallization; dispersion; dissolution; energy; heat transfer; humidity; microwave irradiation; moisture; priority journal; tablet formulation; time; chemistry; drug stability; medicinal chemistry; microwave radiation; procedures; solubility; solution and solubility; tablet; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Crystallization; Drug Carriers; Drug Stability; Glass; Humidity; Indomethacin; Microwaves; Pharmaceutical Solutions; Polyvinyls; Pyrrolidines; Solubility; Tablets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010695842

S. Krøyer the contents of the tube colours found in Krøyer's painting cabinet were examined. In most cases, the results of the pigment analyses were as expected based on our knowledge of artists' colours used in the late 1800s and early 1900s. However, in one of the tube colours labelled “Jaune de Cadmium Citron” (cadmium lemon yellow) an extremely rare cadmium chromate pigment was found. The pigment was analysed and characterised by Raman microscopy (MRS), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), single-crystal X-ray crystallography, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Cadmium chromate was synthesised by precipitation from an aqueous solution of cadmium nitrate and potassium chromate, and the resulting yellow crystals proved identical to the pigment found in the tube colour “Jaune de Cadmium Citron”. The structure determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction identified the pigment as 2CdCrO4·KOH·H2O or more accurately as KCd2(CrO4)2(H3O2) illustrating the μ-H3O2– species. The yellow colour of the paint sample taken from the tube had a greenish hue, which became even more prominent upon storage and drying.

Changes in temperature and relative humidity of the air during drying were recorded. The color, peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free fatty acid (FFA) content, fatty acid composition, and sensory attributes of dried samples were also evaluated once a month for 5 months of storage. High drying rates were obtained in all samples at the start of drying and then decreased with increasing drying time. The highest drying rate and effective water diffusivity (Deff) were observed in blanched sardine during open sun drying. Blanching treatment slowed down the FFA progression during product storage but adversely affected the color, PV, and TBARS content as well as sensory properties. Although sardine dried for a longer time under indoor drying conditions, it attained a stable moisture ratio that was lower than in open sun-dried samples. Indoor drying produced a quality stable product with less lipid oxidation and the desired moisture content, higher polyunsaturated fatty acids and sensory properties. Blanching treatment negatively affected the fish quality and is therefore not recommended for commercial sardine drying. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Blanching; drying; quality; sardine; storage","Blanching; Diffusion in liquids; Energy storage; Fatty acids; Image quality; Moisture; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Solar dryers; Drying characteristics; Fatty acid composition; sardine; Sensory attributes; Sensory properties; Temperature and relative humidity; Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; Water diffusivity; Drying; Drying; Quality; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013356539

Solar energy is one of the most favourable alternative resources in terms of cleanness, safety and the economic and environmental aspects. However, the intermittent nature of solar energy and the lack of high solar radiation intensities in various climates favour the use of various energy storage techniques to eliminate the discrepancy between energy supply and demand. The current work presents an analysis and evaluation of the performance of an underground soil-based thermal energy storage system for solar energy storage, coupled with a combined heat and power generation system. A combined PV-Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system is utilized to fulfil heating and electricity needs of a housing project in Odense, Denmark, in addition to charging the soil storage medium in summer months when excess electric power is generated. The stored heat is discharged in December and January to provide the space heating and domestic hot water demands of the residential project without the utilization of an external heating source. Employing a PV system of 30 kW capacity, it was found that a storage medium of 900 m3 of soil is capable of providing the heating needs for a housing project of 1000 m2 internal floor area. The year round transient behaviour of the thermal energy storage medium is reported in addition to the heat losses and the surrounding soil temperature variation throughout the year. It was found that the overall system heating coefficient of performance is around 4.76, where the reported energetic efficiency is 5.88% for the standalone PV system, 19.1% for the combined PV-ASHP system, and 22.2% for the combined PV-ASHP system employing a seasonal underground thermal energy storage block. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air-source heat pump; PV system; Seasonal storage; Soil; Solar energy; Underground thermal energy storage","Cogeneration plants; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Pumps; Soils; Solar energy; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Analysis and evaluation; Combined heat and power generation; Environmental aspects; PV system; Seasonal storage; Solar radiation intensity; Stand-alone PV systems; Thermal energy storage systems; Air source heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003875031

Scenarios with varying food density may help to understand how corals deal with seasonal variations in the dark ocean and might be used to study consequences of anthropogenic activities potentially affecting food availability. Thus, the physiological responses of L. pertusa to varying food (Artemia salina nauplii) concentration, ranging from 20% to 300% of carbon equivalent turned over by basal coral respiration, were investigated. A starvation group was also included. Measurements of respiration, growth, mucus production, and energy reserves (storage fatty acids) were performed at several time intervals over 26 weeks. In general, data showed a stronger effect of experimental time on measured responses, but no significant influence of food density treatment. In starved corals, respiration rate declined to 52% of initial respiration, while skeleton growth rate was maintained at the same rate as Artemia-fed corals throughout the investigation. Mucus production measured as the sum of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) was also similar across food treatments, but POC production exceeded that of DOC at the highest food density. No marked effect was observed on storage fatty acids. These results confirm that L. pertusa is highly resilient to environmental conditions with suboptimal food densities over a time scale of months. Regulation of several physiological processes, including respiration and mucus production, possibly in combination with an opportunistic feeding strategy, contributed to this tolerance to maintain viable corals. Thus, it appears that L. pertusa is well adapted to life in the deep sea. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"carbon; dissolved organic carbon; fatty acid; organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; polycarbonate; surface water; unclassified drug; Artemia salina; Article; bone growth; breathing rate; catering service; concentration process; coral; deep sea; food availability; food web; lipid storage; Lophelia pertusa; mucus; nonhuman; particulate matter; physiological process; priority journal; seasonal variation; starvation; animal; Anthozoa; Artemia; breathing; food chain; food deprivation; lipid metabolism; metabolism; Norway; physiology; population density; secretion (process); zooplankton; Animals; Anthozoa; Artemia; Food Chain; Food Deprivation; Lipid Metabolism; Mucus; Norway; Population Density; Respiration; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020202072

The power levels of sources in these systems need to be determined wisely by an energy management strategy (EMS). This paper presents an EMS for a battery/ultracapacitor (UC) HESS including a bidirectional MIC for electric vehicles (EVs). Thanks to the fact that energy flow between battery and UC is free in this MIC, the proposed EMS not only regulates the state-of-charge of UC but also smooths the battery power profile by using a fuzzy logic controller and a rate limiter. Therefore, it results in a sustainable HESS with longer battery life. Through a simulation study and an experimental setup including a real EV, the performance of the proposed system is evaluated comprehensively.

Then, we model the joint investment and operation as a two-period stochastic programming program. In period-1, the microgrid operator makes the optimal investment decisions on the capacities of solar power generation, wind power generation, and energy storage. In period-2, the operator coordinates the power supply and demand in the microgrid to minimize the operating cost. We design a decentralized algorithm for computing the optimal pricing and power consumption in period-2 based on which we solve the optimal investment problem in period-1. We also study the impact of prediction error of renewable energy generation on the portfolio investment using robust optimization framework.

In addition to potential and chemical energy in the wastewater, thermal energy can also be recovered. Heat can be recovered from the wastewater with heat exchangers that are located decentralized and/or centralized at several locations throughout the system. It can be recovered directly at the source (e.g. in the showers and bathrooms), at building block level (e.g. warm water tanks collecting all grey water), in sewers or at the wastewater treatment plant. However, an uncoordinated installation of systems on such different levels can lead to competing technologies. To investigate these interactions, a modelling environment is set up, tested and calibrated based on continuous sewer temperature and flow measurements. With that approach different heat recovery scenarios on a household level (decentralized) and of in-sewer heat recovery (centralized) are investigated.

However, to ensure high reversibility, only two-thirds of the iodide capacity is accessed and one-third of the iodide ions act as a complexing agent to stabilize the iodine (I2), forming I3- (I2I-). Here, we exploit bromide ions (Br-) as a complexing agent to stabilize the iodine, forming iodine-bromide ions (I2Br-), which frees up iodide ions and increases the capacity. Applying this strategy, we demonstrate a novel zinc/iodine-bromide battery to achieve an energy density of 101 W h Lposolyte+negolyte-1 (or 202 W h Lposolyte-1), which is the highest energy density achieved for aqueous flow batteries to date.

Thus, the access needs of health professionals to different health information necessitate continuity of care, hence an architecture based on the concept of the cloud proves necessary. Considering the increasing demands placed on healthcare providers for infrastructure, systems and support, cloud computing will be the appropriate solution to meet the needs for care coordination, collaboration and communication between the different actors in the field Of health. Cloud Computing represents an evolution of information systems. Cloud computing brings a new approach to computing, a different way of using computer resources. This development has given existence to several providers offering multiple services. Then, Cloud end users are faced with the choice of the appropriate provider in terms of supported technologies, security and access rules. So, the sector aims to create a solution that works for all types of medical facilities, be it hospitals, health centers, clinics, private health care providers. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the use of a cloud broker in an inter-cloud environment in order to allow the technological renewal of our infrastructure while reducing the time of access to the services requested by the users, the dissipation of the energy And the number of physical servers installed.

The material was examined in a LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte, and in a 1.5-3.5 V versus Li+/Li electrochemical window [1]. The charge storage of 2D α-MoO3 electrodes was negligible and this was attributed to electrical limitations imposed by the semiconducting nature of 2D α-MoO3. Electrical conductivity studies of 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT electrodes, where a fraction of SWCNTs was progressively added, led to finding the SWCNT fraction for which an electrical percolation threshold was reached, i.e. a sharp increase of electrical conductivity. This SWCNT fraction also led to a sharp increase in capacitance confirming the electrical limitation of charge storage. In this work, we examined in detail the energy storage properties of 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT (85 wt%/15 wt%) electrodes. A detailed study of ion-intercalation events, as examined by cyclic voltammetry, is presented. We investigated the contributions to the overall energy storage of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes and how the performance compares against other nanostructured materials including mesoporous α-MoO3 and α-MoO3 nanobelts. Our main findings showed that 2D α-MoO3/SWCNT (85 wt%/15 wt%) electrodes offer scope for supercapacitors and battery applications in terms of total charge storage (200 F g-1 and 195.2 mAh g-1), which is in the range or superior to that of other nanostructured metal oxides and commercial LiCoO2 cathodes.

This paper proposes novel strategies for mitigating the effects of wind intermittency by developing hybrid off-shore wind and marine current turbines. Unlike the random nature of wind, marine currents have slow cyclic variations and are highly predictable. The proposed methods involve optimal sizing strategy for the hybrid system and rely on the resource predictions. Prediction Intervals for wind speed forecasts using Bootstrapped Artificial Neural Networks have been developed and validated. Marine current speeds have been mathematically modeled using the Harmonic Analysis Method. Subsequently, novel power fluctuation mitigation and generation scheduling strategies using minimum energy storage have been designed based on the UK electricity market regulations and the predicted wind and current speeds. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods which ensure successful mitigation of power fluctuations, reliable dispatch scheduling of renewable generation, and significant cost saving potential. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Generation scheduling; marine current energy; power fluctuation mitigation; prediction algorithms; wind energy systems","Banks (bodies of water); Commerce; Electric energy storage; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Neural networks; Turbines; Wind; Wind power; Cost saving potentials; Electricity generation; Generation scheduling; Harmonic analysis method; Marine current turbines; Power fluctuations; Prediction algorithms; Wind energy systems; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013895181

However few experimental and numerical analyses have been published so far to better support the understanding of the recovery capabilities for different forms of titanium beds. In this work, an investigation on the recovery of different hydrogen isotopes from two types of titanium (Ti) beds, namely Ti powder and Ti sponge, has been performed. Hydrogen isotope release was experimentally verified up to a temperature of 600 °C for both Ti powder and Ti sponge beds. The desorption percentages were determined to be from 24.98 to 20.54 in the case of D2 on Ti sponge, and from 34.36 to 29.77 in the case of H2 on Ti sponge.

While the community continues to research ways of mitigating side reactions and improving stability to realize Li-O2 battery prospects, we show that limiting the depth-of-discharge while unbalancing discharge/charge rate symmetry can extend Li-O2 battery cycle life by ensuring efficient reversible Li2O2 formation, markedly improving cell efficiency. Systematic variation of the discharge/charge currents shows that clogging from discharging the Li-O2 cell at high current (250 μA) can be somewhat negated by recharging with a lower applied current (50 μA), with a marked improvement in cycle life achievable. Our measurements determined that specific reduction of the depth of discharge in decrements from equivalent capacities of 1000 mAhg−1 to 50 mAhg−1 under symmetric discharge/charge currents of 50 μA strongly affect the cumulative discharge capacity of each cell. A maximum cumulative discharge capacity occurs at ∼10 % depth of discharge (500 mAhg−1) and the cumulative discharge capacity of 39,500 mAhg−1 is significantly greater than that of cells operated at higher and lower depths of discharge.

At optimal compression, the physical adsorption energies of H2, N2, NO, and CO are increased by 6–9 times, and that for O2 is more than 2 times. We show that the energy for their chemical adsorption on waved graphene decreases dramatically with the increment of compression. The energy of dissociation of H2 on flat graphene is 1.63 eV and reduced to 0.06 eV (96% reduction) on waved graphene at a compression of 50%, respectively. The energy for chemical adsorption of O2 on waved graphenes is extremely reduced from 0.98 eV to −0.57 eV as with compression increasing from 0 to 50%, indicating the transition of endothermic chemical adsorption to exothermic.

During the first two years of operation, measurement data indicated that the difference between heating and cooling load could affect the long term thermal stability of the ground storage and thus may result in poor energy efficiency of the GSHP system. This paper describes two low-cost measures that can be taken in order to reduce or prevent such unfavourable conditions. The school building and HVAC system were modeled and on-site measurement data was used for validation. First, the HVAC system was optimized by integrating an additional cooling coil in the exhaust airflow of the air handling unit in order to recuperate waste heat from the exhaust ventilation air. Additionally, the effect of passive cooling during summer holidays on the annual energy balance was investigated. Results indicated that heat recuperation of the exhaust ventilation air and passive cooling of the school building during weekends and summer holidays are complementary and contribute to a more stable ground temperature, consequently significant energy savings can be achieved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Borehole heat exchanger; Control; Geothermal; Hybrid ground-source heat pump system; Modeling; School; Thermal energy storage","Air conditioning; Climate control; Control; Cooling; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Geothermal energy; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Models; Pumps; School buildings; Temperature; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic stability; Ventilation exhausts; Waste heat; Air handling units; Borehole heat exchangers; Exhaust ventilation; Geothermal; Heating and cooling loads; Low temperature heating; On-site measurement; School; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008388742

The U.S. Residential Energy Splits data for year 2015 from ‘Buildings Energy Data Book’ has been used for modelling of residential buildings. Distribution system models have been made for both AC and DC powers. The system efficiency values have been tested for different cases. The AC system was found to be superior to DC with a minimum efficiency advantage of around 2% and a maximum of around 6%. Subsequently, the building air-conditioning loads were assumed to incorporate the modern concept of Variable Speed Drives (VSD) which use an intermediate DC power stage. If the building power supply is DC rather than AC, then the intermediate AC/DC conversion stage may be avoided. Taking the air-conditioning as a DC load roughly doubles the DC power demand of building. The DC system showed slightly (around 1%) higher efficiency for the VSD air-conditioning case. Back in history, it was apparently the efficiency of power transfer that allowed AC to oust DC, and now, once again efficiency may be a decisive factor for the reignited competition between AC and DC. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","AC distribution; DC distribution; Efficiency; Residential load modelling; Variable speed drives","Air conditioning; Buildings; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric impedance measurement; Electric towers; Energy transfer; Housing; Rectifying circuits; Variable speed drives; Ac distributions; Air conditioning load; Comparative efficiencies; Dc distribution; Distribution power systems; Distribution system models; Residential building; Residential loads; Electric load management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008334954

The MMU consists of three Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) in two levels of hierarchy. The MMU and its respective integration to the processor is prototyped on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Furthermore, analytical results of scaling the second-level Unified TLB (UTLB) to three configurations (with 16, 32, and 64 entries) with respect to the effect on overall hit rate as well as the energy consumption are shown. The critical path analysis of the logical design running on the target FPGA is presented together with a description of optimization techniques to improve static timing performance which leads to gain 22.75% speed-up. We could reach to our target operating frequency of 200 MHz for the 64-entry UTLB and, thus, it is our preferred option. The 32-entry UTLB configuration provides a decent trade-off for resource-constrained or speed-critical hardware designs while the 16-entry configuration poses unsatisfactory performance. Next, integration challenges and how to resolve each of them (such as employing a wrapper around the MMU, modifying the hardware description of the COFFEE core, etc.) are investigated in detail. This paper not only provides invaluable information with regard to the implementation and integration phases of the MMU to a RISC processor, it opens a new horizon to our processor to provide virtual memory for its running operating system without degrading the operating frequency.

The chemical structures of the polymeric S-SPCMs were confirmed by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis techniques. The transformation of crystalline phase to amorphous phase were investigated using and polarized optical microscopy (POM) techniques.

The derived carbons have high content of nitrogen dopant, high surface area, and various defects. Moreover, these carbons exhibit a high electrical conductivity (107 S m−1). Thanks to the high content of edge N (64.3%) and highly microporous nature (82% of microspores), these biomass-derived carbons show promising performance when used as supercapacitor electrodes. To be specific, these carbonaceous materials show a specific capacitance as high as 197 and 135 F g−1 at 2 and 20 A g−1 in three-electrode configuration, respectively. Furthermore, the symmetrical cells using palm-leaf-derived carbon show an energy density of 8.4 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 0.64 kW Kg−1, with high cycling life stability (∼8% loss after 10,000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at 20 A g−1). Interestingly, as the power density increases from 4.4 kW kg−1 to 36.8 kW kg−1, the energy density drops slowly from 8.4 Wh kg−1 to 3.4 Wh kg−1. Getting such extremely high power density without significant loss of energy density indicates that these palm-leaf-derived carbons have excellent electrode performance as supercapacitor electrodes.

HESS consisting of battery and ultra-capacitor energy storage units is used for energy sustainability from solar PV power generation system.

In experimental tests, load status of one sunny day and PV power profile have been created and tested dynamically by using SEMA and some of the test results in eight different operation modes are given in this paper. The battery group is charged with 1320 W power by the system and remaining energy is transferred to the grid with 5% current harmonic via the inverter in one of the operation modes.

The encapsulating efficiencies of starch-enriched fraction (SEF) and native starch (NS) obtained, respectively, by dry and wet assisted ball milling were studied. The effects of high impact milling, gelatin addition, and storage temperature (5–45 °C, 45 days) on the retention of β-carotene were investigated. Significant effects of both milling and amaranth protein present in SEF matrix on emulsification and subsequent retention of β-carotene were found. Ball milled SEF matrix showed the best encapsulation performance, with up to three times of total β-carotene content in comparison with the NS-containing matrices. Degradation of surface and encapsulated β-carotene followed a first-order kinetic model and was strongly influenced by storage temperature. The activation energy of surface β-carotene degradation doubled that of encapsulated β-carotene (86 vs. 48 kJ/mol, respectively). This difference indicates that encapsulated β-carotene is more stable to temperature changes than surface β-carotene and revealed the protective capability of the SEF matrix even at high temperatures. The color coordinates a* and L* for samples stored at 25 and 45 °C positively correlated with the remaining β-carotene, revealing the potentiality of color measurement as an adequate index of β-carotene retention. The starch-enriched amaranth fraction modified by high impact milling showed a high technological potential as an encapsulating agent and its own protein content served as a good emulsifier-stabilizer. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Amaranth flour; Amaranth starch; Encapsulating agent; Planetary ball milling; Thermal degradation; β-Carotene","Activation energy; Emulsification; Food storage; Milling (machining); Proteins; Pyrolysis; Skin; Starch; Amaranth flour; Amaranth starches; Color measurements; First-order kinetic models; Functional characteristics; Planetary ball milling; Storage temperatures; Temperature changes; Ball milling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000915472

Passive heat storage in the indoor space is a promising solution to improve the building energy flexibility. It relies on an accurate control of the transient building temperature. However, many of the current numerical models for building energy systems assume empty rooms and do not account entirely for the internal thermal inertia of objects like furniture. This review article points out that such assumption is not valid for dynamic calculations. The furnishing elements and other internal content can have a significant impact on the indoor thermal dynamics and on the occupants’ comfort. There is a clear lack of guidance and studies about the thermo-physical properties of this internal mass. Therefore, this paper suggests representative values for the furniture/indoor thermal mass parameters and presents the different available modelling technics. In addition, the large exposed surface area of furniture pieces offers a good potential for the integration of phase change materials. It can highly increase the effective thermal inertia of light frame buildings without any construction work. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy flexibility; Furniture; Indoor thermal dynamics; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage; Thermal mass","Buildings; Dynamics; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Heat storage; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Building energy; Building energy systems; Dynamic calculations; Furniture; Representative values; Thermal dynamics; Thermal mass; Thermo-physical property; Phase change materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995755320

At each location, different renewable off-grid power generation systems are considered to cover a load demand of a typical house incorporating; photovoltaic (PV) array, wind turbines, converter, batteries, electrolyzer, fuel cell (FC) and hydrogen tank. Six systems are considered in hourly base simulations; PV/battery bank, wind/battery bank, PV/wind/battery bank, PV/FC, wind/FC and PV/wind/FC.

Significant advances including commercialization in the general area of printed electronics have been based on organic molecular electronics. Still some fundamental challenges remain: Thermal instability, modest charge transport characteristics, and limited lithographic resolution. In the last decade, one-dimensional nanotubes and nanowires, like carbon nanotubes and silicon nanowires, followed by two-dimensional materials, like graphene and transitional dichalcogenide materials, have shown interesting promise as next-generation printed electronic materials. Challenges, such as non-uniformity in growth, limited scalability, and integration issues, need to be resolved for the viable application of these materials to technology.

One of the most significant problems for RESs is the sustainability of energy, because the raw material storage is not possible for renewable energy sources as photovoltaic (PV), wind, etc. Therefore, energy storage systems (ESSs) have an important place for RESs and SGs. The aim of this paper is ESS location selection for selected distribution networks. In this paper, a PV array is modelled and connected to DN randomly as unlicensed manufacturers, and a location planning algorithm (LPA) for location selection of ESSs is studied for higher energy quality at DNs. The location is determined for optimum ESS usage connecting the ESS to the correct bus decreases the power losses and increases the voltage levels. Besides, energy can be stored at the peak-off time, and stored energy can be used at the peak times for the lower cost with the usage of ESSs. Thus, the optimum usage of ESSs will be provided for RESs and SGs. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Distribution networks; Energy storage systems; Location planning; PV arrays; Smart grid","Data storage equipment; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Location; Natural resources; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Storage (materials); Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Location planning; Location selection; PV arrays; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Smart grid applications; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988433401

Social-spider optimiser (SSO) is applied to fine tune the proposed proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers by generating their optimal settings. The integral time multiplied summation of absolute deviations and the gains of PID controllers define the fitness function and control variables, respectively. The performance of the proposed SSO-based method is demonstrated on an isolated HμGS complete with variety of energy storage systems under number of scenarios. The scenarios include load fluctuations, variations in wind speed,and sun irradiance employing real site measurements. In this study, photovoltaic generating arrays and wind turbine generators are not participating in system frequency regulations due the proposal of their maximum power tracking operation strategy. The signatures of time-domain dynamic responses and cropped numerical results ascertain that the proposed SSO-based LFC scheme is promising in diminuting the signal deviations and in short time. Further validations for cropped results produced by SSO are made compared with powerful optimisation tool such as genetic algorithm which signify the tuned PID gains. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.",,"Controllers; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Genetic algorithms; Proportional control systems; Three term control systems; Turbogenerators; Two term control systems; Wind; Wind turbines; Absolute deviations; Energy storage systems; Frequency controllers; Load frequency controllers; Maximum power tracking; Micro-grid systems; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Time-domain dynamics; Electric control equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012094056

As with traditional sensor networks, it is easy to deploy and operate WMSNs. With inclusion of multimedia devices in wireless sensor networks, it is possible to provide data to users that is more meaningful than that provided by scalar sensor-based systems alone; however, producing, storing, processing, analyzing, and transmitting multimedia data in sensor networks requires consideration of additional constraints, including energy, processing power, storage capacity, and communication. Furthermore, as multimedia sensors produce much more data than scalar sensors, more manpower is required to analyze multimedia data. To overcome these constraints and challenges, this paper aimed to propose a system architecture and a set of procedures for WMSNs that facilitate automatic classification of moving objects using scalar and multimedia sensors. Methods and standards for detecting and classifying a moving object, as well as transmission of the results, are described in detail. The hardware for each sensor node includes a built-in camera, a passive infrared motion sensor, a vibration sensor, and an acoustic sensor. An application using our proposed methods was developed and embedded in the multimedia sensor node. In addition, a sink station was set up and the data produced by the sensor network was collected by this server. The classification performance of the application was tested using video recorded by the sensor node. The effect of the proposed methods on power consumption was also tested and measured. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is sufficiently lightweight to be used for real-world surveillance applications. © 2016 IEEE.","Classification; feature extraction; object detection; wireless communication; Wireless multimedia sensor","Classification (of information); Digital storage; Feature extraction; Object detection; Sensor nodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Automatic classification; Classification performance; Moving object classifications; Surveillance applications; Wireless communications; Wireless multimedia; Wireless multimedia sensor network; Wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSNS); Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014913220

Trait-based approaches have already been reported for separate soil groups like bacteria, nematodes and collembolans but investigating these groups together could bring better insights in assessing both environmental pressures and state of the systems. Still, selecting a suite of single traits that might encompass the large heterogeneity in soil biota remains a challenge for community trait-based analyses. We sampled arable fields and their adjacent (buffer zone) margins to investigate overall trait-based responses of the soil community to agricultural management. We explored the suitability of three groups of functional traits (i.e. eco-physiological traits, behavioural traits and faunal morphological traits) to analyse how different components of the soil biota (fungi, bacteria, micro- and mesofauna) respond to agricultural management and to what extent the selected traits detect effects on soil functioning. For microbes, we opted for eco-physiological trait proxies due to the difficulties to study these organisms at individual level. Our results showed that eco-physiological traits reflected differences in nutrient cycling dynamics and carbon storage driven by the soil microbial community. The structural organization of micro- and the mesofauna trophic grouping and body mass distribution reflected effects of agricultural management on soil assemblages and revealed differences in the responses of these groups to the environment. We recognize some methodological limitations of our comprehensive community trait-based approach. Yet our analysis reveals characteristics of the soil community structure and belowground ecological processes, as i.e. the partial shift from the bacterial- to the fungal-driven energy channels, that could not be detected by traditional methods, showing the potential of this approach in determining environmental pressures and in evaluating ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural management; Body mass; Eco-physiological traits; Feeding guilds; Functional response; Soil invertebrates","agricultural management; body mass; carbon sequestration; community structure; ecophysiology; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; functional response; guild; microbial community; nutrient cycling; soil biota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Invertebrata; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012283827

The purpose is to analyse the processes and stakeholder interactions, which formed the basis for integrating resource efficiency requirements into the implementing measure for vacuum cleaners and the voluntary agreement for imaging equipment. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made on how to strengthen the focus on resource efficiency in the Ecodesign Directive. It is legally possible within the Ecodesign Directive to set requirements to resource efficiency, but a focus on the most significant environmental impact has often resulted in a focus on energy efficiency in the use phase. Therefore, the Ecodesign Directive should continue to target resource efficiency aspects but also consider environmental aspects with a large improvement potential in addition to the most significant environmental impact. For the introduction of resource efficiency requirements into the Ecodesign Directive, these requirements have to be included in the preparatory study. It is therefore recommended to broaden the scope of the Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy-related products and the EcoReport tool and to develop the necessary resource efficiency indicators. A continued pressure from the stakeholders is also important, and a recommendation is therefore to continue the open ecodesign process and strengthen stakeholder consultations during the preparatory study. The Directorate-General for Energy and The Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs have the leadership of the main adopted product groups within the Ecodesign Directive. DG Environment is involved in the process and has a shared leadership of the preparatory study on washing machines and dishwashers. The role of DG Environment in the Ecodesign Directive could be strengthen in order to include broader environmental aspects and drive the resource efficiency and circular economy agenda. A final recommendation is to continue to expand the work on developing standards defining test methods and verification procedures on resource efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Ecodesign Directive; Implementing measures; Resource efficiency; Voluntary agreement","Ecodesign; Electric energy storage; Environmental impact; Testing; Circular economy; Energy related products; Environmental aspects; Imaging equipment; Implementing measures; Resource efficiencies; Stakeholder consultation; Voluntary agreement; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010886979

The designed Heat Storage Units (HSU) should be used in repeatable processes for different Time Slices (TS) with the same pair of previously heat integrated process streams. The design of Heat Storage Units (HSU) is based on analysis of heat cascades calculated for heat process integration of selected streams with Pinch Table Algorithm (PTA). Determined surplus heat loads, the temperature difference of storage material and the physical characteristics of heat storage material were used for computation of construction characteristics and estimated cost for Heat Storage Units (HSU). Two different approaches were used, heat storage process depends on industrial process parameters related to Pinch technology as well as determination of optimal volume for heat storage design on total cost for investing in such units. The designed Heat Storage system related to Pinch technology gave different compared to the approach with minimization of total estimated costs. The final selections of Heat Storage Unit design was determined with satisfying of Pinch Technology rules. The previously analyzed case study for heat process integration of Baker‘s yeast and ethyl alcohol production plant were referent system for upgrading for Heat Storage system. The cost estimation of designed Heat Storage Units (on both proposed ways) was made, and it was compared with estimated prices for hot and cold utility that would be replaced with Heat Storage for the whole annual cycle. In this case study low profitability was found because of small heat load within Heat Storage accumulation.

By comparison with Co3O4 microparticles, the advantages of the porous anode architecture are clearly shown. The inverse opal material markedly enhances specific capacity and capacity retention. The impact of various C rates on the rate of the initial charge demonstrates that higher rate charging (10 C) was much less destructive to the inverse opal structure than charging at a slow rate (0.1 C). Slower C rates that affect the IO structure resulted in higher specific capacities (more Li2O) as well as improved capacity retention. The IO structures cycle as CoO, which improves Coulombic efficiency and limits volumetric changes, allowing rate changes more efficiently. This work demonstrates how 3D IOs improve conversion mode anode material performance in the absence of additive or binders, thus enhancing mass transport of Li2O charge-discharge product through the open structure.

The grafting of polyoxometalates (POM) at carbon has scarcely been explored at the theoretical and experimental level, and the mechanism behind the chemical bonding between POM and carbon has not been fully understood. In order to give insights into these issues, an electronic structure study was carried out on the following POM systems adsorbed on carbon: PdMo12, RuNb12, SiMo12, PMo12 and SiW12. The prediction of the existence and chemical stability of PdMo12 and RuNb12 systems is reported for the first time. All systems were fully optimized with the nominal charges and also neutralized with counterions, as a benchmark to elucidate an optimal scheme that models the interaction in these nanocomposite systems. The POM/carbon attraction lies at about 250 pm in average, which may be addressed to a non-covalent bonding of the electrostatic-type, where the van der Waals contribution may also play a role. The density of states is evidently increased around the Fermi level in all POM/carbon systems. This may be due to the rising of new trajectories that ions may follow at the electrode of a solid-state device, such as a supercapacitor, giving as a result the strengthening of density current values and pseudocapacitive properties than those observed in pristine carbon systems. It was found that the SiWO12 and RuNb12 POM systems may be more feasible to be adsorbed on carbon substrates and may not require functional groups to allow POM retention. These systems represent potential candidates to be considered in nanohybrid electrodes for solid-state applications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Density functional theory; Electrostatic-type interactions; Energy storage; Polioxometalates; Solid-state devices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009446562

In such a system, natural balancing is achieved when the converter is operated in open loop with 50% duty cycle, eliminating the need for measuring the voltage of each storage device. Nevertheless, excessive currents arise even for slight voltage misbalance because of the highly underdamped nature of the system. In order to remedy this drawback, bidirectional pulse-by-pulse inductor current limitation is introduced, which is equivalent to adding a peak-current-mode-like control loop to the system. Since the duty cycle never exceeds 50%, compensation ramp is not required to maintain stability. On the other hand, while the uncontrolled system dynamics is linear, introducing the current limit mechanism turns the closed-loop dynamics into a nonlinear one, burdening the analysis task and thus calling for suitable average model to perform fast simulations for system analysis. Therefore, dynamical equations of the system are developed in order to derive the switching-cycle-averaged model and reveal the tradeoff between current limit level, balancing time and efficiency for the worst case of imbalance. Simulations and experiments support the presented findings. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Active balancing; buck-boost converter; current limitation; dynamic model; supercapacitor (SC) bank","Dynamic models; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Power converters; Virtual storage; Active balancing; Bi-directional pulse; Bidirectional buck-boost converter; Buck boost converter; Current limitation; Performance analysis; Supercapacitors; Uncontrolled systems; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999293168

Compared to a typical DC-DC converter with a resistive load, SC charging circuits do not have to supply a continuous dissipative load. A capacitor charger's operation is defined by the maximum charge to be stored in the capacitor bank. To achieve a practical energy-limited fast SC charger, a new circuit topology is proposed where the SC bank is divided into two parts. One is charged by an overrated voltage source with capacitor terminal voltage monitoring, and the other is charged from the energy stored in a coupled inductor.

As compared with other existing SC converters achieving a same conversion gain, the main advantages of the proposed converters are that they require a relatively lower number of switches and capacitors, have a relatively lower switch's and capacitor's stress, and that their associated driver circuits are simpler to realize. Importantly, with the achievable conversion ratio being flexible and that the input and output of the proposed converters are of common ground, the proposed converters are widely suitable for many applications. Moreover, as the proposed converters do not possess magnetic component or any component that can severely degrade the converters' performance at high temperature, they are especially useful for high-temperature applications. Besides, the proposed converters are capable of delivering bidirectional power, which is a key requirement for emerging applications with battery storages. Different aspects of the proposed converters, including a simple auxiliary power supply circuit for the MOSFETs' drivers, will be discussed in this paper. A nine-time SC converter prototype that operates with 20-V input voltage, 100-W output, and at 75 kHz, is constructed and tested. Experiment results show that the maximum efficiency achievable with this prototype is over 98% (without driver's loss) and the efficiency over the entire load range between 25 and 100 W is over 95.5% including the driver's loss. The output voltage ripple of the SC converter is less than 1%. When the SC converter is open-loop controlled, the load voltage regulation is relatively well kept at less than 5% between full load and no load conditions. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Bidirectional; high-voltage gain; renewable energy; switched-capacitor","Electric inverters; Energy resources; Gain measurement; High temperature applications; HVDC power transmission; Power converters; Power supply circuits; Voltage regulators; Auxiliary power supply; Bidirectional; Distributed Energy Resources; High voltage gain; Renewable energies; Switched capacitor; Switched capacitor converter; Switched-capacitor dc-dc converter; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999115048

The effects of self-discharge during capacitor storage was negligible since it took a fully charged capacitor a minimum of 14.0 days to be entirely discharged by self-discharge in all conditions studied, hence self-discharge in storage condition can be ignored.

Solidification time depended on the configuration of the aluminum foils, where differences of up to 38% were detected between horizontal perforated disks and stripes. The equations for the solidification process were numerically solved in Matlab using the finite volume method, finding good agreement for the simulated output air temperature when compared with experimental values (relative error <10 %). Later, a thermal energy accumulator was designed and assessed, which consisted of 12 cans with paraffin wax, using the horizontal perforated disks configuration.

With experiments conducted both during the warm (September) and cold (April) seasons, emphasis was put on how mechanical influence, stacking height, post-harvest water storage and dry transport affected scallop fitness. When scallops were exposed to mild- or hard mechanical shocks (dropped three times from 50 or 150 cm), it was found that hard mechanical shock caused up to 90% mortality during subsequent water storage. Results from the experiments where scallops were stored at different stacking heights (15, 30 and 50 cm) in water showed that both the duration of storage and the stacking height had a significant effect on mortality. Higher stacking heights also affected survival in subsequent transport. For long-term storage (&gt;7 days), it is recommended to limit the stacking height of scallops stored in tanks to reduce risk of mortality. Respiration experiments showed an average oxygen consumption of 0.10 and 0.24 mg O2 min−1 kg−1 f.w. in the cold and warm season respectively.

Hybridisation with more stable renewable sources, such as biomass, represents a resourceful way of meeting energy demands uninterruptedly. In this paper, a hybrid renewable electricity generation system is presented and modelled. The system relies on a combination of concentrating solar energy and biomass sources to drive an Organic Rankine Cycle. The solar field is constituted by parabolic trough collectors, and a biogas boiler is used as backup energy. The system was designed and a prototype will be installed in Tunis, in the framework of the REELCOOP project, co-funded by the EU. A computer model was developed with a combination of EBSILON and EES. Annual simulations were carried out for solar-only and hybrid modes. The system annual yield is significantly improved with hybridisation, increasing from 3.4 to 9.6%, with enhancement of SF and ORC efficiencies. Electrical generation stabilisation was achieved during the whole year with the fulfilment of ORC minimum requirements, contrarily to 1420 generation hours per year if the system relies solely on solar energy. On the other hand, hybridisation promoted energy excess mostly in the summer months, demonstrating that hybridisation significantly reduces, although not eradicating, the need for storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; CSP; Generation; Hybridisation","Biomass; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Concentrated solar power; Electrical generation; Generation; Hybridisation; Organic Rankine cycles; Parabolic trough collectors; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy source; Rankine cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003864993

Dispersing nanostructures solid materials of high conductivity in PCM represents a one method to enhance heat transfer rate of phase change processes (melting and solidification). In this paper, a review of analytical, numerical and experimental investigations of melting of Nano-enhanced phase change materials (NePCM) inside different shape containers is introduced. The common shapes of the containers used for thermal energy storage being rectangular containers, spherical vessels, cylindrical enclosures of two orientations (horizontal and vertical) and annular cavities are covered. The effect of geometrical parameters and operation conditions on the heat transfer modes (conduction and/or convection) and resulted melting characteristics are reported. Increasing the amount of supplied heat (augment the Rayleigh and Stefan numbers) results in fast evolution of natural convection dominated melting which expediting the melting process. Numerical studies indicated that the increasing the amount of nanoparticles dispersion in PCM leads to enhancing the thermal conductivity, increasing the heat transfer rate and shortening the melting time. On the other hand, experimental works proved that there are some restrictions on the amount of nanostructures suspended in PCM such as agglomeration, precipitation and dramatic increase in viscosity.

Throughout, the nature of the soluble precursors solutions and their relationship to film formation process by various solution coating techniques are collated and compared, highlighting advantages in precursor design for creating complex oxides for devices. Because of the versatility of solution-processable oxides and functional material coating, it is important to capture the advances made in oxide deposition for plastic electronics, see-through and wearable devices, and high-fidelity thin film transistors on curved or flexible displays. Solution processing, even for oxides, allows control over composition, thickness, optical constants, porosity, doping, tunable optical absorbance/transmission, band structure engineering, 3D-substrate coating, complex composite oxide formation and multi-layered oxide systems that are more difficult to achieve using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes.

In this paper, we propose a link between exergy analysis and nutrition to account for the exergy efficiency (exergy of output per exergy of input) in the metabolism of nutrients from foods in the human body. For this, we analyzed the exergy efficiency of four different chains of carbohydrate-rich products based on semi-industrial preparation processes and we included nutrient bioavailability through the use of several bioavailability indicators, including the glycemic index and protein digestibility. The least exergy efficient chain changed when not only looking at the exergy losses of the food processing chains, but also including the bioavailability and conversion of nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main molecule for energy storage in the body. When including only the processing chain, white bread presented the highest exergy loss, whereas the lowest values pointed to the spaghetti chain when also including metabolism both because of its preprocessing chain and its low bioavailability. In contrast, cooked potatoes were found to be an efficient source of ATP due to both a high metabolic efficiency and low process exergy losses. The carbohydrate bioavailability had a strong influence on the overall exergy efficiency of the studied cases, which shows the importance of including bioavailability aspects in the sustainability assessment of industrial food processing chains. © 2016","Bioavailability; Carbohydrate; Exergy; Food-chain; Glycemic index; Metabolism","Adenosinetriphosphate; Biochemistry; Carbohydrates; Chains; Energy efficiency; Food processing; Food storage; Metabolism; Nutrients; Nutrition; Physiology; Processed foods; Bioavailability; Exergy efficiencies; Food chain; Glycemic index; Industrial preparation; Processing chain; Protein digestibility; Sustainability assessment; Exergy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006489240

Therefore, the current paper presents and assesses a conceptual design for large scale sawdust and coal direct co-firing electricity production under oxy-fuel combustion conditions with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) using feedstocks with different coal and sawdust content. The influence of sawdust co-firing on several key technical performance indicators (energy efficiency, auxiliary power consumption, specific CO2 emissions, etc.) was evaluated under the following oxy-fuel atmospheres: 21.8% O2, 28.4% O2 and 35% O2 concentration. The impact of the air separation unit on process performance was tested for oxygen purities of 95% and 99%. It was found that under constant CO2 capture (CC) rate (93%), residual O2 concentration (8%) and gross electrical output (1000 MWe), power plant performances are continuously decreasing with the increase of sawdust feedstock content and supplied oxygen purity. The results also indicate that the increase of O2 concentration in the oxy-fuel atmosphere from 21.8% O2 to 28.4% O2 has a positive impact on process performance while the further increase to 35% O2 leads to lower energy efficiencies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Co-firing; CO2 capture; Oxy-fuel combustion; Renewable energy source; Sawdust","Atmospheric composition; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal storage; Combustion; Conceptual design; Energy efficiency; Feedstocks; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Sawdust; Co-firing; Coal-fired power plant; Electricity production; Oxyfuel combustion; Power plant performance; Process performance; Renewable energy source; Technical performance; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993990200

This energy is largely untapped. Oscillating Water Column (OWC) is a mechanical system that utilizes fluctuating water level from sea waves to drive an air turbine which, in turn, provides electricity when transmitted to a generator. In this study, two sets of modeling, each involving a numerical modeling and a physical experimental modeling, were conducted in a wave flume to optimize OWC systems. By varying the length, width and angle of the air chamber, an OWC structure can be designed to obtain the maximum system power. The data used for designing the optimal geometry of the chamber that may yield the maximum conversion of wave energy to useful energy were provided from the interpretation of the measurements of these parameters. In this study, results of the numerical models were compared with the measured experimental values based on the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) as performance evaluation criterion.

Combining the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photo-/thermoswitch with the dithienylethene/dihydrothienobenzothiophene (DTE/ DHB) photoswitch could potentially meet these challenges. The combined multimode switch is studied by density functional theory in order to predict its energy storage properties and spectral behavior in various solvents before discussing its suitability for use in solar heat batteries. An energy storage capacity of 0.17 MJ/kg is calculated which corresponds to a specific energy of 46 Wh/kg-slightly larger than that of a common lead.acid car battery (∼40 Wh/kg) but still only one-fourth of lithium-ion batteries (100-250 Wh/kg). The usual trend for 1,8a-dihydroazulene-1,1-dicarbonitrile and its derivatives is for their energy storage capacities to decrease dramatically as the solvent polarity is increased, but it is found that solvent effects are not as significant for the combined DHA-DTE system. Furthermore, the spectral data indeed imply a possibility of controlling the back-reaction from the energy-rich metastable isomer by light stimulus, thus enabling one to release the stored energy upon request. This work thereby represents important progress toward efficient long-time solar energy storage in photochromic closed-cycle molecular systems. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Density functional theory; Digital storage; Energy storage; Isomers; Photochromism; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solvents; Energy releasing; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage properties; Metastable isomers; Molecular systems; Photochromic molecules; Solvent polarity; Spectral behaviors; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030868478

This study explores the design of TiO2 hollow nanotube shells deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on vertically aligned SnO2 nanorods grown using the vapor-liquid-solid technique. The sacrificial template approach in combination with highly conformal coating advantages of ALD resulted in a highly reproducible method to create a large surface area covered by TiO2-protected SnO2 nanorods, which are about 60-100 nm in diameter and approximately 1 μm in length. ZnO was used as a sacrificial layer to create a 30 nm gap between SnO2 nanorods and 10 nm of TiO2 shells. Chemical etching of the sacrificial layer was used to create the desired hollow nanocomposite. A coin half-cell battery has been assembled using the TiO2-protected SnO2 nanorods as an anode electrode and lithium foil as a counter electrode and tested for lithium storage during 70 cycles of charge/discharge in a range of 0.5-2.5 V.

One of the main consumers of water worldwide is industry, with specific sectors dominating the profile in different regions. The true value of the water utilised encompasses all the costs incurred including extraction, treatment, pumping, storage, purification and disposal. Knowledge of the costs incurred allows suitable management. However the true cost or true value of the water being used is not known. In order to address this and improve environmental systems, a novel framework for establishing the true value of water was developed and its application to a specific water system in a case-study manufacturing facility is articulated in this paper. The framework may also be similarly applied to other water life-cycle stages and indeed to other water systems within the facility. A Simulink model was created and monthly data over a three year period was analysed. It was determined that the true value of the deionised water was, on average, €13.20/m3. The Value Added Factor relevant to this system is 14.05, originating from a raw water supply cost of €0.94/m3. The total true expenditure on deionised water was €26,025 whereas the perceived expenditure was €1853. The primary constituent components of the true value were system maintenance (30%), equipment depreciation (19%) and energy consumption (18%). The methodology may be applied to other services and other industries thus providing typical value-added factors for a range of systems and this approach could then act as a tool for educating consumers and also assisting with the transition to more sustainable practices. Scenario analysis may be performed in order to evaluate and provide justification for proposed modifications, thus enabling benefits to water and energy consumption, waste reduction and also operational efficiencies. The results may also be used to contribute to water foot-printing, system/regulation compliance and facility benchmarking. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Intelligent efficiency; Smart manufacturing; Value-system; Water footprint; Water-management","Costs; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Water management; Water supply; Waterworks; Environmental systems; Equipment depreciation; Manufacturing facility; Manufacturing process; Operational efficiencies; Smart manufacturing; Value systems; Water footprint; Deionized water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994507806

Although the loss modulus decreases as function of frequency in case of viscoelastic behavior, which can be interpreted as a decrease of damping, the viscoelastic behavior still leads to an increased modal damping for mechanical structures. This advantage holds for inertial-mass-type dampers that are tuned for broad-banded resonance damping. It turns out that an increase of the storage modulus as function of frequency contributes to the effectiveness of mechanical dampers with respect to energy dissipation at different mechanical resonance frequencies. It is shown that this phenomenon is medium specific and is independent of the amount of damper mass. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","LVE material; Motion stage design; Optimal; Passive damping; Structural damping","Beams and girders; Energy dissipation; Resonance; Viscoelasticity; Linear viscoelastic material; Mechanical resonance frequency; Motion stage; Optimal; Passive damping; Structural damping; Visco-elastic behaviors; Visco-elastic material; Damping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992221809

The model aims to schedule the power among the different microgrid units while minimising the operating costs together with the CO2 emissions produced. A storage device is added where the charge and discharge schedule is calculated according to both objectives. In addition, as a part of the demand side participation strategy, a charging schedule was determined for the electric vehicles (EV) in order to increase the system security and further reduce the costs and emissions. A congestion management approach is also introduced, which eliminates congestions by effective unit scheduling according to congestion signals provided by the distribution system operators. The complete day-ahead time horizon is divided in 96 time steps (each with a 15 min time span), which makes the UC problem more complicated. The studied system includes renewable energy resources, a storage unit, two microturbines, a fuel cell and EVs. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is robust and is able to reduce the microgrid operating costs and emissions by optimal scheduling of the microgrid units, and is able to take into account local congestion problems. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy resources; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Traffic congestion; Virtual storage; Charge and discharge; Congestion management; Congestion problem; Demand side participations; Distribution systems; Optimal scheduling; System security; Unit Commitment; Operating costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009384723

To get better insight in how pesticides may affect aquatic ecosystems, we tested how sublethal pesticide concentrations modify body stoichiometry. Moreover, as interactions with natural stressors may cause underestimates of the impact of pesticides, we also tested whether this pathway depended on the presence of predator cues. Therefore, we exposed damselfly larvae to chlorpyrifos and cues from predatory dragonflies and focused on body stoichiometry and associated explanatory variables (growth rate, RNA:DNA, and energy storage molecules). The way the predator cues modulated the pesticide effects strongly differed between endpoints. Exposure to chlorpyrifos affected the key body stoichiometric ratios: chlorpyrifos consistently increased N:P, while its effects on C:N (decrease with predator cues) and C:P (increase without predator cues) strongly depended upon the presence of the natural stressor. These stoichiometric responses could be explained by associated changes in growth, RNA:DNA, and in C-rich fat and sugars and N-rich proteins. The observed changes in body stoichiometry may affect the damselflies' food quality and have the potential to cascade through the food web and shape nutrient cycling. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Health risks; Nucleic acids; Pesticides; Risk assessment; RNA; Stoichiometry; Agricultural pesticides; Ecological risk assessment; Energy-storage molecule; Explanatory variables; Nutrient cycling; Pesticide concentrations; Predator cues; Stoichiometric ratio; Pesticide effects; carbohydrate; chlorpyrifos; fat; pesticide; pesticide; aquatic ecosystem; chlorpyrifos; concentration (composition); damselfly; DNA; dragonfly; ecosystem health; environmental risk; food quality; food web; growth; larva; pesticide; risk assessment; RNA; stoichiometry; sublethal effect; Article; DNA RNA hybridization; dragonfly; energy; explanatory variable; female; food quality; larva; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; stoichiometry; animal; association; Odonata; predation; Anisoptera (dragonflies); Zygoptera; Animals; Chlorpyrifos; Cues; Larva; Odonata; Pesticides; Predatory Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021854757

A systematic kinetic study of quality loss of RTE mixed salad (lollo rosso lettuce-40%, lollo verde lettuce-45%, rocket-15%) packed under modified atmospheres (3% O2, 10% CO2, 87% N2) was conducted. Microbial population (total viable count, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria), vitamin C, colour and texture were the measured quality parameters. Kinetic models for these indices were developed to determine the quality loss and calculate product remaining shelf-life (SLR). Storage experiments were conducted at isothermal (2.5–15 °C) and non-isothermal temperature conditions (Teff = 7.8 °C defined as the constant temperature that results in the same quality value as the variable temperature distribution) for validation purposes. Pseudomonas dominated spoilage, followed by browning and chemical changes. The end of shelf-life correlated with a Pseudomonas spp. level of 8 log(cfu/g), and 20% loss of the initial vitamin C content. The effect of temperature on these quality parameters was expressed by the Arrhenius equation; activation energy (Ea) value was 69.1 and 122.6 kJ/mol for Pseudomonas spp. growth and vitamin C loss rates, respectively. Shelf-life prediction models were also validated in real cold chain conditions (including the stages of transport to and storage at retail distribution center, transport to and display at 7 retail stores, transport to and storage in domestic refrigerators). The quality level and SLR estimated after 2–3 days of domestic storage (time of consumption) ranged between 1 and 8 days at 4 °C and was predicted within satisfactory statistical error by the kinetic models. Teff in the cold chain ranged between 3.7 and 8.3 °C. Using the validated models, SLR of RTE fresh cut salad can be estimated at any point of the cold chain if the temperature history is known. Shelf-life models of validated applicability can serve as an effective tool for shelf-life assessment and the development of new products in the fresh produce food sector. © 2016","Eruca sativa L; Field test; Kinetic modelling; Lactuca sativa L; Microbial growth; Ready-to-eat salad; Shelf-life","ascorbic acid; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; oxygen; Article; atmosphere; bacterial growth; bacterial viability; catering service; cold chain; controlled study; correlational study; Eruca sativa; field study; food; food analysis; food chain; food color; food control; food intake; food packaging; food quality; food spoilage; food storage; food texture; kinetic parameters; lactic acid bacterium; leaf lettuce; lettuce; mathematical model; nonhuman; prediction; Pseudomonas; ready to eat fresh cut salad; refrigerator; shelf life; storage temperature; temperature related phenomena; validation study; bacterial count; biological model; cold; food control; food preservation; food storage; growth, development and aging; kinetics; Lactobacillaceae; microbiology; procedures; refrigeration; vegetable; Cold Temperature; Colony Count, Microbial; Food Microbiology; Food Preservation; Food Storage; Kinetics; Lactobacillaceae; Lettuce; Models, Biological; Pseudomonas; Refrigeration; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000415046

We propose a lossless approximate realisation for the VIC as a simple circuit with two controllers: a voltage controller acts fast to maintain the desired terminal voltage, while a charge controller acts more slowly and maintains the charge Q in the desired operating range by influencing the incoming current. The VIC is useful as a filter capacitor for various applications, for example, power factor compensators (PFC), as we describe. In spite of using small capacitors, the VIC can replace a very large capacitor in applications that do not require substantial energy storage.

Authentication is considered as a prime concern in the field of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks due to its wide domain applications. Extenssive amount of research works have been carried out to develop more secure authentication system in order to achieve confidentiality and authenticity constraints. Many authentication protocols are mainly depend upon security, scalability, communication constraints and computation overhead. Also, most of the traditional authentication models are failed to authenticate node behavior using integrity, secured key distribution and encryption models. Therefore, there is requirement of very strong authentication protocols in order to provide extended security to the WSN systems. To overcome these issues, a novel quantum chaotic key distribution (QKD) based homomorphic CPABE model was implemented in wireless communication networks. Quantum key Distribution (QKD) is required to improve the security of communication systems. The major objective of quantum key distribution is to generate a key that takes part in encryption. Experimental results proved that the proposed model has high computation speed, storage overhead and secured key distribution compared to traditional wireless authentication models. © 2017, Science and Engineering Research Support Society.

Metal-decorated carbon substrates, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide have been of interest to the scientific group all through the past three decades on account of different potential applications. The utilization of graphene oxide as the nano scale substrates for the formation of nanocomposites with metal oxides is a novel thought to acquire a hybrid which would show both the properties of GO as an interesting paper-shape material and the elements of single nanosized metal particles. Methods: Graphene is a carbon allotrope of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice. It has attracted unique properties and potential applications. It has been synthesized and modified through various methods, and composites have been made with other nanomaterials, such as metals, metal oxides, and some complex oxides. Results: Grapheme-metal oxide composites are gaining attention as a viable alternative to boost the efficiency of various catalytic, storage reactions in energy conversion, anticancer and drug delivery applications. Nevertheless, by combining the superior physical/chemical properties of GO themselves and the versatile nanomaterials that can decorate with GO, GO based materials have a bright future in the anticancer, drug delivery, energy, and environmental applications. Conclusion: This review article has described the recent publications in the development of Decoration of Graphene Oxide such as metals, metal oxides and their nanocomposites based materials. We anticipate this active field will continue growing rapidly, leading eventually to a variety of mature materials and devices that would benefit the society. Finally, the applications of composites are at their initial stages.

The most important renewable energy resources include hydroelectric, solar, wave and wind energies. Hydroelectric energy provides a safe and clean power supply to Turkey with positive effects on environment and climate, less cost in operation and maintenance, being long-lasting and domestic nature. Especially hydroelectric production of all renewable energy resources in Turkey is becoming increasingly significant in total electricity production in that it has reached 16.1% in 2015 while it was only 3.8% in 1950. Small scale hydroelectric power plants are favored among clean energy resources since they are easily established, mostly sustainable and cheaper to operate. Pumped Hydropower Storage (PHS) systems have become common recently since they store energy in the form of water in an upper reservoir, pumped from another reservoir at a lower elevation. During periods of high electricity demand, power is generated by releasing the stored water through turbines in the same manner as a conventional hydropower station. On the other hand, during periods of low demand (usually nights or weekends when electricity is also lower cost), the upper reservoir is recharged by using lower-cost electricity from the grid to pump the water back to the upper reservoir. Furthermore, they can be operated every hour of the day when interconnected with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to obtain maximum efficiency. In reality PHS's do not provide means to produce net gain in electricity but they are economically viable due to new pricing policies and can balance the load in the grid. In this study, general status of energy and hydropower of Turkey is investigated, and a proposal for a pumped hydropower storage in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey is presented. © by PSP.","Hydroelectric Energy; Pumped Hydropower Storage; Renewable Energy; Turkey; Western Black Sea","alternative energy; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy storage; energy use; hydroelectric power; operations technology; pump; reservoir; Black Sea Coast [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050739135

In addition, an interlayer of graphitic carbon nitride coated on flexible and conductive carbon fiber paper (g-C3N4/CFP) was inserted between the cathode and the polymer separator to trap the soluble polysulfides. It was found that the as-fabricated LSB using the NGae host with 4.2% N doping content and the g-C3N4/CFP interlayer can provide a specific capacity of 1271 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with excellent stability over 400 cycles.

FA can be generated as a byproduct from hydrolysis process of lignocellulose biomass. Palm oil empty fruit bunches (POEFB) is one of palm oil industry waste in Indonesia and could be used to produce chemicals such as FA. In this study, we investigated the production of FA from POEFB hydrolysis process using sulfuric acid catalyst, and we determined kinetic model of FA production from POEFB hydrolysis process. FA production was done in a pressurized reactor with temperature around 150 - 170oC using 1M sulfuric acid catalyst. The highest FA was formed at reaction temperature of 170oC after20 minutes reaction that produced 0.031 mol/L and 46.6 %molFA yield. FA production kinetics were also investigated by compared two kinetic models. The first model (model 1) predicted FA production from C5 (pentose sugars) and C6 (hexose sugars). On the other side, the second model(model 2) predicted FA production only from C6 sugars. Model 2 was a kinetic model that can describe FA production from POEFB hydrolysis process.

The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative research that integrates the creation and the consumption of scientific knowledge across regions. From a human behavior point of view, this is significant since it provides an advanced decision-making layer for bringing together researchers from all over the world. Design/methodology/approach: More specific in this paper, the authors analyze the production and consumption of scientific knowledge across the regions in an important field of sustainable and renewable energy – using publications and citations data indexed in Scopus. As a case study, the authors select the USA a major producer of scientific publications in the field. At first, the authors identify the topics produced by the USA. Further topics produced by the scientific communities outside the USA that consume the knowledge produced by the USA are identified. The authors generate topics by employing the proposed topic model with distance matrix – an extension of classic latent Dirichlet allocation model. Findings: The results show that research topics produced by the USA are consumed in different international contexts, interestingly. Consuming the knowledge produced by the USA, Chinese scientific community heavily produces topics related to biomass – to produce renewable energy. In contrast, Japanese scientific community produces topics related to fuel cell – used for the production of hybrid and electronic vehicles. Whereas the Taiwanese scientific community shows remarkable competency in solar cells. Among the European nations, while the German scientific community produces topics related to photovoltaic, the French scientific community covers topics related to Energy Storage and Green Chemistry. The authors believe that such analyses may be helpful in establishing more effective multi-national research collaborations by understating the actual consumption of produced knowledge. Practical implications: Overall, the study provides a new dimension to comprehensively understand production and consumption of knowledge using scientific literature.

In spite of the recent technological advancements, many Latin-American countries remain with a wide number of towns isolated from the main grid of their electrical power systems. Colombia is one of these countries, and the implemented solutions rely mainly on the use of diesel generators. One possible solution approach includes the expansion of the existing infrastructure with the use of renewable energy sources in isolated microgrids. In this paper, three optimal designs for an isolated hybrid microgrid in the Colombian community of Unguía are proposed using an iterative optimization technique, the interior-point algorithm. The hybrid microgrid is composed by a diesel generator, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and batteries. In addition, each design is obtained for a given diesel generating cost. In each design the number of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and batteries for a given type of element are calculated. The unmet load and the power delivered by the diesel generator are calculated for each time interval. The optimization objective is to minimize the total system cost. The optimization results show that for a certain diesel cost, the system obtained only uses renewable energy and storage to supply load demand, although the diesel generator infrastructure is already in place, and no initial investment costs associated with diesel generation were assumed. © Renewable Energy Research, 2017.","Energy storage; Hybrid energy systems; Microgrids; Optimization; Renewable energy systems; Solar energy; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043455299

Compared to the unmodified sisal/PLA biocomposite, it produced a better interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the PLA matrix. In addition, silanization also increased the crystal size and crystallinity in the biocomposite, which decreased thermal decomposition to an observed maximal activation energy of 213 kJ/mol. This indicated the stability of silanized sisal biocomposite in resisting. After the microbial growth test, despite the molecular weight of all biocomposites declining due to biodegradation, the silanized sisal PLA still possessed better properties than the unmodified biocomposite, particularly storage modulus, molecular weight and hydrophobicity, which reflected the inhibition of enzymatic degradation.

Energy extraction is provided by the potential rise in electrodes held in a fixed charge, as a response to the concentration change. Therefore, electrodes that exhibit high potential variation as a response to concentration change (negative rise for the cation-capturing electrode and vice versa) are highly desirable. In this work, electrodes that can accommodate mostly cations within their porous structure are discussed. In accordance to the modified Donnan (mD) model of the electrical double layer, it is expected that such electrodes will display the highest potential change as a response to concentration change (while being held with a fixed charge).

Liwa, Al Ain and Al Khatem areas are suffering from high water well salinity that exceeds 20,000 ppm. This work focuses on this problem and suggests a suitable solution allowing the use of renewable energy (Solar Photovoltaic) to drive RO desalination units. An optimal design of RO/PV unit adapted to a typical farm in Abu Dhabi was suggested using a model developed by using the software ROSA and HOMER. One of the main important results given by ROSA, besides the characteristics of the RO plant, is the required power to drive the plant. This data is the main input in the second part of the present work which is the design of the PV solar system.

In this research we used Xanthan gum which is a microbiological polysaccharide. In order to obtain the properties of the Xanthan gum, such as viscosity, storage and loss modulus, shear rate, etc., it was necessary to do an amplitude sweep and steady flow test in a rheometer with a concentric cylinder as geometry.

The demand place on electric power is increasing daily while generation may not be able to meet up with demand requirements. One of the aspects of power plant systems where an improvement can be instituted is the installation of efficient plant control. This will be able to minimize waste as well as enable smooth running of the plant ensuring availability of power when needed. The work presented in this paper is an intelligent hybrid hydropower plant control technique successfully applied to a 300kW capacity hydropower plant. The plant combines both conventional hydropower plant and a pumped storage plant. A generic model designed for this work was used in simulating for optimised outcomes. The control design operates effectively using three parameters; generated power, time of operation and the volume of water in the reservoir for generation. Flowcode and Proteus ISIS were used in the design of the control system, which allow plant operation change using the parameter stated.

Arsenic selenide glasses are well known as high photosensitive materials with a wide range of application in optoelectronics and information storage systems. Besides, that it was found that the impurities influence the electrical, photoelectrical and optical characteristics of the amorphous material, due to the changes in the density of localized states. Introduction of the elements of IV group of periodic table in selenide and sulphide glasses, such as Sn, conduct to the appearance of tetrahedral structural units in the base glass, which change the coordination number and other parameters. These particularities lead to the non-monotonic dependence of mechanical, electrical, optical and photoelectrical properties with increasing of the concentration of four coordinated atoms. It was shown, that the spectral distribution of the stationary photoconductivity for studied glass system depends on the composition and polarity on the illuminated electrode. The dependence of the stationary photocurrent Iph on the light intensity F for the exponential distribution of the localized states is described by a power function Iph ~ Fα, were the parameter 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 1.0. The transient photocurrent behavior in investigated amorphous materials is controlled by carrier localization and delocalization processes. The kinetics of photocurrent produced by uniform continuous bulk photogeneration of non-equilibrium carriers reveal anomalous behavior, passing through the maximum before the stationary state is reached. The relaxation curves are described by the parameters of the localized state energy distribution, and are analyzed in the framework of multiple trapping models for amorphous materials. © 2017, Editura Academiei Romane.

For this, the two phases intended for obtaining the margarine were used first as extraction solvents. Both enriched phases thus obtained are then employed to formulate different margarine samples. In addition to color and rheological behavior, margarine samples were characterized in terms of oxidative stability which was evaluated through the peroxide value, Q10-factor and activation energy (Ea). Results showed that all the kinds of margarine formulated by addition of date peel extract presented high values of a* and b* parameters, compared with those of reference and commercial origin (p&lt;0.05).The best oxidation resistance of different kinds of experimental margarine was obtained when the sample was added with: (i) the aqueous extract-ingredient, in the case of storage at 30°C, and (ii) the both aqueous and oil extract-ingredients, in the case of storage at 5°C. Results showed that the models applied (zero-order, first-order, polynomial, logarithmic and power law) differently described the oxidation kinetics (R2≤0.993), according to the margarine type and storage temperature. Globally, Q10 and Ea parameters varied within wide intervals of values (0.8-4.0 and 3.4-95.9kJ.mol-1, respectively) according to margarine nature.

Two-dimensional electrophoresis and subsequent mass spectrometry were used to identify 454 protein spots from the Flip97-171C and Elite proteomes. By using Mascot Server software, 37% of the spots were identified as 47 different proteins involved in a large range of metabolic functions.

The basic criteria for this kind of energy storage unit installations include, (a) the existence of an autonomous power system with local power stations, (b) the high electricity production cost, (c) the potential of renewable energy sources (mainly wind and solar), and (d) the non-flat terrain morphology (for PHS). Greek islands represent ideal cases for large scale energy storage installations, as they fulfil all the above criteria. This paper shows the effect of the installation of a planned PHS unit in Crete island.

Defining the relationship between the parameters of the energy storage components of the three-phase parallel power active filter and the character of current which is compensated. Methodology. The methodology includes formation of the equivalent circuit for active power filter with the analysis of the distribution of the currents as well as their components in the branches by the principle of compensation. Analysis of time diagrams of the mode parameters by the character of the load current for the scheme which matches the equivalent circuit and was published in the previous papers. Moreover, the method involves the realization of experiments in order to determine the influence of the values of capacitor voltage and inductance of the inductive components on compensation quality of the load current by the electric power network current and the analytical determination of the power distortion influence on the average value and the deviation of the capacitor voltage of the power active filter. It also involves the justification of the rate of change of load current as a critical parameter using the experimental results. Analytical determination of the rate of change of load current of the power active filter taking into account its dependence on the delay angle for thyristor converter considering active component and instantaneous value of load current. Analysis of the rate of change of load current in the power active filter with several current delay angles of the thyristor converter and comparison of it with the transient current in the power active filter scheme using certain assumptions and taking into account the presence of energy storage components. Findings. It is proved that the parameters of the circuit and the modes of the power active filter essentially depend on the rate of change of load current within a considered time interval. The results are based on the analysis of time diagrams for the mode parameters of the power parallel active filter used in the circuit with thyristor converter as a load. Originality. Influence of the rate of change of load current on the mode parameters of the power active filter, and accordingly, on the parameters of the power circuit components which should additionally be taken into account for calculations by known methods is substantiated. Practical value. It is determination of the influence of the rate of change of load current on parameters of components of the three-phase parallel power active power filter, which may be useful for their selection.","Angle of overlap, power distortion; Current delay angle; Pulse control; Rate of change of load current; Total harmonic distortion (THD)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033476642

Low temperature synthesis routes for cathode materials are currently gaining attention, in order to decrease the ecological footprint of the final LIB. Here, the crystallization temperature of LMO by a citrate based solution-gel synthesis was significantly lowered, to as low as 250 °C by the addition of ethanol to the precursor. The role of ethanol in this synthesis process was explored. It was found to lead to a considerable increase in the oxidation rate of the redox couple Mn2+/Mn3+, a lowering of the precursor decomposition temperature by 200 °C, besides a drastic decrease in the crystallization temperature (reaching 250 °C). Moreover, the main cause was identified to be an esterification reaction of ethanol with the carboxylic acid in the precursor complexes, taking place before the oxide formation. The insights obtained strengthen the knowledge regarding citrato-Mn2+/Mn3+ complexes present in aqueous solution-gel synthesis routes and are relevant for the preparation of various manganese containing oxides. Moreover, the precursor developed opens up a new possibility for the low temperature synthesis of LMO powders and thin films for application in LIB. In the case of thin film batteries, the low temperature processing provides compatibility with other materials in the thin film battery stack, avoiding undesired oxidations or interfacial reactions. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Esterification; Ethanol; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Low temperature effects; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Manganese oxide; Secondary batteries; Solutions; Temperature; Thin films; Aqueous solution-gel; Crystallization temperature; Energy storage applications; Esterification reactions; Low temperature processing; Low temperature synthesis; Precursor decomposition; Synthesis temperatures; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033226196

Synthesis of triacylglycerols from non-esterified free fatty acids (FFAs) combined with triacylglycerol storage represents a highly efficient strategy to stockpile FFAs in cells and prevent FFA-induced lipotoxicity. Although essentially all vertebrate cells have some capacity to store and utilize triacylglycerols, white adipose tissue is by far the largest triacylglycerol depot and is uniquely able to supply FFAs to other tissues. The release of FFAs from triacylglycerols requires their enzymatic hydrolysis by a process called lipolysis. Recent discoveries thoroughly altered and extended our understanding of lipolysis. This Review discusses how cytosolic 'neutral' lipolysis and lipophagy, which utilizes 'acid' lipolysis in lysosomes, degrade cellular triacylglycerols as well as how these pathways communicate, how they affect lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis and how their dysfunction affects the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.

Huge amount of fresh tomatoes were lost and negatively affected human health because of fungal diseases. Drying process represent easy and applicable techniques to minimize tomatoes infection notably mycotoxigenic fungi. The economical problem of tomato comes from its price had 10-fold increase in the last decade. Methodology: The commercial ripe tomato samples (30) obtained from local super-market at Giza during October 2015 were used to evaluate the effect of drying with those from Egyptian agriculture centre, Giza, which considered as control. A. flavus and Alt. alternata have been isolated from sample, Alt. alternata observed inside tomato using scanning electron microscope. Aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and tenuazonic acid were determined. The infected and spoiled samples were discarded and the uniform with healthy were selected to study and were divided into 4 groups, three of them were cut into slices; the fourth group was converted to juice. The product of all groups were divided into 2 sets the first set was dried by solar energy, and the second treated by freeze-dryer. All sets sample packaged in plastic bags, stored at 25°C for one year, and inspected for fungal growth. Results and Discussion: The freeze-dried samples color appeared nearest to fresh tomato by highly coast. No fungal growth appeared through storage. The isolated fungi weren't able to produce either aflatoxin or tenuazonic acid. None of ochratoxin A or aflatoxins was detected in analyzed samples. Tenuazonic acid detected at low levels of concentration (0.680 ug/kg) in inside rotted ripped samples. Conclusion: All tomato samples were free from either aflatoxins or ochratoxin A. alternaria fungi recorded as inside rotted. However the effectiveness and promising results of freeze-dried samples which near to fresh-like samples it’s expensive cost considered as major problem. © 2017 Hegazy.","Alternaria alternate; Freeze drying; Mycotoxins; SEM; Solar drying; Tomato",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031507125

But conventional fuel and engine technologies are often criticized, especially Diesel engines with the recent ""Diesel gate"". Engine and fuel co-research is one of the main leverage to reduce both CO2 footprint and criteria pollutants in the transport sector. Compression ignition engines with gasoline-like fuels are a promising way for both NOx and particulate emissions abatement while keeping lower tailpipe CO2 emissions from both combustion process, physical and chemical properties of the low RON gasoline. To introduce a new fuel/engine technology, investigation of pollutants and After-Treatment Systems (ATS) is mandatory. Previous work [1] already studied soot behavior to define the rules for the design of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) when used with a low RON gasoline in a compression ignition engine. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of such fuel/engine technology on the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) for low load operating conditions. Hydrocarbon (HC) speciation is performed upstream (Us) and downstream (Ds) of the DOC. Warm-up and efficiency are also tested for different operating conditions. To finish, exothermal capacities are considered to ensure high temperature levels for DPF regeneration. Upstream and downstream DOC HC speciation showed heavier molecules for Diesel fuel compared to low RON gasoline and higher carbon balance. These results are consistent with fuel composition. Upstream DOC main HC family is olefin for Diesel while it appears to be paraffin from low RON gasoline. Regardless of the fuel, upstream DOC HC species are mainly C1 to C4 and methane is the major downstream molecule. For steady hot conditions, conversion efficiency of HC and CO for both fuels are quite similar. Differences are highlighted for transient conditions from cold to warm. For low load operating conditions, due to high amounts of HC and CO for low RON gasoline combustion, the catalyst seems to be poisoned and light-off temperatures are higher than Diesel ones. Moreover, the HC storage, during the light-off, is lower when using low RON gasoline. Finally, DOC exotherm for regeneration is possible with low RON gasoline post-injections. For a same fuel quantity injection regardless of the fuel, low RON gasoline has higher upstream DOC HC amount and generates higher exotherms. Despite some differences in the HC species between Diesel and low RON gasoline, conversion efficiency and DOC exotherm are quite similar. Nevertheless, the light-off and the HC-storage during a warm-up phase could be different and need more investigations.

The share of power plants with intermittent energy production is rising. The increasing volatility of supply and demand has to be compensated by more flexibility in the energy system. Biomass-based plants are qualified for providing flexibility due to the almost infinite storability of the energy carrier. In this work dynamic models for the simulation of flexible operation of an Austrian biogas plant with biomethane production using the process simulation tool IPSEpro are presented. The models base on data collected during a one-year-monitoring. The plants main focus lies on biogas upgrading with two additional CHP units for production of heat and power on demand. For the simulation detailed models of the CHP units and various dynamic models including a gas storage model were developed and are described in this work. Additionally the effects of providing positive secondary control reserves on the needed gas and heat storage capacities were investigated in a case study. For this purpose one month of operation was simulated ex-post. The results show that the existing gas storage capacities are sufficient to provide control reserves while upgrading biogas steadily and simultaneously.

Recent research suggests that ammonia is a potential alternative automotive fuel due to its favorable storage properties and the mature infrastructure for its production and distribution. However, there remains the question of whether ammonia can be a sustainable alternative automotive fuel on a life-cycle basis. The energy-intensive production process and the need for a secondary fuel are two major issues with the use of ammonia. A comparative welltowheel life cycle assessment of selected ammonia-based fuel cycles is done. Two conventional fossil fuelbased ammonia production processes and two proposed biomass-based processes are considered, namely: steam reforming, partial oxidation, a cyanobacterial (Anabaena) process, and a willow-based (Salix) process. The end-use is propulsion of a light-duty internal combustion engine vehicle, and the functional unit is 1 km of distance driven by a such a vehicle. Three types of secondary fuels are considered: gasoline, diesel, and dimethyl ether. Using the carbon and nitrogen footprint as the primary environmental performance indicators, fuzzy life cycle optimization is applied to determine the optimal system configuration. Results show that ammonia produced from the biomass-based process with dimethyl ether as the secondary fuel results in the best well-towheel fuel pathway. Sensitivity analysis shows that the end-user vehicle fuel economy has the most significant influence on the optimal solution, which means that concerted efforts to improve ammonia-based fuel cycles must be focused on the end-use phase.

The problem in this paper involves gaseous streams from which ammonia has to be removed using water as the mass separating agent. The ammonia rich lean stream is then sent to a regenerator where steam stripping is used to remove the ammonia, after which the lean stream, which is now somewhat free of ammonia, is recycled back to the network of mass absorbers for further ammonia absorption from the gaseous streams. The stage-wise superstructure is adopted, however it is extended by including models to account for primary mass exchange, regeneration and heat exchange subnetworks.

Phase change materials (PCMs) and the latent heat accompanying the phase change can be utilized to accumulate, store, are release the energy. Computer simulation tools are usually applied in the optimal design of LHTES devices as the simulations are fast, relatively easy to perform and not expensive. The paper presents a performance and accuracy comparison between a front tracking algorithm and well-known interface capturing methods - the enthalpy and apparent heat capacity methods. Acceleration by means of graphics processing unit (GPU) is used to enhance the computational efficiency of the presented front tracking algorithm. A container filled with a commercial PCM, which has been utilized in a numerous LHTES applications, is considered in the comparison. Simulation results are also compared to experimental data. The evaluation of results shows that the front tracking algorithm allows for a significantly higher accuracy than in case of interface capturing methods. The higher accuracy of simulation tools then contributes to a more accurate design of LHTES devices and allows for their higher performance and efficiency.

When doing so, particular projects may have to be developed, being important to understand their impact on water tariffs, and thus, on customers. Such consequences may bear an increased relevance in cases stressed with, e.g., resource scarcity, poverty, and the need for infrastructure investments. The resulting cost and revenue variability demand a comprehensive study. If the first may require a stochastic modeling (in major cost components) in order to consider its inherent uncertainty, the second needs to be modeled following context-specific objectives set by the relevant stakeholders. The solutions achieved will likely promote distinct revenue sources, as well as diversified water tariff structures. A multi-objective optimization model (i.e., a Framework for Suitable Prices) is built to deal with those diversified requirements (e.g., stochastic energy costs, affordability, cost recovery, or administrative simplicity). The model is solved through achievement scalarizing functions with several weighting coefficients for a reference point, so as to provide a significant perception of possible revenue options (and their impact) to the decision makers. The proposed method is applied to a case study, Boa Vista Island in Cabo Verde, in which the background characteristics, namely water sources availability (e.g., the adoption of desalination technologies), economic development and other contextual factors were considered. The key role of tariff structure selection is displayed, instead of assuming it a priori, giving important insights regarding project feasibility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-objective optimization; Stochastic desalination cost; Sustainability; Tariff structures; Water supply","Costs; Decision making; Depreciation; Desalination; Economics; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Water supply; Desalination technologies; Economic development; Infrastructure investment; Multi-objective optimization models; Scalarizing function; Tariff structures; Water supply projects; Weighting coefficient; Multiobjective optimization; water; desalination; economic development; investment; optimization; poverty; prioritization; stakeholder; stochasticity; sustainability; tariff structure; water storage; water supply; achievement; Article; controlled study; desalination; economic development; energy cost; energy recovery; environmental decision making; priority journal; stochastic model; water availability; water supply; Cape Verde; cost; decision making; economics; empirical research; Markov chain; statistical model; uncertainty; water supply; Boa Vista [Roraima]; Brazil; Roraima; Cabo Verde; Costs and Cost Analysis; Decision Making; Empirical Research; Models, Statistical; Stochastic Processes; Uncertainty; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030705847

As WTG installations are increasing, these systems generate a fluctuated output power as a result of varying wind speed and need to have a power smoothing capability to have a smooth output power profile. The optimal size of the SCESS is determined and a controller is proposed and implemented to continuously charge and discharge the SCESS to achieve its objectives. The SCESS is exploited to minimize the short term fluctuation to have a smooth power profile during normal operation. A bi-directional buck boost converter is used to integrate the SCESS with the system. Two back to back connected three level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) converters are used for the power conversion. The control strategy and the system model have been developed for the NPCs, the buck boost converter and the variable speed WTG system.

As common PSP schemes, binary and ternary configurations are considered as well as fixed and variable speed schemes. Operating ranges and efficiency values depend on water way losses, pump/turbine characteristics, electric losses and gross-head dependent plant losses. Finally, an optimization algorithm is presented, including the market and plant models, where the objective function is the earning in each scenario such that the model can be used to determine the best operation strategy among the markets. It is found that earnings from the balancing energy market exceed earnings from the spot market over and that the high price volatility has a significantly higher influence on earnings than the relatively small efficiency variations.

Turkey is structured into seven geographical regions and all assumptions and data are collected and applied separately for the regions. The energy transition is simulated for two scenarios: a power sector scenario and power sector plus desalination and non-energetic industrial gas demand (integrated) scenario. Turkey has an enormous solar energy potential, which leads to an installed solar PV capacity of 287 GW (71% of total installed capacity) in the power scenario and 387 GW (73% of total installed capacity) in the integrated scenario in 2050. Solar PV and other installed RE systems are balanced by storage systems to increase the flexibility of the system. Levelised cost of electricity increased slightly in the power scenario, from a fossil fuel based system with 63 €/MW hel in 2015 to a fully RE-based system with 65.4 €/MW hel in 2050. The capacity mix in the power scenario entirely built for the assumptions of the year 2050 led to a cost of 51 €/MW hel, which can also be expected in the periods beyond 2050. In the integrated scenario, however, the costs decreased from 60.3 €/MW hel to 57.3 €/MW hel, mainly due to the benefit of sector coupling.

As an alternative, the world has started considering renewable energy sources as they are ubiquitous, environmentally affable and freely available. One of the fastest expanding renewable energy sources is wind energy. The stand-alone wind energy systems may not be practical for fulfilling the electric load demands at the places having unsteady wind speeds with high unpredictability. At those places wind-hybrid energy systems, comprising of the wind energy system combined with one or more other renewable energy systems, can be of great significance in overcoming the weaknesses of stand-alone wind energy systems. This paper mainly focuses on wind energy and wind-hybrid power generation systems used to electrify various locations.

The shell space is filled with n-octadecane as a base phase change material (PCM) dispersed with copper nanoparticles. A heat transfer fluid (HTF: water) flows in the inner tube and transfers heat to NEPCM. In order to evaluate the effect of the use of both pulsating flow and NEPCM instead of a stationary flow and a base PCM on the storage performance, a mathematical model based on the energy conservation equations has been developed and validated by experimental, numerical, and theoretical results. Numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of the volumetric fraction of nanoparticles, pulsating frequency, Reynolds number, and Stefan number on the thermal behavior and performance of the storage unit. Calculations were performed in the following control parameter ranges: the volumetric fraction of nanoparticles from 0 to 7%, dimensionless pulsating frequency from 0.01 to 3, Reynolds number from 100 to 2000, and Stefan number ranges from 0.155 to 0.402. The results showed that the dispersion of copper nanoparticles in base PCM enhances the thermal performance of the LHSU. For a volumetric fraction of nanoparticles of 7%, a reduction up to 14.4% in the melting time (at dimensionless pulsating frequency of 1, Reynolds number of 500, and Stefan number of 0.155) was achieved. The results also showed that the pulsating frequency affects the heat transfer rate to NEPCM, and the small melting time is obtained for a low pulsating frequency. It was also revealed that high Reynolds and Stefan numbers highly reduce the time required for the complete melting. © 2017 by Begell House, Inc.","Heat transfer fluid (HTF); Latent heat storage unit (LHSU); Nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material (NEPCM); Nanoparticles; Phase change material (PCM); Pulsating flow","Copper; Dispersions; Fluids; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Melting; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Phase change materials; Phase transitions; Reynolds number; Storage (materials); Copper nanoparticles; Energy conservation equations; Latent heat storage units; Pulsating flow; Pulsating frequencies; Storage performance; Thermal Performance; Volumetric fractions; Flow of fluids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029459440

Water is used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) at constant temperature. The thermal and dynamical behavior of both PCM, i.e., PCM1 and PCM2, put in two capsules, is detailed at the beginning of this study. The results indicate that natural convection dominates heat transfer during the charging mode. The solidification phase is conduction-dominated in the discharging mode. Moreover, these same results suggest that the PCM1-PCM1 configuration is preferable when the application requires the storage of a small latent energy (latent heat) and a long discharge time. Whereas configuration PCM2-PCM2 is preferred when the application requires the storage of a large latent heat energy and a short discharge time. However, the configuration PCM1-PCM2 is more desirable when the application requires the storage of an average latent heat energy with a long discharge time. Moreover, for the height velocity of water flow, the latent heat energy packed by two different PCM without thermal interaction is the arithmetical addition between them. Whereas, from v = 10−5, the thermal interaction between two different PCM cannot be neglected and the energy stored is not the arithmetic addition. The thermal interaction appears clearly in the discharging mode. Thus, the thermal interaction has accelerated the discharging of PCM2. Whereas, the discharging of PCM1 is prolonged by this thermal interaction. © 2017 by Begell House, Inc.","Different phase change materials; Melting; Solidification; Spherical capsules; Thermal behavior; Thermal interaction","Encapsulation; Flow of water; Heat transfer; Hydraulics; Latent heat; Melting; Phase transitions; Solidification; Spheres; Storage (materials); Charging modes; Computational studies; Constant temperature; Dynamical behaviors; Melting and solidification; Spherical capsule; Thermal behaviors; Thermal interaction; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029413197

Peak consumption, however, occurs when the irradiance is at its highest, suggesting that the problem can be partially solved by injecting photovoltaic energy into the DC link of the adjustable speed drive in inverter-grade air-conditioning appliances. In this paper, the optimal design of an isolated Resonant Boost – Half – Bridge DC/DC Converter is described. The converter was optimized using the NSGA-II algorithm, with weighted-efficiency and cost as objective functions. Annual irradiance and temperature data was used to develop site-specific weighted-efficiency coefficients. Since photovoltaic power evolves throughout the day, several optimizations, at different power levels, were carried out. Components to build the converter were selected from a data base taking into account individual temperatures, and suitable maximum and peak ratings. Optimization results demonstrate that optimizing the converter at its nominal power does not provide the best solution. Rather, it was found that the best result is obtained when the converter is designed at the power level that coincides with the maximum energy harvesting. The main differences between optimization results are in the transformer design, leakage inductance, switching frequency and capacitors. Results also highlighted the fact that cost is very sensitive to efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ASD air-conditioning appliance with auxiliary PV energy; Multi-objective annual energy losses vs cost optimization; Optimal converter design for highest PV power interval; Site specific weighted efficiency","Air conditioning; Bridges; Costs; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Energy harvesting; Multiobjective optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Variable speed drives; Adjustable speed drives; Converter design; Cost optimization; Efficiency coefficient; Objective functions; PV energy; Residential air conditioning; Site-specific; DC-DC converters; air conditioning; demand analysis; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; environmental factor; experimental design; optimization; photovoltaic system; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029367771

Contribution margins in fuelwood supply are small and ensuring supply chain efficiency plays a crucial role in delivering high quality products at competitive costs. This paper provides a review of research trends related to this issue in the field of harvesting and storing fuelwood and the impact of recent technology during the last decade. Whereas the basic suitability of supply chains and machines was research’s main priority 20 years ago, the focus shifted to improving the efficiency of machines appropriate for harvesting fuelwood during recent years. Significant increase of productivity could be achieved by introducing fuelwood harvesting heads for processing whole trees to bunches convenient for forwarding (»multi-tree handling«), and adapted working techniques (»boom-corridor thinning «) were developed. Development of compaction measures for bulky raw materials, like logging residues, applied during or before processing and forwarding, culminated in dedicated machines (»bundle-harvester«). Improving the final product quality by appropriate storage practices was emphasised. The phrase »moisture content management« voiced the urgent need for prompt monitoring of fuelwood drying behaviour, which was answered by research in the form of meteorological data based drying models. Among the treatments applied before and during storage, covering has evolved as the most suitable measure. Furthermore, research advocated for greater attention to dry matter losses during storage and the development of basic energy density. © 2017, University of Zagreb.

The first system is an integrated solar thermal driven residential air-conditioning. This system consists of evacuated tube solar collector arrays of area 36 m2 with high reflective parabolic surface used at the back, a silica gel-water adsorption chiller of 8 kW nominal cooling capacity, and hot and cold-water storage tanks of 1.8 and 1.2 m3 in volume, respectively. While the second system is an off-grid PV electrically driven DC compressor air-conditioning system. This system is a split air-conditioning unit with a cooling capacity of (26000 BTU) 7.62 kW that requires an input power of 1.8 kW with R410a (1550) refrigerant. Those solar-driven systems are compared with a grid connected AC driven vapor compression Air-Conditioning having 8 kW nominal cooling capacity. Experimental results show that the indoor thermal comfort conditions are achieved in the hottest days of the year for space with a floor area of 80 m2 with 14 residences for both systems. Comparison between the systems is based on the lifespan of 20 years, cooling capacity 8 kW and 18 hours' daily operation in the cooling session. The results clearly indicate that: Compared with conventional vapor AC driven air-conditioning system, the solar thermal driven cooling system has an energy consumption of 10.94%, with the Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) of 9.96% while the cost per kW cooling is higher by 295.96%, respectively. While, the off-grid PV driven DC air conditioning system has an energy consumption of 0%, with TEWI of 0.65% and cost per kW cooling is lower by 54.88%, respectively. Therefore, the off-grid PV electrically driven DC compressor air-conditioning system can be recommended for use in the residential sector based on its low cost per kW cooling, no grid energy consumption, and very low environmental impact on global warming. However, this system further cost reduction can be cut from the energy storage, battery subsystem, in case this system is on-grid connected. © 2017, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. © 2017, Institute of Problems of Mechanical Engineering.",,"Air conditioning; Arid regions; Cooling; Cost reduction; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Housing; Silica gel; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Water tanks; Air conditioning units; Comparative studies; Cost competitiveness; Evacuated tube solar collector; Indoor thermal comfort; Residential air conditioning; Residential sectors; Total equivalent warming impacts; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028979194

Mini-scale hydropower installations are environmentally-friendly technologies, unlike large hydroelectric power plants that have certain drawbacks from the environmental point of view. A safe and clean solution is the cross-flow turbine, but the commercial types require a minimum head, usually captured by additional hydro-technical works that can also damage the environment. In this context, a very good solution could be a low head turbine that has no adverse environmental impact, since no water storage is necessary. The objective of this paper is to investigate a cross flow pico-turbine prototype, in order to verify whether, when well designed, such a turbine can operate with good efficiencies at very low heads. The tests revealed good efficiencies of the turbine that are in the range of values calculated with the classical Hutton, Banki, and Sutton methods. However, unlike the classical methods, that predict an increase in efficiency as the head increases, the results presented in this paper suggest that, for cross-flow turbines designed for very low heads, the efficiency increases as the head decreases. This could be considered the most important result of this study. Numerical simulations were performed to get a better insight into the air-water two-phase flow inside the turbine operating at low heads. The results obtained suggest that air bubbles get entrapped into the blade channels during the first pass if the operating parameters are far from the rated ones. The results could be used as a recommendation for saving the hydraulic energy that is wasted in very low head hydraulic installations. By implementing the proposed cross-flow turbine in hybrid technologies or on irrigation open channels, the energy is produced using a sustainable solution that is able to protect the environment. © 2017, Gh.

Design/methodology/approach: The main objectives were achieved by using the methodology of a holistic multi-criteria approach. Electra method was applied. The design of the three projects on the international Danube River were analyzed, from technical, economical and environmental point of view, with the goal to manage a higher involvement of renewable resources. Findings: The results of the research imply that the most profitable technical solutions cannot reach its realization and construction if the environmental quality criteria are not fulfilled and included in the multi-criteria optimization model. At the same time, the most sustainable and environmentally friendly technical solutions, such as the renewable hydro pump storage scheme, cannot be realized without proper project management and investment. Research limitations/implications: The results and conclusions are valid for all the structures and projects of renewable resources, where there is a conflict to the environment. This research has implications to all decision-making processes focusing on holistic analyses of conflicted techno-economical and environmental parameters. Originality/value: The value of the paper and research is in proving the necessity of simultaneous analyses of technical, economical and environmental impacts on the projects.

The main sources of CO2 were from the combustion of fossil fuels, cement production, alcohol production, and wastewater treatment plants. The criteria used to assess the suitability of CO2 sources were: annual quantity of CO2 emitted; concentration of CO2 in the gas; CO2 source; distance to the electricity network; and distance to the gas network. The most suitable sources of CO2 were found to be distilleries, and wastewater treatment plants with anaerobic digesters. The most suitable source of CO2, a large distillery, could be used to convert 461 GWh/a of electricity into 258 GWh/a of methane. The total electricity requirement of this system is larger than the 348 GWh of renewable electricity dispatched down in Ireland in 2015. This could allow for the conversion of electricity that would be curtailed into a valuable energy vector. The resulting methane could fuel 729 compressed natural gas fuelled buses per annum.

In Europe, red cell concentrates (RCC) are usually stored in SAGM (saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol). During storage, in vitro red cell quality declines, including lowered energy status and increased cell lysis. Recently, several additive solutions (ASs), designed to diminish the decline in in vitro quality during storage, have been developed. These new solutions have mainly been developed to better maintain red blood cell (RBC) 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (2,3 BPG) levels and energy status during storage. High levels of 2,3 BPG allow for better oxygen release while high energy status is necessary for function and survival of RBC in vivo. In a paired study design, RBC ASs were compared for their ability to provide improved in vitro quality during hypothermic storage. Materials and methods. For each experiment, 5 whole blood units held overnight were pooled and split. The whole blood units were processed according to the buffy coat method. RBCs were resuspended in either SAGM, PAGGSM, PAG3M, E-Sol 5 or AS-7 and leucoreduced by filtration. RCCs were stored for eight weeks at 2-6 °C and sampled weekly for analysis of in vitro quality parameters. Results. Red cell concentrates stored in PAG3M, E-Sol 5 and AS-7 showed significantly higher lactate production and higher levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total adenylate. 2,3 BPG levels rapidly declined during storage in SAGM and PAGGSM. The decline in 2,3 BPG was inhibited during storage in E-Sol 5 and AS-7, while in PAG3M, 2,3 BPG level increased above the initial level till day 35 and remained detectable till day 56. Haemolysis was comparable for all ASs until day 35, upon prolonged storage, haemolysis in SAGM was higher than with the other ASs. As compared to SAGM, storage in PAGGSM, PAG3M, E-Sol 5 and AS-7 better maintained morphological properties. Discussion. Storage of RBCs in the new generation ASs yield RBCs with more stable metabolite levels and improved overall quality during storage as compared with RBCs stored in SAGM. © SIMTI Servizi Srl.","2,3 BPG; Additive solution; ATP; Glycolysis; Red blood cells","adenosine triphosphate; 2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid; adenine; glucose; guanosine; mannitol; PAGGS-M solution; Article; blood sampling; cell damage; cell pH; comparative study; cytolysis; echinocyte; erythrocyte concentrate; erythrocyte preservation; hemolysis; high performance liquid chromatography; in vitro study; mean corpuscular volume; blood storage; cell survival; cytology; drug effect; energy metabolism; erythrocyte; human; metabolism; procedures; time factor; 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate; Adenine; Blood Preservation; Cell Survival; Energy Metabolism; Erythrocytes; Glucose; Guanosine; Humans; Mannitol; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026681059

Wind traders are, therefore, interested in mitigating their trading risks in a number of ways. This work suggests addressing this issue in a comprehensive manner by coordinating the trading of wind resources with thermal resources and a pumped-hydro storage system (PHS) and co-optimizing the trading in energy and regulation markets. The trading strategy is modeled as a mixed integer linear stochastic program that takes into account several uncertain parameters, including wind power outputs, prices for energy, balancing, and regulation, and regulation deployments. In this optimization, the trader's attitude toward risks is controlled by using the metric of conditional value at risk (CVaR).

The heated vertical wall of the enclosure contains a 1 cm thickness layer of a phase change material (PCM), whereas the opposite one is cooled. The dimensions of the experimental air cavity are 10 cm × 10 cm with a width of 10 cm. The PCM layer, initially molten, is discharged in the air within the cavity. Temperature measurements were performed inside the air cavity as well as the PCM and the PCM/air interface during the charging and discharging processes. A numerical model based on the coupled Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the air inside the cavity and the PCM layer was developed to examine the perturbation of the phase change on heat transfer at the PCM/air interface. The results showed a notable disagreement between the calculated and measured temperature in the cavity and PCM, when the density change during the solidification process has not been taken into account. A new approach based on volume contraction during solidification has been proposed and successfully tested to overcome this issue. Moreover, the simulations demonstrated that the heat transfer in the cavity is affected significantly when the phase change occurs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Active wall; Energy management; Heat storage; Natural convection; Phase change material; Solidification phase front","Enclosures; Energy management; Heat storage; Natural convection; Phase change materials; Solidification; Temperature measurement; Active wall; Discharging process; Measured temperatures; Numerical and experimental study; Phase change material wall; Phase front; Solidification process; Volume contraction; Navier Stokes equations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026485234

The economic viability of two main scenarios (i.e. Large-scale WE development and island's IC with the ML grid, with or without local energy storage) is evaluated by calculating their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), while the influence of specific energy and financial parameters on the cost-effectiveness of each of the examined solutions is also investigated through a sensitivity analysis. According to the results obtained, the “costly” project of island's IC can turn into an economically attractive solution if it is combined with local large-scale WE development. Moreover, the addition of a Pumped-hydro Storage (PHS) unit is found to bring reductions in the WE rejected amounts, while part of energy imports from ML can be replaced by Hydro Turbine(s) (HTs) operation.

Calcium looping (CaL) is an emerging technology to capture carbon dioxide from flue gases of fossil fueled power plants exploiting the reversible gas-solid reaction between the carbon dioxide (CO2) and calcium oxide (CaO) to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in a fluidized bed. In this paper, the concept of calcium looping application using alternating fluidized beds is explored as well as a proposed scheme to allow smooth gas switching between reactors using an intermediate third reactor. The latter scheme enables energy saving as well. A dynamic model of a bubbling bed carbonator, the key reactor in the capture process, is presented. The model incorporates both hydrodynamics and chemical kinetics to provide more reliable predictions. The model has been validated with experimental results obtained at combustion lab, Mansoura University, Egypt using an atmospheric fluidized bed reactor of 10.5 cm inner diameter. The key parameters have been investigated to check for system sensitivity. Bed temperature has a non-monotonic effect on CO2 capture efficiency. Maximum CO2 capture efficiency was found to occur around a temperature of 675 °C. Capture efficiency increases with either decreasing fluidization velocity or increasing bed particle size due to enhanced mass transfer and increased residence time. These findings almost accord with published data. Also, the average CO2 capture efficiency was found to increase with increasing static bed height up to a certain limit. Further increase in bed height doesn't considerably affect the capture efficiency. The proposed model can be used as a design tool that would enable the optimization and commercialization of calcium looping. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Calcium looping; Carbon capture; Fluidized bed; Global warming","Bubble formation; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Dynamic models; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Atmospheric fluidized bed; Calcium looping; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Emerging technologies; Fluidization velocity; Fossil-fueled power plants; Mitigation strategy; System sensitivity; Fluidized beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024852086

Fresh yams are difficult to store and are subjected to post harvest losses during storage. These losses serve as an impetus for processing this staple food into a product of longer shelf life. Therefore, yam tubers are usually processed into dried ground yam which invariably makes it more stable with prolonged shelf life. The effect of blanching time and slice thickness on the proximate properties of dried ground yam was investigated from 'Ehuru' (Dioscorea rotundata). The yam was peeled, washed, sliced at 2, 3 and 4 mm thickness, blanched at 100°C for 5, 7 and 10 minutes, dried at 65°C and milled into flour. The proximate analyses of the dried ground yam samples were determined using (AOAC, 2005). A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. The data generated were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 95 % confidence level, to know if there are significant differences between the values of the proximate analyses for each sample of dried ground yam and the means were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test. The results showed that blanching time and slice thickness has significant effect (P < 0.05) on the moisture content, crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre, ash content and carbohydrate of the dried ground yam. © All Rights Reserved.","Blanching time; Dried ground yam; Proximate properties; Slice thickness",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024115790

The first part of the work was optimization of the geometry of the major components of an SCPP of 10 m height and 8 m collector diameter using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-CFX to study and improve the flow characteristics inside the SCPP. The collector inlet opening, the collector outlet height, the collector outlet diameter, the chimney divergence angle, chimney inlet opening and the diameter of the chimney were varied and optimum values that give the highest power were obtained. Based on the best configuration achieved for the 10 m high SCPP, a scaled down model of 1:2.5 was modeled and simulated. The 4 m tall SCPP had a collector diameter of 3.2 m. The collector outlet height was kept constant while the collector outlet diameter and the chimney throat diameter were varied in the second part. The collector inlet opening was also varied. The best configuration was then fabricated and extensive experiments were carried out on days of different solar insolations with and without water bags including the effect of atmospheric wind as the third and main part of this work. Detailed measurements of temperature variations along the collector and along the chimney height were performed. The air velocity at the location of turbine was measured and the power available to the turbine was estimated. It was found that, at higher wind speeds, the temperatures along the collector and along the chimney height drop a little; however, the air velocity and available power increase. Water bags were placed under the collector to obtain round-the-clock power. A 100 m SCPP was later modeled and simulated to predict the power available for bigger sized towers at different solar insolations. Such SCPP plants will be very appropriate for Pacific Island Countries; most of these countries have islands with populations of only a few hundred people. Also, the solar insolation is very high in these countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy storage; Experimental testing; Solar chimney power plant; Solar collector","Air; Chimneys; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Energy storage; Fluid dynamics; Incident solar radiation; Solar collectors; Solar radiation; Turbines; Water distribution systems; Atmospheric Winds; Collector diameters; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Experimental testing; Flow charac-teristics; Outlet diameters; Solar chimney power plant; Temperature variation; Solar chimneys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023605711

However, the random nature of these sources requires the development of sizing rules and the use of these systems for their exploitation. This article presents the results of a developed hybrid PV/wind optimization sizing method, taking into account the strong combination between the intermittent energy resource (solar and wind), the storage capacity and a given load profile. This optimization method is based on the use of metaheuristic techniques. These algorithms, often inspired by nature, are designed to solve complex optimization problems. Among the most recent metaheuristics, we used the Firefly Algorithm (FA), considering the Load Dissatisfaction Rate (LDR) criteria and the Electricity Cost (EC) indicator for power reliability and system cost. The suggested method determines the system optimum configuration, which can achieve the desired LDR with minimum EC. To achieve this aim, an objective function is formulated for the EC. It must be kept to a minimum while respecting the reliability constraints (LDRdesired).

In Indonesia, these potatoes are used as chips. Tuber is a plant organ that serve as storage organ for nutrient and it is used for survival during dry season. One way to increase production of potato is through induction of its tuber. Heading date gene 3a (Hd3a) is one of the genes that can regulate flowering time in rice. In addition to inducing flowering, this gene have proven to induce the formation of tuber in Andigena potato cultivar. In this study we introduced Hd3a gene under the control of 35S CaMV promoter into the IPB CP 1 potato cultivar to induce formation of its tubers. Genetic transformation was done by co-cultivation method using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 carrying Hd3a gene. From the transformation of 157 explants from internodes, we obtained 16.4% and 23.1% as value of transformation efficiency and regeneration efficiency respectively. Six putative transgenic shoots survive on callus induction medium containing 15mg/L of hygromycin antibiotic. Molecular analysis was carried out by using 35S-F primers and Hd-R primers to prove if Hd3a gene was integrated into IPB CP 1 potato. PCR analysis showed that all of the six putative transgenic IPB CP 1 potato contained the Hd3a gene under the control of 35S CaMV promoter.","Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Hd3a Gene; IPB CP1","hygromycin; 35S camv gene; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Article; callus (plant); coculture; cultivar; flowering; genetic transformation; heading date gene 3a; internode; ipb cp1 cultivar; nonhuman; plant gene; plant tuber; polymerase chain reaction; potato; promoter region; shoot; transgenic plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021992794

Design/methodology/approach - Visual inspection and light microscopy revealed the extent of damage exhibited by the panels. Standard metallographic techniques were used to prepare samples obtained from both unused and failed sections. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques were used to study the surface morphology, microstructural features, elemental composition and structure of the samples. Findings - The failure occurred in the form of delamination and blistering of coated layer. Presence of solar radiation, humidity and water retention resulted in loss of adhesion, leading to coating delamination and flaking especially at the top surface. The coating at the bottom surface of the panels showed evidence of blistering caused by water vapor differential that existed between the environment and the coating because of prolonged (four months) wet conditions that existed at the manufacturer's site during storage. Practical implications - It is recommended that the coated panels are stored in covered area where direct exposure to atmospheric conditions can be prevented. If open storage is unavoidable, then the use of tarpaulin or plastic sheet as covering and vapor-phase inhibitors was recommended. Originality/value - This paper provides an account of failure analysis of metal sheet panels. It identifies the mode and cause of failure and also provides recommendations to avoid such occurrences in the future. The information contained in this paper is useful for plant engineers and project managers working in the metal sheet industry. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blistering; Delamination; Failure analysis; Galvanized steel; Polyester coating; Scanning electron microscopy","Atmospheric humidity; Coatings; Delamination; Electron microscopy; Failure analysis; Galvanizing; Metal analysis; Metal working; Metallography; Microstructural evolution; Plastic sheets; Project management; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Blistering; Design/methodology/approach; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Galvanized steels; Metallographic technique; Microstructural features; Polyester coatings; X-ray diffraction techniques; Sheet metal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021729224

Primary data from the company was used as far as possible, complemented with secondary data from life cycle inventory databases, scientific publications and/or reports, and even from tools developed specifically for application in the wine sector. The sustainability evaluation was performed using several indicators, selected based on their relevance to the wine industry, but also considering the existing consensus in the area, including: carbon footprint, water consumption, energy intensity, material intensity, solid wastes and wastewater. Indicators values were calculated relatively to a functional unit of 0.75 L that represents the capacity of most wine bottles available in the market. Results show that bottling and storage have the highest contribution to carbon footprint, material intensity, solid wastes and wastewater. Viticulture is the life cycle stage with the largest contribution to water consumption mainly due to irrigation of vines. Results also show that winemaking is the life cycle stage with the largest contribution to energy intensity, mainly due to the transportation of grapes to the winery and of wine to the bottling facility, accounting for 94 % of this indicator value. Results can be used to identify hotspots in the production process where improvements are necessary or to compare the performance of different wines. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Bottles; Carbon footprint; Digital storage; Life cycle; Solid wastes; Stages; Sustainable development; Functional units; Life cycle inventory database; Life cycle stages; Life cycle thinking; Production process; Scientific publications; Sustainability evaluations; Water consumption; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021635373

Battery energy storage (BES) can take advantage of energy price arbitrage under favourable pricing regimes. However, the challenge is to what extent will the introduced policy favour the installation of BES at residential accommodations? The tools to assess suitability of installing BES exist but they come at a cost. In this study, we improved upon existing methodology and implemented it in Microsoft Excel to assess techno-economic viability and environmental benefits of using BES. The approach showed that none of the three BES technologies investigated was economically viable at the prevailing average rate of 0.1442 $/kWh for peak electricity. The Monte Carlo simulation implemented suggests that the minimum mean price of peak needed for the BES system to break even range between 0.2560 – 0.2919 $/kWh. At 50% discount in storage medium cost and 100% increase in the price of peak, the BES will only break even when the average price of peak is 0.2043 $/kWh at maximum cycling cost that range between 0.1077 – 0.1560 $/kWh. The study concluded that reduction in the cost of storage medium has more impact on economic viability than increasing only peak price of electricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; Energy storage; Environment; Probabilistic simulation; Techno-economics; Time-of-use","Demand side management; Economic analysis; Economics; Energy storage; Monte Carlo methods; Battery energy storages (BES); Environment; Environmental analysis; Probabilistic simulation; Residential accommodation; Techno-economics; Time of use; Time-of-use tariff rates; Costs; demand-side management; economic analysis; energy conservation; energy policy; environmental assessment; Monte Carlo analysis; simulation; technical efficiency; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021414229

The solar aggregate stockpiles in question are intended for use in industrial applications for the production of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). These tests aim to establish the difference in temperature of the mineral mixture with and without the effects of sunlight. For the purpose of this test, three test models of solar aggregate stockpiles and one reference model to simulate the conditions of uncovered and unprepared surface storage were constructed. All the solar models had consistent volumes, the same shape, thickness and type of brim heat insulation and orientation, where the only difference was the surface area of the glass opening designed to let through varying amounts of sunlight. For the purpose of this test, analysis was made of the heat build-up of the mineral mixture when exposed to sunlight, without exposure to sunlight at night, and the drop in temperature over several days when the mixture was not exposed to sunlight. The results of the test show that the increased opening area of the solar aggregate stockpiles and the use of solar models in themselves lead to increased heat accumulation of the mineral mixture and reduced heat loss during daytime and in other conditions when the mineral mixture is not exposed to sunlight. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Hot mix asphalt production; Solar aggregate stockpiles; Sun exposure","Aggregates; Asphalt; Minerals; Testing; Energy; Heat accumulation; Hot mix asphalt; Paper analysis; Reference modeling; Solar aggregate stockpiles; Sun exposures; Surface storage; Mixtures; asphalt; energy efficiency; experimental study; insulation; numerical model; radiation exposure; solar radiation; surface area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021292751

A stockpile established in early August in northern Finland was monitored for six months. Based on changes in the basic density of the chip samples, a dry matter loss of 2.6–2.8% occurred during the storage period, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two chip assortments. The dry matter loss derived from the CO2 effluxes was 1.3–1.5%. Even when capturing only about half of the carbon loss deduced from dry mass measurements, the CO2 measurements provided valuable information about decomposition dynamics in stockpiles. The CO2 flux rates were not static, but could differ by an order of magnitude, depending on the spatial location of flux measurement and the evolution of temperature conditions within the pile. Whole-tree chips generated more heat during the first two months after pile construction.

In this work, nanocomposite electrochromic supercapacitor electrodes were fabricated with silver nanowire (Ag NW) network electrodes and a green to transmissive electrochromic polymer, PDOPEQ. High transparency and conductivity of Ag NW network current collectors allowed the fabrication of electrochromic supercapacitors and investigation of the spectroelectrochemical and electrochemical properties of the PDOPEQ. Previously reported electrochromic properties such as long term electrochromic switching stability and vibrant color change for PDOPEQ were well transferred into electrochromic capacitors. Investigated electrochromic supercapacitors changed their color from vibrant green to transparent with superior characteristics. Specific capacitance of the fabricated nanocomposite electrodes was calculated as 61.5 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest capacity retention value was obtained upon 20000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.

The analysis is conducted based on techno-economic aspects, where the loss of load probability and life cycle cost are represented as technical and economic criteria, respectively. Various photovoltaic water pumping systems scenarios with initially full storage tank; battery and hybrid DG-PV energy source are proposed to analyze the feasibility of system. The result shows that the configuration of the PV array and the initial status of the storage tank are important variables to be considered. Moreover, the sensitivity of cost of unit for various PVPS components is studied. It is found that the cost of unit is more sensitive to the initial capital cost of photovoltaic array than other components. In this paper a standalone PV based pumping system with a PV array capacity of 2.4 kWp and a storage tank with a capacity of 80 m3 was proposed an a optimum system. The system with the aforementioned configuration pumps an average hourly water volume of approximately 3.297 m3 over one year with a unit of 0.05158 USD/m3.

However, little is known about the metabolic behaviour and ecological niche that each organism exhibits in mixed communities. In this study, an enriched culture of Tetrasphaera and Ca. Accumulibacter was obtained using casein hydrolysate as sole carbon source. This culture was able to achieve a high phosphorus removal efficiency (>99%), storing polyphosphate while consuming amino acids anaerobically. Microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridisation confirmed that more than 90% Tetrasphaera cells were responsible for amino acid consumption while Ca. Accumulibacter likely survived on fermentation products. Tetrasphaera performed the majority of the P removal (approximately 80%) in this culture, and batch tests showed that the metabolism of some carbon sources could actually lead to anaerobic orthophosphate (Pi) uptake (9.0 ± 2.1 mg-P/L) through energy generated by fermentation of glucose and amino acids. This anaerobic Pi uptake may lead to lower net Pi release to C uptake ratios and reduce the Pi needed to be removed aerobically in WWTPs. Intracellular metabolites such as amino acids, sugars, volatile fatty acids and small amines were observed as potential storage products, which may serve as energy sources in the aerobic phase. Evidence of the urea cycle was found, which could be involved in reducing the intracellular nitrogen content.

The bottleneck in these cycles is the gas turbine because the mass flow through the pressurized air receiver system and, therefore, the amount of thermal energy that can be used in the bottoming cycle, is limited to the maximum throughput of the turbine. The enhancement in the SUNDISC cycle is an additional low-pressure air receiver system that is uncoupled from the gas turbine and directly feeds the storage system or steam generator. Different variations of the cycle with separated and hybrid receiver systems are presented and selected operating modes are shown. The asynchronous power cycles and separated receiver systems allow for project-specific plant layout and operation. Annual simulations with an hourly thermodynamic model returned the lowest levelized cost for a plant generating electricity during 87% of the year practically without co-firing. During almost all of this time, one of the two cycles operates at full load. The large storage capacity needed for this baseload plant is viable because of the low anticipated cost of the rock bed thermal energy storage technology. The calculated levelized cost of this plant is 25% lower than for a plant without a low-pressure receiver and is predicted to be on a par with a next-generation molten salt plant's cost once medium-scale roll-out has commenced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Combined cycle; CSP; Rock bed storage; Solar air receiver; SUNDISC","Costs; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Solar energy; Steam generators; Thermal energy; Combined cycle; Concentrating solar power; Levelized costs; Maximum through-put; Pressurized air; Storage capacity; SUNDISC; Thermodynamic model; Gas turbines; electricity generation; energy conservation; integrated approach; photovoltaic system; solar power; thermal power; thermodynamics; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020385197

This technique aims to co-pelletize Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) primary sludge, and non-reactive fly ashes with high loss of ignition coming from an industrial coal chain-grate stoker boiler. This technique represents a synergistic opportunity to capitalize the heating power within each residue, in two main ways: first, pelletization on its own has proven benefits on energy densification, in terms of volume reduction for transport and storage; second, the reactivity of fly ashes increase with the volatile matter contribution of the primary sludge, improving the thermal properties of the mixture and its performance under combustion. The later was demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis of the different mixture ratios evaluated.

Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998–2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries.

To shed light on the chemical processes involved in redox thermochemical energy storage materials, in-situ powder diffraction was used in combination with atmospheric control to investigate the redox-reactions of Co3O4, MnO2 and PbO2 under various conditions. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry under the same conditions provided information on heat-flows and mass-changes. In contrast to theoretical thermodynamic considerations, only Co3O4 and Mn2O3/Mn3O4 (originating from MnO2) were found fully reversible. In the case of PbO2 for none of the numerous intermediate phases any kind of reversibility was observed. The effect of the O2-concentration in the reactive atmosphere was most distinct for the Mn2O3 system, notably affecting the reduction/oxidation temperatures, whereas for the Co3O4 system only a moderate influence of the O2 concentration was found. Based on the stability of the intermediate phases under various atmospheres, an isothermal TCES-cycle for Co3O4 and Mn2O3 was investigated, triggering the redox-process by an abrupt change of reactive-gas atmosphere. The fast reaction rate combined with a significant down-shift of the reaction temperatures compared to an isokinetic redox reaction suggests application as a chemical heat pump, as well towards a broadened operational profile not only in combination with concentrating solar power plants, but also with e.g. recycling of industrial flue gas heat. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Isothermal redox cycle; Metal oxide; Non-ambient P-XRD; Redox system; Thermochemical energy storage","Atmospheric temperature; Calorimeters; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Heat pump systems; Isotherms; Lead oxide; Manganese oxide; Metals; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Storage (materials); Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Concentrating solar power plant; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Isothermal redox cycles; Metal oxides; Reaction temperature; Redox systems; Situ powder diffractions; Thermochemical energy storage; Redox reactions; calorimetry; concentration (composition); copper compound; heat flow; isotherm; lead; manganese; oxide; reaction rate; redox conditions; storage; thermochemistry; thermodynamics; thermogravimetry; X-ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019892432

The dynamic growth of production, refining and consumption of crude oil, especially in the 1970s and 1980s was followed by and influenced the significantly higher growth rates of the gross domestic product than those occurred during the last years. Major oil companies were the leaders of the economic development on the global level, while at the local level such leaders are smaller national companies, such as INA Plc. and JANAF Plc. in Croatia. Oil economy developed in turbulent conditions of crude oil market with constant oscillations of crude oil prices, through adjustments to the challenges of implementing new energy policies and measures with regard to climate changes, political crises, and others. Over the last years, a stagnation in crude oil production and consumption has been observed on the global level (4,2 -4,3 billion tons), with a decline being recorded in the developed countries, while higher growth rates have been noticed in China, India and the emerging Asian economies. The beginnings of crude oil (exploration and production) in Croatia dated back to the first half of the 19th century and the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (refineries) respectively. The bloom of the Croatian oil economy during the 1970s and 1980s was marked by the crude oil production hitting a record high of 3,1 mil. tons (in 1981) in comparison with the present 613 thousand tons (in 2015) and refining of an all-time high amounting to 9,2 mil. tons (in 1979) as compared to the present 3,5 mil. tons. Croatia contributes with 0,145 pro mille in the global oil production and with 0,862 pro mille in the global oil consumption. Further development and globalisation of oil sector may occur through intensifying the activities on crude oil exploration and production both in Croatia and abroad, but also along with the refineries modernization and increase of share on both domestic and foreign markets. Crude oil transport followed the development of crude oil refining on the domestic market, and especially on the foreign markets of the countries of South-Eastern and Central Europe, with the highest transport of 9,7 mil. tons being achieved in 1990, as compared to 6,2 mil. tons in 2015, with the growth trend being observed owing to increase in transport for foreign refineries and their diversification of crude oil imports from the Omišalj direction. The diversification strategy directed towards storage of crude oil and petroleum products further supports the growth of oil companies and Croatian economy as well. The Croatian oil economy will still remain under the influence of volatile oil market characterised by: price volatility, global trend of reducing the petroleum products consumption, stricter regulations and quality standards, policies and measures for enhancing the security of supply, growing costs and investments together with pressures of reducing prices, growth trend of imports and competitiveness of petroleum products, diversification of supply sources and routes and other. Therefore, continuous adjustments are necessary, as well as prompt responses to challenges and development of new strategies for diversification and growth. © 2017, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ekonomista.

The water content drops during hop cone drying from the original approx. 80% of moisture to 8 or 10%. The drying medium is heated air, and the maximum drying temperatures range between 55 °C and 60 °C, remaining practically stable for the entire duration of drying. Hops are exposed to these temperatures for 6 to 8 hours. The current old and ageing belt dryers record large losses. Their modernisation and particularly new drying technologies need to derive from perfect knowledge of thermal characteristics of materials and drying devices. The drying process and the actual implementation necessarily depend on the knowledge of the entire process calculation that is why the paper introduction outlines simplified issues concerning a ‘theoretical dryer’ following the h-x chart. An experimental measurement was carried out in an operating belt dryer. It included measurements of the drying medium thermal and moisture parameters and of the drying hop qualitative parameters. These drying parameters were monitored by means of continuously recording data loggers and of a laboratory analysis of the samples (hop moisture content, alpha bitter acids, Hop Storage Index). The drying process revealed that hops are practically dry (10 ± 2.0% of moisture content) already at the end of the second belt or possibly at the beginning of the third belt. It was also proven that hops are excessively dried (moisture content of 4 to 8%), adjusted to their final moisture of 8–10% through conditioning. Excessive drying results in considerate hop-cone shatter which makes the hop manipulation difficult during further processing, leading to larger losses of lupulin. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

In this paper, the influence of porous media on the performance of a double pass hybrid PV/thermal air collector was achieved by building an experimental set-up for this purpose. The study showed that using porous media expanded the area of heat transfer and thus increased the thermal efficiency and temperature of the exit air from the hybrid solar collector. The compound efficiency was increased (3%) after using the porous medium in the lower ducts of the double-pass hybrid collector. At the same time, the pressure drop was increased after using the porous media. In this analysis, it was concluded that the hybrid solar collector with porous media and glass cover is more thermally efficient than the other design form. The results showed a rise in the electrical efficiency with the increase of the fluid flow rate. This increase in the value of the electrical efficiency was due to the higher volumetric air flow which enhanced the PV panel cooling. Also, the results displayed that fixing a glass layer on the hybrid collector caused the rise in thermal efficiency and reduction in the electrical efficiency of the hybrid collector.

Two of the main parameters affecting the behavior of these plants are the collection area and the water storage volume. In this paper, an energy performance model of an FPSWC plant is used along with genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize the combination of these two parameters in order to produce the maximum life-cycle savings (LCS). This model is applied to 182 locations in Chile and 6 consumption profiles with the purpose of creating a solar map for this kind of plant throughout the country. The financial results show that the installation of an optimized FPSWC plant is convenient in all the analyzed locations. Furthermore, results are noteworthy in the northern zone of Chile with respect to the others due to excellent meteorological conditions. A sensitivity analysis was carried out at the locations with higher and lower LCS, showing that consumption temperature mainly affects zones with higher radiation. This study allows us to provide evidence that the utilization of FPSWC plants should be promoted in order to induce rapid growth and development of this important technology in Chile. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Flat-plate solar water collector; Genetic algorithm; Life cycle savings; Solar potential","Genetic algorithms; Sensitivity analysis; Solar equipment; Collection areas; Energy performance; Financial results; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Life cycle savings; Meteorological condition; Solar potential; Solar water collectors; Location; energy efficiency; energy use; genetic algorithm; installation; life cycle analysis; model test; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; solar power; temperature; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019562191

The other proposal is employing the TES as the combustion chamber of an Erickson cycle for energy storage applications (ECB).

All of the three systems are designed for a 100 MWp wind power in Denmark as the case study. Although it is demonstrated that the application of the ECB system is limited to locations with high heating demand, it outperforms both of the RCB systems due to its very fast response and also the high efficiency that it offers.

There are a lot of researches on renewable energy; one of the most prominent is the development of bioethanol as a result of fermentation of the sugar. One of the most abundantly available sugar sources in Indonesia is the palmyra sap. Palmyra sap from palmyra tree (Borassus flabelliffer) is a seasonal and low priced drinking juice in tropical countries such as Indonesia and it is highly available in a coastal area of Indonesia. Currently in Indonesia, ethanol is mainly produced from molasses or cassava which can hamper the needs of crop plants. Palmyra sap can be used as a cheap alternative of ethanol feed stock and in the same time can enhance its economic value. Conventional fermentation is usually carried out with the help of Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but recent study shows that Gram-negative bacteria Zymomonas mobilis could be a promising alternative of fermentative microorganism. This research aims to determine and compare physical parameters needed in the fermentation of palmyra sap by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis to obtain optimum concentration of ethanol. Using a batch fermentation process in a 1.8 L bioreactor with 1 L working volume, these microorganisms were cultivated in sterilised palmyra sap and the different physical parameters applied are pH and inoculum concentration. Response surface methodology was generated based on the result of 13 runs generated by central composite design (CCD). Response surface methodology was applied to determine the optimum conditions for the maximum yield of ethanol with the variation of temperature and pH. The highest yield of ethanol concentration using Saccharomyces cerevisiae was obtained at pH 5.05 with inoculum concentration of 3,973,760 cell.mL-1/gL-1glucose. The model showed that the value of R2 (0.9201) was high and from ANOVA analysis the model is said to be significant. Highest concentration of ethanol obtained by fermentation is 85.68 g/L, with yield of 0.49 and error compared to predicted value is 9.05 %. The highest yield of ethanol concentration using Zymomonas mobilis was obtained at pH 5.57 with inoculum concentration of 2,660,000 cell.mL-1/g.L-1glucose. The model showed that the value of R2 (0.9290) was high but analysis of ANOVA shows that the model is not significant. Highest concentration of ethanol obtained by fermentation is 12.75 g/L, with yield of 0.49 and error compared to predicted value is 0.65 %. The study concluded that fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae gives better model of optimisation but Zymomonas mobilis gives better result of ethanol production.

Then, we explain non-linear programming models that we developed for obtaining operating policies with different characteristics. We evaluate and compare the operating policies through a case study. Policies characterized by dynamic end-of-month storage levels are shown to perform much better than the policy with an optimal static end-of-month storage level, and it has been further shown that the dynamic policies perform quite close to the theoretical upper bound.

For design and operation purposes, it is important to develop computational tools that can represent energy fluxes at the interface between the bottom of the pond and the ground beneath it. In this study, a robust one-dimensional transient model is developed to represent the thermal evolution of a salt-gradient solar pond and the ground that surrounds it. The model was evaluated under different contrasting scenarios: buried or unburied ponds, artificially or naturally heated ponds and for deep or shallow groundwater tables. Experimental data from an indoor laboratory-scale solar pond were used for the development, calibration and validation of the model. A good agreement between experimental and modeled results was observed, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.21 °C and 1.54 °C for the upper and lower convective zones respectively, during a 28-days validation period. Further, the model was validated using experimental data from three outdoor salt-gradient solar ponds obtaining RMSEs that ranged between 1.5 and 6.5 °C. Results show that dividing the ground into multiple layers contributes to the robustness of the model, as it allows the representation of the ground heat storage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ground heat storage; Solar energy; Solar pond; Transient model","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Groundwater; Heat storage; Lakes; Mean square error; One dimensional; Ponds; Solar energy; Calibration and validations; Ground heat storage; Lower convective zones; Root mean square errors; Salt gradient solar pond; Shallow groundwater tables; Temperature prediction; Transient model; Solar ponds; design method; energy flux; equipment; experimental study; heat balance; indoor air; model validation; numerical model; one-dimensional modeling; operations technology; pond; prediction; solar activity; solar power; temperature effect; thermal evolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019369171

Results show that both SiS and SiSe have large adsorption energies towards single Na atom of −0.94 and −0.43 eV, owing to the charge transfers from Na to SiS or SiSe. In addition, it is found that the highest Na concentration for both SiS and SiSe is x = 1 with the chemical formulas of NaSiS and NaSiSe, corresponding to the high theoretical specific capacities for Na storages of 445.6 and 250.4 mAh g−1, respectively. Moreover, Na diffusions are very fast and show strong directional behaviors on SiS and SiSe monolayers, with the energy barriers of only 0.135 and 0.158 eV, lower than those of conventional anode materials for Na-ion batteries such as Na2Ti3O7 (0.19 eV) and Na3Sb (0.21 eV).

The negative ΔG° rxn values showed that oxidation of fuel through hydroperoxidation is a spontaneous process. It was shown that the bridgehead carbon atoms and the carbon atoms that link the norbornane structure with the other ring system are the vulnerable centers to hydroperoxidation because the corresponding hydroperoxides are quite low in total electronic energies. The thermodynamic calculations showed that these hydroperoxide structures may rearrange themselves to minimize their energy forming different molecules. These rearranged molecules have been identified using rearrangement mechanism in the literature. The probable rearrangement products were determined and confirmed by thermodynamic calculations.

The improved still is incorporated with a latent heat thermal energy storage medium and a parabolic solar concentrator. A parabolic solar concentrator was added to concentrate and increase the amount of solar irradiance absorbed by the still basin. Paraffin wax was applied as phase change material (PCM) in the solar still bottom plate. In the current study also, the effect of impure water profundity inside the still on still's accumulated yield have been assessed. The following study involved a mathematical analysis for calculation of the exergetic proficiency as an efficient tool for the optimization, and yield evaluation of any energy systems and solar stills as well. Experimental research conducted in steady days of summer and winter at six different values of impure water profundity inside the solar still basin. The salinity of the impure water tested was about 3000–5000 ppm, while the salinity for the resulted drinkable water was about 550–500 ppm. The performed outcomes revealed that during summer, exergetic efficiency is higher than its qualified value in winter with approximately (10–15%) for the same water profundity. Results also disclosed that, the exergetic efficiency is higher when the water profundity in the basin is lower with approximately (6–9%). The experimental findings reveals that, the solar still with PCM and parabolic concentrator is higher in the daily freshwater yield in summer with an amount of (55–65%) and in winter with an amount of (35–45%) compared to the usual solar based still.

Both the rising share of renewable-based electricity (characterised by intermittent production) and increasing energy efficiency in buildings induce a reconsideration of the traditional role of conventional power plants coupled with district heating systems along with its impact on the energy system. Moreover, the price of electricity determined by the merit-order system additionally decreases the load factor of such plants, making them less competitive or even inflicting financial loss in operation. Research presented in this paper focuses on a novel approach towards conventional combined heat and power (CHP) plants coupled with district heating systems. It involves an analysis of dynamical performances of the district heating system – capability of energy accumulation and thermal inertia – in order to assess its potential to become part of ancillary services. It is concluded that the district heating system, i.e. network of pipelines can be considered as dynamical thermal energy storage in which excess energy can be stored during operation of the CHP plant. A comprehensive analysis of dynamic behaviour of the district heating system has been performed by means of a mathematical model developed as a part of this research. The model is implemented on a theoretical case consisting of a simplified district heating system with three final users and the pipeline network of 9000 m in length. The simulation has shown that the storage capacity of the network depends on the thermal load in the network and in such circumstances specific thermal capacity of the network amounts to 10.1 Wh/(km). If the thermal load is decreased by 13% at the peak the accumulation capability is decreased by 40%. Moreover, the thermal capacity of the network increases up to 13.7 Wh/(km) as the pipeline length declines to 1000 m which is characteristic of densely populated areas. The capability of energy accumulation is explored for different parameters, such as: external temperature, distance of the network, supply water temperature etc. It is shown that distance of final users from CHP plant has certain impact on the operation strategy as well. Final users closer to the CHP plant determines operation strategy in the case of short-term disturbances in heat supply, while the farther ones in the case of long-term disturbances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CHP; District heating; Dynamical thermal storage; Mathematical modelling; Operation strategies","Cogeneration plants; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Losses; Mathematical models; Pipelines; Thermal load; Combined heat and power; Conventional power plants; District heating system; Energy efficiency in buildings; Multi Criteria Analysis; Operation strategy; Supply water temperature; Thermal storage; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018745306

The supply-side changes are expected to cause large short-term electricity price volatility. More frequent periods of low electricity prices may mean that electric use in flexible heating systems will become more profitable, and such flexible heating systems may, in turn, improve the integration of increasing shares of VRE. The objective of this study is to analyze the likely future of Nordic electricity price levels and variations and how the expected prices might affect the use of electricity and thermal storage in heatonly district heating plants. We apply the North European energy market model Balmorel to provide scenarios for future hourly electricity prices in years with normal, high, and low inflow levels to the hydro power system. The simulation tool energy PRO is subsequently applied to quantify how these electricity price scenarios affect the hourly use of thermal storage and individual boilers in heat-only district heating plants located in Norway. The two studied example plants use wood chips or heat pump as base load representing common technologies for district heating in Norway. The Balmorel results show that annual differences in inflow is still a decisive factor for Norwegian and Nordic electricity prices in year 2030 and that short-term (daily) price variability is expected to increase. In the plant-level simulations, we find that tank storage, which is currently installed in only a few district heating plants in Norway, is a profitable flexibility option that will significantly reduce the use of fossil peak load in both biomass and heat-pump-based systems. Installation of an electric boiler in addition to tank storage is profitable in the heat pump system due to the limited capacity of the heat pump. Electricity will hence, to a large extent, replace gas when heat demand exceeds the capacity of the heat pump. For the bio-based plant, we find that an electric boiler in addition to tank storage is not profitable in the normal electricity price scenario. The electric boiler investments are only profitable when electricity prices are as low as in the high inflow scenario. In that case the electric boiler will provide 17% of the heat supply in the example plant. Fuel prices for peak load and electricity grid tariffs are found to be decisive factors for the electricity use and therefore flexibility options provided by heat-only district heating plants. © 2017, Aalborg University press.

In such a model, the range of human consciousness is a function of the bandwidth of mind in the frequency domain. The hypothesis emerges from an integration of two paradigms: (1) the holonomic mind/brain theory of Karl Pribram, and (2) the ontological interpretation of quantum theory by David Bohm. The composite model, known as the Pribram-Bohm holoflux hypothesis, addresses observed phenomena of non-locality, both spatially and temporally. Holoflux is a term suggested by Karl Pribram to describe David Bohm's ""holomovement"" of information-energy cycling between an outer explicate order and an interior implicate order. Bohm concluded that consciousness will eventually be found as primary within the actuality of the implicate order. Pribram's decades of laboratory data, collected over the course of decades, convinced him that memory storage and retrieval follows a holographic Fourier process of transformation between frequency and time domains (i.e., simultaneous resonance between frequency spectra observed within the implicate and explicate orders). This Pribram-Bohm composite holoflux theory is congruent with established principles of radio communication engineering. In Bohm's explicate space-time domain, the holoflux spectra manifest as electromagnetic shells of information, or isospheres. Each isosphere has a unique tunable wavelength equal to its diameter, and each isosphere is separated by one Plancklength. Information imprinted on the holosphere resonates with the nonlocal holoflux within the implicate order. This is outside of space-time, located at the bottom of space, and beginning below 10-35 m. Extending the panpsychist paradigm that consciousness is inherent in the structure of the universe, the holoflux theory describes a single, dynamic, nondual but tunable energy. This energy cycles mathematically, in a lens-like process of transformation between the two domains, the explicate order and the implicate order. © 2017 Shelli R.

The electrode materials (nanostructures of polyaniline-carbon nanotubes, PANI-CNT) were supported on carbon cloth acting as current collector. PANI-CNT nanostructures were synthesized through an oxidative polymerization process in the monomer (aniline) acid solution with the presence of a surfactant and the addition of multi-walled CNT. The CNT were used with and without pretreatment. The cells electrolyte was H2SO4 0.5 M and the selected potential range was 1 V. In order to test their behavior, the different cells configurations were evaluated by electrochemical techniques. Polyaniline nanostructures and polyaniline-carbon nanotubes nanocomposites were used to make the negative and/or positive electrodes of the cell. The cathode in the asymmetric supercapacitors was always carbon cloth/carbon black. The behavior of the arrayed supercapacitors was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, between 0.0 and 1.0 V at different scan rates (10–100 mVs−1), as well as with galvanostatic charge/discharge runs at current densities between 0.3 and 6.7 mAcm−2.

CSP significantly lags behind solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power by cumulative capacity and cost for a number of reasons including the complicated nature of the technology and the traditional inability of the technology to be economically viable at smaller scales. The scaling limitation itself has prevented the technology from learning faster due to limited market share, which has inhibited the learning rate and continued to make CSP project financing difficult due to finance quantum risks. CSP has limited but successful lifecycle experience due to the SEGS I–IX plants commissioned between 1985 and 1990 in California. More recently, the technology benefited from competitive tariffs before the adoption of PV and learning rates undermined its growth. PV (as with wind) now offers some of the lowest electricity generating rates of any technology. While this is valuable, the marginal value of intermittent renewables is roughly inversely proportional to their share of the electricity system as their capacity credit diminishes with each addition to capacity, all other things equal. CSP with storage has the ability to flexibly deliver electricity and to do so 24 h a day in the right conditions. CSP plants with up to 15 h of full-load storage have now been commissioned and are demonstrating initial evidence that they can deliver to expectation. Despite the proposed value of CSP, it is not penetrating the market as expected. The value of electricity has simply not been valued for instance in the U.S. market to date, which has valued renewable targets above capacity needs. Sunny developing countries have been identified as potential growth markets due to capacity constraints and the avoided cost of electricity. Most recently, China has embarked on the greatest capacity growth of CSP in the decision to commission around 5 GW of CSP within the next 5 years with 1.35 GW assigned to be online by the end of 2018. Even with this evolution, CSP will still significantly lag other renewables. This review covers the system value and progress of CSP. An overall description of CSP and its value is followed by a broad review of CSP experience and research. A review of CSP in energy systems analysis is then provided to expose and quantify the marginal value of CSP. It is argued that improved quantification and accuracy in terms of energy systems analysis is an important step for CSP growth. The findings from the review show that CSP has potential to be the backbone of future electricity systems, but it needs to demonstrate value and acceptance to a broader audience than might be expected to achieve this. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CSP; Energy system analysis; Progress; Techno-economic; Value","Commerce; Competition; Developing countries; Engineering education; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Systems analysis; Wind power; Concentrating solar power; Energy system analysis; Intermittent renewables; Nature of the technologies; Progress; Renewable energy technologies; Techno-economics; Value; Constraint satisfaction problems; economic analysis; energy resource; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017526121

The delivery of low- or nearly zero-energy retrofits is highly dependent on technical expertise, adoption of new materials, methods of construction and innovative technologies. Future Irish national building regulations will adopt the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive vision of retrofitting existing buildings to higher energy efficiency standards. Construction industry stakeholders are key for the achievement of energy performance targets. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to assess the attitudes, approaches and experiences of Irish construction professionals regarding energy efficient buildings, particularly nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a series of quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey, a workshop and detailed interviews with professionals in the retrofit industry. The structure of this approach was informed by preliminary data and information available on the Irish construction sector. Findings: There is a substantial amount of ambiguity and reluctance among the professionals in reaching the Irish nZEB targets. The growing retrofit industry demonstrates low-quality auditing and pre/post-retrofit analysis. Basic services and depth of retrofits are compromised by project budgets and marginal profits. Unaligned value supply chain, poor interaction among nZEB professionals and fragmented services are deterrents to industry standardisation. Practical implications: This study will enable construction industry stakeholders to make provisions for overcoming the barriers, gaps and challenges identified in the practices of the retrofit projects. It will also inform the formulation of policies that drive retrofit uptake. Social implications: This study has implications for understanding the social barriers existing in retrofit projects. Support from clients/owners has a diverse impact on energy performance and retrofit decisions. Community-based initiatives are key to unlock the promotion of nZEBs. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of current activities of retrofit professionals and analyses the barriers, gaps and challenges in the industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction professionals; Energy efficiency; Nearly zero-energy buildings; Retrofit industry; Stakeholders","Budget control; Building codes; Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Digital storage; Energy policy; Retrofitting; Supply chains; Construction professionals; Design/methodology/approach; Energy efficiency standards; Energy efficient building; Energy performance of buildings; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Stakeholders; Zero energy building (ZEB); Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017321259

Two storage ratings are essential to time-shift delivery of electricity to loads: electric power, or instantaneous electricity flow [W], and electric energy, or power integrated over time [Wh]. An optimal storage portfolio is likely composed of multiple technologies, each having specific power and energy ratings. This paper derives and explains the link between the shape of the time-varying demand and generation profiles and the amount of desirably installed storage capacity, both energy and power. An analysis is performed for individual storage technologies first, showing a link between the necessary power and energy capacity and the demand and generation profile. Then combinations of storage technologies are analyzed to reveal their mutual interaction in a storage portfolio. Results show an increase in desirability for storage technologies with low cost power ratings when the mismatch between generation and demand occurs in daily to weekly cycles. Storage technologies with low cost energy ratings are preferred when this mismatch occurs in monthly to seasonal cycles.

For that purpose, we proposed in this work an active management algorithm to predict the need in terms of the power to be injected by a High Voltage/Medium Voltage substation for every single feeder issued from this substation. We apply it on a medium voltage feeder, considering that this feeder contains a photovoltaic installation and a storage system. The developed algorithm will allow us to underpin the forecast accuracy results through the adoption of many approaches. Those approaches aim to adjust the load demand forecast, ensure a reliable photovoltaic power production prediction, estimate the technical losses of the system and manage economically and optimally the energy flow in the battery storage bank. The present study will permit, from the one hand, to minimize energy losses in a grid connected distributed generations. The latter can be realized by managing in advance the energy flow between the different medium voltage feeders and substations for each region. Then, predict the whole energy production from conventional sources at the National Dispatching level. From the other hand, it will allow us satisfy load demand while avoiding peaks and rising the electrical devices lifetime by optimizing the number of operations on the network and forecasting the different suitable regulations. To succeed those objectives, we tried to find the best way to minimize the prediction error of our model. We exclusively adopt a particular approach to define each key performance indicator. We cite mainly the estimation of the technical losses in distribution and production segments, separately, the forecast of the load demand by considering the impact of weather conditions, the evaluation of the impact of cloud motion on PV panels and finally integrating those parameters into a MPC to enhance the accuracy of the transformer output prediction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy flow; Energy losses; Forecast; Medium voltage feeder; Model predictive control; Photovoltaic system; Storage system; Technical losses","Benchmarking; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Energy dissipation; Feeding; Model predictive control; Photovoltaic cells; Predictive control systems; Energy flow; Medium voltage; Photovoltaic systems; Storage systems; Technical loss; Forecasting",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016391120

It is a double-pipe unit with a helical fin attached to the inner tube in which a heat-transfer fluid (HTF) flows. Experiments in the unit are performed both for regular conditions, when its shell is exposed to ambient air, and for a slightly heated shell which allows to achieve close-contact melting (CCM). It is clearly shown that CCM in the suggested unit is possible and shortens the melting time by a factor of three. In addition to the experimental demonstration, the paper includes comprehensive modeling of the unit. Both analytical and numerical models are included, describing the phenomenon of close-contact melting on a helical surface. The analytical model, made possible under the assumption that the fin is isothermal, accounts for other main features of the process and also reveals its governing dimensionless parameters, including the Fourier, Stefan, Archimedes and Prandtl numbers, along with the group representing the unit geometry. The numerical model includes a complete solution for the time-dependent fin temperature distribution, and can account also for the sensible heat of the PCM. A very good agreement of the numerical predictions and experimental findings is achieved. Then, a dimensional analysis, based on the analytical model, is applied to the numerical results. Generalized behavior is obtained for such parameters as the temperature difference between the heat-transfer fluid and the PCM, and the helical fin pitch. The analysis is then extended to a non-isothermal fin, suggesting an additional physically-meaningful dimensionless group which completely generalizes the results for different fin radii, fin thicknesses and fin-to-PCM volume ratios. It is argued that the suggested configuration may have a number of advantages in comparison with the existing fin-array systems. These advantages include enhanced melting, prevention of increased pressures in melting (or solidification if the material is anomalous like water) and voids in solidification, and highly-convenient handling and maintenance of the system. Also, the helical fin might be attached to the outer tube (shell), and a configuration in which the HTF flows across the shell is possible while preserving all important features of the unit explored. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Close-contact melting; Heat storage; Helical fin; Modeling; PCM","Analytical models; Fins (heat exchange); Heat storage; Heat transfer; Isotherms; Latent heat; Melting; Metal melting; Models; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Shells (structures); Solidification; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Analytical and numerical models; Contact melting; Dimensionless parameters; Experimental demonstrations; Helical fin; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Latent heat thermal energy storage systems; Temperature differences; Numerical models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016277548

It is the first time this approach is used to quantify the effects of these policy actions on cost-optimal investments and operations. To consider the uncertainty of the energy market, we analyse the policy actions under four different price developments for biomass, fossil fuels and electricity. The results demonstrate that our stochastic approach provides different model decisions compared to the traditional deterministic approach. Further, we show that the future role of the large hydro reservoirs in Norway and Sweden depends both on the adopted policy actions and on future energy prices, and that the policy actions have a significant impact on the development of the energy system.

The proposed model not only determines the optimal number of PV modules and batteries but also assesses the economic feasibility of the system through annualized cost. The model takes into account site-specific data in finding the optimal sizes. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed through a case study in Bursari, Nigeria. The result obtained from the model reveals that establishing a solar PV system is not only environmentally friendly but also about 30% cheaper than the diesel generators that are currently in use at Bursari.

Most of today's operating nuclear reactor systems are producing saturated steam at relatively low pressure. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency. Superheating of nuclear steam with solar thermal energy has the potential to overcome this drawback. Accordingly, an innovative configuration of a hybrid nuclear-CSP plant is assembled and simulated. It brings together pressurized water reactor and solar tower. The solar heat is transferred to nuclear steam to raise its temperature. Continuous superheating is provided through thermal energy storage. The results from design point calculations show that solar superheating has the potential to increase nuclear plant electric efficiency significantly, pushing it to around 37.5%. Solar heat to electricity conversion efficiency reaches unprecedented rates of 56.2%, approaching the effectiveness of the modern combined cycle gas turbine plants. Off-design model was used to simulate 24-h operation for one year by simulating 8760 cases. Due to implementation of thermal energy storage non-stop operation is manageable. The increased efficiency leads to solar tower island installed cost reductions of up to 25% compared to the standalone CSP plant, particularly driven by the smaller solar field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrated solar power; Electric efficiency; Hybrid plant; Small modular reactors; Steam superheating","Combined cycle power plants; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar heating; Steam; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Combined cycle gas turbine plants; Concentrated solar power; Electric efficiency; Hybrid plants; Small modular reactors; Solar tower power plants; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermodynamic efficiency; Pressurized water reactors; electricity; energy efficiency; energy planning; heating; innovation; nuclear power plant; solar power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014950509

As wind power fluctuates sharply, there may be either surplus power or electricity deficit relative to the local demand. Thus, storing the surplus electricity and reclaiming it in demand times can increase the power plant incomes and reliability. On the other hand, as Denmark is one of the countries in which energy consumers are supplied by district heating, the demand for efficient and reliable heat production systems is also high.

In this methodology, the size of the solar field, the fossil fill fraction of backup system and full load hours of storage are optimized for the minimum LCOE using the concept of solar multiple. Moreover, different models, technologies and scenarios for parabolic trough and central tower receiver power plant are presented. LCOE presents a basis of comparison for weighted average costs of different power generation technologies. It is clearly shown that the solar power plant based on central receiver tower technology with 48% of backup system and 8 h of storage is the most attractive and optimum plant.

The coupling has been considered of surplus renewable power with sewage sludge gasification and renewable syngas storage. High quality syngas produced with power support can be introduced into a gas distribution network or stored and utilized on site. Both systems enable gas consumption at power and heat demand periods. The efficiency of power conversion to syngas produced from high moisture sewage sludge has been studied using a developed equilibrium thermodynamic model for the gasification process providing the calculated prediction of the syngas amount and composition. Furthermore, the total energy efficiency has been studied of the syngas production and utilization system. The results show that the optimum scenario to get syngas suitable to introduce into a natural gas distribution network would be to gasify sewage sludge with 35–40 wt.% moisture, while the optimal parameter for syngas to be valorized onsite is, in terms of efficiency, with SS dried to 20 wt.% of moisture content.

The exact mechanism by which the reduced activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, in response to RTC-1, promotes these improved metabolic parameters remains to be established. Through extensive in vitro analysis, new molecular insights into these downstream signalling pathways have been obtained. RTC-1-induced inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase was found to promote glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes in vitro, through the activation of the Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), in response to the increased activity of Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). RTC-1-induced phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in vitro, was associated with a decrease in lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and murine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The novel compound also prevented tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced insulin resistance and demonstrated insulin sensitising effects in C2C12 myotubes. Taken together, these results present a systematic analysis of the signalling mechanisms responsible for the potent anti-diabetic and anti-obesogenic effects of this modulator of mitochondrial function, strengthening the potential use of such compounds for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). © 2017","Akt; AMPK; Insulin resistance; Lipid accumulation; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","4 (thiophen 2 yl) 1 [4 [4 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperazin 1 yl]butan 1 one; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; antidiabetic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; metformin; oxidoreductase; protein kinase B; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; wortmannin; enzyme inhibitor; piperazine derivative; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); RTC-1 compound; thiophene derivative; tumor necrosis factor; adipocyte; animal cell; Article; cell energy; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme substrate; female; glucose transport; in vitro study; insulin resistance; lipid storage; mesenchymal stroma cell; mouse; myotube; nonhuman; signal transduction; 3T3 cell line; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; energy metabolism; lipid metabolism; 3T3-L1 Cells; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Electron Transport Complex I; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Piperazines; Thiophenes; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013887770

Rock bed using air as heat transfer fluid (HTF) is being now used for thermal energy storage (TES) in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. It is considered as a cost effective storage system. However, no detailed works have been published on selection and identification of rocks for high temperature storage applications. The scope of the present study is to choose the most suitable rocks for high temperature sensible heat storage (SHS) using a methodology based on laboratory measurements. Thus, experimental characterization of several rock types has been performed. An experimental device has been made for thermal conductivity measurement at room temperature. The obtained results show that the gabbro rock is the best candidate material for CSP plants. Comparative study with some other conventional materials found in literature indicates that rock is an efficient filler material for high temperature TES.

Insertion of a TiO2 thin film between STO layers increases the linearity of the capacitance in response to an applied voltage, to meet the increasing demand of large-capacitance-density dynamic random access memory capacitors. Both STO and TiO2 suffer from the problem of high leakage current owing to their almost equivalent and low bandgap energies. To overcome this, the thickness of the thin TiO2 film sandwiched between the STO films was varied. A magnetron sputtering system equipped with radio frequency and direct current power supply was employed for depositing the thin films. TiN was deposited as the top and bottom metal electrodes to form a metal-insulator metal (MIM) structure, which exhibited a very large linear capacitance density of 21 fF/um2 that decreased by increasing the thickness of the TiO2 film. The leakage current decreased with an increase in the thickness of TiO2, and for a 27-nm-thick film, the measured leakage current was 2.0×10-10 A.

PCMs can be classified as organic, inorganic and eutectic. Such materials present some limitations, including subcooling, phase segregation, flammability, low thermal conductivity and thermal instability, among others. In order to overcome these problems, encapsulation of PCMs is being successfully developed, providing decreased subcooling, large heat transfer area, and controlling the volume change of the storage materials when the phase transition occurs. A considerable amount of studies has been published in the field of encapsulation methods for organic PCMs. Nevertheless, the information available on inorganic PCMs is scattered. Furthermore, the influence of the encapsulation techniques on thermophysical properties of PCMs is not reported in these reviews most of the time. Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the encapsulation and characterization techniques for inorganic PCMs and to provide the analysis about the influence of synthesis parameters on thermophysical properties of encapsulated PCMs. Two principal types of encapsulated inorganic PCMs were found: core-shell PCMs (core-shell EPCMs) and shape stabilized PCMs (SS-PCMs). Classification of encapsulation methods of core-shell EPCMs and SS-PCMs are reported in this work. Among all the microencapsulation methods, inverse Pickering emulsion, electroplating, solvent evaporation–precipitation method and mechanical packaging are the most common methods described in the literature for the production of core-shell EPCM. On the other hand, for SS-PCMs, mainly sol-gel process, infiltration and impregnation encapsulation methods were found. Scientific works report a reduction in the heat of phase change for core-shell EPCMs. This is mostly because of the low content of salt in the final material. Moreover, an improvement of thermal conductivity was procured for SS-PCMs. Finally, PCM percentage, particle size, stirring rate, type of crosslinking agent and solvent properties were established as principal factors influencing the final properties of the encapsulated materials. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first profound review of encapsulation techniques for inorganic PCM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Core-shell PCM; Inorganic PCM, encapsulating methods; Shape stabilized PCM; Thermophysical properties","Characterization; Emulsification; Heat transfer; Inverse problems; Particle size; Passive solar buildings; Precipitation (chemical); Shells (structures); Sol-gel process; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamic stability; Characterization techniques; Core shell; Encapsulated materials; Encapsulation methods; Inorganic PCM, encapsulating methods; Low thermal conductivity; Shape-stabilized PCM; Thermal instabilities; Phase change materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012123728

However, electricity generated from PV plants can rarely provide immediate response to load demand, as these sources do not deliver a regular supply immediately compatible with consumers’ needs. Recently, an important attention has been devoted to the use of energy storage in grid-connected PV plants, with the objective of adding flexibility in load management and overcoming some important power quality problems of real distribution grids. This makes PV plants more useful and attractive. Several battery management techniques have been underlying as a way to create more price-responsive demand and as a way to integrate PV plants more effectively into power grid. However, the development of energy policies constraint the wider deployment of PV systems. In this paper, various sizing, modelling, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods have been reviewed for the efficient operation of grid-connected PV systems. Dispatch strategies for stored energy that maximize the financial value of battery-PV systems along with several optimization techniques are discussed. Power quality and control technology issues of grid-connected PV systems are also covered.

In parallel to the developing world economy, the increase in the use of energy resources is increasingly consuming existing fossil sources and also increasing the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. As a result of resulting material and environmental concerns, renewable energy resources have begun to be used as alternative energy resources. These resources have advantages such as sustainability and environmental friendliness, in addition to having disadvantages such as higher investment costs and also system reliability is insufficient to provide for continuous demand for energy. To resolve these disadvantages, hybrid systems have been developed involving the use of more than one type of renewable energy resource and/or use with traditional energy resources and/or integration with storage systems. The use of these systems requires finding the solution to optimization problems including one or more objectives such as sizing the system to minimize energy costs, system management to balance the uncertainty of energy produced or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This article was prepared with the aim of investigating optimization techniques developed from past to present to solve this problem and especially to determine the efficacy of multi-objective optimization approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto optimum; SA-HRES; Stand-alone","Developing countries; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Sustainable development; Alternative energy resources; Environmental concerns; Environmental friendliness; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimization techniques; Pareto optima; SA-HRES; Stand -alone; Renewable energy resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012000356

Since splitting is performed at the same FCBS, we define this architecture as the same base station based split architecture (SBSA). For multiple bands, we consider co-channel (CC) microwave and different frequency (DF) 60 GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for FCBSs and UEs with respect to the microwave band used by their over-laid macrocell base station. All femtocells are assumed to be deployed in a 3-dimensional multi-storage building. For CC microwave band, cross-tier CC interference of femtocells with macrocell is avoided using almost blank subframe based enhanced inter-cell interference coordination techniques. The co-existence of CC microwave and DF mmWave bands for SBSA on the same FCBS and UE is first studied to show their performance disparities in terms of system capacity and spectral efficiency in order to provide incentives for employing multiple bands at the same FCBS and UE and identify a suitable band for routing decoupled UL/DL or C-/U-plane traffic. We then present a number of disruptive architectural design alternatives of multi-band enabled SBSA for 5G mobile networks for UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, including a disruptive and complete splitting of UL/DL and C-/U-plane as well as a combined UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, by exploiting dual connectivity on CC microwave and DF mmWave bands. The outperformances of SBSA in terms of system level capacity, average spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and control-plane overhead traffic capacity in comparison with different base stations based split architecture (DBSA) are shown. Finally, a number of technical and business perspectives as well as key research issues of SBSA are discussed. © 2017 by De Gruyter.","5G; control-/user-plane; mmWave; multi-band; small cell; uplink/downlink","Base stations; Energy efficiency; Femtocell; Microwaves; Millimeter waves; Network architecture; Wireless networks; Average spectral efficiency; Inter-cell interference coordination; Millimeter waves (mmwave); mm-Wave; Multi band; Small cells; Spectral efficiencies; uplink/downlink; Mobile telecommunication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011878078

Aeration requires large amounts of energy in PHA production by mixed microbial cultures (MMCs), particularly during the feast phase due to substrate uptake. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of DO concentrations on microbial selection, substrate competition and PHA production performance by MMCs. This represents the first study investigating DO impact on PHA production while feeding the multiple volatile fatty acids (VFAs) typically encountered in real fermented feedstocks, as well as the substrate preferences at different DO levels. Efficient microbial cultures were enriched under both high (3.47 ± 1.12 mg/L) and low (0.86 ± 0.50 mg/L) DO conditions in the feast phase containing mostly the same populations but with different relative abundance. The most abundant microorganisms in the two MMCs were Plasticicumulans, Zoogloea, Paracoccus, and Flavobacterium. Butyrate and valerate were found to be the preferred substrates as compared to acetate and propionate regardless of DO concentrations. In the accumulation step, the PHA storage capacity and yield were less affected by the change of DO levels when applying the culture selected under low DO in the feast phase (PHA storage capacity >60% and yield > 0.9 Cmol PHA/Cmol VFA). A high DO level is required for maximal PHA accumulation rates with the four VFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate) present, due to the lower specific uptake rates of acetate and propionate under low DO conditions. However, butyrate and valerate specific uptake rates were less impacted by DO levels and hence low DO for PHA accumulation may be effective when feed is composed of these substrates only. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","DO impact; Microbial community analysis; Mixed microbial cultures (MMCs); Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs); Substrate competition","Biodegradable polymers; Dissolved oxygen; Microorganisms; Volatile fatty acids; Accumulation rates; Biodegradable polyesters; DO impact; Microbial community analysis; Mixed microbial culture; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Relative abundance; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Substrates; acetic acid; adenosine triphosphate; ammonia; butyric acid; carbon; dissolved oxygen; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polymer; propionic acid; RNA 16S; valeric acid; volatile fatty acid; oxygen; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; competition (ecology); concentration (composition); dissolved oxygen; ester; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; performance assessment; pollution effect; substrate; amplicon; Article; Azoarcus; bacterial cell; biomass; Brevundimonas; cell growth; decarboxylation; Flavobacterium; fluorescence in situ hybridization; Gammaproteobacteria; microbial community; microbiological examination; mixed microbial culture; nonhuman; organisms; oxygen consumption; Paracoccus; Plasticicumulans; polymer production; priority journal; sequencing batch reactor; substrate competition; substrate concentration; Zoogloea; bioreactor; biosynthesis; fermentation; microbiology; Flavobacterium; Zoogloea; Bioreactors; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Fermentation; Oxygen; Polyhydroxyalkanoates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011617673

Several scenarios were constructed for the future energy system based on various combinations of domestic production of wind and solar photovoltaic power, expanded domestic energy storage solutions, electrified transport, and strategic energy carrier trade. Hourly analysis of scenarios using the EnergyPLAN tool shows that annualised costs of operating a future sustainable energy system for the year 2030 range between 225 and 247 M€/a compared to 229 M€/a for the business as usual case. However, this result is highly dependent on how vehicle and battery costs are accounted. A scenario featuring a highly electrified transport sector, including a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic forms of mobility, was among the most cost competitive solutions due to high levels of flexibility and electric storage harnessed in the energy system. In this scenario cost reductions were achieved as high capacities of electric vehicle battery storage resulted in less need for seasonal storage and synthetic fuel production in the form of Power-to-Gas technologies and offshore wind power capacity. Results also indicate that 100% renewable energy-based domestic energy production can be achieved in Åland, with or without reliance on imported energy carriers, such as sustainable biofuels or electricity. A demonstration of a highly electrified transport sector may also offer Åland society several benefits outside of the boundaries of the energy system.

While gas flaring was the default solution, increasingly stringent carbon constraints have rendered this solution unattractive. One potential solution entails injecting the otherwise stranded AG into underground geologic systems for temporary storage, but re-producing same when a viable gas market becomes available. Seeking a robust temporary AG solution for a new oil development in the shallow offshore area of the Niger Delta, this paper presents an overview of common AG solutions, examining their relative strengths and weaknesses relative to this case study. Employing analytic and numerical-simulation studies, temporary AG storage in a non-associated gas (NAG) reservoir as well as the later development of both the native NAG and alien (injected) AG resources have been investigated. The main factors that control both the injection and production phases are highlighted. For a given set of abandonment conditions, effects of the gas volume injected prior to the production phase on the ultimate recovery factors of the native and alien gas resources are presented. Additionally, matrix, pseudo-fractured, and fractured injection modes are explored. Based on selected technical and economic indicators, underground storage in a virgin gas reservoir is found to be the most attractive solution to address stranded AG in this example field, and possibly others. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Associated gas; Flaring; Fractures; Gas storage; Niger Delta; Stranded gas","Associated gas; Commerce; Energy resources; Fracture; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil wells; Oil field development; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Attractive solutions; Economic indicators; Flaring; Gas storage; Niger Delta; Numerical simulation studies; Stranded gas; Underground storage; Underground gas storage; gas production; gas trade; gas well; hydrocarbon reserve; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; resource management; underground storage; Niger Delta; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009288405

This means hydroelectric, wind and solar energy capacities would increase to 36,000 MW, 20,000 MW and 3000 MW, respectively. Increased hydroelectric capacity would indeed benefit stability and flexibility of the existing energy infrastructure. However, increased wind and solar capacity could bring intermittency problems due to nature of these energy sources. Recently, pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) has become a hot topic in Turkey. And, its potential applications via synergistic utilisation with wind and solar energy to solve the aforementioned intermittency problems is being discussed. Yet, detailed information in the literature about PHES in Turkey is scarce. Therefore, this paper was intended to provide this crucial information. Detailed analysis showed even if all obstacles are overcome and all potential PHES capacity is used PHES could only provide a storage capacity worth equivalent to 0.6–0.8% of Turkey's annual electricity demand in 2023. It is estimated that the overnight capital cost required to develop this PHES potential is between 3.6 and 6.5 billion US$. Even so, there would be serious economic risks of PHES plants. Because, PHES systems are currently net consumers of energy. Current study also showed that instead of focusing on PHES, flexibility of Turkish electricity market could be sustained by diversifying energy sources and increasing nuclear energy capacity. It is estimated that an additional 490 MW of nuclear capacity could provide the same potential PHES capacity. By this way, intermittency problems associated with increased share of solar and wind energy can be easily tackled without imperilling the Vision 2023 energy targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hydroelectricity; Pumped hydroelectric energy storage; Solar; Vision 2023; Wind","Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Hydroelectric power; Reinforcement; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind; Wind power; Electricity demands; Existing energies; Global development; Hydroelectric energy; Renewable energy source; Solar; Solar and wind energies; Turkish government; Electric energy storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009227850

Geometrical model was based on a commercial WGET-SWH with nominal capacity of 40 L and 8 evacuated tubes. Simulations were carried out for four different transient energy inputs and 10°, 20°, 27° and 45° collector tilt angles. If tilt angle and total energy input are fixed, the energy input function with larger rates produced larger velocities and temperatures. Nevertheless this temperature increment is negligible for any practical purpose and the increment of kinetic energy is not large enough to affect stratification. Thus cumulated energy rather than energy input rate is significant for systems performance. Several second law indexes are proposed to assess stratification in the storage tank. The internal stratification number was used to compare the performance of WGET-SWH and active energy storage systems, showing that the former can achieve higher levels of stratification at low tilts, even comparable to those obtained in active systems with stratification promoters. The novelty of this work is to assess the influence of the transient energy input on the thermodynamic performance and stratification of a passive solar water heater. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage; Passive solar water heater; Second law analysis; Stratification; Transient energy input; Water-in-glass evacuated tube","Energy storage; Glass; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Solar water heaters; Thermal stratification; Thermodynamics; Evacuated tubes; Geometrical modeling; Passive solar; Second law analysis; Systems performance; Temperature increment; Thermodynamic performance; Transient energy; Water heaters; energy balance; energy budget; equipment; kinetic energy; performance assessment; solar power; storage structure; temperature; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009138662

The selection of a solar reactor that optimizes a particular process is always a difficult challenge. This work studies two types of reactor configuration by means of a comparative experimental analysis. It was employed a solar device, which is able to operate as fixed reactor with packed bed samples and as rotary kiln. The reduction of CuO into Cu2O was tested under both operation modes, due to its proved potential and interest as thermochemical storage material. It was found that heat transfer was hindered in static experiments limiting the fraction of reactive sample. Thermal gradients of about 200 °C were found in the packed bed through thermocouple and IR camera measurement. Heating rates and total fed energy must be restricted at the risk of front of the sample to melt, resulting in several operation drawbacks. In contrast, mixing conditions in rotary kilns allowed for higher heating rates and led to homogenous sample temperature. Maximum reaction yields in stationary mode did not overpass 14% while it was achieved more than 80% in rotary mode at temperatures about 860 °C. Thermal efficiencies were very limited in both operation modes due to the high thermal inertia of the solar reactor. Because rotary mode admitted much more energy, its thermal efficiency was even lower than static. A solution to increase rotary kilns thermal efficiency is working in continuous mode. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Solar energy; Solar furnace; Solar reactors; Thermochemical processes","Brickmaking; Copper oxides; Heating rate; Oxide minerals; Packed beds; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Solar furnaces; Thermocouples; Comparative performance; Experimental analysis; Experimental aspects; Reactor configuration; Solar reactors; Static experiments; Thermo chemical process; Thermochemical storage; Rotary kilns; comparative study; copper compound; heat transfer; heating; inertia; mixing; operations technology; reaction rate; reduction; solar radiation; thermochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009073033

The efficiency and validity of this model are tested by carrying out a case study on a standard IEEE 41-bus radial distribution system. The numerical results show that the simultaneous integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) and reactive power sources largely enables a substantially increased penetration of variable generation (wind and solar) in the system, and consequently, reduces overall system costs and network losses. For the system, a combined wind and solar PV power of up to nearly three times the base-case peak load is installed over a three-year planning horizon. In addition, the proposed planning approach also considerably defers network expansion and/or reinforcement needs. Generally, it is clearly demonstrated in an innovative way that the joint planning of distributed generation, reactive power sources, and ESSs, brings significant improvements to the system such as reduction of losses, electricity cost, and emissions as a result of increased renewable energy sources (RESs) penetration. Besides, the proposed modeling framework considerably improves the voltage profile in the system, which is crucial for a normal operation of the system as a whole. Finally, the novel planning model proposed can be considered as a major leap forward toward developing controllable grids, which support large-scale integration of RESs. © 2016 IEEE.","Distributed generation; distribution network systems; energy storage systems; integrated planning; renewable energy sources; stochastic programming","Cost reduction; Data storage equipment; Distributed computer systems; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Natural resources; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Distribution network system; Distribution system planning problems; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Integrated planning; Radial distribution systems; Renewable energy source; Stochastic mathematical models; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008219696

It is revealed that rectangular and cylindrical containers are widely used in the heat storage devices of the solar cookers. The geometry of the storage units, however, depended on the mode of heat transport into the storage medium and out to the cooking vessel from which, three categories of solar cookers (2-stage, 3-stage, and 4-stage solar cookers) are identified. Furthermore, oils and organic phase change materials dominated in the sensible and latent heat storage units respectively. Additionally, the inclusion of high thermal conductive material into the storage medium was the principal technique used in enhancing effective thermal conductivity. Besides, it is shown that there is no significant difference between the cooking power of cookers equipped with sensible and latent heat storage units. However, the design parameters of the cookers as well as thermal diffusivity of the storage medium greatly influenced the cooking power. The 3-stage cookers outperformed their 2-stage counterparts whereas cookers with cooking vessels integrated to the thermal storage unit outperformed the ones with non-integrated cooking vessels. On the other hand, lower thermal diffusivity of the storage medium increased cooking power in cookers with sensible heat storage but decreased the cooking power in cookers with latent heat storage. Finally, it is shown that the quest for the development of high temperature thermal storage units, and the optimization of the geometry as well as heat transfer characteristics of thermal energy storage units remain the potential areas of research in heat storage for cooking. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cooking power; Phase change materials; Solar cookers; Thermal energy storage","Conductive materials; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Oils and fats; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Virtual storage; Cooking power; Cylindrical containers; Effective thermal conductivity; Heat transfer characteristics; Latent heat storage units; Sensible heat storages; Solar cookers; Thermal storage units; Storage (materials)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008214588

Part I is devoted to the theoretical aspects and mathematical formulations in a comprehensive manner. The proposed model, formulated from the system operator's viewpoint, determines the optimal sizing, timing, and placement of distributed energy technologies (particularly, renewables) in coordination with energy storage systems and reactive power sources. The ultimate goal of this optimization work is to maximize the size of renewable power absorbed by the system, while maintaining the required/standard levels of power quality and system stability at a minimum possible cost. From the methodological perspective, the entire problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming optimization, allowing one to obtain an exact solution within a finite simulation time. Moreover, it employs a linearized ac network model which captures the inherent characteristics of electric networks and balances well accuracy with computational burden. The IEEE 41-bus radial DNS is used to test validity and efficiency of the proposed model, and carry out the required analysis from the standpoint of the objectives set.

One of the challenges for latent heat storage systems is the proper selection of the phase change materials (PCMs) for the targeted applications. As compared to organic PCMs, inorganic PCMs have some drawbacks, such as corrosion potential and phase separation; however, there are available techniques to overcome or minimize these drawbacks. On the other hand, inorganic PCMs are found to have higher thermal conductivity and storage capacity over organic PCMs. As a result inorganic PCMs have a great potential in thermal energy storage field, especially in medium to high temperature applications where organic PCMs are not a viable option. In this study, a detailed review of research outcomes and recent technological advancements in the field of inorganic phase change materials is presented while focusing on providing solutions to the associated disadvantages of this class of PCMs. Long term stability, thermal cycling performance, and heat transfer enhancements are also discussed in the context of this review. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Heat transfer enhancement; Phase change materials (PCMs); Solar energy; Thermal energy storage","Heat storage; Heat transfer coefficients; High temperature applications; Latent heat; Phase separation; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Corrosion potentials; Heat Transfer enhancement; Latent heat energy storage; Latent heat storage system; Long term stability; Storage capacity; Technological advancement; Thermal energy storage systems; Phase change materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007579687

Energy consumption rates have become excessive and engendered an increasing reliance on fossil-fuel reserves. Hence, the conception of energy-efficient buildings as well as applying solar cooling techniques has become a promising solution. In this context, the current work dealt with the appraisal of a solar system that drives the cooling process in an office building located in the Center of Researches and Energy Technologies in Tunisia. The solar system consisting of linear parabolic trough solar collectors' field coupled to a 16 kW double effect Lithium Bromide absorption chiller, supplies chilled water to a set of fan coils installed in the 126 m2laboratory building. A dynamic model that couples the solar cooling system with the building was developed using the TRNSYS tool and several simulations were performed to assess the case study and improve its performance. The model results were compared to the data collected during the experimental campaign conducted in summer 2015 and showed that the collectors efficiency was at the range of 26–35%, the COP ranged between 0.65 and 1.29, the daily maximum solar COP was approximately at 35%. However, the solar system was unable to cover 32.3% of the cooling requirements, the absorption chiller was switched on only during 53.8% of its total operating time. An improved system configuration was then studied; the integration of an auxiliary heater prior to the chiller as well as the increase of the aperture area guaranteed high driving temperatures and more suitable conditions to the absorption chiller. As a result, the chiller operating time increased to 75.8%, the cooling power increased by 75.6%, the solar COP reaches 57% and the solar fraction averaged 87%. The summer season performances predict that the improved system configuration achieves primary energy savings that reach 82.3% compared to a classic air conditioning system producing the same cooling power, the yearly avoided CO2emissions are estimated to 2947 kg. © 2016","Experimental analysis; Parabolic trough collectors; Performance testing; Primary energy consumption; Solar absorption cooling; TRNSYS simulation","Air conditioning; Collector efficiency; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Dynamic models; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Lithium bromide; Meteorology; Office buildings; Proven reserves; Refrigerators; Solar system; Thermoelectric equipment; Water absorption; Experimental analysis; Parabolic trough collectors; Performance testing; Primary energy consumption; Trnsys simulations; Absorption cooling; absorption; air conditioning; carbon emission; chemical compound; cooling; economic development; energy use; equipment; experimental design; experimental study; fossil fuel; performance assessment; solar system; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007560114

The goal of this study is to develop a unique artificial neural network (ANN) model that gives the best approach to predict the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of two different PTSTPPs integrated with thermal energy storage and fuel backup system; the first one is using thermic oil as primary heat transfer fluid in the solar field, while the other one is based on molten salt. By this way, the optimum designs of the two plants were determined in the LCOE analysis by using the obtained weights and biases of the best ANN topology. The techno-economic potentials of using molten salt in comparison to thermic oil of the two optimized plants were investigated considering both hourly and annual performances. The results show that it is possible to get minimum values of LCOE of 8.3 and 7.0 cent$/kWh for oil and salt configurations, respectively. Moreover, because of the difference in dispatch of thermal energy system and solar field aperture area of the plants, the annual power generation and capacity factor of salt plant are much higher than those of oil plant with a difference of around 26%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Levelized cost of electricity; Molten salt; Parabolic trough solar thermal power plant; Thermic oil","Electric energy storage; Fuel storage; Fused salts; Heat storage; Neural networks; Solar concentrators; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric power plants; Artificial neural network models; Capacity factors; Levelized cost of electricities; Molten salt; Parabolic-trough solar thermal power plants; Techno-economics; Thermal energy systems; Thermic oil; Solar heating; artificial neural network; cost analysis; electricity; energy budget; heat transfer; performance assessment; power generation; power plant; salt; solar power; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007452353

For this reason, new strategies are required to improve sustainability, reduce cost and enable wave energy harnessing even in low energy seas. Six new strategies that can make commercialization of wave energy more appealing are studied. These comprise the integration of wave energy converters (WECs) in coastal defence; tourism; desalination technology; offshore aquaculture; energy security; and power plants. WECs can axe erosion by half, or even more, in sandy beaches by creating wave shadows in their lee. Therefore, an innovative way to offset WEC high initial capital expenditure is their incorporation in coastal defence, with the added benefit of electricity production. Also, WECs can directly provide pressurized seawater for reverse osmosis desalination plants, thus achieving significant energy, cost and environmental footprint reductions. The touristic trade could also benefit from educational and interpretive displays of the wave energy technology, whilst ecotourism opportunities may arise that could address tourism seasonality. Combined offshore aquaculture facilities with WECs would benefit for reduced installation, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as addressing fossil fuel dependence in aquaculture. Moreover, WECs could be used for mitigating the intermittency of established renewables (solar and wind) and advance their penetration; while a combined WEC- pump hydropower storage scheme could secure the energy supply in remote coastal areas and islands. Finally, WECs could directly supply cooling water intake structures, such as power plants, with the huge amounts of seawater they require for cooling purposes. WEC are also able to provide high purity sterile water for core cooling in nuclear reactors and also support its circulation. For example, WECs can be introduced in coastal nuclear power plants, as to minimize the loss of coolant accident and prevent disasters similar to Fukushima's 2011. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal engineering; Desalination; Marine power; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Wave energy","Aquaculture; Coastal engineering; Cooling; Cooling water; Cost reduction; Desalination; Disaster prevention; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Loss of coolant accidents; Marine engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Seawater; Sustainable development; Wave power; Cooling water intake structures; Desalination technologies; Environmental footprints; Marine power; Renewable energies; Reverse osmosis desalination; Technological development; Wave energy; Wave energy conversion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007439051

In this paper, a detailed thermo-economic optimization is conducted for a hybrid air bottoming cycle power plant with water injection in the bottoming cycle air. Analyses are accomplished by utilizing three thermo-economic assessment approaches comprising levelized cost of electricity, payback period and life cycle savings. The acquired results indicate the advantages of water injection to improve the bottoming cycle heat recovery capability and plant's levelized cost of electricity.

This paper focuses on modeling, analysis and comparison of three hybrid configurations for concentrated solar power and conventional steam power plants. The configurations include feedwater preheating, cold reheat line and high pressure turbine concepts, in which linear Fresnel collector solar field with direct steam generation is applied to generate steam parallel with the steam boiler. The modeling is conducted using dynamic simulation software Apros®, which enables investigation of the system operation under varying process conditions. In particular, the focus is on the comparison of thermal load balance and interdependencies of the subsystems. In addition, the focus is on increasing the solar contribution, as the solar share is low in current commercial concepts. As a main conclusion, the more solar steam is fed to the system, the more different turbine sections and heat surfaces of the steam boiler are imbalanced, which leads to challenging system design. In addition, the maximum fuel and emission savings are not only determined by the achievable solar share, but also by the hybrid process design. The design of the hybrid system has to be optimized and modified according to the configuration in order to achieve higher peak solar share and fuel and emission savings than 20% achieved in this study. © 2016","Apros; Circulating fluidized bed boiler; Concentrated solar power; Direct steam generation; Hybridization","Computer software; Engines; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Pressure vessels; Solar energy; Steam; Steam power plants; Turbines; Apros; Circulating fluidized bed boiler; Concentrated solar power; Direct steam generation; Hybridization; Boilers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007329859

The procedure utilizes inverse 3D finite element method (FEM) modelling of distributed temperature measurements inside the BTES for inferring the thermal properties of the subsurface. We find that individual geological layers can be distinguished in terms of their heat capacities and thermal conductivities using inverse modelling. The depth integrated estimate of thermal conductivity differs significantly from that obtained from a single thermal response test (TRT) at the site. As such, we find significant scaling effects in terms of the subsurface thermal conductivity distribution which are expected to be further amplified in an expansion of the pilot BTES to full scale.

Evaporation is an important challenge for efficient operation of solar ponds, especially in arid locations without water sources to replenish the evaporative losses. In this work, transparent partial covers were used to investigate how evaporation suppression affects both the water and energy balance of a laboratory-scale solar pond. In our experiments, the evaporation reduction efficiency was related to the cube root of the relative covered area. This evaporation reduction efficiency is smaller than that of natural water bodies because of the influence of the warm lower convective zone. Also, as the covered fraction of the surface area increased, the thickness of the non-convective zone decreased and the heat losses through this zone increased. As a result, the temperature in the lower convective zone did not increase as the covered fraction increased. Nonetheless, the heat content within the solar pond slightly increased, demonstrating that the reduction of evaporation improves the heat storage capacity of the pond. Moreover, an economic analysis showed that although the evaporation reduction efficiency in solar ponds is smaller than that of natural water bodies or reservoirs, the benefits related to the additional energy collected in the solar pond when reducing evaporation overcome the smaller water saving benefits. Therefore, suppressing evaporation in solar ponds not only is valuable in locations with no water to replenish the evaporative losses but also improves its economic benefits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Evaporation suppression; Solar energy; Solar ponds; Transparent pond covers","Economic analysis; Evaporation; Heat convection; Heat storage; Lakes; Low temperature effects; Ponds; Reservoirs (water); Solar energy; Temperature; Water conservation; Experimental and numerical studies; Heat storage capacity; Low-temperature applications; Lower convective zones; Natural water bodies; Renewable energy source; Salt gradient solar pond; Transparent pond covers; Solar ponds; economic analysis; energy balance; energy resource; equipment; evaporation; experimental study; low temperature; operations technology; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; temperature effect; water budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007189920

Energy storage technologies have the ability to revolutionize the way in which the electrical grid is operated. The incorporation of energy storage systems in the grid help reduce this instability by shifting power produced during low energy consumption to peak demand hours and hence balancing energy generation with demand. However, the deployment of some energy storage systems will remain limited until their economic profitability is proven. In this paper, a cost-benefit analysis is performed to determine the economic viability of energy storage used in residential and large scale applications. Revenues from energy arbitrage were identified using the proposed models to get a better view on the profitability of the storage system. Moreover, the feasibility of energy storage projects relies on the readiness of investors to invest in the project.

Iterative techniques, implicit equations, and complex mathematical functions were avoided. Yearly climate and daily thermal load data were applied at hourly time steps. About 10 additional simulation days are necessary to obtain a yearly periodic simulation. A time step dependency analysis indicates that a one-hour period results in less than 2 % error from the exact solution. The solar fraction increases very rapidly with increasing collector area for low areas, tending to a constant value for high areas. For low collector areas, collector flow rate has virtually no effect on the solar fraction, but above a certain area, the solar fraction starts to decrease with increasing area; the area at which the solar fraction starts to decrease increases with increasing flow rate. Moreover, the solar fraction increases with increasing storage volume for low volumes, becoming virtually constant for high volumes. For an insulation thickness of 20 cm, the storage losses reduce the solar fraction by less than 3 %.

This affects grid stability and power quality. If the share of renewable power generation is to be increased further, additional flexibilities must be introduced.

In this paper, the suitability of decentralized and on-site optimized storage system consisting of repurposed electric vehicle batteries for grid balancing is investigated. Battery operation is controlled via an optimization procedure, which relies on a one-way communicated pseudo-cost function (PCF). Day-ahead electricity stock market prices are used as the PCF.

All approaches lead to very similar results, however ILP leads to the shortest runtimes. ILP is then used to investigate the grid balancing potential using last decade's hourly day-ahead prices. Higher market data resolutions featuring quarter-hours introduced in 2014 lead to higher earnings. For hourly day-ahead prices the optimal capacity-to-power ratio of the battery is approximately 6 h while for quarter-hourly prices it is about 3 h. © 2016","Battery storage; Distributed storage; Grid balancing; Optimization; Repurposed; Vehicle batteries","Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Earnings; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Integer programming; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Battery storage; Distributed storage; Grid balancing; Repurposed; Vehicle battery; Power markets; decentralization; electric vehicle; electricity generation; linear programing; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; stock market; storage structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007039129

While mostly used in semiconductor technology for the deposition of ceramic oxides and nitrides on wafers, ALD lends itself to the deposition of a wealth of materials on virtually every substrate. In particular, ALD and its organic counterpart molecular layer deposition (MLD), have opened up attractive avenues for the synthesis of novel nanostructured materials. However, as most ALD processes were developed and optimized for semiconductor technology, these might not be optimal for applications in fields such as catalysis, energy storage, and health. For this reason, novel applications for ALD often require new surface chemistries, process conditions, and reactor types. As a result, recent developments in ALD technology have marked a considerable departure from the standard set by well-established ALD processes. The aim of this review is twofold: firstly, to capture the recent departure of ALD from its original development; and secondly, to pinpoint the unexplored paths through which ALD can advance further in terms of synthesis of novel materials. To that end, we provide a review of the recent developments of ALD and MLD of materials that are gaining increasing attention on various substrates, with particular emphasis on high-surface-area substrates. Furthermore, we present a critical review of the effects of the process conditions, namely, temperature, pressure, and time on ALD growth. Finally, we also give a brief overview of the recent advances in ALD reactors and energy-enhanced ALD processes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry",,"carbon nanotube; cobalt; copper; copper oxide; ferric oxide; fluoride; gold; graphene; metal organic framework; metal oxide; molecular layer; nanowire; nickel; nickel oxide; palladium; platinum; ruthenium; silver; sulfide; titanium; transition element; tungsten; unclassified drug; Article; atomic layer deposition; chemical procedures; molecular layer deposition; pressure; processing; reactor; surface area; synthesis; temperature; time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006850966

Altogether, three discharge strategies are taken into consideration; base case, adaptive algorithm and an energy-market-oriented remote-controlled strategy. All of the presented strategies are strictly limited to available residential load reduction based on the current BESS regulations. Furthermore, the simulations are run on real-world measurement data. The adaptive “grid-friendly” discharge algorithm utilizes global optima and a moving-average calculation to maximize the self-energy consumption in regards to the peak grid load periods. On the other hand a remote-controlled discharge scenario is taken into consideration to maximize self-consumption and to decrease the grid load when the intraday energy prices are the highest, if there is opportunity to do so. The system size optimization equations are based on a hidden layer feedforward neural network system. The main goal of the network is to predict the corresponding equations for the optimization software. Based on the neural network results, an “easy-to-use” BESS-size economic optimization web-based application has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the different discharge methodologies and to make easier different manufactures’ BESS system comparisons. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage system; Discharge strategies; Economical sizing; Renewable energy","Adaptive algorithms; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Feedforward neural networks; Housing; Network layers; Remote control; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Economic optimization; Economical sizing; Optimization software; Renewable energies; Residential PV systems; Web-based applications; Battery storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006456716

Greenhouse gas abatement, the utilisation of renewable energy sources, and energy efficiency represent the main pillars of sustainable development. Agriculture contributes a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions and concurrently represents a carbon dioxide (CO2) sink; it thus has twofold opposing impacts on climate change. The carbon footprint of agricultural products is one of main measures for monitoring the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural productivity processes. A model calculation of the carbon footprint in the agricultural sector was developed in order to calculate the carbon footprint of grains, fruit, and other agriculture products based on a calculation of total greenhouse gas emissions resulting from production, from the beginning of the production process to storage and delivery to the final consumer or the food industry. The first obstacles in such a calculation are the availability of input data on energy consumption by unit of land for all forms of agricultural land preparation and other work required for sowing, fertilisation, plant protection, harvesting, internal transportation, and other work. The mineral diesel fuel consumption of tractors with various connected machines and self-propelled work machines (e.g. harvesters or forage harvesters for maize) were measured. In addition, the energy consumption required for harvesting and the internal transport of crops on farms itself was included.

Due to the elevated temperature to keep the batteries liquid, thermal convection appears, also, during the charging/discharging processes a large electrical current density interacts with its own magnetic field generating a Lorentz force that induces motion in the stratified system. In this article, the natural convection in a liquid metal electrode (LME) candidate for LMBs is studied from a numerical point of view. Additionally, it is of interest to investigate the effect of the electrical current density on the natural convection through the Lorentz force, whose effect is called MHD natural convection. The mathematical modelling for this problem involves the solution of mass, momentum, energy and electromagnetic equations for an incompressible, viscous and electrically conducting fluid. A 3D numerical solution is implemented using the open source CFD library OpenFOAM. Numerical results indicate that the convective flow organizes due to the current.

Unfortunately, eggs are perishable and most rural communities in South Africa have very limited access to effective food storage and preservation facilities. Utilization of eggs by rural households could increase if they were available in the form of egg powder, which is convenient and shelf-stable. However, rural communities in South Africa are not familiar with egg powder and therefore it is not known whether it would be acceptable to them. The aim of the current study was to explore the utilization of eggs by rural households of Mkhambathini, South Africa, and assess the potential for using egg powder in popular egg dishes. A total of 110 household representatives completed a survey questionnaire, 50 participated in focus group discussions and 51 in sensory evaluation of egg dishes (sandwich and relish) prepared with commercial egg powder. The households perceived eggs as an important, nutritious food, but cultural beliefs, ineffective storage facilities, and limited market access restricted their utilization. Results of sensory evaluation showed that the acceptability of the egg powder dishes was similar to that of their fresh egg counterparts. Overall, the study demonstrates that there is a great potential for rural households to replace fresh egg dishes with egg powder dishes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Egg powder; food insecurity; protein-energy malnutrition; rural households",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990957242

In this study, the current status and theory behind municipal sewage sludge disposal in Lithuania is presented. Since 2004, the country has rapidly developed its wastewater treatment system by applying contemporary technologies used in other European countries. According to statistical data, the amount of accumulated sewage sludge in the country will reach 82,000 t/year dry weight in 2016. Of that, approximately 60% is stored in storage plants and landfills, 14% is used in agriculture, and 26% is composted. Storing such a large percentage of waste is not viable from an environmental or an economic perspective. Thermal utilization of sewage sludge is considered a promising alternative to storage, and there is strong demand for more reliable data on accruing quantities of sewage sludge and its properties, including heavy metals concentrations, at separate wastewater treatment plants. Sludge samples were collected from seven wastewater treatment plants in the cities of Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys, Alytus and Silute which had populations of 528, 307, 159, 107, 97, 57 and 17 thousand inhabitants, respectively, in 2013. These cities utilized different waste water treatment technologies, and the primary industrial activities in the places selected varied. Heavy metal concentrations and ash melting temperatures were determined based on an analysis of the sludge content, and conclusions for agricultural application and energy production were made. For energy production, co-incineration with municipal waste or wood and gasification are the most reliable ways to utilize sewage sludge. Implementation of such technologies is beginning and further research into these methods is occurring at both the local and international levels. © 2016","Co-incineration; Gasification; Heavy metals; Sewage sludge disposal; Wastewater treatment quality","Agriculture; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Digital storage; Gasification; Heavy metals; Incineration; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial water treatment; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge disposal; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Wastewater disposal; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Co-incineration; Heavy metal concentration; Industrial activities; Municipal sewage sludge; Sludge characteristics; Wastewater collection; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment system; Wastewater treatment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988473880

There are many processes for hydrogen production from both conventional and alternative energy resources such as natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind. In this work, a comparative overview of the major hydrogen production methods is carried out. The process descriptions along with the technical and economic aspects of 14 different production methods are discussed. An overall comparison is carried out, and the results regarding both the conventional and renewable methods are presented. The thermochemical pyrolysis and gasification are economically viable approaches providing the highest potential to become competitive on a large scale in the near future while conventional methods retain their dominant role in H2 production with costs in the range of 1.34–2.27 $/kg. Biological methods appear to be a promising pathway but further research studies are needed to improve their production rates, while the low conversion efficiencies in combination with the high investment costs are the key restrictions for water-splitting technologies to compete with conventional methods. However, further development of these technologies along with significant innovations concerning H2 storage, transportation and utilization, implies the decrease of the national dependence on fossil fuel imports and green hydrogen will dominate over the traditional energy resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Green hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Water splitting","Climate change; Coal deposits; Economics; Energy resources; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Natural gas deposits; Solar power generation; Alternative energy resources; Fossil-fuel depletions; Hydrogen production method; Hydrogen production process; Hydrogen technologies; Process descriptions; Pyrolysis and gasification; Water splitting; Hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988353044

Moreover, there is a gradual shift on distributed generation (DG) over the years to focus more on renewable generation due to global incentivization, climatic issues (such as greenhouse gas emission), and energy market deregulation. This article places attention on photovoltaic (PV) system as an emerging power generation paradigm enabled by the evolving smart grid. One of the critical constraints in this game-changing technology is the high propensity for a mismatch between its power output and load profile characteristics, which could result into severe voltage violations, high losses and a larger reverse power during low load conditions. Consequently, the concept of dispatchability with load-following function for various PV deployment scenarios is crucial for the 21st century grid modernization. The dispatchable PV unit output is controllable when deployed with storage systems making it suitable for ancillary services and demand-side management application. Also, dispatchability implies the ability to remotely start and stop the operation of PV unit when needed to maintain grid reliability. This article presents various deployment scenarios of dispatchable PV units and their impacts on the evolving smart grid. Additionally, this paper reviews the evolution of control, monitoring and communication systems in the active distribution network, utility-interactive inverter technologies, dispatchable grid-connected hybrid system deployments, and communication network configuration for dispatchable distributed energy resource (DER) units integration into the electric power system (EPS). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dispatchable; Microgrids; Plug-and-play; PV integration","Deregulation; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Active distribution networks; Dispatchable; Distributed energy resource; Electric power systems (EPS); Micro grid; Non-renewable energy sources; Plug and play; Utility interactive inverters; Electric power system control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988001562

Density functional theory calculations (DFT) were performed for super-cells of fcc Ni with interstitial H in octahedral sites at different concentrations. In order to physically explain the effect of magnetization diminishing as the hydrogen concentration increases, we propose a simple Stoner type of model to describe the influence of the H impurity on the magnetic properties of Ni.

A structural analysis of CoxNi1-xMnP2O7 samples was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of Co substitution on the structural, electrical, and electrochemical properties of CoxNi1-xMnP2O7 is reported. The electrochemical results show that the specific capacity increases from 59 to 205 mAh/g with increasing Co content. This study demonstrates the Co substitution effect on the mixed electrical conductivity. The temperature dependence of the dc electrical conductivity, for both pure and Co2+-doped samples, obeys the Arrhenius law. The frequency dependence of ac conductivity for the materials exhibited a Jonscher’s universal power law. The plots of pre-exponent (n) versus temperature suggested that the conduction mechanism can be described using correlated barrier hopping model. The improved electrical conductivity and electrochemical proprieties of CoxNi1-xMnP2O7 nanomaterials could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt ions. The best results have been obtained for the composition x(Co) = 0.75, where the electrical conductivity is maximum, and the Co0.75Ni0.25MnP2O7 demonstrates the highest specific capacity, implying their promising potential applications in the energy storage. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electrical properties; Electrochemical properties; Impedance spectroscopy; Inorganic compounds","Cobalt; Cobalt deposits; Electric conductivity; Electric properties; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical properties; Inorganic compounds; Temperature distribution; X ray diffraction; Correlated barrier hopping models; DC electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Frequency dependence; Hydrothermal methods; Impedance spectroscopy; Mixed electrical conductivity; Temperature dependence; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982243022

Recent studies have demonstrated that VDR and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes are expressed in adipocytes. Furthermore, it has been shown that vitamin D regulates adipogenic gene expression as well as adipocyte apoptosis. Vitamin D is active in adipocytes at all levels. It interacts with membrane receptors, adaptor molecules, and nuclear coregulator proteins. Several functions of unliganded nVDR were discovered by studying human samples from patients having hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets, transgenic mice overexpressing the VDR and VDR knockout mice. Through its genomic action, vitamin D participates in the regulation of energy metabolism by controlling the expression of uncoupling proteins. In vitro, vitamin D stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis by interacting with mVDR. mVDR is present in caveolae of the plasma membrane and is the same as the classic nVDR. In addition, vitamin D affects directly the expression of the appetite regulating hormone, leptin. Some researchers reported also that vitamin D regulates the expression of the insulin sensitizing hormone, adiponectin. Vitamin D reduced cytokine release and adipose tissue inflammation through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling. Scientific research investigating the role of adipose tissue resident immune cells in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammation is scarce. Obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency. However there is no scientific evidence to prove that vitamin D deficiency predispose to obesity. Vitamin D supplementation may prevent obesity but it does not lead to weight loss in obese subjects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adipogenesis; Adipokines; Adipose tissue; Obesity; VDR","adipocytokine; adiponectin; calcitriol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; leptin; vitamin D; calcitriol; calcitriol receptor; leptin; uncoupling protein; vitamin D; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; apoptosis; cytokine release; energy metabolism; genomics; inflammation; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adolescent; adult; aged; animal; cell membrane; cytology; female; gene expression regulation; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; mouse; nucleocytoplasmic transport; obesity; physiology; young adult; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Apoptosis; Calcitriol; Cell Membrane; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genomics; Humans; Inflammation; Leptin; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Uncoupling Proteins; Obesity; Receptors, Calcitriol; Vitamin D; Young Adult",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981717344

In New Zealand, hydropower generation in mountain basins is the primary source of electricity and renewable energy resource in the country. The goal of this study was to simulate and evaluate the potential effects of climate change on hydropower operations in three mountain headwater lakes (lakes Pukaki, Tekapo, and Ohau) in the Upper Waitaki Basin of the central South Island. The TopNet hydrological model was used to estimate catchment runoff and lake inflows based on the 1990s (baseline), 2040s, and 2090s periods. Average temperature and precipitation results from an ensemble of 12 Global Circulation Models based on the IPCC 4th Assessment Report A1B emissions scenario were used as input to TopNet. Linked hydropower lake water balance models were developed and used to simulate hydropower operations including discharge, hydroelectric power generation, and spill based on TopNet future inflow predictions, projected electricity demand, and lake storage and outflow characteristics. Our results indicate that annual lake inflows increase under future climate scenarios, but that there are seasonal effects with increasing flows in winter and early spring, and summer flows decreasing somewhat as a result of increasing temperatures and greater winter rain with less snow. Although overall hydropower generation can increase with the increasing flows and projected electricity demand, the seasonal changes result in demand being met in winter and spring with potential shortfalls in summer and autumn. Maximum annual generation can be achieved for some generating stations, but generation will decrease at other stations and more spill will likely be required through the 2090s because of the seasonal changes. Therefore flood and drought risk could also increase for downstream areas. Results also indicate that by the 2090s electricity demand could exceed generation capacity for these headwater lakes.

This article presents a LCA of fresh and frozen chestnut produced in Portugal, intended both for export and domestic consumption. A “cradle-to-plate” life-cycle model was implemented considering cultivation, two types of processing (fresh and frozen chestnut), domestic and international distribution, retail, home storage, and cooking. Different markets (consumer locations) and alternative transport modes were assessed. Variability in cultivation and two alternative household storage times for frozen chestnut (45 days or six months) were also analyzed. Cultivation contributed most to the life-cycle impacts of both fresh and frozen chestnut (from 34% to 98%), mainly due to diesel and fertilizer use. Frozen chestnut presented higher impacts than fresh due to higher energy requirements for frozen storage (factory, retail and household) and processing losses. Post-harvest stages, particularly home storage and cooking, contribute significantly to life-cycle impacts. Important differences between the locations of final consumption were found due to differences in the electricity mix of the various countries. Furthermore, increasing storage time in the home freezer from 45 days to six months can lead to considerably higher life-cycle impacts. The consumption of products out of season can present significantly higher impacts than fresh; however, chestnut (fresh or frozen) shipped by air showed higher impacts than off-season. To mitigate the environmental impacts of chestnut, it is important to improve fertilizer and fuel use, as well as to reduce energy use in storage and cooking. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Chestnut processing; Environmental impacts; Food miles; Nut orchards; Refrigeration","Agriculture; Cooking; Cultivation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Fruits; Fuel storage; Nuts (fasteners); Refrigeration; Consumer locations; Domestic consumption; Energy requirements; Food miles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impacts; Life cycle model; Transport modes; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965002174

In Mytilene, Lesvos, the port is located within the city limits, resulting in air pollution, congestion and noise, especially during the tourist season. The aim of this study is to estimate the quantities of particulate matter and CO2 emitted by ships in the port of Mytilene and to explore the potential of shore side electricity to reduce the emissions. The emissions were estimated using the bottom–up methodology, based on the activity of the ships in the port (berthing, maneuvering). Simulation of renewable energy sources was made using Homer Energy microgrid simulation software. The results showed that between the 10th and 20th of August 2012, there were 40 calls of passenger ships, tankers and bulk carriers in the port of Mytilene, emitting 441 kg of PM10 and 282 metric tonnes of CO2. About 63% of PM10 and 77% of CO2 were emitted at the berthing phase and the remaining during the maneuvering. These emissions could be reduced by providing electricity to the ships from a hybrid renewable energy system with wind turbines and photovoltaics, connected to the grid. Simulations showed that the total energy requirements of the ships in the port of Mytilene could be covered by four 1.5 MW wind turbines combined with a 5 MW photovoltaics. With this configuration, renewable energy will exceed the ships' electricity needs for most of the time in order not to increase the power station's load. The excess energy could be fed to the islands' grid, so a costly battery storage system is not necessary to handle the variations of alternative energy. In this way, a considerable reduction of the CO2 and PM10 emissions by the ships in the port occurs, providing a viable solution for a cleaner and healthier environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutant emissions; Cold ironing; Port; Solar energy; Wind energy","alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; electricity; emission control; particulate matter; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; wind turbine; Aegean Islands; Greece; Lesbos; Northern Aegean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958225931

A simplification of Miller's living systems theory, distinguishing only three functional units, (i) production systems, (ii) storage, and (iii) controller structures, is used to investigate the importance of these units on various evolutionary stages. In the internal evolution of biological systems, storage is crucial to control the availability of intermediate products of autocatalytic cycles. This is the base for continuous production and maintenance of controller structures (brains). In the external, technical evolution storage enables building external production systems and controller structures (like computers). In the dyadic coevolution of living systems, control of material flows and/or storage enable power positions in interaction patterns ranging from competition for scarce resources, via market relations, to egalitarian cooperation. Such power positions open access to different markets and exclusive evolutionary options. Economic theory widely ignores that. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
